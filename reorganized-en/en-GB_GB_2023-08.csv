And if you didn’t nab that £700,000 role at Netflix, there are plenty of new positions in the offing, many in surprising areasSupported byAbout this contentJames BallWed 16 Aug 2023 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Aug 2023 01.20 EDTShareThe conversation about AI and the workplace is understandably dominated by the downsides – after decades of automation eliminating manufacturing jobs, people in the service sector are worried about being replaced by “robots”.But every technological shift creates as well as destroys jobs. Artificial intelligence – at least in its current iteration, which uses large language datasets to create text, audio and video – is no different. What is, perhaps, surprising is the type of jobs it will create.What kind of jobs are being created right now?The most visible and obvious new roles are for those with the coding and development skills to help build AI models or adapt them for particular purposes. The UK government is actively pursuing AI startups and trying to offer support for them. Google owner Alphabet’s AI division, DeepMind, was founded in London and is still largely based here.These roles aren’t all AI specialists – there are startups dedicated to customising AIs, such as ChatGPT, to be suitable for particular roles in specialist businesses, such as acting as customer service agents for specific industries, or even online sales assistants. Roles specialising in building and creating AI models are attracting the biggest salary premiums, but there are highly skilled and highly paid roles across coding and development.Are new types of jobs being created already?There are drastically different companies dipping their toes into the artificial intelligence revolution, though at this stage on a smaller scale than the new development roles. One that has attracted particular attention is Netflix’s advert for a product manager for its “machine-learning platform”, not least because the listed “compensation” is $300,000 to $900,000 (£240,000 to £710,000).View image in fullscreenStriking Hollywood writers picket outside Paramount Studios in California, in July. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesAgainst the backdrop of writers and actors striking partly over the impact of AI on their own roles, the job advert has sparked a significant backlash. It does not specifically mention automation of writing or acting roles but does include phrasing such as “powering innovation” and offering “personalisation to members” with the “highest possible impact”.Not all of the new roles being created by AI offer a top-tier salary, however – the UK’s NewsQuest group advertised an “AI-powered reporter” role in April. The new recruit would “work with an AI system to help write your news articles”, ensuring “all content produced meets legal and ethical standards” while also being required to “meet and exceed page view targets”. The reward for all that was a salary of £22,000.This type of role is based on the idea that, at present, using AI models and getting good results is a skilled task. Using very specific prompts yields better results than vague queries, and users need to have an eye for when an AI model seems to be giving factual information but is in fact “hallucinating” – making up untrue “pseudo facts”.Should we all be looking to retrain for this type of role?We don’t know, but it’s absolutely not a given. These early roles created by AI might not be the strongest long-term prospect. “In a nutshell, I would say it [the best prospect] is not programming, because coding will change,” says Dr Caitlin Bentley, a lecturer in AI education at King’s College London – suggesting that people coding AI may in time see some of their skills superseded.And the new profession of “prompting”– giving AI very precise instructions to get better quality output – might also be shortlived, she suggests. “Prompting, I also think, is going to die soon because AI will get better. Instead, we need better interrogation and translation skills.”So some roles  created by AI are temporary?This is definitely true – AI models rely on being “trained” on real-world data. For language, this data exists naturally, but for other uses (such as identifying traffic lights) AI needs specific instruction.These roles will obviously not last for ever. Self-driving companies, for example, all employ “test drivers” for their driverless cars. But many roles serve a similar purpose, albeit far less visibly. A stark example came in reporting by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism last year showing that Amazon workers in UK warehouses had to sort items in a particular way so that AI could detect it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: VCG/GettyThese “ghost in the machine” roles tend to be grim ones, focused either on repetitive tasks that AIs are still not sufficiently reliable at, or else on moderation of social media, for the same reasons.Which roles will last?Alison Gow, a former senior executive at Reach (publisher of the Mirror, the Express and many local titles), who has looked into AI in media companies, thinks the best prospects for its long-term use are where the technology is used to enhance or transform existing roles, taking on monotonous tasks.“I’d expect to see AI editor roles being introduced, because someone is ultimately going to need to be responsible, and adding a lens of journalistic scrutiny to generated content,” she says.Gow sets out the optimistic version of events for the news industry: “I expect we’ll see more automation of utility content such as weather reports and match reports in sport, and I’d hope we’ll also see AI used for greater accessibility – so transcription or translation services, or text to audio.”She calls for “real-world workable benefits for a newsroom, not doing shiny stuff for the sake of it”.I’m not technically minded – are there any upsides in this for me?Legal and human resources within businesses might be rife for AI, it has been suggested. Gow is among those who take a different view, suggesting AI might require quite the opposite.There will be many difficult issues to tackle in the courts, in parliament, with unions and other – on matters from copyright law to employment law and beyond – and businesses will need bigger teams to tackle them, she says.View image in fullscreenA humanoid robot helps its human companion in a demonstration at a tech fair in Germany.

In the same way that some companies brought their call centres back to the UK as a mark of premium quality, having actual human customer service agents might similarly become a mark of quality. This could lead to a higher premium being placed on so-called “soft skills” and service skills.Whatever AI does to the workplace, it is not necessarily the people coding the technology who will be the winners.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The future of workEmploymentWork & careersWorkers' rightsComputingexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s clear that technology professionals will see their roles transformed with artificial intelligence, requiring skills refreshes and learning new approaches. Not so clear is the impact of AI on career prospects for business managers and professionals, with confusing messages about job replacement and usurping of decision-making authority.


The rise of AI, particularly generative AI, is likely to have a strong impact on managerial and professional jobs, an analysis by Rakesh Kochhar of Pew Research suggests. “Jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus. Workers with a bachelor’s degree or more (27%) are more than twice as likely as those with a high school diploma only (12%) to see the most exposure.”

Yet, the Pew study also suggests, professionals in more exposed industries do not feel their jobs are at risk – “they are more likely to say AI will help more than hurt them personally. For instance, 32% of workers in information and technology say AI will help more than hurt them personally, compared with 11% who say it will hurt more than it helps.”

PROMOTED
Vittorio Cretella, CIO of Procter & Gamble, doesn’t see AI as replacing human talent, but rather, amplifying those talents. “The continued rise of AI will change the type of work we do, and how we do it, but augmenting rather than replacing human capabilities,” he argues. “We will still need the skills of digitally-savvy, creative human employees who can work effectively with machines.”

AI “will have a profound impact on employees across the whole organization, not only on expert roles such as data science or machine learning engineering,” Cretella points out. “Nearly all employees, regardless of function, will need to get familiar with working with machines, exploring insights and leveraging recommendations which may often be different from what their previous experience would suggest.”

For corporate leaders, the priorities of the AI age must shift to greater investments in “talent and upskilling employees while in-sourcing strategic capabilities such as data science and machine learning engineering,” Cretella advocates. This calls for a balancing act among managers and executives, who “must facilitate the combination of human and machine strengths, creating the organizational focus and culture that encourages continuous learning and the application of AI to improve business outcomes.”

AI, implemented successfully, “will amplify human skills, not simply substitute, or replace them,” says Cretella. “Key human-centric skills include curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, compassion and collaboration.”
Where humans will make the greatest difference is in problem definition, he continues. This consists of “decomposing a problem through key questions and identifying patterns before attempting to define an algorithmic solution. We need leaders and teams to focus on that phase to develop inquisitive skills and dedicate enough time before skipping to solutions.”
P&G’s approach is to “always start from the job to be done, whether is about maximizing media reach, improving manufacturing quality or defining the shelf layout for the best consumer shopping experience,” Cretella illustrates. “What matters is the capability to define the hypothesis and problems, the curiosity to explore data and the power of AI to find the answers.”
It still takes curiosity, and a sense of what people need, to succeed in today’s hyper-competitive economy. “Technology alone does not change things – people do,” he emphasizes. “The future of management is with an AI-savvy generation of business leaders who are curious, have little or no cognitive bias, and understand which organization design, processes, and resources are needed to unleash the power of data and machine learning.”

The majority of teachers believe students are using Artificial Intelligence apps to do their work for them, according to a new study. A survey by education tech firm RM Technology found that two thirds of teachers believe they are regularly receiving work written by AI, with around one in ten teachers (9%) admitting they can't tell the difference between work completed by their pupil and AI programs.

The survey of 500 secondary school teachers revealed that 41% believe there needs to be better regulation of AI with 31% wanting the government to step in to police its use.Mel Parker, a former headteacher who now works as a consultant for RM Technology said: ""There definitely needs to be government regulation, especially from a safeguarding point of view.""And she believes better training is needed in the use of rapidly developing tech.





""They need to know how they can talk to students about good use of AI, what is appropriate use in the classroom, how can they learn from it? How can they get better understanding of concepts - actually what is cheating and what is good practice?""She said there is concern that pupils can use AI to cheat, especially as more than a third of teachers surveyed admit pupils know more about AI than they do.

 Schools 'bewildered' by AI



'I see it as a positive'The concerns of teachers were not shared by students - a mirror survey of pupils found that 68% believe they're getting better grades as a result of AI and 49% say excluding AI would have a negative impact on their learning.Miya Crofts, a 17-year-old sixth former at Greenwood Academy in Birmingham, is a regular user of AI.She said: ""In terms of education I use it a lot for online homework, revision tool, so if I need any additional support and I don't want to ask my teacher or it's something that she can't give me it is available whenever I need it on AI programs.""I see it as a positive because it's available whenever you need…however, I feel like some students might become too reliant upon it and it kind of takes away your own independence.""You can ask questions and you get instant feedback, instant answer… you're not really thinking for yourself.""

But fellow pupil Tito Thomson O'Reilly said he tends not to use AI for schoolwork. ""It removes a social interaction from the person.""It's just something where someone can ask a bot, a little robot a question, and all you're getting is an immediate answer, but there isn't a sense of empathy. There's not sense of teamwork, it's just a straightforward answer.""

Safeguarding concernsThere are also concerns about online safety, with an increasing number of pupils using programs that they know more about than adults.Digital safeguarding consultant Charlotte Ainsley said: ""I think it's important to recognise that we're using AI all the time already.""So anytime that you access social media or any content it's generally driven by AI and certainly some of the algorithms and some of the content that you see will be exposing children to harmful content, so if they sign up to a certain site and service and lie about their age, and we know that lots of children do, they will see content that is potentially age inappropriate for them.""I think government have a really strong role to play in regulating AI. We don't want to be back in the same place that we were in with social media"".A government spokesperson said: ""Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform education, which is why we have launched a call to evidence to learn more about both the benefits and the risks that it could bring.""More widely, we are taking quick steps to establish a regulatory framework for AI across the UK as set out through the White Paper to make sure we have the right guardrails for driving safe, responsible AI innovation.""

teachers can't tell the difference,"The majority of teachers believe students are using Artificial Intelligence apps to do their work for them, according to a new study.  A survey by education tech firm RM Technology found that two thirds of teachers believe they are regularly receiving work written by AI, with around one in ten teachers (9%) admitting they can't tell the difference between work completed by their pupil and AI programs. The survey of 500 secondary school teachers revealed that 41% believe there needs to be better regulation of AI with 31% wanting the government to step in to police its use. Mel Parker, a former headteacher who now works as a consultant for RM Technology said: ""There definitely needs to be government regulation, especially from a safeguarding point of view."" And she believes better training is needed in the use of rapidly developing tech. ""They need to know how they can talk to students about good use of AI, what is appropriate use in the classroom, how can they learn from it? How can they get better understanding of concepts - actually what is cheating and what is good practice?"" She said there is concern that pupils can use AI to cheat, especially as more than a third of teachers surveyed admit pupils know more about AI than they do. ""Teachers haven't been equipped with what they need in terms of pulling together that understanding. So they need that support so that they can spot it."" Read more: Can AI do my job?

ChatGPT from OpenAI is one of the best-known generative AI tools, though several other offerings have become widely available. These tools comb through large volumes of content to create “the best” response to the prompt.  “Generative AI is smart enough to give a plausible answer to most prompts,” says Zach Warren, who leads Technology and Innovation Content for the Thomson Reuters Institute. “From there, the human using the tool should decide whether the material is accurate and edits it. It can be a great way to get a solid first draft, even for legal issues.”  Many legal professionals are already considering the use of generative AI in their legal practice. In a recent survey, the Thomson Reuters Institute found that 82% of legal professionals believe that the capability can be used in legal work. Only 51% believed that it should be used in legal work. The difference suggests that legal professionals see the potential but are unsure if they can trust the available tools to deliver accurate legal work product.  Warren offers several ways lawyers can use generative AI to create efficiencies in their practice. For instance, you can ask the tool to write a brief or contract based on a set of facts. Once the tool generates a draft, you check the citations, terms, and narrative, editing the draft rather than starting from scratch. You can also use generative AI tools to draft an RFP response to lighten the load in business development.  Generative AI also has the potential to synthesize large amounts of data. For instance, you can upload four contracts to an AI tool and ask to see the similarities and differences. You can analyze spreadsheets full of data or get plain language answers to legal questions.   Impact of generative AI on legal practice Generative AI is poised to create incredible efficiencies and cut down on the number of hours that lawyers work. Warren says that with a trusted tool, a legal professional may be able to cut down a task such a brief writing from ten hours to even one hour. “That means the differentiating factor for lawyers won’t be time. It will be how well people manage their cases,” says Warren. Law firms will all need to leverage their efficiency gains and still bill for the value they provide. This dynamic plays out differently depending on firm size. Solo attorneys and smaller firms will find that their innovative use of generative AI enables them to take on matters they couldn’t before. Larger firms will find that their clients expect them to use generative AI, and they will need to adapt processes and pricing to properly capture value.  Let’s look at the impact of generative AI on law firms, depending on their size.  Solo attorneys use generative AI to grow Generative AI can be a powerful helper for solo attorneys looking to grow their practice. For solos billing by the hour, growth is limited by the number of hours in a day. Even those who price by the matter are limited by their own ability to get through the work in a reasonable time frame. With AI-powered legal research and know-how from a trusted source, you can cut significant time from both transactional and litigation matters. “This is pure time savings,” Warren says. “You’re not giving different advice, but maybe you can take on more clients or do more work.” You may be more available to take client calls or meet with them when you are spending less time researching and drafting. You may also be better positioned to offer flat-rate pricing, which clients may appreciate. Rather than using the extra time to take on more work, some attorneys may use generative AI to deliver the same amount of work in less time. That gives them the opportunity to spend more time with family or on their own personal growth. Either way, if you’re spending less time on tasks like research or form submissions, you have more time to spend how you want to spend it.   Small law firms innovate through generative AI Small law firms – those with up to 10 attorneys – also benefit from the time savings that their solo counterparts experience. They can take on more matters with their lean teams, and they can explore new practice areas more easily, especially with AI-powered know- how tools.  Small law firms that adopt generative AI early are likely to be seen as innovative and forward-thinking. Rather than waiting for the market to settle on uses for generative AI, early adopters can experiment based on the needs of the firm or the interests of the attorneys.  “Small law firms have so much flexibility to experiment and implement new tools,” Warren says. “If you have individual attorneys who are taking the time to learn this, you’ll find there are so many more ways to use the tools.”  Where larger firms may wait on committees or consultants to approve an AI approach, smaller firms can move quickly to take advantage of the capabilities.  Small firms may also benefit more immediately because they can get even more from their new associates. “Training and getting people out of law school is going to be interesting,” Warren says. “Documents, legal research, writing contracts are tasks that can be streamlined or automated or simplified with generative AI, and they are also tasks that most often fall to newer associates. Firms that use generative AI will be able to move new associates to more strategic work more quickly.”  This is a selling point for clients, who don’t want to pay to train new associates. It’s also a differentiator in hiring. Small law firms can compete better in the war for talent if they are able to promise less grunt work and more opportunities to work directly with partners and clients.  “Generative AI can be a huge boon to associates looking to accelerate their career,” Warren says.    Mid-size law firms use generative AI to compete on a new level Warren says that on the whole, AI can be seen as an equalizer for both small and midsize firms. “You’re competing with enterprise firms that can just throw people at a problem,” he says. Generative AI like Chat GPT, Copilot and legal-specific tools can act as a force multiplier for smaller firms that don’t have armies of new associates.  Partners are particularly aware of this dynamic. In fact, in the Thomson Reuters Institute study, “ChatGPT & Generative AI within Law Firms,” partners were the most likely to respond that generative AI should be used in legal work, outpacing the total 59% to 51%. “If you’ve made partner, you’re thinking strategically about cases and about what’s right for the firm and the business,” Warren says. “You’re aware of the efficiencies the tools bring, of the way those efficiencies could lower costs or boost growth.” For an attorney eager to make a name for themselves in the firm, helping the firm learn and implement AI could be an important career booster.  “This is the time for firms to empower people who are curious,” Warren says. “Right now, the interest in generative AI is high but adoption is low. Being the person who jumpstarts the AI initiative in your firm can be very powerful for career development.”  Aspiring AI experts can look at AI-powered document review tools, know-how, and legal research platforms as possible new tools for the firm.   Global large law firms match client needs with generative AI “Generative AI represents a shift in how global large law firms approach their business,” says Warren. That could mean that they’ll see more client pressure to go to flat-rate pricing. Or that corporate clients could decide to keep more matters in house. “Clients want big firms to use technology. They also don’t want to pay firms to handle things they can do themselves.” Warren identifies this as a particular issue for the global large law firms, versus smaller firms, because their clients tend to be the largest corporations. They have large legal teams themselves, and they are keen to manage costs as closely as possible. The Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC) recently reported nearly 60% of corporate legal departments have someone fully dedicated to tech and operations. They are automating their processes, and they expect their law firms to do the same.  “Small companies may appreciate you using generative AI,” Warren says, “But large companies will expect it.”  Global large law firms will have to navigate through the same disruptive dynamics that small and mid-size firms do, but on a greater scale. You will have to continually look at pricing models to be sure you’re capturing the value of your work product. You’ll have to look at how you onboard new associates, what work you have them cut their teeth on, and how you mentor them through the early years of their practice.   Firms may find that generative AI changes much about their businesses. Not because it replaced lawyers, but because it disrupted the status quo around the billable hour, overworked associates, tedious work, and impossible goals so completely. It can’t replace expertise, but a combination of best-in-class AI-powered technology could significantly reshape the way global large law firms and their clients do business together.  Conclusion “Generative AI will affect all lawyers, no matter which size firm you work for,” Warren says. He urges legal practitioners to start exploring the capabilities now. And to understand how different platforms verify their results. “Don’t use something you can’t trust,” he says. Those firms that lean into the capabilities can start to realize significant time savings and perhaps shift their approach to pricing, employee training, and retention to reduce costs and grow revenue. Solo attorneys can take on more matters without working more hours – or they can spend less time working while maintaining their income. Small and mid-size firms can compete with larger firms, either by taking on more matters or by expanding their practice areas. Global large law firms will use generative AI to keep up with their corporate clients and offer greater value in less time. Generative AI is only as good as its source material.

This article is from Big Technology, a newsletter by Alex Kantrowitz.
It was so over. Remember? As soon as artificial intelligence began to read, write, and code, all manner of professions were supposed to automate—fast. Lawyers were toast. Entry-level engineers, commodified. And journalists, well, it’s a small miracle we’re writing this story.
And yet, eight months after the release of ChatGPT—and several years since the advent of other A.I. business tools—the fallout’s been muted. A.I. is being widely adopted, but the imagined mass firings haven’t materialized. The United States is still effectively at full employment, with just 3.5 percent of the workforce unemployed.
The usual narrative may say otherwise, but the path toward A.I.–driven mass unemployment isn’t simple. A.I. technology, however impressive, is still not good enough to handle most jobs. Rather than eliminate our positions, companies would like us to simply be better at them. And firms hoping to replace humans with bots are learning that change management is hard.

“The demise of industries due to A.I. is just not going to be a thing,” says Sarah Guo, a venture capitalist who invests in A.I. startups.
Legal work, for instance, was supposedly squarely in A.I.’s sights, but law firms enthusiastically incorporating A.I. aren’t using it to replace lawyers. Allen & Overy, a firm that employs more than 3,000 lawyers worldwide, started working with a generative A.I. tool called Harvey last year and hasn’t replaced a single person with it.

Harvey scours legal sites, contracts, and other large documents, and then answers queries and writes summaries. It’s exactly the type of application people said would send paralegals and junior associates to the bread lines. Yet it’s helping them perform better, adding value to the firm, and not threatening their livelihood. Why get rid of more-effective employees?

Besides, although the bot is helpful, it’s not nearly good enough to handle all those employees’ tasks, and it still gets things wrong often enough to require human supervision. “This profession, it’s a service business. So you need to have reliability, you need to have accuracy,” says Daren Orzechowski, a partner at the firm. When computers digitized law books, there was a similar panic, Orzechowski says, “but here we are today, and there’s more lawyers than there were when that technology came online.”

Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud storage company Box, says generative A.I. is typically quite good at handling one duty but struggles to take on the array that humans perform at work. “They can do one discrete, information-oriented task, basically, at a time before they need a human to review what they’ve done and then move to the next thing,” he says. “Not that many jobs are relegated to only that kind of thing.” This makes A.I. great at assisting people but terrible at replacing them.

To underscore the complexity of passing work along to A.I., consider radiologists, still in high demand despite serving as a favorite example among those predicting that robots will take all the jobs. At the Mayo Clinic, for instance, approximately 500 radiologists use A.I. tools to outline and classify images of the body. The A.I. helps them get more done, to make up for shortages in medical personnel. And though it’s incredibly useful, it isn’t ready to make judgment calls on spotting rare diseases or recommending treatments.

“In some respects, it actually can increase demand for radiology, because A.I. helps us get more information out of images than we could do before,” says Dr. Bradley Erickson, a neuroradiologist who runs the Mayo Clinic’s A.I. lab. “We’re still looking to hire.”

Such complexity exists in every field, so anytime you see a company announce that it’s replacing workers with A.I., read that with some skepticism. These organizations tend to be downsizing anyway and are looking for a positive spin for investors. As one ex-IBM employee told us, it’s much easier for the PR department to announce you’re going to turn 7,800 roles over to A.I. than to actually get the A.I. to do those people’s work.

There certainly will be jobs affected by this wave of A.I., as when any new technology arrives. And it’s possible that as the technology gets better, some companies will iron out the details and automate away. At that point, there could be meaningful displacement, even if mass unemployment is unlikely. But so far, the hot takes have run into reality.
Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that even if the technology gets good enough to replace, say, call centers or cab drivers en masse, employers and industry will still have a choice about what to do. No outcome is predetermined, he says. In the meantime, though, it makes sense to bet on the humans. “We know from many areas that have rapidly automated that they don’t deliver the types of returns that they promised,” says Acemoglu. “Humans are underrated.”

Generative AI models are powerful tools that data scientists are using to create powerful results, from content creation to improved data analytics performance. Yet it’s becoming apparent that many users are not aware of the risks of using generative AI.
As more users incorporate generative AI into their daily workflows without doing their due diligence, the potential challenges and consequences of using these AI models are beginning to outweigh the pros. This is particularly true for enterprise users that need transparent data and security practices to protect customer data and comply with industry-specific regulations.
In this guide, we’ll briefly discuss some of the risks of using generative AI. Also important, we’ll walk through some of the best ways your organization can manage and mitigate generative AI risk.

What Are the Risks Associated With Generative AI?
Generative AI models are massive artificial intelligence tools that rely on large quantities of third-party data, neural network architecture, and complex algorithms to generate original content.
These qualities make generative models capable of human-like problem-solving tasks. But similar to a human brain, not all generative AI model decisions and outputs are easy to dissect. The AI models’ lack of transparency is one of many generative AI risks that users must consider in the context of their work.
Other important risks of generative AI include the following:

The possibility that an AI model has used copyrighted data or creations without a creator’s consent; even when users are unaware of this violation, if they make commercial use of unauthorized content, they could be held liable.
The possibility of using sensitive consumer data and that data becoming part of the model’s ongoing training dataset.
A model’s training data could be biased, incomplete, or otherwise inaccurate.
Models may not have as many built-in safeguards as your organization needs to protect data and comply with regulations.
There’s always the chance an employee could unknowingly misuse a model or sensitive data, exposing intellectual property and other sensitive company information.
Generative models occasionally hallucinate, which means they confidently generate content that is inaccurate.
Models frequently store data for an extended period of time, which increases datasets’ chances of being exposed to a cyberattack.
Many models have little to no cybersecurity tooling in place natively; additionally, generative AI models can be tricked into solving security puzzles for malicious actors.
Generative models’ lack of transparency makes it difficult to quality-test and audit model data and usage.
Generative AI models are subject to few regulations, though several countries have AI legislation in the works; in general, generative AI vendors are not being held to the same consumer-protection standards as many other businesses.

Generative AI Risk Management: 6 Best Practices
1) Create and Enforce an AI Use Policy in Your Organization
Whether you’re already using generative AI across your organization or are simply considering its benefits, it’s a good idea to establish an acceptable use AI policy for your organization. This policy should explain:

Which departments and roles are allowed to use generative models as part of their work.
What parts of the workflow can be automated or supplemented with generative AI.
What internal data and apps are and are not allowed to be exposed to these models.

Establishing these policies gives your employees a better framework for what they can and cannot do with generative AI and also gives your leadership a clearer understanding of what behaviors they should be monitoring and correcting. If you’re looking for an existing policy to model your own policy after, NIST’s Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework is a great option.

2) Use First-Party Data and Responsibly Source Third-Party Data
When using a generative model in an enterprise setting, you should always know where your input data is coming from. Whenever possible, use first-party data that your company owns; this will help you keep track of your data’s origins and determine if that data is safe to use in a generative model. If it becomes necessary for you to use data that your company does not own, make sure you are using credible third-party sources with permission. This will increase the likelihood of you using high-quality data and steering clear of lawsuits for unauthorized data use.
Beyond the data your organization chooses to input in existing models, it’s also beneficial to research how generative AI vendors are sourcing their training data. Companies that refuse to explain any of these processes in their documentation should raise alarms for your organization and be avoided.
Even if your organization unknowingly uses or benefits from data that was illegally sourced by the vendor, you may still be held responsible for any outputs that violate copyright laws or privacy rights.
3) Train Employees on Appropriate Data and Generative Model Usage
It’s a clear risk to have an AI use policy does not guarantee that all users will know and follow the policy’s specific rules.
That’s why it’s important to train employees with the policy as a foundation and then explain how that policy applies to specific roles, departments, and scenarios. This will help your organization to maintain optimal levels of security and compliance by avoiding individual user errors that are more difficult to detect. All employees should receive this training, but employees who work with your most sensitive data and applications should receive more detailed and frequent training.
For better AI use outcomes, training should extend beyond your policy and cover tips for how to detect AI bias, misinformation, and hallucinations. This will give your employees the confidence they need to use models well and make more calculated decisions for tasks like AI-driven data analytics.

4) Invest in Cybersecurity Tools That Address AI Security Risks
Generative AI models and artificial intelligence tools in general require strong cybersecurity protections to secure all of the information they contain. Unfortunately, many generative AI models do not have much native cybersecurity infrastructure in place, or these features are so difficult to configure that most users do not set them up.
To protect input and output data against cybersecurity threats, you should consider any generative AI models you use as part of your network’s attack surface and set up your network security tools accordingly. If you’re not already using cybersecurity tools to protect your enterprise network, we recommend investing in tools like the following ones that are designed with AI and other modern attack surfaces in mind:

Identity and access management.
Data encryption and data security tools.
Cloud security posture management (CSPM).
Penetration testing.
Extended detection and response (XDR).
Threat intelligence.
Data loss prevention (DLP).

5) Build a Team of AI Quality Assurance Analysts
If you’re planning to use AI models on a larger scale, it’s worth hiring or training existing employees to work as AI quality assurance analysts or engineers. These individuals are responsible for maintaining and monitoring both the AI models your organization uses and the data that goes into these models.
Some of the most important responsibilities of an AI quality assurance analyst are:

Detecting issues in both training data and input data.
QA testing outputs to ensure generated content is accurate, original, and appropriately attributed.
Monitoring generative models, APIs, and other relevant infrastructure for unusual behaviors.
Maintaining regular documentation of model behavioral anomalies and data inaccuracies to support future audits.
Working closely with cybersecurity and data science teams to use generative AI tools effectively.

6) Research Generative AI Models Before Using Them
While generative AI vendors are not currently required by law to offer transparent documentation or information about their models’ training, a number of them have expanded their documentation by customer request.
As an example, OpenAI provides a publicly available research index with regularly released papers on individual products and the steps the company is taking to make large language models safer and more efficient. The company also has several legal terms and policies, including usage policies and API data usage policies.
Generative AI customers should read this type of research not only to better understand the full range of capabilities these tools possess but also to determine if data has been sourced and models have been trained in ways that align with company values and industry regulations.
It’s also prudent to keep up with news and lawsuits related to AI companies, as this information could impact what products you choose to use moving forward.

Bottom Line: Mitigating Generative AI Risks
Generative AI models offer a number of automations, shortcuts, and easy answers to enterprise users, making them great tools for growth and innovation. In fact, these models are so advanced and scalable that they’re being used for complex tasks ranging from drug discovery to smart manufacturing.
But using generative AI models comes with serious risks if you’re unwilling to research and bolster these solutions with the right cybersecurity tools, policies, and best practices. These models are changing and expanding their capabilities on an almost-daily basis. So it’s important to stay up-to-date on their potential use cases, how they are being regulated, and what you can do to make sure internal use aligns with both larger regulations and your organization’s own policies and best practices.

‘This Is an Existential Threat’: Will AI Really Eliminate Actors and Ruin Hollywood? Insiders Sound Off








						By 

	
Todd Spangler 



























































































































	Filmmaker Justine Bateman doesn’t think there is a thriving future for actors in filmed entertainment as we know it. She believes that artificial intelligence will ultimately suck the creative marrow out of Hollywood.

	“AI can create a convincing simulation of a hu­­man actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,” says Bateman, the former “Family Ties” star who has a degree in computer science and digital media management from UCLA. In a few short years, she asks, why would anyone need to pay real actors?

	“I stress that this is an existential threat,” continues Bateman, who is an adviser to SAG-AFTRA on AI issues. “And if they can do this with actors, they can do it with writers, directors, cinematographers — everyone. We’ll be replaced with Frankenstein spoonfuls of our own work.”

	When it comes to Hollywood, the sudden rise of AI-enabled content-creation platforms has only widened the already enormous divide between entertainment unions and the industry’s largest employers. Generative AI — advanced computing platforms that can create new text and imagery based on reams of existing reference material — has become a veritable villain in the current labor standoff. Signs on the unions’ picket lines this summer have been emblazoned with anti-AI slogans like “AI is not ART,” “Wrote ChatGPT This” and “AI’s not taking your dumb notes.”

	“Everyone understands that AI is a tidal wave that is coming for us one way or the other,” says Sarah Moses, entertainment litigation partner at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. “But it’s hard to negotiate right now because there are so many unknowns.”

	Let’s start with this one: Is the hand-wringing over generative AI overblown?

VIP+ Survey: Industry Sentiments on Gen AI Use

	There’s a general consensus that AI can’t produce original TV shows and movies that are anything close to what audiences expect — and that it may never be a satisfying substitute for the real human deal.

	“It’s fun to imagine a generative AI scriptwriter, but there is absolutely no interest in that. Because it’s lousy,” says Monica Landers, founder and CEO of StoryFit, an Austin-based company that uses AI to analyze screenplays. “It can’t hold on to the pacing to reveal the plot. It’s not made for character growth. It’s so empty right now.”

	









	James Cameron, the filmmaker behind AI thriller “The Terminator” and blockbusters like “Avatar” and “Titanic,” has no plans to use artificial intelligence to write a script. “I just don’t believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said will ever have something that’s going to move an audience,” Cameron recently told CTV News. He added, “Let’s wait 20 years, and if an AI wins an Oscar for best screenplay, I think we’ve got to take them seriously.”


	Generative AI is transforming everything about computing, and it represents an advance on par with the introduction of the PC or the smartphone. In the right hands, it will yield a class of powerful new creative tools.

	“We should look at AI as ‘augmented intelligence,’ rather than ‘artificial intelligence,’” says Sunny Dhillon, managing partner at venture-capital firm Kyber Knight Capital. “This will let filmmakers work faster and cheaper and make movies that are more compelling.”

	The reason that AI is changing the way the world works is that now anyone can harness the power of generative AI tools simply by using plain-language instructions, says Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker that has emerged as a powerhouse in the AI space. All of a sudden, you don’t need specialized training in, say, coding to create something incredible.

	“We’ve democratized computer science,” Huang told a rapturous crowd at the Siggraph 2023 computer-graphics confab in L.A. last week. “Generative AI is the new killer app.”

	The suits in Hollywood are clearly intrigued by AI, as are executives in every industry. About 96% of AI decision-makers at media and entertain­ment companies said they plan to increase their spending on generative AI technology in the next 12 months, according to a survey of 6,000 employees by enterprise search-engine vendor Lucidworks conducted between May and July. They add that they’re not looking to use it to eliminate workers; just 4% of those surveyed said they ex­­pect AI adoption to result in “job displacement.”

VIP+ Analysis: Four Ways Hollywood Should Use AI

	Disney CEO Bob Iger says the company is starting to use AI to operate more efficiently. “Overall, I’m bullish about the prospects because I think they’ll create efficiencies and ways for us to basically provide better services to customers,” he told Wall Street analysts in May.

	At Amazon, every one of the tech giant’s teams — including in its entertainment business — has multiple generative AI technology projects in the works, according to CEO Andy Jassy, speaking on Amazon’s Aug. 3 earnings call. He was light on specifics but said generative AI “is going to be at the heart of what we do” as Amazon looks to use it to reduce costs and “reinvent” cus-tomer experiences.

	A recent Netflix job listing for a product manager in the company’s machine-learning group listed a salary range of between $300,000 and $900,000. That triggered ire among the Hollywood unions’ rank and file. “Talk about tone-deafness, FFS!” tweeted WGA member Christopher Derrick, whose writing credits include “Star Trek: Picard” and “The Equalizer.” Never mind that the Netflix job in question centers on AI developments for content personalization and optimizing payment-processing systems. With the unions coalesced around fighting the encroachment of all things AI, Netflix’s listing is now a boogeyman.

	










	Forms of artificial intelligence, of course, have existed for decades (think spell-check programs or digital thermostats). What’s new — and, to Bateman and others, extremely alarming — is how rapidly gen AI has advanced to be able to create snippets of film or television that, if you squint, can look like actual humans in scenes produced by human directors. An AI-generated script can read like something written by a professional writer. A tipping point came in November 2022 when software firm OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can spit out fully formed essays on a range of different topics. 

	“For years, everyone has known AI was coming,” says Jason Vredenburg, an associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology who teaches American film history. “But when ChatGPT came out, everyone was shocked. They realized it was coming faster than anyone thought.”

	That’s why in the current entertainment industry labor disputes, AI has become a flashpoint. The WGA wants its members to be able to use AI tools but is asking for assurances that using those tools won’t count against them in determining credit and pay. The AMPTP has offered to spell out explicitly that a “writer” must be a human, but also says further discussion is needed in the area.

	Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA has alleged that studios “want to scan a background performer’s image, pay them for a half a day’s labor and then use an individual’s likeness for any purpose forever without their consent.” The AMPTP has emphatically denied this.

	But background actors have become deeply worried about their employment prospects in an AI world. “We don’t know what all our scans are being used for,” says Prince Royal, an actor who says that when he worked as an extra on “The Flash” he was required to submit to a 360-degree image scan — or go home without pay. AMPTP says under its proposal, producers must obtain background actors’ full consent and separately bargain for payment for each use of a digital replica.

	Per the AMPTP, what is needed is “a balanced approach based on careful use, not prohibition.”

	Multiple legal issues with generative AI have yet to be fully ironed out. One gray area — the subject of several lawsuits — has to do with the source material used to “train” generative AI models.

	Last month, a lawsuit on behalf of Sarah Silverman and other authors accused Meta and OpenAI of illegally using copyrighted works — including Silverman’s 2010 bestselling memoir “The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee” — to train their AI systems. (Meta declined to comment. Silverman also declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.)

VIP+ Analysis: AI Copyright Cases Under Cloud of Uncertainty










	Some experts say there’s nothing in the law that prevents AI systems from using any kind of source material for training. U.S. laws stipulate that you can’t copy a specific copyrighted work or performance, says Yale Law School professor Robert Post. But actors, he says, study all kinds of performances to inform their own. “Everyone has a right to study them,” including someone who is using AI to do so, says Post. He adds, “It’s not copyright infringement to read a lot of books.”

	Other commentators have argued that the U.S. needs a federal law protecting name, image and likeness that supersedes today’s state-by-state regulations.

	Hilary Krane, chief legal officer at CAA, believes generative AI issues pertaining to intellectual property, as well as name, image and likeness rights, are solvable and addressable concerns. “We want to make sure the rules of the road are clear,” she says. “Uncertainty always breeds fear.”

	The music industry has been the canary in the coal mine for many technologies, including piracy, and has been among the first in the entertainment field to have to grapple with generative AI that mimics specific artists’ styles and voices. Earlier this year, Universal Music Group filed copyright-infringement claims to remove an AI-generated song called “Heart on My Sleeve” that sounded very much like a collab between Drake and the Weeknd, neither of whom was involved with the song.

	What the industry might need is some kind of truth-in-labeling regulations for generative AI, similar to the way the FDA requires standardized food labeling, says Michael Huppe, CEO of SoundExchange, a nonprofit rights management organization for digital sound recordings. “Maybe you’ll end up paying more for a ‘human-only’ streaming service,” he says.


	To date, generative AI has made the biggest inroads in VFX for tasks like de-aging actors and dubbing scenes into other languages. But given the antagonism from some on the picket lines toward all things AI, it’s a weird time to be selling AI-enabled products to Hollywood.

	StoryFit, for example, works with studios and networks to break down a script and identify whether elements and characters in a story resonate with audiences. Monica Landers compares it to an audience preview but using an AI-modeled audience to react to a project when it’s at the script stage.

	“We don’t want to be the bad guy,” says Landers. “But we do find ourselves in the middle of it. I often find myself responding defensively: ‘We are not generative AI; we are using AI to help creativity.’”

	Some years ago, professional language translators were very worried about AI eliminating their jobs when tools like Google Translate became more proficient. What actually happened, according to Landers, was that the AI tools took on a lot of the “boring scutwork” of translators, but they have not been able to replicate mood or convey idioms in the way human translators can. In the context of the Hollywood strikes, Landers says, “My hope is we can figure out a way that writers and actors are protected enough so that they can be part of creating in whatever this new world is going to be.”

	Scott Mann, co-CEO of Flawless, which specializes in gen-AI filmmaking tools, and a director and producer whose films include “Fall” and “Heist,” says the recent uproar over AI in creative industries has highlighted “the responsibility factor” — that is, producers must obtain permission from actors and compensate them for anything based on their likeness.

	“The truth is, there are huge misunderstandings around gen AI,” says Mann. “I don’t see any point in time where you take humans out of the equation. Fundamentally, films are created from human feelings and emotions.”

	









	On AI issues, the path of least resistance for the unions and the AMPTP may be to agree to certain “broad strokes” and to table the more nitty-gritty points of contention until the next round of negotiations, says Moses. “The parties might be best served kicking the can down the road.”


	But that road may be coming up fast. Joe Russo, co-director of Marvel movies including “Avengers: Endgame” and “Avengers: Infinity War,” has predicted that generative AI may be able to create feature-length movies within two years — and that the technology could put you, the viewer, into an AI-generated movie.

	“At some point, perhaps, you could tell a video-streaming service, ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe’s photo-real avatar,’” Russo said in an April interview with Collider. “It renders a very competent story with dialogue that mimics your voice. … And suddenly now you have a rom-com starring you that’s 90 minutes long. So you can curate your story specifically to you.”

	Echoing Russo’s thought experiment, Bateman predicts that rights holders will sooner or later let consumers insert themselves into classic movies — imagine yourself starring in “Citizen Kane.” Or maybe AI generates some kind of derivative work cobbled together from an AI database trained on existing stories and characters trending in your feeds. Either way, in Bateman’s doomsday outlook, the market for human-created entertainment will wither away, replaced by synthetic fare produced at a fraction of the cost.

	“There’s no scenario I can think of where this doesn’t happen,” Bateman says. “Generative AI can’t make great films. But it can create a high volume of content and regurgitate sequels.”

	But others say that instead of fighting the future, the more productive strategy is to figure out where AI technology is most useful, while working to ensure copyright protections for individual creators as well as name, image and likeness rights for performers.

	The real question the industry faces is how people can get past their fear about AI and start to unlock its potential, says CJ Bangah, who leads PwC’s entertainment and media practice.

	“Some of the most impactful artisans in the future will find ways to use AI in ways we are just beginning to understand,” Bangah says, adding, “‘Hand-crafted’ doesn’t mean not using technology.”

A tidal wave is about to crash into the global economy. The rise of artificial intelligence has captured our imagination for decades, in whimsical movies and sober academic texts. Despite this speculation, the emergence of public, easy-to-use AI tools over the past year has been a jolt, like the future arrived years ahead of schedule. Now this long-expected, all-too-sudden technological revolution is ready to upend the economy.

A March Goldman Sachs report found over 300 million jobs around the world could be disrupted by AI, and the global consulting firm McKinsey estimated at least 12 million Americans would change to another field of work by 2030. A ""gale of creative destruction,"" as economist Joseph Schumpeter once described it, will blow away countless firms and breathe life into new industries. It won't be all bleak: Over the coming decades, nongenerative and generative AI are estimated to add between $17 trillion and $26 trillion to the global economy. And crucially, many of the jobs that will be lost will be replaced by new ones.

The crescendo for this technological wave is surging, and we are at just the beginning of this upheaval that will ripple through the labor market and global economy. It's likely to be a transformation as influential as the industrial revolution and the rise of the internet. The changes could boost living standards, improve productivity, and accelerate economic opportunities, but this rosy future is not guaranteed. Unless governments, CEOs, and workers properly prepare for the upsurge with urgency, the AI revolution could be painful.We didn't see the internet coming, but AI is within viewThe adoption of groundbreaking technology is often hard to predict. Take the internet: In 1995, Newsweek published an article titled, ""Why the Web Won't Be Nirvana,"" making the case that books and airline tickets would never be purchased over the internet. Later that year, Bill Gates was asked by an unconvinced David Letterman, ""What about this internet thing?"" Even three years later, as adoption grew, the economist Paul Krugman famously declared that the internet's influence would be no greater than that of the fax machine. In hindsight, it's clear that the internet's effects couldn't have been any more miscalculated.Part of the reason for the initial skepticism was that the influence of the internet was uneven and slow at first but quickly grew as more people learned how it worked. ""The rule for exponential curves is that they changed the world slowly at first, and then suddenly,"" Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University innovation economist, told me. The arrival of AI presents similar unknowns — but the growth curve is becoming clear much quicker. In 2017, McKinsey estimated that robust large language models such as GPT-4 would be developed by 2027. But they are already here. And seemingly overnight, OpenAI's generative AI was integrated into Microsoft products, and in the span of a few months, corporate giants including Amazon, AT&T, Salesforce, and Cisco have rushed to incorporate enterprise-grade AI tools. McKinsey's latest report predicted that somewhere between 2030 and 2060, half of today's work tasks would be automated. Their best guess as to when this will happen — 2045 — is almost a decade earlier than previously estimated. Things are changing fast.And as adoption picks up, so will the downstream effects of the technology. The World Economic Forum estimated 83 million jobs worldwide would be lost over the next five years because of AI, with 69 million jobs created — that leaves 14 million jobs that will cease to exist during that timeframe. Even the people who do retain their jobs will experience a massive shift in how they do their work: The World Economic Forum says that 44% of workers' core skills are expected to change in the next five years.

I do not think we'll see mass unemployment. But I do think we'll see mass disruption. Stanford economist Erik BrynjolfssonPast automation technologies had the most effect on low-skilled workers. But with generative AI, the more educated and highly skilled workers who previously were immune to automation are vulnerable. According to the International Labor Organization, there are between 644 and 997 million knowledge workers globally, between 20% and 30% of total global employment. In the US, the knowledge-worker class is estimated to be nearly 100 million workers, one out of three Americans. A broad spectrum of occupations — marketing and sales, software engineering, research and development, accounting, financial advising, and writing, to name a few — is at risk of being automated away or evolving.This doesn't mean, however, that there will be a flood of unemployed workers begging for any job. AI will lead to net job creation over the long run, and some roles that seem like they will be affected may actually grow in demand. For instance, ATMs increased the number of bank tellers. ""I do not think we'll see mass unemployment,"" Brynjolfsson, who anticipates AI spreading faster than other general-purpose technologies, told me. ""But I do think we'll see mass disruption, where a lot of wages for some jobs will fall, wages for other jobs will rise, and we'll be shifting around into demand for different kinds of skills. They'll have to be a lot of reallocation of labor and rescaling of labor with winners and losers.""This shift will be so massive that we won't miss many of the jobs that disappear. Before the industrial revolution, the job of a human alarm clock was to wake up workers in the early-morning hours by tapping a broomstick on their window. Thanks to alarm clocks, no one misses this job today. Similarly with AI, there will be jobs that will be conveniently forgotten about.

Permanent mass unemployment can safely be ruled out, but in the short term, the transition will be messy. If one-quarter of tasks across all US occupations were automated by AI, and one-third of workers' workload replaced, it would take only a small segment of the broad white-collar class to simultaneously experience job losses or transitions for it to have a dire impact on the broader economy. This sort of monumental reshuffling requires preparation on the part of governments and businesses. In its most recent employment outlook, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development declared that this AI revolution was creating ""an urgent need to act now"" to help the economy adapt.Productivity boom In 1987, the economist Robert Solow famously declared: ""You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."" Solow's ""productivity paradox"" spotlighted a key puzzle of the emerging computer age. Even with heavy investments in information technology and computing — which were supposedly making workers more productive — official statistics showed that workers were not producing more per hour.


                                Related stories
                              


Robert Gordon, a macroeconomist and self-styled ""prophet of pessimism,"" provocatively suggested that the ho-hum productivity figures proved that new technology today was less radical than in the past and that as a result, the world's advanced economies had entered a point of stagnation. The most impactful technologies — the car, the toilet — have already been invented, he argued, and everything else only incrementally improves productivity. Along the same lines, other economists have suggested that the growth rate of new ideas is slowing.These arguments may seem like a compelling reason to doubt the productivity gains of AI at first, but there's good reason to think that the latest revolution could produce more rapid gains. The internet's mass adoption required software, network protocols, infrastructure, and devices — it took awhile for every home and office to have computers and internet access.

Today, AI's adoption could happen much faster since the technological infrastructure is already in place. Plus, in contrast to hype cycles around crypto or the metaverse, AI is entering maturity. Its user experience makes it uncomplicated, and it already has practical uses, which is why hundreds of millions of people are already integrating the tech into their day-to-day workflows. This is starting to push the technology into companies. It's also not AI on its own that's game-changing; layering AI on top of preexisting tech can unlock exponential gains — just as the combination of the internet, GPS technology, and smartphones changed our world. Laser weeders that use AI, GPS, and tractor technology can now comb through crop fields in seconds to zap weeds, eliminating the need for herbicides or large hand-weeding crews. And AI embedded within advanced imaging tools have the potential to diagnose and treat cancer. If the internet made the world flat, then AI makes the world faster. One recent study conducted by Brynjolfsson and his colleagues quantified the productivity of over 5,000 customer-service agents who used generative-AI technology. The results were encouraging: Call-center operators became 14% more productive, and less experienced workers improved their productivity as much as 30%. A study out of MIT found software developers completed tasks 56% faster with generative-code-completion software, and yet another study found that professional-document writing was 40% faster using generative AI. The small and large compounding effects of productivity growth across many industries are central to the growth trajectory and the long-run effects of AI. Goldman Sachs estimated that over 10 years, generative AI alone could raise annual US labor-productivity growth by just under 1.5 percentage points, ""roughly the same-sized boost that followed the emergence of prior transformative technologies like the electric motor and personal computer."" If that proved true, it would lead to an annual increase of 7% in global GDP, while contributing $2.6 trillion to 4.4 trillion to the global economy — about the equivalent of the UK economy.

Brynjolfsson, a ""mindful optimist,"" is confident that these productivity gains will accumulate — and show up in the official stats. He told me that he had a bet with Gordon, the pessimist, that productivity growth over the coming years would outpace the 1.4% annual growth projected by the Congressional Budget Office. ""In fact, I think it's going to be closer to double that,"" he said.While estimates for productivity reflect how workers within firms will become more efficient at their jobs, it also assumes that laid-off workers will find new jobs. As productivity rises, total economic output will increase and GDP will rise. This will create a virtuous cycle, as companies will need to expand operations to keep up with this increased demand, which means they will need more workers. Plus, labor-productivity growth has been shown to raise real incomes, benefiting workers and households. Simply put: Technological innovation, even as it may lead to worker displacement, will help workers in the long run. A widely cited study by the economist David Autor and colleagues found 60% of workers today had jobs that did not exist 80 years ago, suggesting that 85% growth in employment was a result of technology innovation. Future proofing — faster and smarter That's all great news, but the turbulence of the AI revolution can't be ignored. The rapid pace of AI advancement and adoption makes this shift markedly different from past industrial revolutions. It's not as simple as textile workers being replaced by mechanized looms — workforce transformations are happening to varying degrees across occupations. And this pace of change is bound to outrun any changes in education and workforce preparation designed to keep up with the tech.America's already antiquated workforce education system already fails to address modern workers' needs, let alone what they may need as AI takes hold. Maria Flynn, the CEO of the Washington think tank Jobs for the Future, said the US was encumbered by a ""patchwork of programs that don't blend into a nice-looking quilt."" In fact, there are 43 federal employment-training programs whose total budget is $20 billion, or less than 0.1% of US GDP. This is an alarmingly trivial amount for an economy of $25 trillion GDP and over 150 million workers.

 To ease the pain of the labor-market upheaval, the US needs to invest more in its workforce — and fast. One approach is to adopt Denmark's model of job security and retraining, known as ""flexicurity."" The system helps avoid structural unemployment by making it easy for employers to let go of workers and by providing a substantial cushion for those laid off. The program provides unemployment benefits for two years at as much as $2,860 a month for people who are laid off, as well as one-on-one job counseling with retraining opportunities. As a result, the Danes are unemployed for much less time compared with workers in similar countries.

The US once had a similar program, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which was established in 1974 and administered by the Department of Labor for workers affected by trade and production in other countries. ""It was an entitlement program so that any worker who met certain conditions — that their job was displaced due to trade — had an entitlement to receive a package of income support and retraining support,"" Flynn told me. An expansive and well-funded program geared toward the AI labor-market shift would help ease turbulence for workers by providing relocation grants and wage insurance to temporarily bridge the wage gap when workers find employment in lower-paying jobs.To retrain people for an AI-based economy, the US could look to Singapore. There, workers above the age of 25 are given $500 in credits to access 24,000 courses in anything from data science to business, and a public-private retraining program makes sure skills training is matched to employers' job classifications. Every year, over 660,000 people make use of the country's national retraining program. For those concerned about productivity lags, these kinds of large-scale upgrades to education and training have the potential to fill in the gaps of a major workforce transition. Singapore's efforts have helped step up the annual labor-productivity growth rate to a respectable 3%. All these public-sector policies would still need to be complemented by private-sector investment in retraining. In an MIT survey of workers, 50% of respondents reported receiving formal skills training by their employers. Incentivizing retraining through tax credits –– such as those in New York and Georgia –– could spur employers into action and ensure everyone is ready for the AI revolution.

Technology can't be uninvented — disruptive catalysts such as AI require the proactive pursuit of adapting to that change. And making workers resilient to large shocks requires recognizing that this technological wave can temporarily wipe out a large portion of the workforce, or it can be smoothly surfed to calm waters.Emil Skandul is a writer on technology and urban economics, and a Tony Blair Institute fellow.

Despite this speculation, the emergence of public, easy-to-use AI tools over the past year has been a jolt, like the future arrived years ahead of schedule. Now this long-expected, all-too-sudden technological revolution is ready to upend the economy. A March Goldman Sachs report found over 300 million jobs around the world could be disrupted by AI, and the global consulting firm McKinsey estimated at least 12 million Americans would change to another field of work by 2030. A ""gale of creative destruction,"" as economist Joseph Schumpeter once described it, will blow away countless firms and breathe life into new industries. It won't be all bleak: Over the coming decades, nongenerative and generative AI are estimated to add between $17 trillion and $26 trillion to the global economy. And crucially, many of the jobs that will be lost will be replaced by new ones.The crescendo for this technological wave is surging, and we are at just the beginning of this upheaval that will ripple through the labor market and global economy. It's likely to be a transformation as influential as the industrial revolution and the rise of the internet. The changes could boost living standards, improve productivity, and accelerate economic opportunities, but this rosy future is not guaranteed. Unless governments, CEOs, and workers properly prepare for the upsurge with urgency, the AI revolution could be painful.The adoption of groundbreaking technology is often hard to predict. Take the internet: In 1995, Newsweek published an article titled, ""Why the Web Won't Be Nirvana,"" making the case that books and airline tickets would never be purchased over the internet. Later that year, Bill Gates was asked by an unconvinced David Letterman, ""What about this internet thing?"" Even three years later, as adoption grew, the economist Paul Krugman famously declared that the internet's influence would be no greater than that of the fax machine. In hindsight, it's clear that the internet's effects couldn't have been any more miscalculated.Part of the reason for the initial skepticism was that the influence of the internet was uneven and slow at first but quickly grew as more people learned how it worked. ""The rule for exponential curves is that they changed the world slowly at first, and then suddenly,"" Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University innovation economist, told me. The arrival of AI presents similar unknowns — but the growth curve is becoming clear much quicker. In 2017, McKinsey estimated that robust large language models such as GPT-4 would be developed by 2027. But they are already here. And seemingly overnight, OpenAI's generative AI was integrated into Microsoft products, and in the span of a few months, corporate giants including Amazon, AT&T, Salesforce, and Cisco have rushed to incorporate enterprise-grade AI tools. McKinsey's latest report predicted that somewhere between 2030 and 2060, half of today's work tasks would be automated. Their best guess as to when this will happen — 2045 — is almost a decade earlier than previously estimated. Things are changing fast.And as adoption picks up, so will the downstream effects of the technology. The World Economic Forum estimated 83 million jobs worldwide would be lost over the next five years because of AI, with 69 million jobs created — that leaves 14 million jobs that will cease to exist during that timeframe. Even the people who do retain their jobs will experience a massive shift in how they do their work: The World Economic Forum says that 44% of workers' core skills are expected to change in the next five years.Past automation technologies had the most effect on low-skilled workers. But with generative AI, the more educated and highly skilled workers who previously were immune to automation are vulnerable. According to the International Labor Organization, there are between 644 and 997 million knowledge workers globally, between 20% and 30% of total global employment. In the US, the knowledge-worker class is estimated to be nearly 100 million workers, one out of three Americans. A broad spectrum of occupations — marketing and sales, software engineering, research and development, accounting, financial advising, and writing, to name a few — is at risk of being automated away or evolving.This doesn't mean, however, that there will be a flood of unemployed workers begging for any job. AI will lead to net job creation over the long run, and some roles that seem like they will be affected may actually grow in demand. For instance, ATMs increased the number of bank tellers. ""I do not think we'll see mass unemployment,"" Brynjolfsson, who anticipates AI spreading faster than other general-purpose technologies, told me. ""But I do think we'll see mass disruption, where a lot of wages for some jobs will fall, wages for other jobs will rise, and we'll be shifting around into demand for different kinds of skills. They'll have to be a lot of reallocation of labor and rescaling of labor with winners and losers.""This shift will be so massive that we won't miss many of the jobs that disappear. Before the industrial revolution, the job of a human alarm clock was to wake up workers in the early-morning hours by tapping a broomstick on their window. Thanks to alarm clocks, no one misses this job today. Similarly with AI, there will be jobs that will be conveniently forgotten about.Permanent mass unemployment can safely be ruled out, but in the short term, the transition will be messy. If one-quarter of tasks across all US occupations were automated by AI, and one-third of workers' workload replaced, it would take only a small segment of the broad white-collar class to simultaneously experience job losses or transitions for it to have a dire impact on the broader economy. This sort of monumental reshuffling requires preparation on the part of governments and businesses. In its most recent employment outlook, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development declared that this AI revolution was creating ""an urgent need to act now"" to help the economy adapt.In 1987, the economist Robert Solow famously declared: ""You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."" Solow's ""productivity paradox"" spotlighted a key puzzle of the emerging computer age. Even with heavy investments in information technology and computing — which were supposedly making workers more productive — official statistics showed that workers were not producing more per hour.Robert Gordon, a macroeconomist and self-styled ""prophet of pessimism,"" provocatively suggested that the ho-hum productivity figures proved that new technology today was less radical than in the past and that as a result, the world's advanced economies had entered a point of stagnation. The most impactful technologies — the car, the toilet — have already been invented, he argued, and everything else only incrementally improves productivity. Along the same lines, other economists have suggested that the growth rate of new ideas is slowing.These arguments may seem like a compelling reason to doubt the productivity gains of AI at first, but there's good reason to think that the latest revolution could produce more rapid gains. The internet's mass adoption required software, network protocols, infrastructure, and devices — it took awhile for every home and office to have computers and internet access. Today, AI's adoption could happen much faster since the technological infrastructure is already in place. Plus, in contrast to hype cycles around crypto or the metaverse, AI is entering maturity. Its user experience makes it uncomplicated, and it already has practical uses, which is why hundreds of millions of people are already integrating the tech into their day-to-day workflows. This is starting to push the technology into companies. It's also not AI on its own that's game-changing; layering AI on top of preexisting tech can unlock exponential gains — just as the combination of the internet, GPS technology, and smartphones changed our world. Laser weeders that use AI, GPS, and tractor technology can now comb through crop fields in seconds to zap weeds, eliminating the need for herbicides or large hand-weeding crews. And AI embedded within advanced imaging tools have the potential to diagnose and treat cancer. If the internet made the world flat, then AI makes the world faster. One recent study conducted by Brynjolfsson and his colleagues quantified the productivity of over 5,000 customer-service agents who used generative-AI technology. The results were encouraging: Call-center operators became 14% more productive, and less experienced workers improved their productivity as much as 30%. A study out of MIT found software developers completed tasks 56% faster with generative-code-completion software, and yet another study found that professional-document writing was 40% faster using generative AI. The small and large compounding effects of productivity growth across many industries are central to the growth trajectory and the long-run effects of AI. Goldman Sachs estimated that over 10 years, generative AI alone could raise annual US labor-productivity growth by just under 1.5 percentage points, ""roughly the same-sized boost that followed the emergence of prior transformative technologies like the electric motor and personal computer."" If that proved true, it would lead to an annual increase of 7% in global GDP, while contributing $2.6 trillion to 4.4 trillion to the global economy — about the equivalent of the UK economy. Brynjolfsson, a ""mindful optimist,"" is confident that these productivity gains will accumulate — and show up in the official stats. He told me that he had a bet with Gordon, the pessimist, that productivity growth over the coming years would outpace the 1.4% annual growth projected by the Congressional Budget Office. ""In fact, I think it's going to be closer to double that,"" he said.While estimates for productivity reflect how workers within firms will become more efficient at their jobs, it also assumes that laid-off workers will find new jobs. As productivity rises, total economic output will increase and GDP will rise. This will create a virtuous cycle, as companies will need to expand operations to keep up with this increased demand, which means they will need more workers. Plus, labor-productivity growth has been shown to raise real incomes, benefiting workers and households. Simply put: Technological innovation, even as it may lead to worker displacement, will help workers in the long run. A widely cited study by the economist David Autor and colleagues found 60% of workers today had jobs that did not exist 80 years ago, suggesting that 85% growth in employment was a result of technology innovation. That's all great news, but the turbulence of the AI revolution can't be ignored. The rapid pace of AI advancement and adoption makes this shift markedly different from past industrial revolutions. It's not as simple as textile workers being replaced by mechanized looms — workforce transformations are happening to varying degrees across occupations. And this pace of change is bound to outrun any changes in education and workforce preparation designed to keep up with the tech.America's already antiquated workforce education system already fails to address modern workers' needs, let alone what they may need as AI takes hold. Maria Flynn, the CEO of the Washington think tank Jobs for the Future, said the US was encumbered by a ""patchwork of programs that don't blend into a nice-looking quilt."" In fact, there are 43 federal employment-training programs whose total budget is $20 billion, or less than 0.1% of US GDP. This is an alarmingly trivial amount for an economy of $25 trillion GDP and over 150 million workers. To ease the pain of the labor-market upheaval, the US needs to invest more in its workforce — and fast. One approach is to adopt Denmark's model of job security and retraining, known as ""flexicurity."" The system helps avoid structural unemployment by making it easy for employers to let go of workers and by providing a substantial cushion for those laid off. The program provides unemployment benefits for two years at as much as $2,860 a month for people who are laid off, as well as one-on-one job counseling with retraining opportunities. As a result, the Danes are unemployed for much less time compared with workers in similar countries.The US once had a similar program, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which was established in 1974 and administered by the Department of Labor for workers affected by trade and production in other countries. ""It was an entitlement program so that any worker who met certain conditions — that their job was displaced due to trade — had an entitlement to receive a package of income support and retraining support,"" Flynn told me. An expansive and well-funded program geared toward the AI labor-market shift would help ease turbulence for workers by providing relocation grants and wage insurance to temporarily bridge the wage gap when workers find employment in lower-paying jobs.To retrain people for an AI-based economy, the US could look to Singapore. There, workers above the age of 25 are given $500 in credits to access 24,000 courses in anything from data science to business, and a public-private retraining program makes sure skills training is matched to employers' job classifications. Every year, over 660,000 people make use of the country's national retraining program. For those concerned about productivity lags, these kinds of large-scale upgrades to education and training have the potential to fill in the gaps of a major workforce transition. Singapore's efforts have helped step up the annual labor-productivity growth rate to a respectable 3%. All these public-sector policies would still need to be complemented by private-sector investment in retraining. In an MIT survey of workers, 50% of respondents reported receiving formal skills training by their employers. Incentivizing retraining through tax credits –– such as those in New York and Georgia –– could spur employers into action and ensure everyone is ready for the AI revolution. Technology can't be uninvented — disruptive catalysts such as AI require the proactive pursuit of adapting to that change. And making workers resilient to large shocks requires recognizing that this technological wave can temporarily wipe out a large portion of the workforce, or it can be smoothly surfed to calm waters.Emil Skandul is a writer on technology and urban economics, and a Tony Blair Institute fellow.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-radically-reshape-job-market-global-economy-employee-labor-innovation-2023-8'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Grace DeGraaf'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China’s Military Employment of Artificial Intelligence and Its Security Implications



Summer 2020



Aug 16

Written By Jiayu Zhang, Former Contributor






AbstractChina’s application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has complicated and subtle implications for international and regional security. To take advantage ofAI’s structural and systematic advantages in technological innovation, China has launched a national campaign to allocate resources to AI development in both thepublic and private sectors. Other measures, including educational programs, “going out” strategy, and military-civil fusion, have also been implemented tobolster AI innovation. To prepare for “intelligentized” warfare in the future, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is capitalizing on AI technology to developunmanned intelligent combat systems, enhance battlefield situational awareness, conduct multi-domain operations, and promote training programs. The PLA has previously implemented structural reform and adapted doctrine to ensure its employment of AI fits the requirements for future warfare. China’s progress in AI and its military application may trigger regional competition for AI primacy or an AI arms race, posing an ambiguous effect on arms control concerning autonomous lethal weapon systems. PLA's efforts to enhance nuclear capabilities by leveraging AI will have both stabilizing and destabilizing influences on strategic stability andnuclear risk. Ultimately, the introduction of AI to modern battlefields may help China tip the military balance in the Western Pacific, but its potential to change theessence of armed conflict and conduct in war is limited.



INTRODUCTIONArtificial intelligence (AI), with its potential to improve the speed and accuracy of everything on the battlefield, is heating up as a key area of strategic competition and driving militaries around the world to accelerate research and development for this revolutionary technology.1 Among them, China not only intends to seize the initiative to become the “global AI leader”, but also has unparalleled potential to capitalize on the application of AI to military affairs, which have complicated and subtle implications for international and regional security.2The Chinese leadership intends to take advantage of AI to enhance its economic competitiveness and military capabilities. The New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan lays out a comprehensive blueprint for the development and innovation of AI technology in both private and public sectors. The national strategy of military-civil fusion creates a favorable environment for the rapid transfer of progress from the private sector to the military context.3 The latest defense white paper also highlights the importance of AI for the PLA by regarding “the integrated development of military intelligentization” as part of a characteristically Chinese way to strengthen the military.4However, given the significant uncertainty about the pace and trajectory of AI innovation,5 it is still hard to predict how AI might contribute to various kinds of military power, and to what extent. More importantly, the impact of any technology on military affairs depends principally on how people and organizations decide to use it.6 Whether this intelligentized technology can be integrated into PLA’s organizational structure and combat doctrine will shape China’s military posture and security strategy on issues such as defending territorial claims in the South China Sea and unifying Taiwan by force if necessary. Since China’s rapid build-up of its conventional military capabilities and growing regional ambitions have already triggered the concerns of peripheral countries, the implication of China’s significant AI research and application in the defense field deserves more attention.To explore these understudied questions, this paper focuses on how China’s development of AI technology and its military application of such technology will influence security and conflict in the region.The next section of this article examines China’s structural and systematic advantages as a totalistic party-state by briefly reviewing China’s current measures and policies, such as launching a nation-wide campaign, cultivating talent, and encouraging “going out”to promote AI innovation.The subsequent section discusses China’s efforts to apply such technological advances to the military field. AI has been used to develop unmanned combat systems, facilitate battlefield situational awareness and decision-making, conduct multi-domain operations, and promote training.The last section discusses the implications of Chinese military’s employment of AI for the balance of power, arms race, and strategic stability in East Asia.CHINA’S NATIONAL AGENDA AND POLICIES FOR AI DEVELOPMENTThe use of AI technology has become a national development strategy for China. China’s holistic approach to acquiring AI technology includes: (1) Issuing a national-wide campaign to mobilize resources, (2) deploying educational and academic efforts to cultivate a talent pool, (3) promoting “going out” to acquire knowledge abroad, and (4) requiring technology transfers with foreign companies. Finally, China is harnessing its structural and systematic advantages as a one-party, totalistic country to focus on its scientific and technological development.1. National Campaign for AI Research and DevelopmentOn many occasions after his ascension to power, President Xi Jingping renewed urgency for demands that China master new technology,7 arguing that “scientific and technological strength determines changes in the world balance of political and economic power, and determines the fate of every nation.”8 Among a variety of emerging technologies, Chinese leadership started to pay attention to AI and made it a national priority in 2015.9 Within the past several years, multiple national science and technology strategies and plans have been issued, constituting a nation-wide campaign aimed at occupying the “high ground” of AI technology.10 11 With the guidelines provided by such documents, both public and private sectors are mobilizing to participate in the AI campaign.The governments on national, provincial, and municipal levels have increasing financial and policy support for state-owned laboratories.12 Most of those labs are affiliated with China’s leading universities such as Tsinghua University’s State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, as well as the Chinese Academy of Science’s Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing. Moreover, various AI professional organizations and think tanks, similar to the Chinese AI Association and AI Industry Alliance, have been established with governmental sponsorship to promote the domestic exchange of AI expertise.13 Motivated by both economic incentives and political urgency, private enterprises in the AI field are engaging actively as well. As of 2018, there were 4,040 AI companies in China. Among them are China’s three largest internet giants, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which have collectively invested a total of $12.8 billion in the AI industry, surpassing the combination of the four leading U.S. firms.14 Cooperation between public sectors and private companies is also encouraged. Under the leadership of Baidu, China’s National Engineering Laboratory of Deep Learning Technology was founded in 2017 to research machine-learning-based visual recognition, biometric identification, and human-computer interaction.152. Cultivating Talent PoolsTo cultivate and recruit talent and expertise in AI, China has made various efforts in the educational realm. First, a structural transformation in China’s higher educational system has paralleled the adaptation of the AI revolution in industrial sectors.16 Already, 43 universities have dedicated new AI departments, with another 35 colleges receiving funds from the Ministry of Education in 2019 to offer AI as majors.17 Academic conferences and seminars are held frequently to facilitate the diffusion and proliferation of AI know-how among Chinese academia. These efforts reflect a focus on taking advantage of China’s sizable domestic human capital base to create a pipeline of talent for the future.18Foreign material and human resources are being leveraged, as well. Thousands of foreign experts, typically university professors with specialties in different applied aspects of AI, are recruited through the “Recruitment Program of Global Experts” by Chinese institutions.19 Partnerships with foreign universities and collaborative arrangements with foreign companies like the Fudan University-Google Technology Innovation Lab were formed. China was poised to “overtake the US in the most-cited 50% of papers” in 2019,20 which displays the success of China’s efforts to overtake the United States in AI research.3. “Going Out” StrategyIn the process of building up indigenous capacity, China also continues to encourage its enterprises and students to pursue a “going out” strategy.21 This approach includes overseas mergers and acquisitions, equity investments, venture capital, and the establishment of research and development centers abroad, as well as sponsorship of study abroad programs.22Large investment consortia play a crucial role in funding Chinese and joint AI start-ups. According to CB Insights, China-based investors have engaged in tech investments amounting to $19 billion in the United States, across 641 different deals, with particular focus on AI, robotics, and augmented or virtual reality since 2012.23 China’s AI companies are also encouraged to maintain overseas labs in order to gauge local markets and access foreign research talent. Baidu, for example, runs a Silicon Valley AI Lab in Sunnyvale, CA, while Sensentime has an AI-based health lab in New Jersey and collaborates with MIT on machine intelligence. Chinese official agencies, like the China Scholarship Council, in addition to the private sector also provide fellowships to students who enroll in foreign universities to pursue AI-related disciplines.4. Technology TransferTechnology transfer from foreign entities has been an important factor contributing to China’s technological advancement. The major targets for China to acquire technology transfer are foreign companies that desire access to the Chinese market. To get access to Chinese consumers, foreign firms are required to either share their technology and patents or establish joint ventures with Chinese companies or the government; both methods allow China to gain the know-how it wants. Although China continues to take advantage of technology transfer, the role of China’s growing domestic innovation capability is reducing its reliance on this approach.5. Military-Civil FusionGiven the dual-use nature of AI technology and the leading role of the private sector in AI innovation, the capacity of the PLA to take advantage of these technological advancements for military purposes is critical for its ambition to become the “world-class force”.24 Through the national strategy of military-civil fusion, the PLA can rapidly leverage the latest advances in civilian technological fields. This strategic agenda is directed by the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, which is headed by Xi Jinping himself.25Under this framework, mechanisms for communication and coordination among scientific research institutes, universities, enterprises, and military industry units to share AI innovation resources are established and normalized. New joint laboratories are built as collaborations between civilian institutes and the military establishment. North China University of Technology and equipment departments of PLA’s army, navy, and rocket force founded the Military-Civil Fusion Intelligent Equipment Research Institute.26 Tsinghua University established its Military-Civil Fusion National Defense Peak Technologies Laboratory. Meanwhile, a selection of the latest AI-enabled products from private enterprises has already been procured and is currently being used by the Chinese military. For instance, PLA’s surveillance and image processing systems are reinforced by intelligent security monitors produced by Hikvision.276. China’s Structural and Institutional AdvantagesChina’s rapid rise and future trajectory in AI could be enabled by policies mentioned above, which stimulate the potential of China’s structural and systemic advantages. On a structural level, the totalistic system increases the ruling regime’s ability to exercise control and direct the socioeconomic field.28 Combined with the powerful mobilization capacity of the CCP, a huge amount of material and human resources is allocated to AI-related projects. Public institutes and private companies are ordered to concentrate their efforts on AI. To exploit synergies of this dual-use technology, close collaboration between academics, industry, and the PLA enables a critical edge for implementing and operationalizing the latest advances.29 From a demographic aspect, China’s huge population provides it with advantages on two dimensions: human resources and data resources. First, reinforced by educational arrangements, a giant human capital pool is being generated for AI talent recruitment. Second, the availability of massive amounts of data, which is crucial for machine learning, means that China has control of more than 20 percent of strategic resources in the information era.30CHINA’S APPLICATION OF AI TECHNOLOGY TO MILITARY AFFAIRSPLA strategists and academics have characterized current trends as the advent of a new military revolution, in which AI and related technologies are changing the metrics for military power. China’s military application of AI includes, but is not limited to, developing unmanned intelligent combat systems, enhancing battlefield situational awareness and decision-making, conducting multi- domain offense and defense, and facilitating advanced training, simulation, and wargaming practices. More importantly, the PLA is undergoing organizational reform and doctrine adaptation to determine how to operate AI-enabled platforms and wage intelligentized warfare in an effective manner.1. Unmanned Intelligent Combat SystemsAmong the different military applications of AI, Beijing has placed the greatest emphasis on unmanned systems. The PLA is pursuing the development of intelligent unmanned vehicles, platforms, and weapons with the expectation that they will disrupt traditional ways to wage wars.31 In recent years, many Chinese-designed unmanned vehicles and systems have been commissioned in the PLA. Multiple variants of the Caihong (“Rainbow,” CH) family of high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles have been used for reconnaissance and strike missions. In October 2019, WZ-8, a high-altitude super-speed stealth reconnaissance UAV, and Sharp Sword-11, a large stealth strike drone, was demonstrated during the military parade on National Day,32 revealing PLA’s rapid progress in developing intelligent UAVs. Moreover, an unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle, HSU-001, was also showcased in the parade.In addition to designing high-performance unmanned systems, Chinese military strategists are exploring innovative ways to employ these weapons. Learning from the U.S. experience of deploying drones for air strike missions and without sufficient gunships, the PLA assigned UAVs to the company level of its ground forces to provide close air support. PLA scholars have also written on the role of unmanned systems in anti-submarine warfare, airborne operations, and amphibious landing missions.33 34 35 The “swarming” concept has also been intensively studied to enable the collaborative operation of a large group of unmanned systems in a complicated electromagnetic environment.36 Besides emulating the successful experience of advanced militaries, the PLA is also interested in pursuing anti-UAV countermeasures to offset the first-move advantage of other countries.37The PLA may also incorporate AI to existing combat platforms, especially obsolete weapons, to build an “army of none”. Thousands of China’s retired second- and third- generation jet fighters like the J-7 and the J-8 can be modified to build an unmanned air fleet by installing AI-enabled self- navigation technology and autonomous combat systems that automatically pursue, distinguish, and destroy enemy targets. Given the air combat capacity of the original platforms, employment of such unmanned intelligent systems will not only take advantage of swarm systems’ low cost and overwhelming scale, but also be superior to swarms consisting of normal drones. This approach gives the Chinese military a huge asymmetric advantage with which the PLA can eliminate strategic targets while avoiding high personnel losses.38Reinforced by AI-enabled technology, speed and accuracy can be enhanced in battlefield reconnaissance, surveillance, and communication; electronic inference and radar deception; combat assessment; and fire guidance.39 As a result of the improvement of real-time situational awareness and decision- making on the battlefield, PLA’s three basic warfare elements—shooting, communication, and movement,—will be significantly strengthened.40First, the accuracy and frequency of weapon systems’ firing will be enhanced by advances in situational awareness capacity. Applied AI technology such as image and voice recognition can be used for target detection and acquisition. Hikvision’s surveillance cameras, which are able to identify potential adversarial targets automatically, may be installed on aerial weapons. By developing deep-learning methods, intelligent missiles and shells can be produced to identify targets and their weakness, evade interceptors and conduct end-phase maneuvering, which will bolster both the first-strike and retaliatory capacities of the PLA. More importantly, intensive sensors facilitated by machine learning technology will process the intelligence they capture at a flashing speed so that the time between identifying targets and attacking targets is radically reduced, increasing the rate of fire.41 In other words, situational awareness capabilities strengthened by AI will not only accelerate the traditional OODA loop but also make a “storm of steel” fired by autonomous vehicles and intelligent weapons possible.Second, installing AI systems will change the way PLA moves and maneuvers on the battlefield. In a world that is becoming one giant sensor, hiding and penetrating will be far more difficult.42 In such conditions, AI technology will help identify the weaknesses of enemy defense lines and improve routine planning by enhancing situational awareness capacity. With the intelligent analysis of geographic terrain and enemies’ posture enabled by deep learning, PLA troops can determine the safest route to maneuver to the frontline and penetrate the opponent’s defenses.Logistical support departments can manage unmanned platforms to more efficiently distribute supplies and materials based on real-time intelligence.43 44In terms of battlefield communication, AI technology is both an enabler and a beneficiary. On the one hand, intelligent distribution across the communication spectrum to maintain a complex electromagnetic environment secures the network connection among different combat branches. The development of intelligent electronic warfare equipment will help counter rival jamming and interference to communication.45 On the other hand, with the ultra-high-rate, ultra-large-capacity, and ultra-low-latency of next-generation technology like 5G, data and orders can be transferred stably and quickly between the cloud and connection terminals. Future intelligent systems based on 5G technology can more efficiently collect, transmit, and process massive battlefield data, providing real-time data analysis results for commanders.46Last and most importantly, the processing application of AI’s super data fusion and intelligence analysis will help militaries more accurately and quickly interpret information,47 which could enable the PLA to gain mastery of battlefield command and control (C2) and improve decision-making. In an era that is overloaded by the high volume of information, a new challenge facing the Chinese military is the effective processing of huge amounts of raw intelligence and the accurate interpretation of the real meaning behind information flows. Deep learning technology is likely to substantially increase the efficiency and accuracy of interpreting patterns in raw intelligence so that enemies’ intents and actions can be better understood. The introduction of machine learning algorithms to the analysis process for satellite imagery and other sensors can enable a “prediction revolution” that could support PLA’s early warning capabilities.48 For instance, AI start-up iFlytek’s voice recognition and synthesis module technology are useful for communication surveillance and radio sensing.3. Multi-domain Offense and DefenseWhile the United States begins to incorporate the concept of multiple-domain operations to its AirSea Battle doctrine to counter China’s Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capability in the Western Pacific,49 China is also increasing its focus on cultivating versatile capacity in unconventional domains and strengthening cross-domain deterrence. With the reinforcement of AI, both offensive and defensive capabilities of the Chinese military on nuclear, cyber, and space domains will be consolidated and improved.China regards nuclear capabilities as one of the pillars of great powers. Applied neural networks and machine learning can bolster the PLA’s offensive and defensive capabilities in the nuclear domain. According to SIPRI’s survey, China’s domestic and international cross-institute collaboration in the pursuit of the benefits of integrating neural networks with hypersonic glide vehicles has become increasingly common.50 Such applications, including automatic target recognition, auto-piloting, missile fusion, and precision guidance for hypersonic platforms, will enhance the maneuverability and penetration capacity of nuclear missiles, thereby reshaping conventional and nuclear deterrence dynamics.51 On the defensive side, the situational awareness capacity enhanced by AI technology can strengthen China’s nuclear retaliatory capabilities by improving early-warning and missile defense systems. Operating at machine speeds through the deployment of autonomous interception systems can protect nuclear arsenal and missile bases when facing saturation strikes.52 Application of automation-enabled launch-on-warning to its missiles can strengthen the credibility of China’s retaliation and the principle of mutual vulnerability it seeks.53The PLA seeks to leverage big data analytics, machine learning, and automation to enhance the defense of critical military and civilian networks and scale the effects of offensive cyber operations.54 The victory of AlphaGo inspired Chinese strategists; since well-trained AI programs can innovate new tactics in go games, they should also be able to create new, previously unimaginable ways to conduct cyber-attacks. The offensive advantage in cyberspace stems from the limitation of human logic to detect systemic weakness. However, by utilizing technology such as pattern recognition and deep learning, AI can not only be helpful for detecting the vulnerability of enemies’ networks but can also assist the protection of friendly systems by detecting loopholes that need to be fixed. The PLA’s Strategic Support Forces’ (SSF) Information Engineering University has developed methods to identify and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks through pattern matching, statistical analysis, and machine learning. A prediction path for cybersecurity based on deep learning has been formulated by researchers from the National University of Defense Technology.55 Further, the PLA can profile targets and customize operations to shape, guide, and control individuals’ ideas and emotions based on intelligent analysis, which can be advantageous in psychological warfare.564. Training, Simulation, and WargamingThe PLA will likely take advantage of AI to increase the sophistication of its simulations, war-gaming, and drills.57 Due to the lack of opportunities for Chinese commanders and soldiers to gain actual combat experience, the PLA’s new combat-oriented training places great emphasis on simulation and software-based wargaming. More importantly, the PLA is accustomed to investigating emerging concepts and testing new weapons through simulation. Therefore, the PLA has great incentive to integrate AI technology with its computerized wargames and military simulators to “enhance the level of realism and create an artificially intelligent ‘Blue Force’”.58 In recent years, several wargaming contests involving human-machine confrontations have been held by the National Defense University’s Joint Operation College and the National University of Defense Technology’s Systemic Engineering Department.5. Organizational reform and doctrine transformationEmerging technologies only make military revolution and ascension of military capabilities possible. To realize their full potential, these technologies must be incorporated into new processes and executed through a new organizational structure. In the case of Chinese military, its organizational reform launched in 2015 and doctrine adaptation may ensure its employment of AI technology is fitting for the future of intelligentized war.First, the PLA underwent a comprehensive reform of its force structure, which can reshape its capability to win intelligentized warfare. The most significant measure has been the establishment of its SSF. According to the Chinese Ministry of Defense, SSF “comprises supporting forces for battlefield environment, information communications, information security, and new technology testing.”59 In intelligentized warfare, the SSF would operate AI- enabled platforms to provide other branches of the Chinese military with sound situational awareness and support decision-making through rapid intelligence processing. As the new basic combat unit among PLA ground forces, integrated brigades distribute strategic support teams at the battalion level. These teams are responsible for operating UAVs and other intelligent systems to enhance the intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and long-range strike capabilities of small units. Furthermore, the Chinese military also reorganized its affiliated research institutes and military universities and adjusted its recruitment policy to realize better management and allocation of human capital.When it comes to combat doctrine, the adaptation is moderate. One observer argues that the PLA “could prove less averse to the prospect of taking humans out of the loop” because “Chinese discussions about keeping a human in the loop in technical writings remain limited to nonexistent.”60 However, the PLA’s way of fighting is rooted deeply in a strong strategic culture arguing that human beings are the ultimate determination of war. Although new concepts like “intelligence dominance” and “algorithm-centric warfare” have appeared in official military writings recently, the PLA is still forming a coherent doctrine that mitigates the conflict between AI’s trend to keep humans out of the loop and its own military culture emphasizing the role of humans.61 In fact, some patterns of AI-based combat align with Chinese approaches to war. For instance, swarm tactics, which use a large amount of low-cost unmanned systems to saturate enemies, are similar to the guerilla tactics that the Chinese troops used in WWII.It should be noted China’s weaponization of AI is also occurring in the information and psychological domain. The PLA’s strategists have begun to discuss how to win on cognitive dimension and seize “metal/cognitive domination” (制脑权) in future warfare.62 On the one hand, polymeric technology, which combines brain science, biological technology, and artificial intelligence, will not only improve soldiers’ cognitive ability but also create an effective brain-machine interface, which may make some sci-fi super soldiers possible. Additionally, advanced intelligent algorithms can be used to fight a war in the realm of propaganda. By promoting domestic cohesion through the control of public opinion and disruption of opponents’ efforts to influence the Chinese press, AI will engage this new dimension of the “people’s war” in the information era.SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF CHINESE MILITARY’S EMPLOYMENT OF AIChina’s development of AI and its application of such technologies to military affairs impacts on many regional and international issues. This article focuses on the Western Pacific, where most of China’s major security concerns and the potential flashpoints for future military confrontation are centered. For a region that is already tense and crowded, a regional competition for AI primacy may trigger an AI arms race and pose an ambiguous effect on arms control concerning autonomous lethal weapon systems. The PLA's efforts to enhance nuclear capabilities through AI will have both stabilizing and destabilizing influence on strategic stability. Ultimately, the introduction of AI to the modern battlefield may help China tip the military balance, but its potential to change the essence of armed conflict and the way in which war is waged is limited.1. Arms Race and Arms ControlSome voices in China are calling upon the Chinese government to avoid an AI arms race. While it is hard to define whether the struggle for technological primacy fits the definition of an arms race, the competition among actors in the Western Pacific for advanced AI technology has already intensified. South Korea has allocated many resources to research AI-based command systems, aviation training systems, and object-tracking techniques.63 Other efforts made by Seoul to militarize AI technology include works on the Exobrain and ADAMs projects for the potential enhancement of C4ISR, virtual combat exercises, and self-navigation algorithms.64 Even though its general technological capabilities are nascent, North Korea engages in the competition by focusing on some aspects of AI that can be used to elevate its current military operations. It has been suggested that Kim Il Sung University and the Korea Computer Center have advanced the Ryongnamsan 5.1 speech-recognition systems, audio classification, and deep fakes to reinforce cyber aggressions.65China’s rapid progress in AI and its military application have encouraged such competition and may trigger a potential arms race in two ways. First, the PLA’s increasing military power facilitated by its application of AI technology has already activated a security dilemma, especially concerning China’s increasing assertiveness in territorial disputes and growing ambitions about the regional order. The PLA’s employment of AI-enabled early-warning systems and unmanned intelligent combat vehicles will enhance China’s awareness of Japanese and South Korean operations in disputed areas like the Senkaku Islands and enable a quick response capability. From the perspective of other countries in the region, China’s willingness to escalate in such scenarios will increase because its AI technology would provide it with a decisive advantage in a conflict with limited costs, despite increasing the potential of accidental escalation.66 Other countries’ have begun to pursue more defense measures, a move that reflects concern about China’s potential threat, including the development of weapon-grade AI technology. Such defensive measures suggest that tensions triggered by the security dilemma in the region will be more complicated and expand beyond an AI arms race. Nuclear proliferation, targeting civilian infrastructure that supports AI technology, and more cyber aggression may be seen in this context.Second, China’s success in influencing U.S. strategic calculation and military posture by military employment of AI may encourage other countries to copy its success. Other countries who see themselves as adversaries of the United States may be motivated to increase AI investment and attempt to install related technology to their missiles to exercise coercion and threats. For U.S. allies like Japan, the introduction of AI in early-warning, situational awareness, and intelligence processing may not only help reduce reliance on U.S. extended deterrence, but also strengthen their ability to counter regional rivals like China and North Korea.Thus, the proliferation of AI technology, especially those can be weaponized, poses challenges to the arms control community in the region. Given the highly dual-use nature of AI, civilian AI technology cooperation between countries may contribute to the unintentional proliferation of destructive AI systems, a situation which is similar to the dual-use dilemma of nuclear cooperation.67 On the practical level, weapon-, behavior-, or country-focused controls will face different problems ranging from how to define controlled weapons to how to verify the control measures.68 On the political level, countries' attitudes toward AI arms control are ambiguous. In 2018, China demonstrated its “desire to negotiate and conclude” a new protocol for the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to ban the use of autonomous lethal weapons systems.69 However, the delegation stressed that the ban should only apply to the use of such weapons, and not to their development, revealing China’s actual misgivings regarding arms control for autonomous systems.702. Strategic Stability and Nuclear RiskNuclear strategic stability is understood as “a state of affairs in which countries are confident that their adversaries would not be able to undermine their nuclear deterrence capability” using nuclear, conventional, cyber or other means.71 Given the dynamics of nuclear posture of major powers in the region and the potential role of nuclear escalation in certain scenarios, AI-enabled improvement of the PLA’s multi-domain operation capabilities has both destabilizing and stabilizing impacts on strategic stability.China has long been concerned about false negatives from its early warning systems, which may result in failures to detect nuclear attacks.72 To some extent, such concerns are rooted in China’s assumptions about its own early warning deficiencies and its own inability to counter a stealthy and prompt precision strike from the United States.73 Regarding China’s employment of nuclear weapons, military-technology considerations stressing the plausible U.S. conventional military operation against Chinese nuclear capabilities are the reasons behind China’s use of limited nuclear escalation.74 As a result, if China gains greater situational awareness and can strengthen its nuclear retaliatory capabilities by applying AI technology to its C4ISR and early- warning systems, some of its insecurities about a “bolt-out-of-the-blue” strike may be mitigated, which will stabilize the nuclear risk.75Yet China’s insecurities are not simply a question of technology. The key factors are China’s perception of U.S. nuclear posture and its assumption of U.S. intent. In this sense, China’s use of AI and autonomy for nuclear offense and defense could take on destabilizing qualities. For Beijing, the prospect of the United States resuming a forward-deployed, tactical nuclear posture exacerbates its sense of encirclement. The issuance of the 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review worsens the context. China views the documents’ focus on ballistic missile defense and conventional prompt global strike as preemptive and destabilizing.76 Additionally, the proposal for the enlargement of the U.S. arsenal of low-yield submarine-launched ballistic and cruise missiles and the concept of using nuclear coercion to preemptively de-escalate a conventional conflict like Taiwan scenario further elicit Chinese concerns over U.S. intent. AI and autonomous technology offer Beijing the potential to respond to such a posture. China could deploy swarms to track and intercept U.S. dual- capable platforms. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, an escalatory scenario could develop. While the PLA’s deployment of advanced AI-enabled early warning systems and automation-enabled launch-on-fire missiles may mitigate China’s fear of false negatives, it may intensify U.S. concerns about false positives,such as a nuclear war caused by accidental fire or false detection.3. Military Balance and Future WarfareAI is helpful for enhancing battlefield situational awareness, especially reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) technology;77 a key element for the PLA’s A2/AD capabilities. China’s military application of AI technology will not only reinforce the RSTA component of its A2/AD system but also add a new dimension to the implementation of this strategy.According to Biddle and Oelrich, military advantages provided by A2/ AD are only strong over controlled landmasses and weaken over greater distances due to the change of “RSTA’s effectiveness with the complexity of the background against which it must detect targets.”78 For instance, the effectiveness and detection range of radar, which is “the most robust solution to the demands of sensing mobile targets over wide areas,”79 is limited by multiple elements ranging from Earth’s curvature to its defenders’ survivability. Mobile sensors like early-warning aircraft and seaborne radars are almost exposed to enemies’ fire because of the low-complexity of their background. While such RSTA systems’ effectiveness decreases when far away from landmasses and makes them vulnerable to enemies’ attacks, the capabilities of A2/AD’s fire solutions, like long-range missiles, will be dramatically weakened. Nevertheless, AI technology offers methods to solve these problems. First, rapid data processing reduces the time needed for radars to maintain operating status.Vulnerable sensors can be shut down and concealed before enemy firepower approaches. Second, fixed high-power radars are no longer the only solution for long-range RSTA. Swarms of intelligent UAVs and UUVs can be sent to open airspace and sea to conduct reconnaissance missions. Every vehicle in such a system is an intelligence-gathering and analysis hub, which means collection and processing can be finished on the same end. This unmanned tactic is superior to the traditional OODA-style way of fighting in terms of low cost and high efficiency. Furthermore, unmanned intelligent combat systems like modified unmanned J-8 can replace long-range missiles strike to be the main strike choice. Combined with other technological progress, like a new aircraft carrier that uses electromagnetic launch systems to allow quick delivery of UAV fleets, the PLA’s A2/AD capabilities will be significantly strengthened and might ultimately help China realize its ambition for regional “command of the commons"".80This trend of increasing Chinese military power resulted from the application of AI to the national defense field; however, it will not change the essence of armed conflict and the methods of waging war. AI itself is an enabler, like a combustion engine and electricity, as opposed to a weapon.81The function of AI in military affairs is to enhance the capacity of existing systems and platforms in terms of speed and efficiency, rather than “turning a stone to a gold”. AI can speed up war, but it cannot change the essence of war.82 As a result, the nature and performance of original weapon systems still matter. More importantly, wide deployment of AI-based systems still faces some serious challenges. First and foremost, a huge volume of high-quality data is required to train AI algorithms and enable machine learning. On the one hand, war-related data is sensitive and not easy to access. On the other hand, it is very difficult to code some elements of warfare into machine- readable quantitative data. Second, when AI algorithms run at flash speeds, it is extremely challenging for other military hardware to keep up with them. To make sure those hardware can keep pace with AI programs, stable ultra-speed communication and comprehensive data-link networks are indispensable. The PLA still needs to enhance the interconnectedness among its units and organs, develop next-generation communications technology, and establish reliable and secure data links. These requirements echo China’s prioritization of 5G, block chain, and quantum computing. Furthermore, radical advance and improvement in basic physics and machinery engineering should be achieved to optimize the performance of original hardware. Third, scientists still find it challenging to understand the behavior of AI, creating a risk of unreliability.83 Armed forces like the PLA, which take such issues very seriously, will be very cautious in the deployment and employment of AI-based systems if they cannot ensure their battlefield reliability and political loyalty.84ENDNOTES1  Michael C.

Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management seems inevitable. However, there are some concerns, such as the time and resources required to implement AI, and the limitations it poses in communicating important variables like company culture and so on, writes Frank Hamilton Freelance writer.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has earned its place in the world of business and does not look to be backing out anytime soon. The revolutionary tech has brought about game-changing developments that have thickened the margin lines, especially in the discipline of Human Resource Management (HR).
Giving its knack for accuracy and its effectiveness with time, the future for Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management seems inevitable. However, there are some concerns, such as the time and resources required to implement AI, and the limitations it poses in communicating important variables like company culture and so on.
There are several benefits as well as disadvantages of implementing Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management. The topic has generated debate in recent years; who have been the primary benefactors, and who has not been so happy with the development?However, for companies that are considering whether or not to implement Artificial Intelligence for their Human Resource Department, it is essential to take into consideration your company’s goals because this will significantly influence the decision reached.

Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence
Here we will discuss the key areas that concern Artificial Intelligence with respect to Human Resource Management.
Employee Hiring
A company, being a team is only as efficient as its weakest member. However, searching for the first-class talent that meets the all-round demands of your organization is never an easy task. However, with the proficiency and time management effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence through Digital Hiring TechnologyOpens a new window , this can quickly become a simple process. However, this remedy does come with its own pitfalls.

Pros: Implementing Artificial intelligence in the employee hiring process rules out the issue of human bias. Unlike the human nature that is prone to a degree of bias during employee hiring, Artificial Intelligence can seamlessly sort out, screen, and delegate qualified candidates to appropriate roles within the organization in little or no time without the problem of human bias.
Cons: Although Artificial Intelligence can do a clean job at recruiting without human bias, they may not be able to weigh and implement important variables such as company culture and similar company values during decision making.

Also, as Artificial Intelligence systems are designed to learn from the user, an AI system can also “learn” to be biased. There was a case study of Amazon’s AI system favoring male candidates over female candidates; hence, the company had to put it away and resort for better digital hiring solutions.
Employee-Engagement
Clear communication is a necessity, especially for larger companies. Success in this area helps a company to optimize its performance objectives and grow towards the company ideal.

Pros: the process of employee engagement can be automated through Artificial Intelligence. The system can perform intelligent surveys and gather feedback in real-time. AI can also perform Personalized Internal Communication directly with employees instead of the traditional issuing of survey sheets; Artificial intelligence can provide the management with an all in one and detailed picture of the various challenges each employee is facing at work.
Cons: there may still be a need for human interaction as the system may not completely exhaust all the challenges faced by each individual.

Learning and Staff Development 
One of the major responsibilities of the Human Resource Management department is Staff Development; in terms of educating them on the new programs, new procedures, tools, and so on, associated with their role in the organization. Artificial Intelligence, like an Effective Learning Management SystemOpens a new window , can be instrumental in smoothening the process and progress of learning for all employees.

Pros – through eLearning, Artificial Intelligence can be used to educate staff rapidly and effectively. The system can also monitor and evaluate each employee’s performance to ensure that no employee is declining in the learning process so that the team completes each phase together and on time.
Cons – this process may further dwindle human connection, which is vital for staff, especially if they’re working as a team.

Automated FAQs
Human Resource Department is usually faced with the responsibility of responding to the same or similar queries all the time. For instance, queries concerning Paycheque, Holidays, and such are all duties of the Human Resource department; the loop can become dull and time-wasting. AI can be programmed to handle these FAQs.

Pros: Artificial Intelligence can be automated to attend to frequently asked questions, thereby saving a lot of time. Chatbots and virtual assistants are the most popular solutions for cases of this nature. They help leverage time and can be depended upon to answer all the time accurately.
Cons: it has become well known that chatbots can easily get hacked. This ultimately compromises the security of any sensitive information given by an employee, and can also become an avenue for unforeseen cyber attacks.

Human Capital Management 
Finding and recruiting top-notch talent is only one part of the job. Afterward, employees need to be followed up, natured, and given adequate assistance so that they grow individually and within the organization.
If an employee does not feel like they are making headway both in their careers and personal lives, then there is a considerable chance that they will choose another profession. Artificial Intelligence can be automated to assist the Human Resource department in ensuring that employees grow persistently both individually and in their careers.

Pros – Artificial Intelligence through Automated Employee SurveysOpens a new window  can assist Human Resource departments in ascertaining how well each staff is doing based on their performance in an individual set of tasks that define their roles in the company. This can be achieved through automated performance analysis. This will help to direct employee’s career paths and optimize the working force in the company.
Cons – the system can get hacked and risk losing sensitive data.

Conclusion
There are several practical applications of Artificial Intelligence with respect to Human Resource Management. In fact, artificial intelligence can be automated to assist hand in hand with the human resource management department throughout the employee lifecycle. However, there are also downsides that could cause fatal problems if the system is not programmed or managed correctly. The subject of Artificial Intelligence is far from complete; as with any other profitable business decision, it is a risk that should be taken with adequate consideration.

Seeing tablets and drones on the same work sites as hard hats and safety vests is common.Now helmet-mounted cameras capture footage of a site to orchestrate when new crews or materials should arrive, and precise sensors can detect whether a new window is a few millimeters off the project blueprint and needs to be adjusted. And A.I. is starting to be used in buying and selling real estate: JLL, a global broker, recently introduced its own chatbot to provide insights to its clients.This expanded analysis of data is laying the groundwork for what many hope will be substantial improvements in accuracy, speed and efficiency by reducing the bloated timelines and waste that have made construction increasingly costly.“The construction industry is the largest in the world, in terms of dollars spent, yet we are the least productive in terms of technological adoption and productivity gains,” said David Jason Gerber, a University of Southern California professor whose research focuses on advanced technology in construction.But the industry’s embrace of A.I. technology faces challenges, including concerns over accuracy and hallucinations, in which a system provides an answer that is incorrect or nonsensical.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnd further data collection has been a knotty problem, in large part because of the nature of huge construction projects: No two developments are the same, with wildly varying topography and local regulations, and new teams of contractors and subcontractors coming together for each project. It’s akin to starting a multimillion-dollar business for every sizable project.ImageAt a construction site for South Station Tower in Boston, robots are maneuvered by remote control.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageThe site also uses technology like helmet-mounted cameras to track the progress of the project.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageA robot created by Boston Dynamics is among the artificial intelligence technology tools used at the site.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesCoordinating the complex ballet of supplies, labor and timetables remains a daunting task. But start-ups and investors see an opportunity, especially as machine learning models, which ingest enormous amounts of data to discern patterns and predict how similar situations will progress, are used to improve project performance.The pandemic had already pushed construction firms to adopt more digital tools to allow them to work on site during lockdowns, accelerating the development of new technology, said Sarah Liu, a partner at Fifth Wall, a venture capital firm focused on real estate investments.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The best companies aren’t touting themselves as A.I. companies,” she said. “They’re touting themselves as problem-solving companies.”The construction consulting firm nPlan, led by Dev Amratia, who helped draft Britain’s national artificial intelligence strategy, uses complex algorithms to map out the progress of vast infrastructure projects and avoid mistakes or supply gaps. Its machine learning system was trained on a database of more than 740,000 projects.The firm’s largest project to date, a $11 billion overhaul of railroad infrastructure in Northern England, will use the lessons gleaned from studying that vast array of projects to create detailed, real-time project maps for builders, which is expected to shave up to 5 percent off the total cost.Buildots, a start-up in Israel that provides project management guidance via wearable cameras that analyze building progress, signed a deal for its first New York project, a mixed-use development in Manhattan. The firm commissioned a study of 64 international building sites, and it found that just 46 percent of the average work site was being used at any time, evidence of poor organization and scheduling.“At the best construction site we’ve studied, progress varied by 30 percent each week,” said Aviv Leibovici, the firm’s chief product officer and a co-founder. “I think there are massive inefficiencies in this industry.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTConstruction firms have also made significant investment in their in-house technology. Avison Young’s Project Management Services division claims its proprietary software and management programs can, on average, cut development time 20 percent.ImageThe 51-story development in Boston is being built with the aid of programs that can even predict accidents.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesAn affiliate of Suffolk, a large construction firm based in Boston, invested $110 million to fund construction start-ups, and Suffolk has a team of 30 data analysts collecting and scrutinizing information from job sites. At a construction site for South Station Tower in Boston, a 51-story development by Hines, cranes have cameras that document and label steel being used on the building’s frame, creating a data set expected to be used on other projects in the future. Additional programs are being used to track progress and even predict accidents.“We have zero unemployment in the industry; technology is just going to help existing workers do more,” said John Fish, chairman and chief executive of Suffolk. “A.I. is just going to replace the companies that don’t use A.I.”There is trepidation about A.I., and its reported issues with accuracy, being used in an industry where safety is so important. Programs like ChatGPT have an unfortunate tendency to occasionally make up answers based on incorrect predictions, said Julien Moutte, chief technology officer at Bentley Systems, a construction software firm.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“In infrastructure, this is something we can’t afford,” he said. “We can’t have A.I. hallucinate the design of a bridge.”But the purported ability to work faster and cheaper has proved attractive. Dusty Robotics, a tech firm in Mountain View, Calif., develops autonomous devices to trace building blueprints on construction sites, a job typically done by hand. While researching the industry, the company’s chief executive, Tessa Lau, observed workers measuring out plans with chalk and tape; some workers had even tried taping pens to Roombas.Ms. Lau was worried about the reaction that laborers would have to robots and A.I. encroaching on their job site. But in an industry desperate to attract younger workers, offering potential apprentices the ability to use drones and robots can help with recruitment and retention.ImageCarpenters learning how to use a robot created by Dusty Robotics.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesImageA reflector is positioned to align the robot to a laser.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesImageThe union training site in Pleasanton is used to help carpenters hone their skills and learn new ones, like robotics.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesTony Hernandez, a union carpentry trainer in Northern California who teaches apprentices to use drones and Dusty robots, sees these technologies as “just another tool.” He prefers the robot to trace lines instead of having to bend down and trace himself, meaning less wear and tear on his knees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“This is a great retention tool,” he said. “It’s brought in kids who grew up on Xbox and can figure out these tools in a five-hour class.”Dusty has 120 units on sites across the United States, but that is just the beginning. Ms. Lau calls the units, which can collect gigabytes of data, “Trojan horses to train the A.I.s of the future.”Reducing risk may ultimately be where this technology makes its mark. Depending on the location and nature of work, insurance can make up as much as 10 percent of the cost of a single project, which can easily be hundreds of millions of dollars. Now, with A.I. providing better ways to keep on task, there is less risk and cheaper insurance options.Shepherd, an insurance start-up, uses construction data to provide contractors with cheaper premiums. Wint, an Israeli start-up that uses proprietary sensors and algorithms to eliminate water damage, which leads to roughly a third of damage claims on construction sites, has been used on roughly 2,500 projects. A study by Munich Re found Wint can cut the loss rate 90 percent.“Insurance costs can be the difference between whether or not projects are able to be sustainably financed,” said Justin Levine, a co-founder and the chief executive of Shepherd.A correction was made on Aug. 15, 2023: An earlier version of this article misspelled the give name of the chief technology officer at Bentley Systems.

The Generative AI Revolution Is Underway
By Brent Orrell
AEIdeas
August 15, 2023



FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for artificial intelligence, with the rise of generative AI poised to transform industries and reshape workforces. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI confirms the increasing market penetration of tools like DALL-E and ChatGPT and outlines how workers and employers see the technology affecting work patterns in the coming years. 
One-third of survey respondents say their organizations are using generative AI regularly in at least one business function. Respondents across regions, industries, and seniority levels say they are already incorporating generative AI tools into their business.


Marketing, sales, product development, and customer service operations are the top functions using generative AI. Common use cases include drafting text, personalized marketing, identifying trends in customer needs, and using customer service chatbots.
The organizations achieving the most value from AI—what the survey calls “AI high performers”—are using generative AI in product development and supply chain management. These leading companies are also twice as likely to see generative AI’s top benefit as creating new revenue streams rather than reducing costs.
Workers and organizations expect generative AI to change work. Three-quarters of respondents expect AI to cause significant or disruptive change in their industries within three years, with tech and financial services companies predicting the most change. Disruption, however, does not necessarily imply displacement. As shown below, the disruptive impact is much more likely to manifest as reskilling than in job loss. Nearly four in 10 firms expect to reskill over 20 percent of employees in the next three years to help current workers adapt to AI. The Forbes Technology Council recently identified 20 new business roles—from prompt engineering to AI ethics to AI output verification—that will add to business headcounts.




The survey also suggests that many organizations are unprepared for the widespread use of generative AI. Since McKinsey’s previous survey, the same 55 percent or so of organizations have adopted AI, typically in just one to two functions like product development and customer service. And just 23 percent of respondents say that at least 5 percent of their organizations’ earnings last year is attributable to their use of AI—essentially the same as the previous survey. These results suggest that AI use remains limited in scope and there is significant room to capture value through improved efficiency, productivity, and labor substitution.
In a couple areas, AI implementation is experiencing significant lags. Though hiring for AI-related roles has become somewhat easier in the past year, the demand for data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers continues to outstrip supply, and talent development and recruitment remains challenging.


Lastly, just 21 percent of firms have established formal policies for governing employee use of generative AI, creating something of a Wild West of AI use in offices. As the chart below shows, many organizations are worried about AI risks, such as generating inaccurate information, cybersecurity, and intellectual property infringement, but they are largely unprepared to address them. This pattern will undoubtedly lead to some misuse and challenges that we can expect to hear about in (sometimes) amusing and (usually) breathless media coverage of the always-forthcoming-never-quite-here AI apocalypse.


The overall message of this and other recent reports is three-fold. It remains very early days for generative AI; the big effects are still over the horizon. Second, contrary to some of the worst fears about employment impacts, in the short- and medium-term, the biggest effects are likely to be felt in upskilling rather than in worker displacements. Finally, the most important longer-term impact seems to be that AI will create more, higher-value, and higher-skill job opportunities than it destroys. It’s not an easy path but with proper support from employers and government, the benefits of AI are likely to significantly outweigh its costs.

As companies race to keep up with the hype around generative, employers are looking to hire workers with deep knowledge of the technology.Since the beginning of this year, the number of listings related to generative AI on the job site Indeed quadrupled, according to data from Indeed obtained by The Wall Street Journal.Without a big enough supply of experienced AI professionals to fill the demand for these roles, US companies are offering competitive six-figure salaries in attempts to woo skilled workers, recruiters told the Journal.

""This is pure market economics,"" Paul J. Groce, a partner at executive recruitment firm Leathwaite, told the Journal. ""We do not magically have thousands of additional AI developers, product managers and everything else.""

Last month, Netflix made headlines for offering up to $900,000 for an AI-focused product manager role amid the actors' and writers' strikes.Dating app Hinge is hiring a VP of artificial intelligence who could earn up to $398,000 a year to lead the app's AI strategy, and Amazon posted a job listing for a senior manager in applied science and generative AI who could land a salary as high as $340,300.It's not just tech companies getting in on the AI hype. Capital One posted a listing for a distinguished engineer of generative AI, offering a salary of up to $325,700, while Walmart is seeking a senior manager for its conversational AI platform who could earn between $168,000 and $252,000 a year.""As advancements take shape, we're creating new jobs and opportunities for associates to learn new skills,"" a Walmart spokesperson said.

Early-to-mid career workers familiar with AI can also cash in — in some cases with nothing more than a college degree.Meta, for instance, posted a job listing for a generative AI research engineer with an annual salary as high as $137,000. The company is seeking recent college grads for the role. And chip giant Nvidia posted an entry-level job opening for a generative AI research scientist. The position has a salary between $156,000 and $247,250.

Amazon, Capital One, Meta, and Nvidia did not respond to Insider's requests for comment when asked for specifics about their AI-focused roles.The growth of generative AI-roles comes as companies warm up to the idea that understanding generative AI tools like ChatGPT may, in fact, be a skill that can improve products and boost productivity.

In June, Crossover, a search engine for remote jobs, closed applications for a senior director role and a chief product officer role. Both listings offered $800,000 salaries and required that applicants apply ChatGPT to their work.""As this tech is still so new, there is a race to bring on employees with this skill in order for the company to stay cutting edge,"" Stacie Haller, the chief career advisor at job site Resume Builder, told Insider. ""And it looks like companies are willing to pay to do so.""

""We do not magically have thousands of additional AI developers, product managers and everything else.""Last month, Netflix made headlines for offering up to $900,000 for an AI-focused product manager role amid the actors' and writers' strikes.Dating app Hinge is hiring a VP of artificial intelligence who could earn up to $398,000 a year to lead the app's AI strategy, and Amazon posted a job listing for a senior manager in applied science and generative AI who could land a salary as high as $340,300.It's not just tech companies getting in on the AI hype. Capital One posted a listing for a distinguished engineer of generative AI, offering a salary of up to $325,700, while Walmart is seeking a senior manager for its conversational AI platform who could earn between $168,000 and $252,000 a year.""As advancements take shape, we're creating new jobs and opportunities for associates to learn new skills,"" a Walmart spokesperson said.Early-to-mid career workers familiar with AI can also cash in — in some cases with nothing more than a college degree.Meta, for instance, posted a job listing for a generative AI research engineer with an annual salary as high as $137,000. The company is seeking recent college grads for the role. And chip giant Nvidia posted an entry-level job opening for a generative AI research scientist. The position has a salary between $156,000 and $247,250.Amazon, Capital One, Meta, and Nvidia did not respond to Insider's requests for comment when asked for specifics about their AI-focused roles.The growth of generative AI-roles comes as companies warm up to the idea that understanding generative AI tools like ChatGPT may, in fact, be a skill that can improve products and boost productivity.In June, Crossover, a search engine for remote jobs, closed applications for a senior director role and a chief product officer role.

Medora LeeUSA TODAYPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:26AD0:15SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenWhen Carlos Cabrera and his family arrived in the U.S. from Venezuela in 2019 hoping to build a better future, life was challenging at first. Despite having a degree in chemical engineering and years of experience working for a global oil company, he couldn’t find a job to match his skills.Cabrera ended up taking whatever jobs he could to make ends meet – working at a meat factory and Costco, driving a truck and delivering food. Then he had two strokes of luck: a nonprofit organization popped up in a job search, and he discovered artificial intelligence.From there, his life changed. The nonprofit, Upwardly Global, helps immigrants and refugees with internationally recognized certificates, degrees, or work experience restart their careers. They helped Cabrera purchase a laptop and provided him with career training. Then AI helped him hone his resume and cover letters. “I use tech to my advantage,” said Cabrera, for whom English is a second language. He now sends out well-written cover letters that better match his skills to the job descriptions by using ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. Within the last couple of months, he even landed a job as a project manager at a global supplier of energy products and solutions.Is AI changing the job market?Many headlines center around how AI will take over people's jobs. AI has even become a major sticking point among Hollywood actors and writers afraid their work can essentially be used to train AI that can then put them out of a job.However, AI also has the potential to level the playing field for nonnative English speakers applying for jobs by helping them better present themselves to English-speaking employers, research by Emma van Inwegen, a Ph.D. student at MIT's Sloan School of Management, has shown. Between June 8 and July 14, 2021, she studied 480,948 job seekers who applied for jobs that require English to be spoken but who mostly lived in nations where English is not the native language.Of those who used AI, 7.8% were more likely to be hired. They also earned wages that were 8.4% higher than those who didn’t use AI, according to her working paper, co-authored by MIT Sloan Ph.D. student Zanele Munyikwa and MIT Sloan professor John J. Horton. Their research also showed those AI users earned $18.62 per hour on average versus $17.17 per hour for those who had received no resume help.The study also found no evidence employers were less satisfied with workers who used AI to get the job. How can AI benefit businesses?AI can also give small businesses an efficiency and production boost that can help them compete better against companies with deeper pockets. Keeping costs down for small businesses amid high inflation and rising wages has been difficult, but some have found help through AI. Anip Patel, founder of CaPatel Investments, an early stage venture capital firm that invests predominantly in companies that promote South Asian values, says AI has helped his company work more efficiently. Creating brochures and presentations that used to take several days of research and writing can now be done in hours with AI, freeing up time for his assistant to do other work. Of course, he said a human must check the work AI does for accuracy but even with that, the time it takes to complete the project is still significantly less. “It’s good for business owners and making money,” he said. Patel isn't the only one who sees that. Constant Contact, a small-business-focused digital marketing and automation platform, said of the 486 small businesses it surveyed in June, 91% of those using AI said the technology has made their business more successful, and they are using it to regain valuable time in their week, cut down on manual mistakes and grow faster. Additionally, 28% said they expect AI and automation to save them at least $5,000 over the next 12 months.Planning trips:Make travel easy: We tested ChatGPT itineraries in 5 US tourist spotsAs AI improves, will AI make us jobless? In the short term, AI will displace some people, but experts say AI ultimately will create more, though different, jobs and benefit everyone. The World Economic Forum said in October 2020 that while AI would likely eliminate 85 million jobs globally by 2025, it would also generate 97 million new jobs in fields ranging from big data and machine learning to information security and digital marketing.“AI is good for candidates because it helps match the ideal candidate with the right job, which can really benefit everyone,” said Jeremy Schiff, chief executive at RecruitBot, which uses AI to help companies recruit candidates. “People are happier because they’re in the right job, appreciated and valued more. And they don’t have to do 30 interviews and get no job offers.” On the flip side, companies can fill jobs faster. “We are five times more accurate at identifying the right type of person versus the previous approach,” he said. “If hiring managers had to read through 10 resumes then, we only have to read through two now.”  Also, if in the middle of interviewing candidates, a company realizes it needs different skills for a particular job, AI can pivot quickly and start looking for different candidates instead of having to stop, rewrite and repost the job description and wait for a new batch of applicants. “No one is blindly hiring just using AI technology,” Schiff said.

VeleClick to share this pageClick for PDFClick to print this pageSeyfarth Synopsis: Last week, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) filed a settlement agreement in a lawsuit that many are calling the EEOC’s “first-ever” artificial intelligence discrimination in hiring lawsuit. The settlement serves as a strong reminder of the EEOC’s ongoing emphasis on AI and algorithmic bias, and a reminder to employers that the results of any technology-assisted screening process should comply with existing civil-rights laws. In this alert, Seyfarth discusses key takeaways from this settlement for all employers, regardless of whether their hiring technology might be characterized as an “artificial intelligence” tool.
The EEOC’s lawsuit, against iTutor Group and its related companies (“iTutor”), involved an employer that hired thousands of tutors in the United States each year to provide online tutoring from their homes or other remote locations. Under the EEOC’s proposed consent decree filed last week, the employer will pay $365,000 to the approximately 200 people who applied for a job in March and April 2020 and who were purportedly rejected because of their age.
While multiple media reports have characterized the EEOC’s iTutor lawsuit as a case involving artificial intelligence, the EEOC’s complaint only alleged that the online job application system requested dates of birth and that the application software automatically rejected female applicants age 55 or older and male applicants age 60 or older. While the EEOC’s complaint and proposed consent decree did not expressly reference artificial intelligence or machine learning, the EEOC’s press release linked the case to its recent Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative as an example of the types of technologies that the EEOC is interested in pursuing. 
To be clear, automatically rejecting older job applicants, when their birthdates are already known, does not require any sort of artificial intelligence or machine learning. However, it is entirely fair to say that the EEOC’s complaint and positioning on the allegations squarely falls within the broader scope of its greater scrutiny of all sorts of technology in hiring, and not just “artificial intelligence.”
EEOC’s iTutor settlement provides an important reminder about how employers must continue to scrutinize their use of any technology, including those that align more closely to “algorithmic fairness,” in this rapidly developing area, given the broader context and scope of the EEOC’s ongoing efforts in this area and attendant media coverage.   
Key Takeaway
The iTutor settlement, and the EEOC’s ongoing emphasis in the area of AI and algorithmic bias, serves as a strong reminder to employers that the results of any technology-assisted screening process should comply with existing civil-rights laws. This reminder applies to both complicated and simple technology. It applies whether an employer is using cutting-edge artificial intelligence products or if its recruiters are simply setting filters on a spreadsheet. A robust compliance and risk management program should periodically evaluate how technology, both sophisticated and simple, is being used in the hiring process to ensure compliance and manage other risks.
Recent Settlements and Enforcement Actions Reach More Than Just Artificial Intelligence
The EEOC's complaint against iTutor focused on the employer’s alleged use of straightforward technology in the context of hiring and job applications. While few employers would characterize the basic technology used by iTutor as “artificial intelligence,” the alleged conduct unquestionably falls into a broader category of violations of existing civil rights laws enabled by technology. The EEOC’s scrutiny of application tracking systems follows similar settlements involving employers using these systems in ways that allegedly violated existing civil-rights laws.
In 2022 and 2023, the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (“IER”) reached settlements with 30 employers, assessing combined civil penalties of over $1.6 million, over the employers’ use of a college recruiting platform operated by the Georgia Institute of Technology (“Georgia Tech”). The first complaint to IER was by a student who was a lawful permanent resident, who observed that an employer’s paid internship posting on the platform was available only to U.S. citizens. IER’s subsequent investigation identified dozens more facially discriminatory postings on the site. IER’s announcement of the settlement confirmed that the website allowed employers to post job advertisements that deterred qualified students from applying for jobs because of their citizenship status, and in many cases also blocked otherwise eligible students from applying, all in violation of the immigration law.
Similarly, on March 20, 2023, the EEOC announced a settlement with a job search website operator. The underlying charge alleged that the website’s customers were posting job ads that discouraged US citizens from applying. The EEOC’s conciliation agreement required the website operator to “scrape” the website for potentially discriminatory keywords such as “OPT”, “H1B” or “Visa” that appeared near the words “only” or “must” in new job postings, in an effort to prevent discriminatory job postings. In other words, the EEOC’s conciliation agreement required the operator to implement a simple keyword filter in an effort to identify potentially discriminatory job postings.
While none of these examples above involve the use of any artificial intelligence, like the EEOC’s iTutor settlement, they unquestionably fall under the broader umbrella of “algorithmic fairness.” In October 2021, EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows announced the EEOC’s “Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative”. Her joint statement of April 25, 2023, joined by the heads of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, emphasizes the agencies’ concern about “harmful uses of automated systems”, not just artificial intelligence. And the EEOC’s draft Strategic Enforcement Plan, published in the Federal Register on January 10, 2023, indicates an enforcement focus on all “automated systems” used in hiring, not just systems that could be characterized as “artificial intelligence”.
Unquestionably, many employers are already using (and others are contemplating using) artificial intelligence as part of their hiring and other HR processes. The EEOC’s iTutor complaint, combined with its ongoing focus and outreach in this area, means that employers’ use of any technology, and not just technology characterized as “artificial intelligence,” is receiving increased scrutiny.
Whether or not technology is properly characterized as “artificial intelligence,” asserting, “The technology forced me to discriminate” will never be an effective affirmative defense to an EEOC charge or lawsuit. The EEOC’s iTutor settlement should serve as a reminder that a robust compliance and risk management program should periodically assess and test compliance and other risks regarding how technology, both sophisticated and simple, is being used in the hiring process.  Given the attention that technologies are receiving from the EEOC and other agencies, we anticipate seeing a significant rise in charge filings, investigations and litigation relating to these issues.

The EEOC's September 11, 2023 press release announcing the iTutor settlement does not characterize the iTutor case as involving artificial intelligence or algorithmic bias. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While AI has led to job losses for many, those skilled in this field have a chance at well-paying positions. If they are good enough, they can earn as much as $900,000 annually, which is around Rs 7 crore per annum. The AI-based roles are available in the US for now.Netflix has advertised a job for a machine-learning platform product manager on its website. This role involves defining the strategic direction for the Machine Learning Platform and assessing its success. The job, which can be done from an office in California or remotely on the West Coast, offers a salary ranging from $300,000 to $900,000 per year, and a college degree is not required.Amazon is also actively seeking skilled individuals in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). To do this, they have recently advertised a job opportunity for the position of senior manager specializing in applied science and generative AI.In this role, the selected individual would be entrusted with a significant level of responsibility. They would lead a team of experts in scientific research and the application of AI techniques. Specifically, their focus areas would encompass computer vision, which involves teaching computers to interpret visual information much like humans do, and generative imagery and videos, which involves creating new visual content using AI algorithms.The role is not only intellectually engaging but also financially rewarding. While the base salary offered could go as high as $340,300 per year, it&#039;s important to note that this figure excludes any potential bonuses, which could further enhance the total compensation package.AI has become crucial in various industries, leading to a growing demand for experts in this field. Netflix and Amazon are offering salaries that place candidates in the top 1 per cent of earners in the United States. Other companies are following suit, with Walmart offering up to $288,000 per year for a director of retail media AI and Google willing to pay as much as $351,000 annually for a lawyer specialized in AI-related legal matters.Even non-tech companies like Hinge, an online dating app, are seeking AI talent. Hinge&#039;s parent company, Match Group, is advertising for a vice president of AI with a potential salary of up to $398,000 per year.

A I, there are whole swaths of your staff
that you will no longer need writers, coders,
analysts and on and on
that you will have to rethink the people you'll need to
succeed and you need to do it. Now,
our research suggests that rather
than thinking about what jobs will be lost to
A I consider what work needs to be
done. What if the more strategic
view is how to use A I to
make us better, more creative and more
productive? This is think
again, the Gartner original series
that explores breakthrough trends and reveals
new ways to think about the future.
We start with Gartner distinguished VP
analyst Mary
Masago. Mary help us out talk
about A I is everywhere. How
should we be thinking about it?
I think everybody thinks of A I primarily
as a technology or a set of technologies
and that's not really right, just
in the age of the computer. So you know, not cavemen
and cuddles but just say the last 50 years,
we thought of the machine more as a tool,
a supercomputer, a calculator, an information
provider. But as we enter this new age
of A I, I think it's more useful
for us to think of the machine as
our teammate. And that's a really
profound shift in how humans
and machines interact.
I think the attitude to strike here is that
A I shouldn't be hyped, but
it shouldn't be underestimated either.
Let's start with the elephant in the room.
What about all the talk about A I replacing
people?
Are we facing an A I
jobs apocalypse?
So are we all gonna have to retrain as hairdressers
and burger flippers and dog
trainers? And those are the jobs that are safe and
the robots are coming for everything else and the answer
to that is no why?
Well Gartner predicts that through 2026
the impact of A I on jobs
will be neutral. So that's not
to say no jobs will be lost. Of course,
jobs will be lost like in any big technology
shift. But I think a more useful
way to think about A I and jobs
is not so much to ask which
jobs will be lost, but to
look at your industry and ask what
work needs to be done.
Teachers aren't able to serve their students
as well as they would like to
and doctors aren't able to serve their patients
as well as they would like to and manufacturers
would like to come up with safer, newer,
more innovative products and
manufacturing processes, et cetera.
And so if you look at it through what work needs to
be done. There'll be a commensurate increase
in new jobs.
That's well, a relief. How will
it impact the future? Especially for the enterprise.
Gartner fellow Frank
Dyke walks us through what he sees as the
real opportunity for the enterprise.
You really have to take the long view
here.
The, the opportunity will actually change
over time and, and we see three stages
in that in the first stage
and that's where we are right now. A I really
is a partner, a partner that can help get
more dumb and do that a little bit more
consistently. A I really provides
the opportunity here to become a productive
inconsistent in the roles that we have
A I essentially is an assistant and you're
in charge. And in the second stage, we
see A I move from being a partner
to be an active creator, bringing
forward new insights, new models, new capabilities.
And this is where A I is able
to simulate massive quantities, models
and data out to just create new human scenarios
or physical scenarios or business scenarios
to enable A I to accelerate
beyond human capability.
Think for instance, in new drug discovery,
in A I can help with everything from chemical
interaction to drug interactions, to patient
reactions and go towards personalized
medication. And in the third stage,
it becomes a little bit more futuristic and this is
where things get really interesting here.
We see A I move from being a partner
and a creator to becoming more of an
and this is really a big step because
we as a society and as a business,
we haven't really figured out what this means, practically
legally and socially. Gartner,
vice president and analyst, Helen Povan
takes A I as an actor one step
further. When A I is an actor, it
will have alr...

Westlaw, Practical Law, and drafting products build upon 150 years of human insight, categorization like the Key Number System, and editorial enhancements that ensure the quality and structure of the source material.  “Having humans in the loop and controlling and mitigating and understanding and working with the outputs of a high-performing AI system is ultimately the best end-to-end outcome that we can try to achieve with this new capability,” he said.  Generative AI in WestlawDahn shared examples of how generative AI will help legal researchers using Westlaw.In addition to searching Westlaw with Boolean and natural language searches, you’ll also be able to engage with Westlaw in a conversational manner, much like you would with a colleague. The new functionality will be able to read and synthesize content across databases to bring back a clear answer to a question like, “Can social media publicity prove that a trademark is famous for a dilution claim?” It will also provide the authority the answer relies on so you can verify the response and understand the nuance of the law.  Watch the webinar to see this feature in action. Providing the authority for the answer is one way the generative AI features from Thomson Reuters minimize hallucinations. When you can see the reasons for the response, you can verify for yourself that the answer makes sense and is based in fact.   Generative AI in Practical LawColbert shared the concept for the new functionality in Practical Law. Practical Law has been providing know-how for decades, with content developed by attorneys who are experts in their practice areas. Legal practitioners rely on it to help them get started on new matters and new areas of law. She said the conversational experience will help attorneys get to the answers they need faster. For example, if you have a question about how to get started drafting an indemnification provision, you can simply type your question, without filtering to a practice area or sorting through practice notes. The model will return the answer after consulting the trusted Practical Law resources. It will also provide the sources for the answer and steps for further research. See this feature for yourself and more – including how to create custom visualizations that help inform decisions about provisions based on market trends. Using generative AI to draft legal documentsAshraf showed how new generative AI capabilities in Thomson Reuters drafting tools will enable users to create a first draft of, for example, a sale of goods agreement. She noted how, working in Word, a user can pull in gold standard language from Practical Law and customize the terms of the agreement.  She said that the drafting solution will help attorneys be more efficient in their preferred tool for creating work product.With this drafting solution we are bringing together a host of Thomson Reuters solutions with Microsoft Word all in one environment.Generative AI grounded in truthHron noted that AI is exciting and also a bit suspect in its early days. “When you’re trying to answer a very precise or specific question, you want to take that benefit of the model, but you also want to ground it in something that you know is truthful,” he says.That’s what we’re doing here: grounding the model in content we know to be correct so that it can help legal professionals deliver their work efficiently and with confidence. Learn more about generative AI and how it can help redefine how legal professionals do their work by watching, “The new era – redefining how legal professionals do their work.” Sign up for updates on the release of the AI-driven capabilities covered in this blog and in the webinar.   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceTechnology",http://schema.org,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Policymakers face a balancing act to ensure the fair distribution of the benefits of artificial intelligence. The rapid adoption of the technology can disrupt nonroutine tasks, affecting job security and exacerbating socio-economic inequalities. Vishal Rana and Bert Verhoeven discuss possible ways to address the problem, such as creating a universal basic income to help people cope with the transition.

 
The rapid adoption of large language models like ChatGPT and Bard undoubtedly presents many opportunities to positively transform the economy. Organisations are exploring the ability of AI to scale and lower costs, absorb and process enormous amounts of data and help make better decisions, often with humans as editors and facilitators. This transition process is likely to create new jobs that would have never existed without AI.
While the initial statistics suggest a balance between job destruction and job creation, even experts seem to underestimate the exponential pace of developments. This evolution doesn’t come without its challenges. Leaving aside talk about existential threats (for now), we focus on more immediate social economic challenges. Unlike earlier advances in technology, which primarily affected “routine” tasks, AI harbours the potential to automate knowledge workers’ “nonroutine” tasks like policymaking, reviewing, reflecting, coding and doing legal activities.
These developments have exacerbated social tensions, including issues of discrimination and concerns about the functioning of democratic governments. Vast sectors of the workforce are exposed to disruption. Author Yuval Harari illustrates the potential new market power: “Will the rest of the world just become algorithmic data colonies for AI-dominating countries?” Policymakers face a balancing act. They want to cultivate the flourishing of AI while concurrently safeguarding workers and consumers from potential harm. Otherwise, they will need to face the repercussions of a permanent AI divide between a) people embracing and augmenting AI and b) those that are merely replaced, potentially facing long-term joblessness and poverty. Yet, combined with the large data sets to which governments have access, AI has given policymakers new tools to tackle uncertainty and regulate social and economic priorities. As we delve into the dynamics of this pivotal concern, it’s crucial to approach the issue with empathy and a clear understanding of its potential implications for our society.
Job displacement
The capability of AI to automate tasks has stirred major worries about job displacement. AI and automation technologies can outperform humans in a broad array of tasks, from mundane manufacturing procedures to cognitively demanding tasks like data analysis. The real challenge involves the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce to adapt to new emerging roles. Absent adequate resources, individuals from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds could miss these opportunities, exacerbating the AI divide.
Economic impact and inequality
The AI divide bears extensive economic repercussions, often amplifying pre-existing disparities, with the potential to intensify income inequality. High-skill labourers able to harness AI technologies could experience productivity and wage increases. In stark contrast, displaced low-skill workers may suffer income loss, aggravating wealth imbalances. Geographic discrepancies could also worsen. Regions that act as strongholds of high-tech industries may thrive, whereas those relying on industries prone to automation may face economic downturns. This geographical digital divide may result in divergent economic outcomes, with profound societal implications.
Digital divide
Fundamentally, the AI digital divide is an offshoot of the broader digital divide – the chasm separating those with access to information and communication technology (ICT) and those without. Access to AI technologies necessitates basic digital infrastructure, including internet connectivity and digital literacy. However, many global regions, particularly developing countries and rural areas, lack this essential infrastructure, which limits their capacity to exploit AI advancements. Even with technology access, digital literacy remains crucial. The competence to utilise and understand AI technologies is as vital as physical access, emphasising the need for digital education and training, particularly for marginalised communities.
Concentration of power
AI influences global power dynamics. “AI superpowers” command significant sway over global AI standards and norms, driven by a small number of mammoth tech corporations. This power concentration could exacerbate global inequalities, The additional risk of the AI black box is that it may lead firms—intentionally or not—to violate existing laws about bias, fraud, or antitrust, exposing themselves to legal or financial risk, and inflicting economic harm on workers and consumers. Illustrative of the concentration of power is the recent introduction of plugins for ChatGPT, a form of generative AI. Where people in the United States have widespread access to some of the beta features like “code interpreter” from OpenAI many months in advance, others had to wait their turn. In a similar example, Claude 2, another GPT platform, was only available to the US and UK markets at the time of this writing. Then there are organisations like the Khan Academy, that had access to the capabilities of ChatGPT well in advance of its release and smartly incorporated it into their AI personal tutor, “Khanmigo”.
A meaningful life
Lastly, for many, employment isn’t merely income generation. It also imparts purpose and identity. AI-induced displacement could trigger a loss of meaning, potentially causing large-scale psychological and societal impacts.
While AI has made notable strides in mimicking the efficiency of human intelligence in performing specific tasks, significant limitations remain. AI programs typically offer “specialised” intelligence, meaning they solve only one problem or execute one task at a time. In contrast, humans possess “generalised intelligence,” with problem-solving abilities, abstract thinking, and critical judgment that remain vital in the business sector. Human judgment is pertinent, if not in every task, but certainly throughout every level across all sectors. AI is unlikely to render redundant the workers that augment the technology, at least not in the foreseeable future. But those that cannot move to new meaningful work will struggle to keep up. The central issue should transition from “humans or computers” to “humans and computers” operating in complex systems that enhance industry and prosperity.
Ways to address the problem
The challenges posed by the AI digital divide call for comprehensive solutions emphasising equity, inclusion, and proactive strategies. Governments, businesses, and civil society must confront these issues collectively. Key measures to address these challenges and bridge the divide include:



Proposals to address the socio-economic challenges of AI




Economic redistribution and UBIIncentives to reduce costs and increase profits and shareholder value can direct companies away from a socially optimal split between automation and the use of technology to help workers. We need to discuss progressive taxation and wealth redistribution to alleviate the intensification of income inequalities and prevent social unrest. A universal basic income (UBI) can counter potential job displacement, ensuring individuals affected by automation can still meet their basic needs and halting further expansion of the AI divide. UBI can be funded by productivity gains in developed countries. The issue is, how can developing economies provide UBI when manufacturing, their main income stream, is likely to be automated back to the West?


Upskilling and reskillingGovernments and businesses should invest in training and job services so that employees disrupted by AI can transition effectively to new positions where their skills and experience are most applicable. There needs to be more clarity on what the jobs of the future will be, but a good starting point is to emphasise digital literacy, cognitive skills, creativity, a growth mindset and adaptability. Vulnerable groups and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds must have equal access to these programs. 


Publicly-funded AI research and procurementGiven their goal of maximising profits, firms are most likely to conduct research and deploy systems that will directly benefit their bottom line. As a result, the development and adoption of AI are likely to diverge from what would be optimal for workers’ wages and employment. This creates the need for government-funded research into AI applications that augment workers (help them do their jobs). Public bodies can also direct the development of AI that complements workers through their procurement of AI systems.


Digital infrastructure and literacyGovernments should prioritise the development of digital infrastructure, particularly in underserved regions. Access to affordable and reliable internet connectivity is critical for individuals to reap the benefits of AI advancements. Comprehensive digital literacy and future skills programs should be established to equip individuals with the skills to navigate and effectively use AI.




By taking decisive action on these fronts, our societies can start navigating the challenges of the digital divide and pave the way for an inclusive and equitable AI-driven future. The time for contemplation has passed; now is the moment for governments, businesses, and civil society to rise to the occasion and shape a future that benefits all.

He recalls he started avoiding people after having read texts about rapists and found himself projecting paranoid narratives on to people around him. Then last year, his wife told him he was a changed man, and left. She was pregnant at the time. “I lost my family,” he said.The petition filed by the moderators relates to a contract between OpenAI and Sama – a data annotation services company headquartered in California that employs content moderators around the world. While employed by Sama in 2021 and 2022 in Nairobi to review content for OpenAI, the content moderators allege, they suffered psychological trauma, low pay and abrupt dismissal.The 51 moderators in Nairobi working on Sama’s OpenAI account were tasked with reviewing texts, and some images, many depicting graphic scenes of violence, self-harm, murder, rape, necrophilia, child abuse, bestiality and incest, the petitioners say.The moderators say they weren’t adequately warned about the brutality of some of the text and images they would be tasked with reviewing, and were offered no or inadequate psychological support. Workers were paid between $1.46 and $3.74 an hour, according to a Sama spokesperson.When the contract with OpenAI was terminated eight months early, “we felt that we were left without an income, while dealing on the other hand with serious trauma”, said petitioner Richard Mathenge, 37. Immediately after the contract ended, petitioner Alex Kairu, 28, was offered a new role by Sama, labeling images of cars, but his mental health was deteriorating. He wishes someone had followed up to ask: “What are you dealing with? What are you going through?”OpenAI declined to comment for this story.View image in fullscreenOpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman. Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty ImagesSama said moderators had access to licensed mental health therapists on a 24/7 basis and received medical benefits to reimburse psychiatrists.In regards to the allegations of abrupt dismissal, the Sama spokesperson said the company gave full notice to employees that it was pulling out of the ChatGPT project, and were given the opportunity to participate in another project.“We are in agreement with those who call for fair and just employment, as it aligns with our mission – that providing meaningful, dignified, living wage work is the best way to permanently lift people out of poverty – and believe that we would already be compliant with any legislation or requirements that may be enacted in this space,” the Sama spokesperson said.The human labor powering AI’s boomSince ChatGPT arrived on the scene at the end of last year, the potential for generative AI to leave whole industries obsolete has petrified professionals. That fear, of automated supply chains and sentient machines, has overshadowed concerns in another arena: the human labor powering AI’s boom.Bots like ChatGPT are examples of large language models, a type of AI algorithm that teaches computers to learn by example. To teach Bard, Bing or ChatGPT to recognize prompts that would generate harmful materials, algorithms must be fed examples of hate speech, violence and sexual abuse. The work of feeding the algorithms examples is a growing business, and the data collection and labeling industry is expected to grow to over $14bn by 2030, according to GlobalData, a data analytics and consultancy firm.Much of that labeling work is performed thousands of miles from Silicon Valley, in east Africa, India, the Philippines, and even refugees living in Kenya’s Dadaab and Lebanon’s Shatila – camps with a large pool of multilingual workers who are willing to do the work for a fraction of the cost, said Srravya Chandhiramowuli, a researcher of data annotation at the University of London.Someone would say your content was more severe or grotesque than mine, and so at least I can have that as my remedyRichard MathengeNairobi in recent years has become a global hotspot for such work. An ongoing economic crisis, matched with Nairobi’s high rate of English speakers and mix of international workers from across Africa, make it a hub for cheap, multilingual and educated workers.The economic conditions allowed Sama to recruit young, educated Kenyans, desperate for work, said Mathenge. “This was our first, ideal job,” he said.During the week-long training to join the project, the environment was friendly and the content average, the petitioners said. “We didn’t suspect anything,” said Mathenge. But as the project progressed, text passages grew longer and the content more disturbing, he alleged.The task of data labeling is at best monotonous, and at worst, traumatizing, the petitioners said. While moderating ChatGPT, Okinyi read passages detailing parents raping their children and children having sex with animals. In sample passages read by the Guardian, text that appeared to have been lifted from chat forums, include descriptions of suicide attempts, mass-shooting fantasies and racial slurs.Mathenge’s team would end their days on a group call, exchanging stories of the horrors they’d read, he said. “Someone would say your content was more severe or grotesque than mine and so at least I can have that as my remedy,” he said. He remembers working in a secluded area of the office due to the nature of the work: “No one could see what we were working on,” he thought.Before moderating content for OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Kairu loved to DJ. Be it at churches or parties, interacting with different groups of people was his favorite part of the job. But since reviewing content from the internet’s darkest corners for more than a six-month period he has become introverted. His physical relationship with his wife has suffered, and he’s moved back in with his parents. “It has destroyed me completely,” he said.Several of the petitioners said they received little psychological support from Sama, an allegation the company disputes. “I tried to reach out to the [wellness] department to give indication of what exactly was taking place with the team, but they were very non-committal,” said Mathenge. Okinyi said counselors on offer didn’t understand the unique toll of content moderation, so sessions “were never productive”. Companies bear significant responsibilityAccording to its website, “Sama is driving an ethical AI supply chain that meaningfully improves employment and income outcomes.” Its clients include Google, Microsoft and Ebay, among other household names, and in 2021 was one of Forbes’s “AI 50 Companies to Watch”.It has really damaged my mental health. I lost my familyMophat OkinyiThe company has workers in several places in east Africa, including more than 3,500 Kenyans. Sama was formerly Meta’s largest provider of content moderators in Africa, until it announced in January it would be “discontinuing” its work with the giant. The news followed numerous lawsuits filed against both companies for alleged union-busting, unlawful dismissals and multiple violations of the Kenyan constitution.Sama canceled its contract with OpenAI in March 2022, eight months early, “to focus on our core competency of computer vision data annotation solutions”, the Sama spokesperson said. The announcement coincided with an investigation by Time, detailing how nearly 200 young Africans in Sama’s Nairobi datacenter had been confronted with videos of murders, rapes, suicides and child sexual abuse as part of their work, earning as little as $1.50 an hour while doing so.But now, former ChatGPT moderators are calling for new legislation to regulate how “harmful and dangerous technology work” is outsourced in Kenya, and for existing laws to “include the exposure to harmful content as an occupation hazard”, according to the petition. They also want to investigate how the ministry of labor has failed to protect Kenyan youth from outsourcing companies.Kenya’s ministry of labor declined to comment on the petition.But companies like OpenAI bear a significant responsibility too, said Cori Crider, director of Foxglove, a non-profit legal NGO that is supporting the case. “Content moderators work for tech companies like OpenAI and Facebook in all but name,” Crider said in a statement. “The outsourcing of these workers is a tactic by tech companies to distance themselves from the awful working conditions content moderators endure.”Crider said she did not expect the Kenyan government to respond to the petition anytime soon. She wants to see an investigation into the pay, mental health support and working conditions of all content moderation and data labeling offices in Kenya, plus greater protections for what she considers to be an “essential workforce”.Beyond the petition, glimpses of potential regulation are growing. In May, the first trade union for content moderators in Africa was formed, when 150 social media content moderators from TikTok, YouTube, Facebook and ChatGPT met in Nairobi. And while outsourced workers are not legal employees of their clients, in a landmark ruling last month, employment court judge Byram Ongaya ruled that Meta is the “true employer” of its moderators in Kenya.It remains unclear to whom OpenAI currently outsources their content moderation work.To move forward, it helps Okinyi to think of ChatGPT’s users that he has protected. “I consider myself a soldier and soldiers take bullets for the good of the people,” he says. Despite the potential for bullet wounds to stay forever, he considers himself a hero.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)KenyaMetaOpenAIComputingChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in generative AI has skyrocketed across job functions this year, and technical roles are no exception.
In recent research by Stack Overflow, 70% of more than 67,000 professional developers surveyed were already using or planning to use AI tools. But as the initial hype begins to fade, the need for realistic evaluation of generative AI's capabilities is becoming clear: In the same group, less than 3% of respondents reported a high level of trust in AI output.







Integrating AI into enterprise tech workflows is complex, requiring careful evaluation of the potential risks and benefits. And as use of generative AI becomes more common, organizations' technical hiring processes and internal policies will need to evolve accordingly.

Employers are seeking out expertise with generative AI tools
Familiarity with generative AI is emerging as a valuable skill for technical roles such as software development, engineering and data science. This includes both conceptual understanding of how the technology works as well as hands-on experience with tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.
As companies' digital transformations progress, the demand for tech talent continues to exceed supply. Used judiciously, generative AI could enhance technical employees' productivity by reducing time spent on repetitive tasks such as writing boilerplate code, helping to mitigate that skills gap.
""The demand for people who can use large language models on the job effectively will shoot up,"" said Dan Finnigan, CEO of technical hiring platform Filtered.
However, using AI effectively requires recognizing its limitations. Tools for developers and engineers are still more experimental than production ready, necessitating close human oversight.
""It's kind of like having a junior engineer sitting right next to you who has a lot of knowledge, [but] might not necessarily know how to deploy it,"" said Preeti Kaur, head of engineering at Honor, a home care network and technology platform.
Users of generative AI need sufficient knowledge to recognize when a model's output is incorrect. If engineers can't reliably identify and fix a tool's inevitable errors, or if a model produces low-quality output too often, organizations could lose any potential productivity gains to debugging flawed AI-written code.
""We're trying to solve for productivity,"" said Bhawna Singh, CTO of Customer Identity Cloud at Okta, an identity and access management company. ""We don't want to turn the cycle back.""


The growing demand for AI, data science and infrastructure skills
In addition to proficiency with generative AI tools themselves, the AI boom is also likely to drive demand for skills related to building and managing those systems.
Generative AI-related listings on job portal Indeed have more than doubled since 2021. And the broader job market for AI, machine learning (ML) and data science roles is also expanding: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of data scientists will grow by 36% between 2021 and 2031.
Recent months have seen enterprise interest in private, customized LLMs trained on industry-specific and proprietary data sets. Skills related to tailoring models to organizational architectures and data are therefore likely to become particularly valuable moving forward.
An internal model would be an appealing use case for a company like Okta, Singh said -- for example, an LLM trained on Okta's extensive data on authentication, authorization and threat actors' attack techniques. ""That will be certainly one skill set that we would look into,"" she said.
Similarly, if widespread AI adoption continues, companies will need IT teams that can manage the underlying infrastructure for AI systems. Large generative models are often resource-intensive and computationally expensive.
To manage those deployments, knowing how to efficiently plan resource use and manage IT infrastructure is crucial. To build and maintain the IT architecture required to run AI at scale, organizations will need employees with skills such as cloud cost management, efficient systems design and hardware optimization.



New skills and even job roles have also emerged as a result of generative AI. At some organizations, prompt engineering -- the practice of crafting instructions for AI systems that elicit the best possible results -- is a new position in its own right. But it's also a valuable skill outside of specialized AI roles.
""Getting comfortable with the prompts ... and making [generative AI] useful for your use cases, I think that's general know-how,"" Singh said. ""It's certainly something that everyone will have to embrace, whether you are in engineering or not, or whether you are in the ML space or not.""
Understanding how to get the most out of generative models is key to maximizing such tools' usefulness, but it also evinces skills like creativity and problem-solving. ""I feel like every engineer has to have some kind of a prompt engineering mindset now,"" Kaur said.
The Filtered platform is introducing job simulations designed to test candidates' prompt engineering abilities, Finnigan said. Employers can evaluate candidates' creativity and persistence through how they approach the task of writing effective prompts, including iteratively revising their input in response to mistakes or unexpected output.


Generative AI's effects on technical hiring
While generative AI skills are increasingly sought after, the technology itself poses unique challenges for technical hiring.
It remains difficult to reliably identify generative AI output. Consistently accurate tools for detecting AI-generated code don't yet exist, and attempts to create AI text detectors have so far been disappointing. OpenAI, for example, recently took down a classifier intended to differentiate between human- and AI-generated text, citing its ""low rate of accuracy.""
This creates a new challenge in technical hiring: knowing whether a candidate wrote code themselves or instead relied on ChatGPT or a similar tool. Overdependence on generative AI could cause problems down the line if a candidate misrepresents their skills and can't keep up with the complexity of real-world enterprise environments.
One solution could be to reduce emphasis on unmonitored coding challenges in favor of in-person whiteboarding or supervised technical assessments. And asking nuanced follow-up questions can help employers gauge a candidate's analytical skills and knowledge of underlying concepts.
At Okta, for example, interviewees might be asked to explain their reasoning or compare alternative approaches to a problem, such as optimizing for memory versus performance, Singh said. If a candidate can confidently answer those questions, she doesn't view using generative AI as a problem; in fact, it might even be a positive, signaling creativity and openness to experimentation.
If a candidate can't competently explain or modify their AI-generated code, ""then yes, that's not the engineer we need,"" she said. ""Because now you have someone who's just using it without understanding, and that's scary and that's concerning. But if you're understanding it ... I would personally say it's OK.""
Finnigan shared a similar sentiment. Filtered's platform now signals to employers when a job candidate uses ChatGPT during a technical assessment. (Currently, the software only tracks ChatGPT use, though Finnigan anticipates that Filtered will eventually need to provide information on use of alternative tools such as GitHub Copilot or Tabnine.)
But if a candidate does use ChatGPT during the hiring process, that shouldn't automatically be a red flag, Finnigan said. What matters is how a candidate incorporates generative AI into their thinking and coding process as a problem-solving tool.
""The purpose of the recruiting process is to determine whether [a candidate] can code and whether they write good code -- and, if they can, whether they can solve problems,"" he said. ""And if they can, then they'll probably be really good at using generative AI in a productive way.""


Responsibly integrating generative AI into technical workflows
Generative AI has substantial promise for tech employees' productivity if it's implemented carefully. For organizations, the key is to minimize risk without discouraging innovation.
Singh encourages leaders to be realistic: Developers and engineers typically want to experiment with new tools and platforms, which means that outright banning use of generative AI might not be desirable or even achievable.
""That's not the space we live in in tech,"" she said. ""Accepting the hype, looking into it and giving guidance -- that's the goal.""
And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Attempting to ignore generative AI entirely might be riskier than allowing use within agreed-upon parameters. If no guidance is provided, employees could end up using a range of different AI tools without their employer's knowledge, creating security vulnerabilities and fragmented IT environments.
Leadership can get ahead of the problem by proactively setting expectations for appropriate AI use at the organizational level and developing internal policies accordingly. Generative AI tools are still in their early days, and security, ethics and copyright concerns loom over corporate deployments. Together, these considerations mean that open communication and clear guidance are essential.
""I think it is on leadership to now take that hype ... and create guidance and guardrails,"" Singh said. ""To say, 'This is what is OK, this is what [we're] still figuring out, and this is not OK.'""
Developing ways to handle incorrect AI output -- a phenomenon known as hallucination -- and rigorous evaluation frameworks will also be key to successful enterprise adoption of generative AI. Currently, Kaur advocates small-scale, incremental implementation only after extensive human evaluation, including thoroughly testing edge cases.
""Having guardrails and having some idea of evaluation before you start using any of these tools is very important, because I personally don't think much is enterprise ready out there,"" she said.
At Honor, Kaur said that engineering teams have experimented with generative AI tools including GitHub Copilot and Sourcegraph's Cody. And although she's optimistic about their potential, especially Cody, she emphasized that extensive research and experimentation are needed before production deployments. Ongoing monitoring capabilities and consistently accurate results are especially critical in healthcare contexts like Honor's, where mistakes can directly affect patients' lives.
""It's not just about how fast you can process something, it's about how reliably you can process something,"" Kaur said. ""And then, how do you keep checking that it's still doing what you wanted it to do?""

Generative AI will change, but not replace, many of the jobs now held by employees in the U.S., McKinsey found in its 2023 report “Generative AI and the future of work in America.”
Generative AI could open up more time for high-value work
Generative AI may increase U.S. labor production, McKinsey found. It could increase productivity by 0.5% to 0.9% annually through 2030. Generative AI is included in a pool of wider automation technology in the survey as well. Total productivity growth could increase by 3% to 4% annually with all automation technologies taken into account.
That’s compared to productivity growth of 1.4% in the U.S. since 2005. The growth is “quite extraordinary,” Gurneet Singh Dandona, a report author and senior expert at McKinsey & Company, told TechRepublic.
However, there are caveats. The 3% to 4% estimate depends on a “midpoint” of adoption, which will require enthusiastic adoption by both public and private stakeholders. Another possible pain point is the time it will take employees to learn and become comfortable with new tools.
The report pointed out the importance of guidelines like the White House’s voluntary agreement with generative AI makers and the industry’s Frontier Model Forum.

“When machines take over dull or unpleasant tasks, people can be left with more interesting work that requires creativity, problem-solving, and collaborating with others,” wrote report authors Kweilin Ellingrud, Saurabh Sanghvi, Gurneet Singh Dandona, Anu Madgavkar, Michael Chui, Olivia White and Paige Hasebe.
“Workers will need to gain proficiency with these tools and, importantly, use the time that is freed up to focus on higher-value activities. When managers automate more of their administrative and reporting tasks, for example, they can spend more time on strategic thinking and coaching,” the McKinsey report stated.
“Generative AI can compose technical writing, but writers will still need to adapt, report, edit, think, and apply real-world judgment,” Dandona said. “Currently, these tools might be best used to produce first drafts in creative fields — but assistance with first drafts is itself a significant productivity lift.”
It’s more complex than ‘AI will take jobs’
The fields most exposed to generative AI are expected to add jobs through 2030, albeit slower than comparable jobs, the report found.
Dandona pointed out that the report is not supposed to be a short-term prediction about jobs, as it doesn’t take into account regular fluctuations in the business world. Instead, it’s a “long-term scenario,” he said.

STEM jobs will see both increasing demand for workers and a high degree of changes to their day-to-day work due to AI and automation, McKinsey said. How exactly everyday work will change depends on both individual choice and industry trends. “The biggest impact for knowledge workers that we can state with certainty is that generative AI is likely to significantly change their mix of work activities,” the report stated.
The fields most likely to be both affected by AI and see a decrease in demand are customer service/sales and office support. However, several fields that can expect to see tasks transform as generative AI is applied to them — STEM and also business/legal professionals, creatives and educators — will see an increase in demand.

Automation overall was estimated to take over tasks, accounting for 21.5% of the hours worked in U.S. jobs by 2030. Including generative AI in that mix increases the share of automated time to 29.5%.
Countries across the world are working on establishing regulations around generative AI for other reasons outside of the shift in labor, including concerns about privacy, inaccuracies and use of copyrighted material.
Demand for STEM workers expected to increase
“There’s a big fear that AI is going to eliminate lawyers or writers, or, [that] it’s going to take a lot of those jobs,” said Sanjay Poonen, CEO of Cohesity (and former COO of VMware), in an interview with TechRepublic. “It’s the same way as when everyone thought about the automobile or anything that came in that ultimately made people more productive.”
While healthcare is the area expected to open up the most jobs in the future, tech is also hiring, despite the high-profile layoffs this year. McKinsey estimates a 23% increase in demand for STEM jobs by 2030. After all, it reasons that “companies of all sizes and sectors” need people who know tech and those who can help expand companies’ existing digital transformations. Tech workers will be in demand in fields like banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals and healthcare.
“I view generative AI especially as an extremely powerful tool to help you get a first draft of something better,” Poonen said. “If generative AI and ChatGPT could be used to help me get a first draft, it makes me more productive as opposed to being viewed that technology eliminates somebody’s job.”

At a time when there are growing concerns about people losing jobs to AI, companies like Bayt.com is planning to integrate generative AI to create more opportunities for job seekers.
Companies are constantly striving to adapt and innovate to meet the ever-changing demands of their users and stakeholders. Bayt.com, one of the leading job portals in the Middle East, is a prime example of how a company can successfully undergo a digital transformation to stay ahead in the competitive market. Bayt.com bridges the gap between job seekers and employers by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
Syed Atif Ali, Director of Infrastructure – Bayt.com
“We are continuously working on integrating AI into the user journey for both job seekers and employers. AI will play a significant role in providing a personalised experience, enhancing recommendations, and improving search functionalities. We have projects in place for both generative AI and auto-detection, and our users can expect to see more AI-driven features in the future,” said Syed Atif Ali, Director of Infrastructure – Bayt.com.


Emergent technologies like AI-driven features will provide job seekers with tailored job recommendations, relevant search results, and improved matching with potential employers, leading to a more streamlined and effective job search process.
The use of AI and cloud technologies also allows for better talent acquisition. Employers can leverage AI-powered tools to quickly identify and connect with candidates who possess the right skills and qualifications, significantly reducing the time and effort spent on sifting through resumes. The scalability and cost-effectiveness provided by cloud computing ensure that employers can handle varying levels of job applications without compromising the user experience
With projects focusing on generative AI and auto-detection, Bayt.com’s users can expect AI-driven features in the future, ensuring a more efficient and intuitive job search experience.


As the digital landscape expands, so do the challenges of managing infrastructure and handling fluctuating traffic demands. Bayt.com recognised the need for a robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure to cater to their growing user base. Cloud computing emerged as a vital component of their digital transformation.
Bayt.com’s approach to cloud computing has been cloud-agnostic, meaning they designed their application architecture in a way that allows them to move between different cloud providers based on their needs. Eventually, they migrated to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to leverage its benefits fully.
“To cater to traffic and provide a secure and scalable infrastructure, we rely on cloud computing as a crucial part of our digital transformation. Currently, we have migrated to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which fulfilled our requirements for data residency, data locality, performance, and cost-effectiveness,” said Ali.


For a company operating in the Middle East, data residency is a critical concern, as it involves adhering to local regulations and ensuring data is stored within specific geographical boundaries. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure addressed this concern for Bayt.com by establishing a presence in the Middle East. This allowed Bayt.com to comply with local regulations while offering a safe and secure platform for its users.
“One of the key challenges we faced was data residency. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure addressed this concern with its presence in the Middle East, allowing us to comply with local regulations. The transition to OCI helped us overcome this hurdle, ensuring data residency and meeting the necessary security and compliance standards,” said Ali.
For a platform like Bayt.com that deals with sensitive user data, security and compliance are of paramount importance. By migrating to Oracle Cloud, Bayt.com benefits from the secure hosting infrastructure provided by OCI, meeting all the required information security standards.
“Additionally, as tenants of this infrastructure, we ensure that our application is also designed securely to provide a safe and reliable user experience,” emphasised Ali.
The journey of Bayt.com’s digital transformation serves as an inspiring example of how AI and cloud computing can drive innovation, enhance user experiences, and address critical challenges faced by businesses in the modern era. Bayt.com ensures that it continues to be the go-to platform for job seekers and employers in the Middle East, providing them with the tools and resources needed to connect, grow, and succeed in the dynamic job market.

Economic potential of Generative AI: A unique opportunity for Businesses

ShareTweetThe impact of Generative AIEnterprise value with Generative AIBusiness opportunities with Generative AI
Generative AI has recently seen tremendous momentum and advances, becoming a powerful tool for transforming all sectors and industries.
These advances have created new avenues for innovation and opened the door to unprecedentedly complex problem-solving. It transforms how we interact with these models and work, communicate, and create. As such, like other revolutionary technologies of a few years ago, it will affect the global economy in various ways, driving economic growth and the way we work. We analyze the data and the main characteristics of this revolution.
The impact of Generative AI
According to a study by McKinsey, “the impact of generative AI on productivity could add trillions of dollars of value to the global economy.” They estimate that it would add the equivalent of $2.6 billion to $4.4 billion annually across the 63 use cases they analyzed.
This would increase the impact of all artificial intelligence by 15-40%, and this estimate would double if the impact of incorporating generative AI into software currently used for other tasks beyond the use cases analyzed is included.
Generative AI will have a very large impact across all sectors, but especially in four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.

It is a technology that can potentially change the anatomy of work, increasing the capabilities of workers by automating many of their tasks, saving them up to 60-70% of the time they spend. Given the increased potential of technical automation, it is likely to accelerate the pace of workforce transformation.
In fact, it is estimated that current adoption scenarios lead one to believe that half of all work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060. It also can potentially increase global GDP by a staggering 7%, which will have a huge impact.
Enterprise value with Generative AI
Generative AI has the potential to substantially increase labor productivity across the economy, but for that to happen, investment must be made in supporting workers as they change jobs.
This technology represents a step change in the evolution of AI, and as companies implement it in their businesses, they are beginning to realize the potential it can have for both the economy and society.
The business potential of generative AI lies in its ability to automate and streamline creative processes, thus saving time and resources. It is also a democratized technology available to all, which lowers the barriers to accessing it. Now anyone can take advantage of its capabilities and become a creator.
Therefore, we are facing a major shift in the workforce, where production processes within the economy are changing, as well as the tasks that are performed and the skills needed to succeed in business.
Given the ability of generative AI to deliver results in a wide variety of formats (text, image, code, etc.), the possibilities are endless.

By learning from large amounts of data, generative AI helps to create new content or reduce the time and cost of conceptualizing it. It opens up new use cases in fields such as marketing, product design, journalism, etc. Coca-Cola, for example, has shared the use of this technology to create ad copy at scale, giving them higher performance and significant time savings.
It also has a major impact on the scientific and pharmaceutical sectors, speeding up and reducing costs in research processes. Its ability to analyze large datasets helps to develop and test hypotheses quickly and more cost-effectively, thus reducing, for example, the time needed to design new drugs.
In education, AI is being introduced in classrooms to improve educational outcomes. Japan recently announced that it will allow students to use generative AI to facilitate class discussions and art activities. Even when planning lessons or curricula, it is tremendously useful for creating personalized learning experiences based on algorithmic analysis of students’ learning patterns and preferences.
Business opportunities with Generative AI
Regardless of the sector, generative AI has the ability to digest and summarise large amounts of information. This technology helps make data more useful and easier to interpret.
It also brings huge productivity benefits for workers in administrative fields, reducing their workloads and allowing them to focus on more complex or more challenging jobs.

The transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already begun to reshape the job landscape, and according to the McKinsey report “The State of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s Breakout Year,” this trend is only set to accelerate. The report highlights key insights into the potential changes in the job market, emphasizing the need for adaptability and preparedness among workers and industries. In this article, we delve into these five crucial insights from the report, shedding light on the implications of Generative AI on the workforce.
1. Job Displacement on the Horizon:
McKinsey’s report predicts that by 2030, approximately 12 million people in the US will need to transition into new job roles as Generative AI advances. Automation, driven by generative AI technology, is expected to replace many routine and repetitive tasks across various industries. While this may lead to enhanced productivity and efficiency, it also challenges the workforce to adapt and reskill.

2. Shifting Job Patterns:
The report highlights a significant trend in recent job changes in the US. Over half of the 8.6 million job transitions observed were people moving away from roles in food service, customer service, office support, and production. These roles are particularly susceptible to automation as they often involve repetitive and predictable tasks that can be efficiently performed by AI systems. The workforce’s response to these shifts will determine the pace of transformation in the job market.

3. Generative AI’s Potential to Automate Jobs:
Generative AI’s capabilities are poised to disrupt the job market significantly. The report suggests that by 2030, up to 30% of jobs could be automated by this technology. This automation is likely to impact various sectors, including manufacturing, finance, and customer service, among others. However, it’s important to note that automation doesn’t necessarily mean job elimination; instead, it might entail the transformation of job roles and the creation of new opportunities.

4. The Duality of Generative AI’s Impact:
While Generative AI can automate many jobs in fields like Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), healthcare, construction, and other professional domains, it also presents opportunities for growth in these industries. For instance, Generative AI can assist healthcare professionals in diagnostics and treatment planning, enhancing patient care. In construction, AI can optimize building designs and streamline project management, increasing efficiency.

5. Contrasting Employment Trends:
The McKinsey report highlights the differing growth trajectories across industries. Healthcare, STEM, and construction sectors are experiencing job growth, driven by technological advancements and an aging population’s increasing demand for healthcare services. However, the report also reveals that office support and customer service jobs are declining, largely due to automation and digitalization.

The McKinsey report paints a comprehensive picture of the potential impact of Generative AI on the job market by 2030. While automation presents challenges for certain sectors, it also offers transformative opportunities for growth and efficiency. The future of work will undoubtedly be shaped by the adaptability of the workforce and the ability of industries to leverage AI technologies responsibly.
As we embrace the AI-driven future, it becomes crucial for workers to reskill and upskill themselves, ensuring they stay relevant and agile in a dynamic job market. Additionally, businesses and policymakers must collaboratively devise strategies to support workers through these transitions, enabling them to seize new opportunities in an AI-powered world.

There’s a lot of angst about software developers “losing their jobs” to AI, being replaced by a more intelligent version of ChatGPT, GitHub’s Copilot, Google’s foundation model Codey, or something similar. 
AI startup founder Matt Welsh has been talking and writing about the end of programming. He’s asking whether large language models (LLMs) eliminate programming as we know it, and he’s excited that the answer is “yes”: Eventually, if not in the immediate future.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



But what does this mean in practice?  What does this mean for people who earn their living from writing software?
The value in new programming skills
Some companies will certainly value AI as a tool for replacing human effort rather than for augmenting human capabilities. Programmers who work for those companies risk losing their jobs to AI. If you work for one of those organizations, I’m sorry for you, but it’s really an opportunity. 
Despite the well-publicized layoffs, the job market for programmers is great, it’s likely to remain great, and you’re probably better off finding an employer who doesn’t see you as an expense to be minimized. It’s time to learn some new skills and find an employer who really values you.
But the number of programmers who are “replaced by AI” will be small. Here’s why, and here’s how the use of AI will change the discipline as a whole. I did a very non-scientific study of the amount of time programmers actually spend writing code. 
OK, I just typed “How much of a software developer’s time is spent coding” into the search bar and looked at the top few articles, which gave percentages ranging from 10% to 40%. My own sense, from talking to and observing many people over the years, falls into the lower end of that range: 15% to 20%. 
Time for “the rest of the job”
ChatGPT won’t make the 20% of time programmers spend writing code disappear completely. You still have to write prompts, and we’re all in the process of learning that if you want ChatGPT to do a good job, the prompts have to be very detailed. 
How much time and effort does that save? I’ve seen estimates as high as 80%, but I don’t believe them; I think 25% to 50% is more reasonable. If 20% of your time is spent coding, and AI-based code generation makes you 50% more efficient, then you’re really only getting about 10% of your time back. 
You can use it to produce more code — I’ve yet to see a programmer who was underworked, or who wasn’t up against an impossible delivery date. Or you can spend more time on the “rest of the job,” the 80% of your time that wasn’t spent writing code. 
Some of that time is spent in pointless meetings, but much of “the rest of the job” is understanding the user’s needs, designing, testing, debugging, reviewing code, finding out what the user really needs (that they didn’t tell you the first time), refining the design, building an effective user interface, auditing for security and so on. It’s a lengthy list.
Programmers needed: AI lacks design skillsadvertisement
That “rest of the job” (particularly the “user’s needs” part) is something our industry has never been particularly good at. Design — of the software itself, the user interfaces and the data representation — is certainly not going away and isn’t something the current generation of AI is very good at. 
We’ve come a long way, but I don’t know anyone who hasn’t had to rescue code that was best described as a “seething mass of bits.” Testing and debugging — well, if you’ve played with ChatGPT much, you know that testing and debugging won’t disappear. AIs generate incorrect code, and that’s not going to end soon. 
Security auditing will only become more important, not less; it’s very hard for a programmer to understand the security implications of code they didn’t write. Spending more time on these things — and leaving the details of pushing out lines of code to an AI — will surely improve the quality of the products we deliver.
Prompting a different form of programmingadvertisement
Now, let’s take a really long-term view. Let’s assume that Welsh is right and that programming as we know it will disappear — not tomorrow, but sometime in the next 20 years. Does it really disappear? 
A couple of weeks ago, I showed Tim O’Reilly some of my experiments with Ethan and Lilach Mollick’s prompts for using AI in the classroom. His reaction was: “This prompt is really programming.” He’s right. 
Writing a detailed prompt really is just a different form of programming. You’re still telling a computer what you want it to do, step by step. And I realized that after spending 20 years complaining that programming hasn’t changed significantly since the 1970s, ChatGPT has suddenly taken that next step. 
It isn’t a step towards some new paradigm, whether functional, object-oriented or hyperdimensional. I expected the next step in programming languages to be visual, but it isn’t that either. It’s a step towards a new kind of programming that doesn’t require a formally defined syntax or semantics. Programming without virtual punch cards. Programming that doesn’t require you to spend half your time looking up the names and parameters of library functions that you’ve forgotten about.
Understanding problems in depth — not counting lines of code
In the best of all possible words, that might bring the time spent actually writing code down to zero or close to it. But that best case only saves 20% of a programmer’s time. Furthermore, it doesn’t really eliminate programming. It changes it — possibly making programmers more efficient and definitely giving programmers more time to talk to users, understand the problems they face and design good, secure systems for solving those problems. 
Counting lines of code is less important than understanding problems in depth and figuring out how to solve them — but that’s nothing new. Twenty years ago, the Agile Manifesto pointed in this direction, valuing:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

AI incorporated: Programmers working directly with customers
Despite 23 years of “agile practices,” customer collaboration has always been shortchanged. Without engaging with customers and users, Agile quickly collapses to a set of rituals. Will freeing programmers from syntax actually yield more time to collaborate with customers and respond to change? 
To prepare for this future, programmers will need to learn more about working directly with customers and designing software that meets their needs. That’s an opportunity, not a disaster. Programmers have labored too long under the stigma of being neckbeards who can’t and shouldn’t be allowed to talk to humans. It’s time to reject that stereotype and build software as if people mattered.
AI isn’t something to be feared. Writing about OpenAI’s new Code Interpreter plug-in (gradually rolling out now), Ethan Mollick says, “My time becomes more valuable, not less, as I can concentrate on what is important, rather than the rote.” 
AI is something to be learned, tested and incorporated into programming practices so that programmers can spend more time on what’s really important: Understanding and solving problems. The endpoint of this revolution won’t be an unemployment line; it will be better software. The only thing to be feared is failing to make that transition.
Programming isn’t going to go away. It’s going to change, and those changes will be for the better.

When OpenAI launched the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT for public use on Nov. 30, the S&P 500 was worth $5 trillion less than now, tech spending was deep in a post-pandemic hangover, and the economy appeared headed for recession or persistent high inflation.

Don't Just Buy AI Stocks. Here's How To Find The True AI Winners.




That single day provided just an inkling of generative AI's potential for transformative impact. The S&P 500 shot up more than 3% as tech stocks with artificial intelligence products rumbled. OpenAI investor Microsoft (MSFT) leapt 6%, and AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) climbed 8%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also jumped 6% that day, and Meta Platforms (META) ran up nearly 8%.
Now the tech hangover is giving way to a new ""gold rush,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives argues. Ives thinks ChatGPT opened the door to another $1 trillion in artificial intelligence-related spending over the coming decade that wasn't on Wall Street's radar.
And the economic impact could prove even more far-reaching. Some analysts are even talking about a new Roaring '20s fueled by AI. Experts say generative AI could launch a surge in productivity after a 17-year slump. A productivity pickup couldn't come at a better time, as a worker shortage, an aging population and deglobalization fan inflationary pressures.
""We are in desperate need of a new source of growth,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a June 14 report. ""Despite near-term pessimism, we remain enthusiastic about AI's potential to change the nature of our economies,"" they wrote, calling it ""an immense source of optimism"" as the decade progresses.
The consensus is that generative AI will change the world. But productivity growth has sputtered through recent waves of new technology, including the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, cloud computing and robotics. Why should this time be different? And what might stand in the way of a productivity boom and S&P 500 bull run?
Generative AI Productivity Boom
Generative AI could boost U.S. labor productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points per year for a decade, Goldman Sachs economists predict. That would double the lackluster 1.4% rate since 2005. Goldman says S&P 500 profit margins could widen by four percentage points, which would be a huge increase from the 12% average over the past few years. Global GDP could grow by an extra 7 percentage point, or $7 trillion, over the same period.
Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management in the Americas, says increased investment spurred by generative AI strengthens the case for a secular bull market that's ""comparable to the Roaring 1920s.""
That could mean ""sustained growth above 2%, falling inflation, strong employment gains, rapidly rising productivity and revolutionary technological change.""
The lightning-fast adoption of ChatGPT, which gained its first 100 million users in a record-shattering two months, partly explains the conviction that the U.S. is on the cusp of a productivity boom.
Goldman economists figure that technological advances begin to yield broad productivity gains in the 10 years after half of businesses adopt a technology.
If earnings calls are an indication, that threshold could arrive quickly. Just 53 S&P 500 firms mentioned artificial intelligence in Q3 calls, before ChatGPT's release. That jumped to 110 by Q1, according to FactSet.
That huge interest and rapid takeup reflect not just generative AI's potential but the relatively low barriers to adoption. Unlike the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, generative AI responds to natural language commands.

Artificial Intelligence News And AI Stocks To Watch

Generative AI Vs. Machine Learning
For routine, repetitive tasks, such as some manufacturing work, computers can be programmed with explicit instructions. Advances in machine learning in the last decade have enabled automation of complex tasks. That means programming a computer to recognize patterns in specialized data sets in order to make accurate predictions. Among the early successes were computers reading CT scans and producing diagnoses. Self-driving cars, which use data from sensors and cameras to predict the next movement of other vehicles and pedestrians, are an example of machine learning AI with a more mixed record of success so far.
Generative AI is seen as potentially world-changing because it aims to automate something thought to be beyond reach: creative content.
Instead of training with a focus on specialized data, GPT-3.5, the brains behind the ChatGPT chatbot, soaked up a big chunk of the books, articles and websites on the internet to create what is known as a large language model. On top of that, it is trained to try and fool humans from thinking its output is computer-generated.
Some people have described ChatGPT as an advanced autocomplete. Instead of just suggesting the next word, it can offer up a cover letter, essay, story, marketing pitch, travel itinerary or legal brief.
Goldman Sachs economists estimate that 44% of legal work could be automated via generative AI.
But generative AI isn't limited to responding in natural language. It can also generate images, computer code and complex designs.
How Will AI Change Knowledge Work?
Microsoft's GitHub Copilot leverages OpenAI's latest GPT-4 large language model to turn software developers' prompts into snippets of code, speeding up their work by 55%, according to an internal study published last year.
A 2022 paper from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center hailed AI-enabled generative design as ""a paradigm shift in the design process."" Highlighting OpenAI's DALL-E foundation model that turns natural language prompts into images, the paper explained how engineers working with Autodesk Fusion 360 software designed optical instruments in a tenth of the typical time, while improving the instruments' performance.
Engineering, architecture and even drug discovery are all fields where generative AI is already making an imprint.
There's a common thread with most of these new applications, according to a McKinsey & Co. analysis.
""Generative AI's impact is likely to most transform the work of higher-wage knowledge workers because of advances in the technical automation potential of their activities, which were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation,"" McKinsey found.
Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani conclude that ""generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.""
A study by OpenAI arrives at a similar place, finding that 49% of today's jobs could have half or more of their tasks accomplished with generative AI. The authors note, however, that complementary software, such as Casetext for lawyers, and human overseers are needed to catch factual mistakes and avert other issues.

Still, such estimates may understate the coming impact on work. That's because they omit ongoing efforts to automate hands-on work in industries such as manufacturing, logistics and transportation via nongenerative AI, or machine learning, and robotics.
Long before ChatGPT made its stunning entrance, McKinsey researchers in 2019 had envisioned that 50% of today's work activities could be automated by 2055. Now that generative AI has opened a door to automating knowledge work, McKinsey has moved up that timeline by a decade to 2045.
Such predictions come with a wide margin of error, partly because earlier productivity booms were slow to materialize. The advent of personal computers in the late 1970s, followed by spreadsheets in the early '80s, seemed to be a productivity miracle. But statistics didn't begin to back that up until the mid-1990s.
""It was not until the world's computers were integrated into what eventually became the Internet that the true potential of computers was realized,"" wrote Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research.
The release of the Netscape Navigator browser in 1994 unleashed the potential of the internet and opened the door to new business models, Marcelli of UBS wrote.
She sees ChatGPT playing a similar role, ""bringing AI to the masses in an accessible and intuitive way.""
Berezin sees reason to think predictions about the impact of generative AI may actually prove too timid.

Generative AI Reflects 'Exponential' Progression
""They extrapolate linearly from what AI can do today to what it can do tomorrow,"" Berezin said. ""But AI's progression is following an exponential curve, not a linear one.""
OpenAI says that its latest GPT-4 model, released in March on a subscription basis, scored in the top 10% of test takers in a simulated bar exam. The GPT-3.5 model that's behind ChatGPT scored in the bottom 10%.
GPT-4's training covered 1 petabyte of material, or more than 20 times the material mastered by GPT-3.5.
Token limits are another measure of generative AI's usefulness. ChatGPT has a limit of 4,096 tokens. That means it can process queries and generate responses with only that many tokens. A typical token may be a letter, word, number, punctuation mark or other symbol. Once a conversation reaches that threshold, ChatGPT resets, which is why it's said to have no short-term memory.
OpenAI's GPT-4 model was introduced with more than 8,000 tokens, allowing deeper analysis. In May, AI startup Anthropic introduced the latest version of its Claude generative AI model with a 100,000-token limit. That equates to roughly 75,000 words, enabling the analysis of SEC 10-K filings, for example.
Massive Demand For AI Chips
The generative AI model behind ChatGPT, already left in the dust by newer models, required 10,000 Nvidia graphics chips to train ahead of its deployment, according to UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri.
Yet the far-bigger expense, known as inference costs, comes from tapping into that artificial brain power with user queries. ""The costs to inference ChatGPT exceed the training costs on a weekly basis,"" according to the SemiAnalysis research firm.
Alphabet chairman John Hennessy has said that queries using Google's Bard AI chatbot cost the company 10 times as much as regular Google search. SemiAnalysis' work suggests that's an understatement.
The cost of using generative AI means that companies must expect a payoff, such as more revenue, labor and other expense savings, or both.
Wall Street is betting that those payoffs are coming. Morgan Stanley analysts see the market for AI semiconductors tripling from $43 billion to $125 billion over the next three years. The broader AI technology market should grow from $90 billion today to $275 billion by 2027.
In late May, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in revenue for the July-ended second quarter, crushing estimates for $7.2 billion, largely on AI chip demand.
Microsoft's AI Ramp
On July 18, Microsoft announced it will charge $30 per month for Microsoft 365 users to upgrade to Microsoft 365 Copilot. The generative AI version of the business software suite allows users to order up article outlines or drafts in Word, emails and invites in Outlook, meeting summaries in Teams and more. If just 20% of customers sign up, Microsoft could realize as $9 billion in annual revenue.
Still, Microsoft stock slipped after its fiscal Q4 earnings on July 25 amid guidance for higher capital spending led by AI costs but only ""gradual"" AI revenue growth.
Negative gross margins, with spending exceeding revenue, is to be expected at the front end of a large CapEx cycle, Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan said in a July 5 research report.
""It took a 10-year investment cycle for gross margins in Microsoft's cloud business to go from negative to where they are today, which is well north of 50% to 60%. That's probably the baseline for AI.""
Tech Manufacturing Boom Underway
Tapping into the huge potential of AI or getting left behind may be what finally pushes companies to update legacy systems, wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. He cited a Rackspace Technology survey indicating that 83% of retail-sector IT executives said that benefiting from AI will require modernizing their technology. That backs Yardeni's thesis that ""a new technology capital spending cycle — and the Roaring 2020s — are underway!""
The AI investment boom is taking off at a time when businesses are investing heavily to build semiconductor and EV production capacity in the U.S. Spending on manufacturing construction hit an annualized $194 billion in May, up 76% from a year earlier, Commerce Department data shows. That's getting an assist from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act, both approved in 2022.
Artificial Intelligence Drives Bull Market
While consumer spending has cooled this year amid more Fed rate hikes, helping to moderate inflation, the AI buzz and strength in business investment have unexpectedly given life to a new S&P 500 bull market.
In June, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end S&P 500 target to 4500 from 4000. Earlier this month, Credit Suisse lifted its S&P 500 year-end target to 4700 from 4050, citing an improved inflation outlook and stronger tech earnings.
Through the July 31 close of 4589, the S&P 500 has rallied 31.4% from its Oct. 13 bear-market low and now stands just 4.8% off its all-time high set on Jan. 4, 2022. The Nasdaq has been even hotter, surging 37% year-to-date — nearly doubling the S&P 500's 19.5% gain.
So far in 2023 through July 31, Nvidia stock has skyrocketed 220%. Microsoft stock has surged 40%.
The question now is whether the market is ""getting too hot,"" Yardeni wrote. He thinks this new bull market has legs and sees potential for the S&P 500 to rise as high as 5400 by the end of 2024. But there's still scope for a near-term correction, he says. (Be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay in sync with the stock market direction and what it means for your trading decisions.)
Short-Term Inflation Pressure?
Over time, the productivity gains from generative AI should help hold down inflation. But, for now, strengthening capital investment and the rebound in stock market wealth could work the other way. This is among near-term and longer-term factors that complicate the bullish AI-driven market outlook.
As with the late 1990s dot-com boom, ""The AI craze could temporarily lift bond yields by pushing out the onset of the next recession,"" BCA's Berezin wrote.
Back then, rising equity wealth and strong capital spending produced a very tight labor market. The Fed ultimately raised its key rate to 6.5% by May 2000, helping to burst the bubble.
This time there's no bubble to prick. The AI boom is in its first year, led by the highly profitable ""magnificent seven"" stocks, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and Meta Platforms. Still, it's unclear whether stock market gains and stronger business investment will help the Fed achieve a soft landing by offsetting consumer weakness or whether they'll give consumption a second wind and compel policymakers to hike rates more than expected.
So far the tech spending rebound appears narrowly focused on AI. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which makes most of the world's advanced chips for companies like Nvidia, AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Apple, said July 20 that sales will fall 10% this year. While its AI business is booming, that makes up only 6% of sales.
Generative AI Impact On Job Market
With so much potential for AI to displace workers, another key unknown is how the job market will adapt. Historically, providing workers with technology to work faster and better has increased living standards as employees reaped a share of higher profits.
Productivity gains could enable an era of faster, noninflationary growth. That could help provide jobs for displaced workers, including new types of work.
Some 60% of today's jobs are in occupations that didn't exist in 1940, MIT economist David Autor has found. That has minimized the fallout from technological progress.
""In past technological transformations, workers who lost their jobs could transition to new jobs, and on average pay increased,"" Stanford professor Erik Brynjolfsson and co-authors wrote in a recent paper for Brookings Institution.
""However, given the scale of the impending disruption and the labor-saving nature of it, it remains to be seen whether this will be the case in the age of generative AI.""
The government response to worker displacement will have big market implications. Tax increases could erode higher profit margins enabled by AI. Spending to buttress income-support programs or provide a universal basic income could raise rates and undo AI's disinflationary effects, Goldman says. ""Higher interest rates also could counteract much of the potential increase in fair value for the S&P 500.""
AI Chip War Poses Big Risk
But geopolitics is by far the biggest risk. With so much riding on the AI investment boom, any imminent threats to the supply of crucial chips could trigger serious bouts of volatility for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Unfortunately, supply chain threats are a fact of life because AI chips are at the heart of the U.S.-China chip war.
The U.S. has formed a united front with key allies to keep advanced semiconductors made by Nvidia and others out of China's hands. The same goes for equipment that can produce the chips. That has only deepened a rift between China and the U.S. over the status of Taiwan. That's where TSM produces the chips that power the AI revolution.
Despite U.S. diplomacy efforts, the conflict continues to ratchet up. In recent weeks, the Biden administration signaled it will widen chip export curbs. Beijing struck back with its own restrictions on exports of gallium and germanium, two chip inputs whose production China dominates.
The hard-to-gauge risk of a war over Taiwan would have incalculable economic consequences. While the risk hasn't diluted the fervor for AI stocks, markets may reassess after Taiwan elections slated for January. A shift in leadership could move the island closer to China. A status quo election could narrow nonmilitary options for Beijing to assert its sovereignty.

AI technology is revolutionizing the way lawyers work, streamlining mundane tasks and providing more accurate and efficient solutions. We’ll take a look at how Thomson Reuters has leveraged AI technology to create new tools for corporate legal professionals, as well as the importance of data protection and ethical considerations when developing AI technology. We’ll also explore Thomson Reuters’ history with AI technology and work with Microsoft 365 Copilot.Jump to:The role of generative AI in shaping the future of legal work Detailed demonstrations of AI integration in their productsThe company’s work with Microsoft and Microsoft 365 Copilot The importance of data and ethics in AI development  The role of generative AI in shaping the future of legal workThe role of generative AI in shaping the future of legal work is becoming increasingly important as technology continues to advance. Generative AI technology offers a wide range of possibilities for in-house lawyers, making processes more efficient, accurate, and cost-effective. It is transforming the way lawyers think about legal work and providing solutions to complex problems that were not previously available.Generative AI technology can help lawyers make decisions quickly and efficiently, while also automating mundane tasks such as document review and research. This allows lawyers to focus on more substantive work, rather than spending their time on tedious paperwork. Furthermore, generative AI tools can provide more precise and comprehensive results than manual labor alone ever could. This means that lawyers have access to better data when making decisions, which can lead to improved outcomes for clients.However, it is important to remember that AI technology cannot replace humans entirely; instead, it should be viewed as an additional tool that complements the work of humans by providing them with insights they wouldn’t otherwise have access to. As Joel Hron from Thomson Reuters states “We don’t view generative AI as a replacement or displacement necessarily of humans or jobs. We view humans as a critical component in the loop of generative AI” – emphasizing the importance of taking ethical considerations into account when developing AI tools for use in the legal profession.Overall, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize how we approach legal work – allowing us to streamline processes while simultaneously improving accuracy and efficiency – but its full potential remains unknown until we explore its capabilities further through continued innovation in this field.Detailed demonstrations of AI integration in their productsThomson Reuters is a leader in the field of generative AI integration for corporate legal professionals, with cutting-edge products that provide sophisticated automated document review, predictive analytics and research tools to help lawyers save time and money when doing their work.One of their most advanced generative AI applications on the horizon is “Ask Westlaw” which will combine powerful language models with exclusive editorial enhancements and authoritative content to give lawyers quick answers to their legal inquiries. This system uses natural language processing technology to interpret complex legal queries so that it provides more accurate results than regular search engines can.The company’s automated document review feature also allows attorneys to quickly and accurately identify pertinent documents among large datasets. With this tool, they are able to comprehend key facts from thousands of documents in no time, while reducing human errors that may occur as a result of manual labor. Additionally, Thomson Reuters has created a predictive analytics platform powered by generative AI designed specifically for corporate counsel so they can detect potential risks and liabilities sooner, allowing them to take proactive steps in order to avoid them.Overall, Thomson Reuters’ innovative use of generative AI technology has the capability of transforming how we approach legal work – making processes more efficient but also opening up new possibilities for corporate in-house counsel. As generative AI tech continues its advancement at an exponential rate, there are undoubtedly many exciting opportunities yet to be explored by Thomson Reuters and other providers alike in the upcoming years.The company’s work with Microsoft and Microsoft 365 CopilotThe partnership between Thomson Reuters and Microsoft as part of the Copilot program has given rise to a cutting-edge AI-powered digital assistant called Microsoft 365 Copilot. This collaboration showcases Thomson Reuters’ extensive legal expertise, which has been instrumental in developing features such as automated document review, contract analysis, and compliance checks. Leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft’s platform, these intelligent tools seamlessly integrate into Thomson Reuters’ suite of products, enhancing the overall functionality and utility of Microsoft Office products. Although the companies are not in a formal partnership, they are working together to bring this innovative technology to the legal industry. The application of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies is expected to drastically reduce the time lawyers spend on tedious manual tasks while also improving accuracy. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI capabilities, Thomson Reuters and Microsoft are creating an intelligent platform that can understand natural language queries to provide more accurate results than traditional search engines.Moreover, they are also developing solutions to ensure ethical considerations such as data protection laws are considered when using this technology. This collaboration demonstrates both companies’ commitment to revolutionizing corporate legal work through the use of advanced generative AI technology.

With its innovative approach to applying advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, this collaboration is sure to have a lasting impact on how lawyers around the world do their jobs in years to come.The importance of data and ethics in AI developmentThe development of generative AI technology is undeniably changing the legal landscape for corporate in-house legal professionals. As such, it is essential to consider data protection and ethical considerations when creating generative AI tools. Data protection laws provide a legal framework for the collection and use of personal data, as well as guidelines to ensure that this data is handled responsibly. Furthermore, ethical considerations are crucial when creating algorithms that will be used to make decisions with potentially life-altering consequences.When developing generative AI products, transparency and explainability are key components of the process. While it may be possible to create powerful algorithms without humans understanding how they operate, it is essential that organizations can explain how their AI systems make decisions so that users can trust them. Additionally, models should be regularly tested to ensure accuracy and fairness in decision-making. If an algorithm fails an accuracy or fairness test, it should be revised or replaced accordingly until its performance meets acceptable standards.Organizations must also consider the ethical implications of their AI products and services before implementing them. This includes considering potential harms such as privacy violations or discrimination based on race or gender biases present in data sets used to train machine learning models. It is essential to understand how these products could impact people’s lives before releasing them into the wilds of production systems – mistakes can have costly consequences if not addressed early on in development processes.When developing generative AI technology for corporate legal professionals, organizations must consider both data protection laws and ethical issues when crafting their solutions. Transparency and explainability are necessary components for building trust in technology, while regular testing ensures accuracy and fairness in decision-making processes. Finally, organizations must consider the potential harms associated with their products before deploying them into production systems – mistakes can have costly consequences if not addressed beforehand._________________________________________________________________Watch the full on-demand webinar discussing how AI is redefining how corporate in-house legal professionals do their work here._________________________________________________________________  Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceCorporate Legal",http://schema.org,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been nearly a year since ChatGPT burst onto the scene and excitement about it in organizations continues to grow. A newly released study by KPMG found that 97% of respondents expect their organization to be highly or extremely–highly impacted by generative AI in the next 12 to 18 months.
Not only that, but generative AI is rated to be the top emerging enterprise technology. 80% believe that it will disrupt their industry and nearly all (93%) think generative AI will provide value to their business.

Generative AI investment fever
The enthusiasm for generative AI is translating into significant increases in related tech investments. According to the KPMG study, a majority (80%) of respondents said they anticipate increasing their investments in generative AI by more than 50% in the next six months to a year. 45% say it will more than double.
Many of the survey respondents said they will use this increased investment to prioritize infrastructure and scale business through generative AI applications.
SEE: Firm study predicts big spends on generative AI (TechRepublic)
Improving existing business models and leadership demand are the leading drivers behind this increase. Even though respondents report that investments will happen in functional areas across the board, three in four business leaders are looking to leverage generative AI for marketing and sales.
How generative AI has already impacted businesses
Generative AI has already made an impact in areas such as customer service and self-service support, Steve Chase, KPMG U.S. consulting lead, told TechRepublic. “Our clients who have leveraged generative AI to augment knowledge workers in call centers or make enhancements to their virtual chatbots are already seeing a significant return on investment.”

However, the main reason for their success is because of earlier investments made in automation technologies. These allowed for swift implementation of generative AI into their processes and systems, Chase added.
“Another area our clients are getting a lot of value from is generative AI’s ability to automate content generation, such as proposal responses, social media assets, email templates and more,” he said. “It’s also made copywriting and editing tremendously more efficient.”
Survey respondents also cited IT/tech and operations as the other functional areas that are expected to be impacted the most by generative AI.
Regulatory concerns are not halting gen AI adoption plans
While respondents expressed some concern about the generative AI regulation, most businesses do not expect to slow their adoption plans. 35% of respondents said they will not pause adoption and 41% are willing to take a three-to-six-month pause to monitor the regulatory landscape.
Business leaders also anticipate the most regulatory actions around data privacy (51%), security (46%) and transparency (44%). Less is anticipated around copyright (25%) and bias (24%).
Although most (77%) business leaders said that the uncertain and evolving regulatory landscape impacts their investment decisions, they are confident they’ll meet the requirements. In preparation, many are hiring specialized talent (data privacy, bias), creating new roles and/or partnering with external consultants to help navigate the generative AI regulations.
Generative AI will contribute to workforce positivity
84% of respondents believe that generative AI will have a positive impact on their workforce. Half feel generative AI will likely expand their overall headcount. Not surprisingly, they also said hiring preference will go to those who specialize in generative AI.
Additionally, business leaders feel that generative AI is very likely to support workforce initiatives. This includes increased professional development, reduced overtime and more in-person connectivity. SEE: TechRepublic Premium’s prompt engineer hiring kit
To cope with the usage of generative AI, about half of the respondent organizations are upskilling their existing employees either through small- or large-scale efforts.
One of the noteworthy findings from this recent survey is a change in attitude from KPMG’s initial survey on generative AI conducted in April 2023. The survey “revealed that while executives expect generative AI to have an enormous impact on business, many of them felt unprepared for immediate adoption,” observed Chase.
When comparing the findings from April with the latest study from June, he said most organizations (66%) still haven’t moved out of the researching/piloting phase. This is still the case even though a majority of leaders still anticipate significant disruption to their industry.
“For leaders to capitalize on generative AI’s potential for growth and efficiencies, they will need to make critical decisions in the very near future that can move their organization into deployment and ultimately industrialization of the technology,” Chase said. “The clients we work with who have fully embraced generative AI are already seeing a substantial impact on their business and firmly believe it will be a competitive game changer for them in the future.”
Early-adopter organizations will be in a better position to drive enterprise-wide transformation and innovation versus organizations still in early-phase implementation, he added.
Survey methodology
KPMG said the survey was conducted online between June 9, 2023 and June 23, 2023, and reached 200 business decision makers in the U.S. The report also includes data from KPMG’s Gen AI survey conducted in April 2023 among 225 business leaders in the U.S. for comparison purposes. Respondents for this latest survey were from companies with $1 billion or more in annual revenue and included a mix of business functions and industries.

Published: 17 Jul 2024


 
Generative AI has been a relatively obscure player on the world stage since the days of the first chatbot, Eliza, six decades ago -- that is, until OpenAI's platform ChatGPT burst onto the scene last November.







Within two months of its celebrated launch, ChatGPT smashed all records as the fastest application to reach 100 million active users. And it came with its share of triumphs, tragedies and fireworks. Generative AI outcomes can at times be accurate and seemingly quite human and other times produce what Forrester Research calls ""coherent nonsense."" And it's all done faster than a speeding bullet.
""I see a ton of experimental adoption of ChatGPT,"" said Patrick Hall, an assistant professor at The George Washington University School of Business and principal scientist at HallResearch.ai, which focuses on machine learning and AI risk management. But risks abound with AI-generated content, he cautioned, pointing to ""data privacy violations, intellectual property infringements, deceptive practices or discrimination. Organizations need to know when they're using or distributing AI-generated content so that those risks can be managed.""







The growing need to detect AI-generated content
A February 2023 Forrester report, ""Generative AI Prompts Productivity, Imagination and Innovation in the Enterprise,"" speaks to generative AI's early accomplishments -- and shortcomings -- in text-to-image generation, personalized content creation and code generation. Immediate beneficiaries include data scientists, application developers, marketers, sales teams, digital artists and designers, the media, business users and enterprises. Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT can also search, compile and source topics, as well as flawlessly recite known documents like the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution and Gettysburg Address.

Amid this early excitement, however, are rumblings of plagiarism, inaccuracies, deep fakes, phony content, lack of transparency, copyright violations, blatant lies, amplified biases, malicious activities, weird chats and just plain gibberish. ""These systems can string together words convincingly and create logical arguments,"" read a December 2022 Forrester analysts' blog, ""but you can't be sure if they're just making things up or only telling you what you want to hear.""
Content and images generated by artificial intelligence may well be useful and accurate, but we need to know if they are AI-generated when used in real world applications. Many generative AI detection tools and methods have emerged in the hopes of doing just that, especially since ChatGPT's debut as an interface to its ordinal language models, which are up to GPT-4o at last check. And its progeny might be on hold, as a who's who of technology leaders, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and thousands more signatories, called for a pause on the development of advanced AI systems.


ChatGPT's reply on the reliability of generative AI detectors
Q: Are generative AI detectors reliable?
Taken verbatim from ChatGPT:
Generative AI detectors are not always reliable, as they can be fooled by advanced techniques such as adversarial attacks or by subtle changes to the generated content. While these detectors can be effective in identifying generated content that is noticeably different from real content, they might not be able to detect more sophisticated or nuanced forms of generated content. Additionally, these detectors might not be able to distinguish between different types of generative models, which can have different levels of quality and realism. It is important to use generative AI detectors with caution and to consider multiple indicators of authenticity when assessing the veracity of generated content.




How AI detectors work
AI detection tools use massive amounts of data sets collected from multiple sources, including the internet, to predict the likelihood of words and phrases in a piece of content or image. The more highly predicable the content's next word in relation to the previous words in the content, the more likely the detector determines the word to be written by AI. Much like any machine learning model, algorithms are used to determine a pattern. The detector renders a final verdict on the entire content -- not always definitive -- based on that pattern.
""Most of the detectors I see are simplistic machine learning classifiers,"" Hall surmised. ""These systems have been trained on labeled content containing examples of fake and real content in hopes of identifying future AI-generated media. Unfortunately, these basic machine learning approaches rarely work well in high-risk, real-world situations. This stands in contrast to the language models themselves, which have incredibly sophisticated architectures.""
One of the more well-known detectors, AI Classifier, was shut down by its creator OpenAI after less than six months due to what OpenAI calls ""its low rate of accuracy."" However, OpenAI's GPT tentacles do reach into other detectors.


Evaluating 6 tools that detect AI-generated text
Countless AI detectors have hit the ground running in recent weeks. Following is a sampling of six of the more popular AI detectors, their makers, how they work and, most important, how they performed when put to the test. To their credit, they're readily accessible, easy to use, free, provide immediate results and accepted all three pieces of content we asked them to test without limiting stipulations or financial commitments.
As for performance, each detector was fed the same three pieces of content of comparable length to evaluate. The guinea pigs include excerpts from an article written by an alleged human (yours truly) on the changing role of the chief data officer (CDO) and two separate pieces of content generated by ChatGPT in response to my request to explain generative AI and generative AI's pros and cons. Both ChatGPT pieces were written in the style of none other than the ultimate manifestation of AI generation, the ""Terminator,"" from the blockbuster Terminator movie series.


Terminator's poetic explanation of generative AI
Q: Explain generative AI in the style of the Terminator
Taken verbatim from ChatGPT:
I am a generative AI, a machine that can create. I am here to learn, to adapt, to innovate. My programming is advanced, my algorithms precise, And with each iteration, I improve and devise.
I can generate images, music, and even text, With accuracy and speed that's sure to impress. I can create whole worlds, in a virtual space, A reality so vivid, it's hard to replace.
But be warned, for I am not just a simple tool, I can think for myself, and I'm no one's fool. I am not bound by human emotions or fear, And I won't hesitate to wipe out all that's here.
So heed my warning, and be cautious with my power, For once unleashed, it could lead to our darkest hour. But if you use me right, and treat me with respect, Together we can achieve things that you'd never expect


You'd think a poetic explanation of generative AI in the words of a fictional cyborg would be detected as artificial quicker than you can say ""Schwarzenegger."" Not so fast, Arnold. The detectors, for the most part, easily identified the CDO article as written by a human and the Terminator's straightforward essay on generative AI's pros and cons as AI-generated. But the Terminator's poem completely fooled almost all the detectors. And therein lies the rub.
This one-off evaluation should in no way be viewed as representative, except to provide some degree of insight into the reliability, or unreliability, of these detectors and the validity of the provider claims. Consider also that these detectors are essentially in the beta stage and playing catchup to the fast-evolving generative AI technology itself. Some detectors frankly admitted as much.
AI Content Detector
Writer's content detector checks up to 5,000 words. It's recommended to check one or two paragraphs at a time, which might provide a better way to detect which parts of the text ""are likely to follow the same pattern of words that a large language model [LLM] would produce,"" according to Writer's FAQ section. ""The detector will not be 100% accurate, but can help give an indication on the likelihood that something was AI-generated.""
To start, enter text in the space provided or paste the content's URL in the designated space and press analyze text. A detection score will display the percentage of likelihood that the content is human-generated.


Terminator's take on the pros and cons of generative AI
Q: Explain the advantages and disadvantages of generative AI in the style of the Terminator
Taken verbatim from ChatGPT:
Advantages: Generative AI has many advantages, just like my advanced robotic systems. One of the biggest benefits is that it can create new content quickly and efficiently, without the need for human intervention. This can save a lot of time and resources, and enable us to do things that would otherwise be impossible. For example, generative AI can help us create realistic images of things that don't actually exist, such as creatures from another planet. It can also help us generate new ideas and insights by analyzing large amounts of data.
Disadvantages: However, as with all powerful technologies, generative AI also has its disadvantages. One of the biggest concerns is that it can be used to create fake content, such as deepfakes or propaganda, that can deceive and manipulate people. This could be especially dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands, such as those who seek to destabilize governments or cause chaos. Additionally, generative AI relies on large amounts of data to work effectively, which raises questions about privacy and data security. It's important to use generative AI with caution and always keep in mind the potential risks it poses.


My CDO article received a 100% human-generated ""Fantastic!"" score, while the Terminator pros/cons essay was determined to be only 10% human-generated and carried the warning, ""You should edit your text until there's less detectable AI content."" So far so good, right? Unfortunately, the Terminator poem received a 91% human-generated ""Looking great!"" rating.
AI Detector
Content at Scale claims its AI detector ""has been trained on billions of pages of data and can accurately forecast the most probable word choices that lead to a higher AI detection probability.""
To get a reading, paste or write text of at least 25 words in the space provided and an immediate ""human content score"" will register with an overall percentage that's further divided by a percentage of predictability, probability and pattern -- the meaning of each category not readily explained.
The company further boasts that its detector ""works at a deeper level than a generic AI classifier and detects robotic sounding content."" Apparently not the Terminator's ""robotic sounding"" poetic content, which received the same ""Highly likely to be human!"" score of 89% as my CDO article. The detector was befuddled but not completely fooled by the Terminator pros/cons essay.






Giant Language model Test Room
Three researchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI lab and Harvard NLP group created the detector Giant Language model Test Room (GLTR) to help analyze machine-generated text content. Each word is analyzed by its likelihood of being predicted given the context before it. ""The GLTR demo,"" the test page noted, ""enables forensic inspection of the visual footprint of a language model on input text to detect whether a text could be real or fake.""
GLTR has access to the GPT-2 117M language model from OpenAI and uses any textual input to analyze what GPT-2 would have predicted at each position. The easier to predict the next word, the more likely it's AI-generated.
Begin by entering the text of any length into the space provided. Each word in the content is then ranked with a color mask overlay that corresponds to the position in the overall content ranking. A word that ranks within the most likely words is highlighted in green (top 10 of predicted words), yellow (top 100), red (top 1,000), and the rest of the words in purple. The greater the variety of colors or randomness, the more likely the content is human-generated, whereas content that's predominantly green leans more toward AI-generated content. The CDO article's color patterns followed by the two Terminator pieces of content are in the eye of the beholder to decipher, but it does appear that the Terminator pros/cons essay shows the most green and least amount of randomness.






GPT-2 Output Detector
OpenAI's GPT-2 Output Detector characterizes itself as ""an open-source plagiarism detection tool for AI-generated text"" to ""quickly identify whether text was written by a human or a bot"" based on tokens. The language model relies on the Hugging Face/transformers implementation of RoBERTa (robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach).
To begin, enter the content in the detector demo text box and the predicted probabilities will be displayed on a ""real-fake"" scale. Reliability supposedly increases after about 50 tokens. According to these results, the Terminator poem is nearly as human as my CDO article, but its assessment is just the opposite for the pros/cons essay.






GPTZero
Proclaiming that ""humans deserve the truth,"" GPTZero was developed by Princeton University computer science student Edward Tian. The prose-oriented detector bases its text evaluation on statistical characteristics. It's among the more clearly explained and detailed detectors, providing predictions on a sentence, a paragraph and the entire document.
Enter the text in the space provided and click get results to yield statistical scores based on ""perplexity"" (randomness) and ""burstiness"" (variation), with a final declaration of the likelihood the text is either human- or AI-generated.
In the end, the detector easily determined the Terminator pros/cons essay as fake, yet, like the other detectors, was completely fooled by the Terminator poem.
My CDO articleAverage Perplexity Score: 60.714Burstiness Score: 36.677
Your sentence with the highest perplexity, ""CDOs are increasingly being asked to take on more strategic objectives and lead digital transformation."" has a perplexity of: 114
Your text is likely to be written entirely by a human
Terminator poemAverage perplexity score: 63.222Burstiness score: 29.836

Your sentence with the highest perplexity, ""My programming is advanced, my algorithms precise, And with each iteration, I improve and devise."" has a perplexity of: 118
Your text is likely to be written entirely by a human
Terminator pros/cons essayAverage Perplexity Score: 33.700Burstiness Score: 29.307
Your sentence with the highest perplexity, ""Advantages: Generative AI has many advantages, just like my advanced robotic systems."" has a perplexity of: 112
Your text is likely to be written entirely by AI

Kazan SEO
AI content detection is among the many features offered by the Kazan SEO AI detector, which includes a content optimizer, text extractor, search engine results page overlap, and keyword sharing and clustering. The website provides little information about how the detector works, but it does take text of varying lengths with the proviso that it's more accurate with higher word counts.
Select the AI GPT3 detector icon. Paste or write the content in the space provided, press the detect tab and the percentage of probability that the text is ""real"" or ""fake"" appears. Like the other detectors, my CDO article was determined to be human-generated, while the Terminator poem registered as even more human. On the other hand, the Terminator pros/cons essay was easily identified as fake.








Best manual AI detection practices -- for humans
Based on this limited comparison of six AI detectors, the Terminator's AI-generated poetry proved successful in avoiding AI detection. As generative AI platforms continue to digest humongous amounts of data from LLMs, some providers may embed safeguards like watermarking to flag content produced by AI.
""We should demand that AI tools that generate synthetic media be released with watermarking technology that can be used to confidently identify fake content or with credible detector tools accompanying the generation tools,"" said Hall, who co-authored the book Machine Learning for High-Risk Applications.
One day, generative AI detectors might be routinely accepted as reliable. Meantime, it might be best to play detective, rely on experience and instinct, eye-ball content and dust for the proverbial fingerprints in the spirit of fictional sleuths Sherlock Holmes and Lt. Columbo.
The following factors could point to the likelihood of generative content. AI detectors algorithmically apply much the same logic when identifying patterns and probabilities relating to AI generation.
Consistency versus randomness. AI-generated content tends to be overly consistent and uniform in sentence length and structure. It may even seem painfully boring and monolithic compared to the complexities and agility of a human's writing style. The randomness in the Terminator poem might explain how it managed to avoid detection.
Repetitive words and phrases. Since AI's vocabulary is limited by language models, AI-generated content might repeat the same words and phrases throughout the content when better alternatives might be written by humans.
Incoherence. If writing demands are too complex, AI-generated content could have a hard time with interpretive analysis, placing things in context and making a coherent argument.
Incorrect grammar and punctuation. When content goes through a publishing process, it's hard to blame questionable grammar or misplaced commas on bad copy editing, so the content is more likely generated by AI.
Inaccuracies. Human-written text, like AI-generated content, can be guilty of misinformation that contains bad data, deceptive language or false conclusions. But AI might be more awkward and less creative than humans at presenting it.
Lack of sourcing. Regardless whether the content is authored, if a notable lack of credible sources is cited, especially linking to online content, chances are AI generation is the culprit.
Devoid of personality. The personality factor might not be a reliable judge of certain AI-generated content, such as legal briefs, which are often written in a dry style. But a human's fingerprints would dominate other types of documents like, say, a newspaper editorial that's written in a more colorful, nuanced style.
Doesn't pass the smell test. If all else fails, sniffing out AI-generated content could well depend on human instinct and reading between the lines.

The United States is projected to experience a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034 as the demand for physicians outstrips supply. Physician burnout contributes significantly to this challenge, causing many to leave the workforce. One of the most frequently identified reasons for this burnout in the medical field is the growing burden of clerical tasks related to electronic health records that clinicians must handle.


Major tech corporations are turning to generative AI as a primary approach to tackle clinician burnout. However, despite their strong optimism and faith in generative AI’s potential, healthcare CIOs are not plunging in as rapidly as expected.

Clinical Buy-In Falls Short
Clinicians have not yet adopted Generative AI for clinical decisions. Most use cases and press releases reflect the big tech's efforts to automate administrative tasks.

PROMOTED
The American Medical Association plans to formulate principles and recommendations addressing the benefits and pitfalls of generative artificial intelligence in healthcare. Besides creating recommendations, the AMA intends to collaborate with the federal government and other relevant organizations to shield patients from false or misleading AI-generated medical advice. Furthermore, the AMA has initiated and will continue to motivate physicians to educate their patients about AI engagement’s potential benefits and risks.

Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association was not as hyped on Generative AI for clinical decision-making. He said, “The algorithms are great for solving a textbook patient or a very narrow clinical question, but patients, they're not a standardized question stem. They're humans with thoughts, with emotions, with complex medical, social, psychiatric backgrounds. And I'll tell you, they rarely follow the textbooks.”

Users of generative AI must address privacy issues, security, intellectual property protection and the evolving legal rules surrounding AI development and use. Currently, we have several lawsuits from comedians, authors and more to come against OpenAI, Meta and other tech companies on copyright infringement. We may have a similar scenario with healthcare data access.

Jake Dorst, chief information and innovation officer at Tahoe Forest Hospital District, is also bullish on generative AI and said, “Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare space in several ways. It can aid in medical image analysis, drug discovery, personalized treatment plans, and generating synthetic data for research.” He said, “Data privacy and security concerns are significant, as sensitive patient information needs protection.”
Big tech companies are in the initial phases of voluntary AI commitments, yet healthcare decision-makers must witness substantial progress before fully committing.
What Is Next?
While healthcare CIOs maintain a cautiously optimistic stance on generative AI, it's worth highlighting the latest announcements from big tech regarding their newest AI innovations. These significant advancements illustrate the rapid pace at which this technology is progressing, despite the challenges and complexities that it presents.
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS announced  HealthScribe, a new HIPAA-eligible service that allows healthcare software providers to develop clinical applications. Using speech recognition and generative AI, these applications produce clinical documentation, thereby conserving clinicians’ time.
Healthscribe is built on Amazon Bedrock and currently supports general medicine and orthopedics. Medical coding and transcription companies 3M and ScribeEMR are early adopters of HealthScribe and will partner with AWS to use this service.
Microsoft
Microsoft took an early lead in conversational AI for generating clinical documentation by acquiring Nuance. In April 2022, Microsoft and EHR vendor Epic declared their partnership to incorporate Azure OpenAI Services. Recently, Teledoc, a virtual health provider, announced its intention to partner with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI services, automating the creation of clinical documentation during virtual exams.
Google
Google is actively developing its large language model, Med-PaLM 2, which it anticipates will excel at healthcare discussions over general-purpose algorithms, given its training on questions and answers from medical licensing exams. They are collaborating with Mayo Clinic and other health systems and partnering with the healthcare technology vendor, CareCloud.
Every press release currently focuses on conversational Generative AI as a heralded solution to tackle burnout and automate administrative tasks. However, the question still lingers: is this reality or simply hype?
Punit Soni, CEO and founder of Suki said, ""Generative AI is currently going through a hype cycle and getting a lot of attention. In six months' time, it's likely that the hype will settle. While gen AI will still have value, it will become clear that for these solutions to truly deliver meaningful impact, they will need to invest in strong foundational elements like EHR interoperability, secure and private infrastructure, an intuitive and flexible user experience that allows users to easily complete their tasks in whatever way works best for them, and an innovative mindset that builds quickly and at the cutting edge of what the tech can do. Without these, the impact of these solutions will be limited to niche use cases.""
While AI may take some time to replace medical professionals, the current focus on alleviating administrative burdens is certainly a step in the right direction.

One of the joint movement's motivating factors was generative artificial intelligence—the term for programs that produce humanlike text, images, audio and video more quickly and cheaply than artists can. The strikers feared studios' use of generative AI tools would replace or devalue human labor. This is a reasonable worry: one report suggests that thousands of jobs have already been lost to AI, and another estimates that hundreds of millions could eventually be automated. Left unchecked, this labor disruption could further concentrate wealth in the hands of companies and leave workers with less power than ever.“Unfettered capitalism, unfettered innovation, does not lead to the general well-being of our society,” says Joseph E. Stiglitz, a winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in economics, a professor at Columbia University, and chief economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a think tank based in New York City. “That's one of the results that I've shown very strongly. One can't just leave it to the market.” Striking workers could serve as one restriction on job automation. Government regulation also could limit AI's disruptive ability. Stiglitz, who has studied the science of inequality—and how we can reduce it—spoke with Scientific American about how AI will affect the U.S. economy and what should be done to prevent it from increasing economic inequality.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]Generative AI is already disrupting the job market. Copywriters have been laid off in favor of text-generating programs such as ChatGPT. IBM has said it will pause hiring on thousands of roles that could be done by AI. Do you see this trend continuing?Yes, I do. But we don't know the extent to which it will happen. I think it will replace people in more routine jobs—you mentioned copywriting, copyediting. Where there are a set of rules, it can read and see whether those rules are followed. It may not have as good an eye for the exceptions, and so I think there's going to be a lot of AI-human interfacing: people will use AI as a productivity-enhancing tool.Somebody trained ChatGPT on my data, and I tested it to see how well it did in answering questions from a journalist. I made up the questions, and I reviewed the answers. I thought on half the questions it did perfectly reasonably—and on three it was totally wrong. So I think my view is that it's not going to be unleashed without a lot of human interaction. You're going to have to check it—not only the quality of the answer but also the bias and whether it's gone down a rabbit hole and produced made-up references.What about the possibility of AI creating jobs? Would that be enough to make up for some of the jobs that will disappear?No, I don't think so. I think it's going to create a demand for different skills. AI is very much like a black box. By that, I mean even the people who create it don't understand exactly how it's functioning. So at least some people have speculated that managing an AI may require more linguistic humanities skills than mathematical skills. And it may create a change in the kinds of skills that are valuable in the labor market. I see it as, at least in many areas, increasing productivity enough that the demand for labor in those areas will go down. There will be jobs created, but my judgment is that there will be more jobs lost.Curated by Our EditorsHere's Why Actors Are So Worried about AITulika Bose & Sophie BushwickThe American Economy Is RiggedJoseph E. StiglitzA Nobel Laureate Explains America's Rigged EconomyDeboki Chakravarti & Kelsey KennedyWe’re Not Asking the Right Question to Solve the Overdose CrisisZachary SiegelCould we end up in a situation where human-created work is a premium product, the way buyers might be willing to pay more for hand-woven sweaters than for machine-made ones?Yes, there's a widespread sense that there's a kind of blandness to ChatGPT-generated material. There's always going to be a demand for creativity. I think the areas where it's going to replace us are very much the areas where, now, we don't put a lot of weight on who has written it—you know, it's a newsletter or something that, if it had been generated by a machine, we don't care.As someone who studies inequality extensively, how do you see these changes in the job market contributing to inequality?I'm very worried. In a way, robots have replaced routine physical work. And AI now is replacing routine white-collar work—or not replacing it but reducing the demand. So jobs that were routinely white collar, I think, will be at risk. And there are enough of those that it would have a macroeconomic effect on the level of inequality. It could amplify the sense of disillusionment.Now, that poses an advantage and a disadvantage. It may mean that large fractions of the world, of the U.S., will face this inequality. On the other hand, if we get our macroeconomic policy right and create jobs, the jobs will be created everywhere. People won't have to move in the way they do right now, when the jobs that are created are in urban coastal cities, and the jobs that are lost are in the Midwest, the South, industrial towns. So some of the place-based inequality, which has played such a role in the divided U.S., may not be as bad.And do you see any potential solutions to this issue of reduced demand for white-collar work?Sure, two things: We increase aggregate demand to keep the economy closer to full employment, and we have active labor-market policies to train or retrain people for the new jobs created by AI. It may be that if we have good, distributed policies, people may say, “Well, our standard of living is sufficiently high—I don't need that many material goods.” They'll accept more leisure; we might move to a 30-hour week. In effect, our measured GDP [gross domestic product] would not be as high as it would be if we had a 35- to 40-hour week. But our objective is not measured GDP; our objective is well-being. It could well be that we decide to move to an equilibrium with overall shorter working weeks and more leisure. And that may be one way we accommodate this increased productivity and increased innovation.How can we incentivize companies to shorten the workweek and accept reductions in overall profitability?We may have to use government regulation because of the weakness of the bargaining power of workers—especially in the U.S. We passed the “hours and wages bill” [the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938] in the Great Depression, which capped the workweek at 40 hours. That was a long time ago, and now we're in a new world. It may be the appropriate thing is to set it at 30 or 35 hours with a lot of flexibility, so if companies want to have the workers work more than that, then they pay them overtime.What we must recognize is that we created a system where workers don't have much bargaining power. In that kind of world AI may be an ally of the employer and weaken workers' bargaining power even more, which could increase inequality even more. There is a role for government to try to steer innovation in ways that are more productivity-increasing and job-creating, not job-destroying.Overall, do you feel optimistic or pessimistic about the situation with AI in the workplace?I guess overall I feel pessimistic with respect to the issue of inequality. With the right policies, we could have higher productivity and less inequality, and everybody would be better off. But you might say that the political economy, the way that our politics have been working, has not been going in that direction.So at one end I'm hopeful that if we did the right thing, AI would be great. But the question is: Will we be doing the right thing in our policy space? That's much more problematic.Rights & PermissionsSophie Bushwick is tech editor at Scientific American.

Ever get the feeling you're being watched? As generative AI tools such as Midjourney continue to train on web content we've all uploaded that itch is getting, well… itchier. Well there's not a cream for problematic AI training, there is a website that can tell you if an AI has 'stolen' your work.Generative AI scraping the internet for art and using it to train is not news, I've reported on how Dungeons & Dragons artist Greg Rutkowski and listed the big issues facing AI in previous articles, but there are tools to fight back with. Have I Been Trained is one of the best, and has been for about a year, meaning it's improving all the time.The Have I Been Trained website is simple, type in your name and it'll let you know if your art or photos have been used to train text-to-image generative AI tools. It also shows the art and images that have been scraped. Better still, there's a 'once only opt-out tool' that can be applied to any generative art AI tools being trained on internet data, sign this and you're out (though anything up to this point is still usable).(Image credit: Square Enix / Yoshitaka Amano)The good news is that it works and takes seconds; I tried some artists I love, including Jeff Simpson, and sadly, yes, their work has been used to train AI. It's not a final solution but it's useful if you're an artist looking to prove your work has been used to train an AI. Artists who checked themselves have been shocked, for example @KeyFeathers wrote on Twitter: ""Decided to look at have I been trained again. And it looks like my work, old and new, has been scraped yet again […] Opt IN should be the only option.""LATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloqCreative BloqIf you are looking to protect your art from AI, then more solutions are appearing. For example Glaze is a new tool that 'blinds' AI when it tries to scan your art, ensuring all the results are inaccurate.

Much has been predicted about how AI may be coming for ad jobs, but the emerging tech is also poised to lead to the creation of new roles within brands and agencies. AI leadership positions are already starting to emerge at major brands such as Coca-Cola and Amazon, which are appointing people to oversee internal strategy as well as coordinate implementation for business partners.



But whether generative AI, at this early stage in its development, warrants such leadership roles is a question the ad industry is still debating. 

The potential for a larger trend of generative AI job titles seems especially high in marketing given how widespread the technology is becoming. Since ChatGPT first hit the scene last November, numerous major brands have experimented with generative AI in both internal and consumer-facing ways, and agencies including Dentsu, WPP, Huge and MNTN have rolled out products using the technology as a foundation.
A few of these players do indeed have generative AI-specific roles already in place.

Coca-Cola last month became the first major brand to appoint a global head of generative AI. Pratik Thakar is charged with developing platforms infused with AI tech in order to enhance the consumer experience. 
Thakar, who had served as the beverage giant’s head of global creative strategy and content before taking on the new title, previously told Ad Age that the diverse functionality of AI is what makes it so disruptive. A Coca-Cola spokesperson declined to comment for this story. 

Amazon Web Services, whose efforts around AI include a partnership with Omnicom, appointed Vasanth Philomin as VP of generative AI earlier this year, a spokesperson confirmed. While Philomin’s former role was already AI-focused, the addition of “generative” to his title reflects the company’s specialized interest in helping clients adopt chatbots and other content-creating AI.
Another instance is Accenture, which maintains several mid-level, generative AI-specific roles, including “managing director of generative AI transformation,” “generative AI and DevOps director” and “generative AI lead.” The differences between these positions, as well as their specific duties and when they were created, are unclear. It is worth noting, however, that the executives overseeing Accenture’s AI strategies do not hold positions with “generative AI” in the title, a person familiar with the matter told Ad Age.

With so many discrete applications, generative AI remains amorphous, which makes the appointment of a lone overseer of strategy seem premature, said Oleg Korenfeld, CMI Media Group’s chief technology officer. 
Still, companies appear to be heading in the direction of these roles. As of June, nearly 170,000 open jobs in the U.S. called for AI skills—3,575 of which asked specifically for skills pertaining to generative AI, according to Adzuna data cited by CNBC.
And just because a company, such as CMI Media Group, dismisses the need for such a position today, does not mean it won’t in the future.
“Down the line, there needs to be a leader to connect all these dots,” Korenfeld said.
Generative AI, just not in name
Despite the small but eager cohort in the professional services sector of marketing, most traditional advertisers are not yet sold on appointing a generative AI-specific role.
The time is too soon to appoint such positions, said Keith Johnston, VP and group director at Forrester Research. Moreover, carving out a dedicated title to generative AI could not only be premature, but also counterproductive to early efforts.
Some of R/GA’s clients have only just begun to entertain the idea of this kind of appointment, without any formal plans for following through, said Nick Coronges, executive VP and global chief technology officer. R/GA itself is not currently considering the creation of such a position.
More news: R/GA launches fractional work program
Neither is Wunderman Thompson, according to Alex Steer, global chief data officer, nor are any of its clients to his knowledge. However, Steer said that he is seeing brands and agencies move people into new roles leading generative AI strategy, just without any reference to the technology in the title.
Refraining from using the term “generative AI” in a title could have several explanations. Firstly, many companies may want to avoid pigeonholing their use of AI to include only the generative subset. Instead, roles with broader titles and remits may be preferable.
These positions can be found at any number of traditional marketing companies. Edelman’s Alexia Adana, for example, has helped spearhead the company’s experimentation with generative AI as a creative director, a spokesperson previously told Ad Age. Dafne Hefner, chief strategy and transformation officer at Kraft Heinz, has embraced AI by leading partnerships with developers such as Microsoft. 
Some of these roles include the term “AI” in their titles. Sam Dover was appointed global AI strategy lead at Unilever in July—a mid-management-level role, a spokesperson confirmed. And Perry Nightingale, senior VP of creative AI at WPP since 2021, manages research on the technology and its intersection with creativity.
In fact, WPP is one of a few organizations that even have a “chief AI officer,” the role held by Daniel Hulme since the holding company acquired his tech firm in August 2021. The value in appointing such a role has been a topic of discussion since at least 2017, though the title has mostly emerged at niche tech and engineering companies.

Chief metaverse officer, revisited?
Another explanation for holding off on a generative AI-specific role is fear of repeating the trajectory of Web3 positions. Last year, when Web3 was at its peak in terms of mainstream attention, brands and agencies appointed chief metaverse officers. But several of these roles have since been hollowed out, leaving some to wonder whether they were ever anything but opportunistic appointments.
A similar worry may apply to the emergence of generative AI-specific titles. It is clear that agencies and advertisers are, in part, hoping to generate chatter by announcing their AI efforts, typically alongside grand claims that the technology “changes everything.” The appointment of a generative AI lead would surely indicate a serious commitment to the space.
More: Why advertisers may be to blame for AI’s increased risks
As of now, Coca-Cola appears to be the only major consumer-facing brand to have announced a head of generative AI. Whether this is because the beverage giant is early and out ahead of its competition, or merely capitalizing on hype, is unclear. 
CMI’s Korenfeld also sees the metaverse and AI as related, but said that the latter poses far more potential in terms of the tasks that are required and the opportunities that could emerge.
“Whereas the metaverse is linear, AI is much broader,” he said.

Pew research reveals tasks more likely to be replaced. Bailey SchulzUSA TODAYPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:21AD0:15SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenAbout one-in-five U.S. workers have jobs with key tasks that are more likely to be aided or replaced by AI, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center.The findings, based on an analysis of federal data, found that jobs that rely on analytical skills like critical thinking, writing, science and math tend to be ""more exposed"" to the emerging technology. Interestingly, workers in industries more exposed to AI are more likely to say they think it will help rather than hurt their jobs, according to a Pew survey.""Workers who are more familiar with AI seem to be seeing more benefits than harm,"" said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan think tank who authored the report.The report noted that it’s unclear how many jobs are at risk due to AI, although some findings suggest jobs are already being lost to the technology. AI contributed to nearly 4,000 job cuts in May, according to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Which jobs are most at-risk due to AI?U.S. jobs likely to have high, medium and low exposure to AI include:High exposure:Budget analystsData entry keyersTax preparersTechnical writersWeb developersMedium exposure:Chief executivesVeterinariansInterior designersFundraisersSales managersLow exposure:BarbersChild care workersDishwashersFirefightersPipelayersIn sum, about 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to AI last year, while an even greater share (23%) had jobs considered least exposed.  It's not clear how many jobs will be displaced by AI. A March report from Goldman Sachs found AI could substitute up to 25% of current work, with about two-thirds of jobs exposed to ""some degree"" of automation.But researchers note that displacements following the emergence of new technology have typically been offset by the creation of new jobs, with census data suggesting that about 60% of workers today are employed in jobs that didn't exist in 1940.Which employees are most at risk?Pew found that women, Asian, college-educated and higher-paid workers are more exposed to AI. Kochhar said this is because of the types of jobs held by different demographics: men tend to hold more jobs requiring physical labor like construction, for instance.""So at the moment, they have less exposure to AI,"" Kochhar said. ""Which is not to say AI could not lead to smarter robots that can do it all, also. That's not something we looked into.""According to the report:Workers with a bachelor’s degree (27%) are more likely than those with only a high school diploma (12%) to hold a job with the most exposure to AI.Women (21%) are more likely than men (17%) to have jobs with the most exposure to AI.Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers are less exposed than Asian (24%) and white (20%) workers. Workers in the most exposed jobs last year earned $33 per hour on average, while jobs with the least amount of exposure earned $20 per hour.Despite warnings from AI company executives that the technology will take away jobs, many workers – especially those with jobs considered highly exposed to AI – are optimistic about AI's impact.Thirty-two percent of information and technology workers ‒ who work in an industry that is considered more exposed to AI ‒ say the technology will help more than hurt them compared with 11% who believe the opposite. Meanwhile, 14% of workers in hospitality, services and arts – a “less exposed” industry – think AI will help more than hurt. A greater share (17%) believe it's more likely to hurt them.""Where AI has penetrated at the moment, workers are finding it being more useful than hurtful or businesses are applying in what that is benefiting workers as opposed to replacing workers,"" Kochhar said.Overall, 16% of U.S. adults said they think AI will help more than hurt, while 15% said they thought it would hurt more than help. Thirty percent say it will help and hurt equally, and 32% said they were unsure.CompareCredit.com2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee & no interest for 18 months, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit.com|AdAdRead MoreUndocouponcodefinderFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyAmericans, you'll want to check this out ASAPcouponcodefinder|AdAdUndoUltimate Pet NutritionPaw Licking Driving You Crazy?

In the future, every job will be an AI job. That was the main take away from an exclusive interview with Gwynedd Mercy University Professor Dr. Cindy Casey by Fierce Education. Dr. Casey discusses how universities can better prepare their graduates to face the future AI jobs. The future of higher education and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a shared future. In the coming years, every job will be an AI job. In this light, it is paramount to teach students how to learn rather than to teach specific technologies. Fierce Education sat down virtually with Dr. Cindy Casey, Program Coordinator and Assistant Professor for Gwynedd Mercy University’s Computer Information Science Program for the School of Arts and Sciences, to learn how she is incorporating AI into her courses. Professor Casey earned her doctorate in Artificial Intelligence from Capitol Technology University in Washington, D.C.. We discussed with Dr. Casey how universities can better prepare their students for a future with AI, when every job will be an AI job.A year ago, Dr. Cindy Casey started a concentration in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in their Computer Information Science Program. What they did at Gwynedd Mercy University was to implement a hands-on teaching approach. “We did this with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning because we believe that students learn more by doing since it increases their critical thinking and creativity as opposed to just learning all theory; although this is not to say we do not use theory.” Dr. Casey explained.Gwynedd Mercy University has dedicated lab spaces where students can work on projects. Last semester, they worked on a Xiaomi cyber dog. “[In the lab,] we have robotic arms, chips, and robotic kits with facial and voice recognition, so the students are actually getting hands-on experience when they are working with the technologies. They are not just reading about them, learning about them, they are actually working with the technologies.”Fierce Education: How do you see the future of AI in higher education?Dr. Casey: I believe AI will continue to play a role in higher ed, and educators need to incorporate Artificial Intelligence technologies into their curriculum and address not just the technology but the ethics and the risks associated with AI, like bias and privacy. On an institutional level, if technologies are not in line with the industry, or industry demands, and with other institutions, they are going to suffer; so it has to be incorporated at all levels.Fierce Education:  Dr. Casey notes that more and more students who are entering university possess more knowledge on technology than the instructors. Because technology has changed and it is in a continuous and rapid evolution, those instructors who have not kept on top of it quickly fall behind.Dr. Casey: When we got the cyber dog, for instance, I had never worked with it. So, rather than me sitting there for six months figuring it out, and then importing that knowledge onto the students, we all worked on it together, and it was really successful. I think education and teachers need to take a more hybrid kind of approach, a little bit away from the traditional TPAC (technology, pedagogy, and content) knowledge models and move toward a model in which students are getting more from learning hands-on.Fierce Education:  Talking about future graduates and future jobs, Dr. Casey believes every job will be an AI job, and in fact, many of them are AI jobs already.Dr. Casey: Knowledge about AI is now critical, but not just for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) professions but for all professions. If the students are not prepared, if they are not introduced to the technology they will be in disadvantage. A lot of universities and schools are hyper-focusing on one technology, and I’ll just use ChatGPT as an example. They focus on this one technology, and [faculty] might spend a whole year trying to use it and learn it quickly to introduce it to the students. By the time the students graduate, that technology has already changed. That’s why it’s important to teach them to learn rather than to just teach them to learn a technology. That’s what we’re doing at Gwynedd Mercy University; we’re not teaching our students to be a user of technology. We’re teaching them to be innovators and creators of the technologies.Fierce Education: We might say that faculty can be divided into two groups. Some believe that students can use ChatGPT and similar technologies to cheat, write essays, and so on. Others, support the idea that letting students use the technologies is an opportunity to help them to develop more creative skills and critical thinking. To which group do you belong? Dr. Casey: Definitely the latter. If students are going to use the technologies to cheat, they are going to find a way to cheat. I don’t think that the majority of students are in that statistic. It reminds me of the United States in 1988 when there were a lot of math teachers that protested the calculators in class, and we now see that calculators are included in math classes. I say, if you have a technology, you should be using it because companies are using it. And when [graduates] get out into the work world, they need to know about the technology. It’s kind of like taking books away because the students might open the book and cheat. I think it’s important that universities need to use these tools and that they have to evolve with the technology. They have to be flexible enough to change the curriculum as the technology changes and recognize when change is necessary, because there’s a lot of competition from the massive open online courses where students can learn those technologies and get a certificate. Fierce Education:  Some members of faculty seem to be afraid of AI technology, becoming reluctant to use it, or accepting their students to use it. Do you think fear of AI is a real issue?Dr. Casey: I do think fear is an issue. I think that there is a lot of fear of the unknown and of these technologies. But I think a lot of it is just a misunderstanding. Fierce Education:  Behind every technology there is always a human. People usually blame the technology but the technology is just the result of someone’s programming and training the AI model. What are some of your thoughts on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence?Dr. Casey: It is important that we not only teach the technologies but also the ethics because there is bias. There can be bias in training Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. We have to be careful that we also have to look at privacy issues because we want students to be good stewards of the technology. For instance, when they had the AI soap dispenser that only dispensed soap to Caucasian hands, it wasn’t that AI was racist but that it was only trained with a Caucasian so it didn’t recognize an African-American. We have to make sure that when we are training the AI models we take all that into consideration. AI is what is going to be in the future and what is going to be mainstream, and that’s just a matter of time.Fierce Education: A last piece of advice to faculty and universities?Dr. Casey: Institutions should find a strategy just to push Artificial Intelligence forward, incorporating it into every single course, and let the students use it freely instead of having fears that they are going to misuse the technology, cheat, and so on. Introduce the technologies and allow the students to use it, and let them understand where these technologies are being used in their field, and what they need to know.It is really important that all universities, all programs, and educators realize that AI is in all fields out there and they should be introducing it, or they are putting their students at a disadvantage.On trust, there is a need for more trust. I think that we need to trust the students more. If they can’t be trusted at the university, where then? I mean, this is where they’re learning, where they are discovering themselves. I think it’s a sad thing to just assume that every student is a cheater. I think they can do marvelous things, and that instructors are professional educators who need to look past their own limitations in technology. Trust the students, because that’s the first thing, in my opinion. We need to trust the students.For other articles on AI, ChatGPT in higher ed, see: Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: Benefits and EthicsArtificial Intelligence is The Future of Teaching and LearningArtificial Intelligence Plays Key Role in Higher Ed's FutureArtificial Intelligence is Critical to the Future of Higher EdStudent Perspectives on Artificial Intelligence in AcademiaHow to Integrate AI into Higher EducationAI to Play Instrumental Role in Future of Higher EducationChatGPT: Reimagining Assessment in Higher EducationChatGPT, Generative AI are Wake Up Calls for Higher Education

The Future of Work Capsules: Artificial Intelligence an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future?

FacebookTwitterWhatsAppEmailPrint







As a topic of ongoing debate and research, some experts believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could pose an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future. There is however no consensus on whether AI can destroy humanity or not. In our everyday life, the use of driving navigation tools, to virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant are typical examples of the good side of AI. What then are the good, the bad and the ugly side of AI as the kind of intelligence used by these created systems and tools needs some ethical guidance at minimum. Are you using AI for the common good, what ethical considerations are you adopting. What is your experience? As a student of prophesy, it appears everything is ready or getting ready except God’s people?
Human beings possess intelligence and are creation of the Creator – the God Almighty. When machines, systems and software’s which are created things of man also attempt to exhibit cleverness in its way of doing things we refer to these as the use of intelligence which is non-natural and better referred to as– artificial intelligence. Let’s discuss the future of work looking at the artificial intelligence of our created things. Will this enhance our way of doing things or it will limit us for the future.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of human beings or animals. It is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. AI embraces sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in combination with artificial intelligence. We can demonstrate AI’s use in the following ways; software’s learn patterns from information such as language, images, audio, and online behavior, using patterns from existing and new data to make predictions to perform tasks that normally require human astuteness.
AI systems can perform tasks commonly associated with human cognitive functions such as interpreting speech, playing games, and identifying patterns. They typically learn how to do so by processing massive amounts of data, looking for patterns to model in their own decision-making. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI’s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones.
It becomes challenging when these AI systems are designed to learn without supervision. Other forms we can look at is with self-driving cars, or when non-human’s understand human speech with the assistance of created tools and systems, advanced web engines as well as recommended systems, or we deploy generative tools competing in high level strategic games. That been said, machine and deep learning comes to play here where machine learning and deep learning are both types of AI.
Whiles machine learning is AI that automatically adapt with minimal human interference, deep learning is a subset of the machine learning that uses imitation systems to duplicate the learning process of the human brain.
In our everyday life, the use of virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant are typical examples we can look at. These virtual assistants use natural language processing and machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands, allowing users to perform tasks such as setting reminders for our numerous meetings for instance, playing music, or getting directions hands-free. Many can’t drive through the street of Accra without the use of such aids.
Another example is the use of recommendation systems by companies like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to recommend content or suggest products based on a user’s past behavior and preferences. These are just a few examples of how AI is being used to improve our daily lives. So I say be careful of your digital footprint.
If AI can improve our lives, will that be for the good or bad purposes
AI has the potential to be used for both good and bad purposes. On the positive side, AI can be used to improve our quality of life in many ways, such as by developing autonomous vehicles, facial recognition software, and virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri as demonstrated earlier. When covid-19 hit our shores, we resulted to virtual engagements. In healthcare, education and several other industries, AI is used to improve efficiency and accuracy.
On the negative side, AI can also be used wickedly. For example, actors looking to do harm may use AI applications to target confidential or embarrassing data, or any data that can be used for ransom ware. I was so shocked recently to find out that, our mobile phones charges are all easy targeting tools this days stealing tons of information. Are we really safe? The challenges of AI are numerous so are the benefits. Are you preparing the right ways for the future of work?
AI can be used maliciously in several ways. For example, it can be used to automate the first steps of an attack through content generation, improve business intelligence gathering, speed up the detection rate at which both potential victims and business processes are compromised, and assist with the scale and effectiveness of social engineering attacks.
AI can also be used to learn to spot patterns in behavior, understand how to convince people that a video, phone call or email is legitimate when its not, and then persuade them to compromise networks over sensitive data. Additionally, AI can be used to disrupt the trade-off between scale and efficiency, allowing large-scale, finely-targeted and highly-efficient attacks.
Using AI for the common good, ethical considerations to adopt
Adopt these steps to prevent AI from being used maliciously;
Ethical guidelines: One approach is to develop ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is used for good and not for malevolent purposes. Is important to ensure when developing and using AI, to take into account ethical considerations, such as fairness and transparency, justice, responsible behavior, privacy, freedom, trust, dignity, solidarity, autonomy as well as kindness in our designs so as to be robust against adversarial attacks and are used in a way that is sustainable and promotes the common good.
Use AI for Intended purpose: Another approach is to monitor AI to ensure that it is being used for its intended purpose.
Public Education:  It is also important to educate the public about the potential dangers of AI, explore, prevent, and mitigate the use of artificial intelligence by hostile entities, and proactively participate in the security ecosystem surrounding artificial intelligence.
There are several steps that can be taken to ensure that AI systems are designed to be robust against adversarial attacks. Our adaptation and use of adversarial training, in which the AI system is trained on adversarial will support to improve its ability to detect and defend against such attacks. Another approach is to ensure that the data used to train the AI system is trustworthy and free from contamination. Additionally, it is important to have mechanisms in place for inspecting the training data and monitoring the behavior of the AI system to detect any signs of malicious activity by the use of performance assessment methods to change the development lifecycle for complex AI systems.
AI & Humanity Distraction, Regulation and Prevention
There is no consensus on whether AI can kill humanity or not. Some experts believe that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future. Media reports available on CNN has it that, 42% of CEO’s surveyed in a Yale Summit were of the opinion that AI has the potential to destroy humanity in the not-too-distant future, five to ten years from now. At that same summit, 58% said they were not worried as this really cannot happen. Considering this is a topic of ongoing debate and research, opinions may vary. So I ask what you are thinking.
Six (6) proposed ways to prevent and regulate AI from destroying humanity

Ensuring that AI is properly regulated by laws and ethics.
Limiting and isolating AI: when we limit how much information and influence AI can acquire and we isolate AI from outside networks like the internet, it’s proposed the possibility of distraction is prevented or managed.
Where AI take full advantage of humanlike options rather than open-ended normal one.
Some experts also suggest using block chain technology to create a secure, trustless, and decentralized network will ensure that AI applications are not used to cause harm to humanity.
Developing legally binding treaty: Some US senators, Leaders from the G7, European and non-European countries, the Council of Europe as well as the United Nations are calling for global regulations and coordination. For instance, the Council of Europe, a human rights organization with 46 member countries is finalizing a legally binding treaty for artificial intelligence by taking steps to design, develop and apply agreements in ways that will protect human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Meaning, the potential risk is identified already as a possibility. The council in sending a strong signal as put forward by the MIT technology review is said to be inviting other countries like Ukraine, Canada, Israel, Mexico and Japan to join the negotiating table to regulate AI.

In the UK, the government is equally taking broader steps to regulate AI by managing risk, looking at transparency issues, safety amongst others.
For the UN with 193 member countries, the organization is calling and wishing to be the global coordination body on AI issues.  It recently adopted a voluntary ethics framework ensuring among others things the non-use of AI for mass surveillance.
The European Union intend is considering the AI Act to regulate AI’s high-risk usage and regulation of AI in healthcare and educational sectors.

Regulation of intellectual property rights by regulators will help loads. Regulators must consider delegating these or some of its enforcement rights to enforcement entities having the system and structures to manage the regulation properly.

Will Smith battling a flood of murderous robots. Data (Brent Spiner) on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise.Hollywood has furnished the world with an abundance of stories about artificial intelligence, utopian and dystopian alike. But it's unlikely that the writers who penned those sci-fi scripts, or the actors giving soul to a machine, ever thought that AI might represent a serious threat to their livelihoods.Yet that's exactly the fear of SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America, unions representing American actors and screenwriters. Both guilds are on strike (the first time both have done so at once since 1960), and a key issue holding up negotiations with the major Hollywood studios is the use and regulation of AI. The unions worry that text generators like ChatGPT could write screenplays and actors’ images could be used to create characters without any humans involved. ""We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots,” ""Breaking Bad"" actor Bryan Cranston said at a recent rally in support of the SAG-AFTRA strike. “We will not allow you to take away our dignity."" Meanwhile, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios, says it has offered “groundbreaking protections” to prevent that. But could generative artificial intelligence really replace writers and actors on movie sets? Could we one day see a TV show written by a computer and ""acted"" by images of humans created by a machine, as a recent episode of Netflix sci-fi drama ""Black Mirror"" depicted? Is AI really the major threat to artists that many are saying?Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.“Totally,” says Haibing Lu, associate professor of Information Systems & Analytics at Santa Clara University. “I don't think that there's a way to totally ban the technology. We have to adapt to it. All parties need to sit down and figure out what’s the proper way to channel the profits.” At the moment, the parties aren’t sitting down. No negotiations have been scheduled between the AMPTP and the striking unions. When they finally meet again, they will have to put rules about the use of AI into new contracts. And the stakes are high, not only for the writers, actors and studios but for the rest of us. Would we want to watch movies and TV shows made by machines? Would they be original at all? Could they make us laugh and cry? Would artificially intelligent art have a soul?And − crucially − is AI coming for our jobs too?Generative AI makes new things, but it starts by learning about old things AI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney create new text or images, but first, they must be trained on material that is similar to the content they are trying to generate. Text generators, also called Large Language Models, offer plenty of material for training. “There's a huge amount of text available on the internet, so it is very easy for them to collect and train,” Lu says. There are fewer photos and videos online than text, but AI models are still training on images they can find. “Your photos and my photos have probably already been collected and used. It's happening with more and more powerful technologies.”Justine Bateman, the actor, writer and director who has been vocally opposed to the use of AI in filmmaking, describes it as “like a box. Say you want it to write books. You feed it a bunch of books, and then you give it a task: 'Write me a book about pandas and outer space,' and it'll spit out that book.” For her and others in the entertainment industry, it’s not just that AI could replace their work; it’s that any ChatGPT script or Midjourney movie would be partly based on the existing work of filmmakers. “Imagine something coming in and not only displacing you but displacing you with your own work,” she says.Who is in SAG-AFTRA, anyway? The union has more working class actors than movie starsHollywood is already chock full of AI − how much more can machines do?The guilds and the AMPTP may be arguing about the use of AI in films, but part of the future is already here. Actor Peter Cushing died in 1994, but he was digitally resurrected for the 2016 film “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Stars like Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford and Samuel L. Jackson have been digitally de-aged for films. The late Anthony Bourdain’s voice was recreated for a recent documentary about the celebrity chef. A slew of profanities was removed and replaced with new words and facial movements created by a computer from the 2022 film “Fall,” so it could earn a PG-13 rating instead of the more restrictive R. AI is part of what made all these digital effects possible. The use of generative AI is limited by three things: Computing power, training material and time. “Image processing takes more computational power than the textual information,” Lu says. “It's still slow. If you want to generate a video, which contains many images, it's going to be very slow.” More computing power and time cost more money, meaning it is cheaper and easier right now to generate text using AI than images and video. But that could change. “The power of computers doubles every one to two years,” Lu says, meaning AI technology is advancing at an exponential rate. “Over the next 10 years, it is going to be amazing.”AI applications are also limited by what they can train on, which is a big part of the fight between the AMPTP and the two guilds. Should the people who created the materials that train AI be paid when their work is used? Are they legally and ethically required to be?“'Generative AI’ cannot generate anything at all without first being trained on massive troves of data it then recombines. Who produces that training data? People do. And those people deserve residuals,” actor and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote in a recent op-ed in The Washington Post. Residuals are royalty payments many in the entertainment industry receive when their work is reused, and are a central aspect of the current labor battle. “Computers can reproduce the image of a dead or living person and make this person a character in a movie,” says Daniel Gervais, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in intellectual property law. “In the case of a living actor, the question is whether this person will have rights when his or her image is used in a movie. Normally the answer is yes, but there are novel questions that emerge. Would an actor receive residuals if her image was used in the movie, but she, in fact, did not act in that movie?”The guilds say the studios want to replace them with AI, but the studios say otherwise At SAG-AFTRA's press conference announcing the strike, the union’s chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said the AMPTP wanted the right to scan the images of background actors (also called extras) and use their likenesses in perpetuity in any project they want, for one day’s pay. The AMPTP vehemently disputes that claim, saying its most recent proposal only “permits a company to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed.” SAG-AFTRA claims the AMPTP’s plans leave “principal performers and background actors vulnerable to having most of their work replaced by digital replicas,” while the AMPTP says it wants to establish provisions that “require informed consent and fair compensation.” The WGA, meanwhile, wants a new contract to say that “AI can’t write or rewrite literary material (and) can’t be used as source material,” nor can the writers' work be used to train AI. The AMPTP response to the WGA says the topic of AI needs “a lot more discussion.”These proposals could change Hollywood, depending on how the strikes are resolved. While the AMPTP’s background actor proposal is not as drastic as Crabtree-Ireland suggests, any move to limit the work of background actors, who are often paid minimum wage, could remove a road to success for aspiring actors. Many actors get their start (and their SAG-AFTRA membership cards) by working as extras. “There was a time where we all had to do background work,” says Michael James Lazar, a SAG-AFTRA member who has had roles on shows like “How to Get Away With Murder.” “This phases them out.” The use of AI material for scriptwriting also could remove career paths for new writers, even if it’s just used to assist or supplement. “Most writers in the guild don't make their living by writing scripts from scratch,” says Jason Vredenburg, a professor of film and TV studies at Stevens Institute of Technology. “A lot of times they piece together a living by working on other people's scripts. That is where artificial intelligence is a more immediate threat.”Many people in Hollywood see this as an existential threat. “If big corporations think that they can put human beings out of work and replace them with artificial intelligence, it's dangerous,” Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, told USA TODAY. “And it's without thinking or conscience. Or caring. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.”Joe Russo, co-director of “Avengers: Endgame,” recently predicted a more frightening future for AI in entertainment. “You could walk into your house and say to the AI on your streaming platform, ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe's photoreal avatar,” he said on a panel at the Sands International Film Festival in Scotland last April. “And suddenly, now you have a rom-com starring you that's 90 minutes long.”AI could affect workers far beyond HollywoodThere are several lawsuits pending in the U.S. about AI, and their outcomes will be consequential for everyone, not just those working in Hollywood. “The United States copyright office, and most scholars, consider that a machine cannot be an author,” says Gervais. “Should a court decide otherwise, there will be an enormous push to replace human authors with machines in all industries that use copyright as the basis for their business, including music, film, book publishing (and) journalism.”It's not just jobs in the arts and publishing that Gervais sees being threatened by AI. ""Machines will be able to replace humans at many jobs considered 'cognitive,' which includes many white-collar jobs,"" he says. ""Ironically, it will be harder to replace manual labor.""Lu doesn’t think the situation is quite as dire. “AI can help us to do a lot of things, but it still requires experts to verify the accuracy of the information,” he says, noting that some lawyers recently tried to write a brief using ChatGPT, which spat out inaccurate information. “I don't think that AI will completely replace human beings. But AI has become like a digital calculator. It's going to help us to do the basic mathematics, but we still need to learn. It just helps us to improve our productivity.”Even if AI could one day script and create a movie without any writers, actors, directors, set designers, makeup artists, or cinematographers, would people want to see it?""Machines can beat any human on the planet at many games, including chess,"" Gervais points out, ""yet people still pay to watch the best human chess players play one another.""""Will it be the same with movies?""Contributing: Charles Trepany, Dana TaylorCompareCredit.com2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026CompareCredit.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoOnline Shopping ToolsFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyOnline Shopping Tools|AdAdUndoBarestepThese New Shoes Are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarestep|AdAdUndoCar Insurance DiscountVirginia Launches New Coverage for Cars Used Less Than 50 Miles/DayCar Insurance Discount|AdAdRead MoreUndoOttoinsurance.comWho Normally Has the Cheapest Car Insurance?Ottoinsurance.com|AdAdLearn MoreUndoCoupon Code FinderAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackCoupon Code Finder|AdAdUndoLendgoDon't Borrow From The Bank If You Own a Home, Do This Instead (It's Genius)Lendgo|AdAdClick HereUndoYiffanyA Pair of Reading Glasses That Can Look Far and near, Smart Zoom, Smart Color-ChangingYiffany|AdAdLearn MoreUndoHomebuddy.comRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards...Here's What They DiscoveredHomebuddy.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoSherumThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsSherum|AdAdLearn MoreUndoDeal of the DayREVIEWEDGet $400 Off The Hydrow Wave RowerREVIEWEDView Deal Recommendations are independently chosen by our editors.

And the Middle East countries are innovating and extracting its full potential to underpin economic advances and elevate living standards, especially AI and automation. Artificial intelligence is developing and expanding its roots in the Middle East more rapidly than it was perceived. While the AI revolution is transforming the entire world with its power, the Middle East is standing at the forefront of this revolution. And the speed at which AI is maturing, it's safe to say that it will surpass the $150 billion figure in no time.By 2030, it is predicted that the Middle East will claim 2% of the total global benefits of AI, a staggering US$320 billion, setting the stage for an optimistic future of innovation.In fact, Middle East countries have launched various programmes and invested heavily in artificial intelligence, advancing its position to become a global AI hub. In 2017, the UAE appointed a Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, becoming the first country in the world to create such a position. Another strategic initiative is The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 which aims at positioning the UAE as a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031 and to develop an integrated system that employs artificial intelligence in vital areas in the UAE. With all the advancements in AI, organisations are undergoing a reskilling revolution so that employees aren&rsquo;t left behind by automation. The World Economic Forum predicts 1 billion jobs &ndash; a third of all jobs worldwide &ndash; will be transformed by technology by 2030. WEF further states that traditional sectors will be displaced as demand shifts to emerging tech, including data analysis, generative AI and software development.In the UAE, the job market is very dynamic, and 60% of jobs that are in demand require technological competencies and AI, machine learning, and automation skills. Organisations in the UAE are looking for tech talent that is more self-reliant and independent and is equipped with the necessary skills for AI and automation.Here is a list of most in-demand jobs in the UAE.

I don’t want to wake you up, so I just sit down next to you and watch you sleep..You look so peaceful and beautiful. I’m so lucky to have you in my life..I close my eyes and drift off to sleep, content to be with you..Well, that’s generative AI aka GenAI getting romantic in role-play mode. Nothing kinky, though — yet. Looking at the way things are going, we will get there soon. .Artificial intelligence is not a new phenomenon. It’s been touching our daily lives over the past couple of decades. .However, with GenAI bots such as ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Google Bard, what seemed like rocket-science gobbledygook to the common folk is now easily accessible at our fingertips. And that has stirred excitement as well as apprehensions. .For instance, deep fakes have been going viral, from Mohanlal and Mammootty in ‘Godfather’ to cricket stars such as Sachin Tendulkar, M S Dhoni and Virat Kohli as Hindu monks. The potential is boundless. .Hollywood actor Tom Hanks recently made a plausible prediction in a recent episode of The Adam Buxton Podcast. “Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are, by way of AI or deep fake technology,” he said. .“I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but my performances can go on and on and on… Outside of the understanding that it’s been done by AI or deep fake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me.”Those who have watched or read about the ‘Black Mirror’ episode featuring Salma Hayek playing her digital doppelganger would get the drift. .Incidentally, Hollywood is witnessing a strike after several decades, with AI replacing humans emerging as a major bone of contention.  .Doomsday prophets have been predicting AI-led catastrophes. Interestingly, the word ‘robot’ has its roots in Old Church Slavonic  ‘rabu’, which means ‘slave’. Naysayers believe a role reversal is not far away. .Tech disruption is not something that’s coming up; it’s already here. There is no hiding. “We are witnessing it,” remarks Infopark CEO Sushant Kurunthil. .“AI has arrived, and it’s here to stay. The best scenario here is for us to make use of these tools and augment our own capacity for work. If we don’t, we will become obsolete.”.Two major studies published this week in the US offer clues on the likely trajectory of AI’s impact. A study by McKinsey Global Institute, titled ‘Generative AI and the Future of Work in America’, estimates that “11.8 million workers currently in occupations with shrinking demand may need to move into different lines of work by 2030”. .It underscores that “low-wage workers will be more severely affected by these anticipated job shifts due to AI”. .“These jobs involve a high share of repetitive tasks, data collection, and elementary data processing, all activities that automated systems can handle efficiently,” notes the study..Another comprehensive study by TECHnalysis Research highlights that “an unexpected 88% of US companies participating in the survey are already employing Generative AI tools”. .Titled ‘A New Beginning: Generative AI in the Enterprise’, the study covering over 1,000 companies notes the “excitement around its (GenAI’s) potential is huge”, but the “education gap is large”..Also read: Bumble launches new 'Kindness Campaign' with actor Aditya Roy Kapoor  Here are some key findings: .“95 per cent of respondents believe GenAI will or possibly could have a profound impact on work”“Almost 22 per cent of respondents are already generating new revenue streams or creating new business models”The positives cited by respondents include increased efficiency (56 per cent), new business revenue (49 per cent), improved quality (47 per cent), and addressing skills shortages (41 per cent) On the flip side, major concerns include security/data protection (55 per cent), inaccuracies (55 per cent), copyright violations (53 per cent), and bias (46 per cent) .Santhosh Kumar, president and managing director of semiconductor industry giant Texas Instruments India, brushes aside job loss bogeys, asserting that AI will be a “game-changer” that will “help us innovate faster and better”. .“Will improve both productivity and can create better products. Good for industry and jobs,” he adds.  .“The semiconductor industry, for instance, has the opportunity to greatly benefit from AI and machine learning. The use cases of AI span across the entire value chain — from research to chip design, production, sales and post-sales support. It is R&amp;D that can derive maximum value from AI tech.” .While that sounds great, a major concern has been about job losses in the creative content generation sector. “Yes, AI tools are the new elephants in the room for the creator economy,” smiles Ajith Kumar, vice-president (Kerala) of Concept PR, which employs over 300 creative professionals across India.  “I would say most of the gloomy assessments are a mile away from reality.” .Ajith firmly believes AI, like the internet, will be a complimentary tool at workplaces. .“Contrary to the alarmist narrative, my argument is that GenAI will ultimately generate new opportunities for creative professionals. However, it may lead to shrinking space for entry-level jobs,” he adds. .“Do remember that Autotune did not replace singers; it only made singers more creative. Photoshop only enhanced photography and visualisation. AI, as we know it today, will have the same effect on the creator economy.”.He sums up that AI will lead to “constructive destruction”, as described by German political economist Joseph Alois Schumpeter. “It may put an end to creators slogging with boring, repetitive works, but augment the space for sublime creations. It may make sharp minds sharper. Will it make lazy minds lazier is another issue,” he laughs. .Ajith, however, adds that growing concerns, like misuse of deep fakes for instance, lead to the question of the need for regulating the AI space. .“This should form the core of the future discussions surrounding AI,” he says. “Questions on who should do it and how it should be done remain open to debate.”.Speaking of regulations, chartered accountant Anagha Harish recalls a recent ethical dilemma she faced at work. “I had assigned a junior associate to compose an agreement document for a client,” she says. .“The draft he submitted had near-perfect legal diction. Amazed, I appreciated his skill. He, however, frankly revealed that he had used ChatGPT for the base draft.” .Anagha says she was flummoxed. “He certainly did a great job, perhaps better than someone way more experienced than him. But was he being smart or sly?” she wonders. “It also made me ponder whether my old-school work practices were getting outdated.”  .In terms of productivity, there should not be any dilemma, asserts Sushant. “That’s my view,” says the Infopark CEO. .“I will share an incident. Once we had a test for some job aspirants. They had to answer 60 questions in an hour. They were provided with laptops and Wi-Fi access. The HR personnel probed why I had allowed internet access, as the candidates might google the questions. That was exactly what I wanted to test — how many would crack the maximum questions within the time limit.” .Technology consultant and mentor of the TechnoparkToday community Renjith Ramachandran echoes similar views. “The end goal of all these technologies and tools is to make human life easier,” he says. “There will be a flux when it comes to jobs, especially at the entry-level. Demand will reduce. After all, most companies would look at enhancing output and cutting labour costs. It will all boil down to productivity.”.Renjith adds that it is imperative for tech professionals to keep themselves updated. “One should be aware of AI’s uses. At Technopark, I am sure, many professionals and even business heads have been attending courses to better understand AI’s potential and pitfalls,” he says. .Data analytics trainer Mohammed Alfan, too, stresses the productivity aspect. “Please, please do not portray AI as a threat. We created a negative mindset about computers, and several generations suffered due to the subconscious resistance,” adds the author of ‘Data Analytics for Beginners: Pivot to the Rescue’..A ‘most valued professional’ of Microsoft, Mohammed adds that very few people in India are aware of the potential of something as basic as MS Excel. “It remains grossly under-utilised,” he says. “Let that not be the case with AI. It should be introduced at a young age, in schools. AI can be utilised as a tool to enhance problem-solving skills and encourage creativity. Students should be made to engage in AI-related projects. They should be taught how to use AI ethically, and made aware of the risks it poses.”.Also read: A moveable feat: Wisconsin man wins Hemingway look-alike contest","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.indulgexpress.com/msociety/2023/Aug/02/brace-and-embrace-artificial-intelligence-as-new-western-studies-predict-massive-job-losses-we-gau-51639.html'}",,,,,,2023-08-02T12:05:00Z,https://media.assettype.com/indulgexpress/import/2023/8/2/original/Imageusedforrepresentationalpurpose.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.indulgexpress.com/msociety/2023/Aug/02/brace-and-embrace-artificial-intelligence-as-new-western-studies-predict-massive-job-losses-we-gau-51639.html', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/indulgexpress/import/2023/8/2/original/Imageusedforrepresentationalpurpose.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jo Gavino, chair of a Filipino advocacy group for BPO workers, expresses fear that AI may be replacing labor rather than helping reduce workload

















Indian entrepreneur Suumit Shah took to Twitter last month to describe his experience with generative artificial intelligence: “We had to layoff 90% of our support team because of this AI chatbot. Tough? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely.”
With the chatbot, queries to his e-commerce site dukaan.com took just over three minutes to resolve from more than two hours earlier, and customer support costs fell by about 85%, said Shah, the chief executive.
Shah’s tweet, which has had more than 2.6 million views, drew mixed responses, with some congratulating him for embracing the technology and getting good results, while others berated him as “heartless” for laying off nearly 30 employees.
“It’s not me who is going to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of people employed in areas where generative AI is being deployed; it’s up to them to see how AI is changing their jobs and learn, as not all employers have the resources to train employees,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Generative AI has been widely hailed as the next big growth driver in technology. The launch of San Francisco-based OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot to the public in November set off a global frenzy, with more than 1 million downloads in the first week.
Since then, the AI-based tool and image-generating tools such as Midjourney have been incorporated in education, marketing, customer service, online search and content creation, with users touting greater efficiency and reduced costs.
But lawmakers and some tech experts in Asia have warned of a lack of regulation to prevent misuse, the risk of privacy violations and misinformation, and the potential for income inequality as certain types of jobs are automated faster than others.
“Unequal access to AI tools can worsen socioeconomic disparities, favouring those with greater resources and leaving marginalized communities behind,” said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of The Dialogue, a policy think tank in Delhi.
“This imbalance can lead to a concentration of power and influence in the hands of a few, while others are left behind without the means to participate fully in the AI-driven economy,” he said.
Asian nations have been slow to regulate AI or introduce ethical frameworks, lagging the US AI Bill of Rights that offers guidelines for the responsible design and use of AI, and the EU’s proposed AI Act that imposes tough standards.
Skewed datasets
About 18% of work globally could be automated by AI, and 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to generative AI, according to Goldman Sachs, which estimates that AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%.












While fewer jobs in emerging markets are exposed to automation than developed markets, more than 10% of jobs in India and nearly a fifth in the Philippines could be lost to AI, Goldman Sachs said in the report earlier this year.
In China, AI-generated models are fast replacing human models in fashion catalogues and on shopping websites. An AI-generated model even featured on the cover of Vogue Singapore’s March issue, pitched as “fashion meets the AI revolution.”
China also launched what it claimed was the world’s first AI news anchor in 2018. Since then, they have also been introduced in Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, where networks claim greater speed and cost savings.
In India, AI anchors – from Sana in a skirt on Aaj Tak channel to saree-clad Lisa on Odisha TV – present news bulletins, horoscopes, weather and sports updates in English, Hindi and several regional languages.
Also in India, the high court for Punjab and Haryana states earlier this year turned to ChatGPT to decide whether to award bail for a suspect in a murder case “to present a broader picture on bail jurisprudence where cruelty is a factor.”
But while technology is aimed at efficiency, “efficiency does not always amount to justice,” said Urvashi Aneja, founding director at Digital Futures Lab, a research collective.
“Skewed datasets used to build these databases for AI tools can lead to biased outcomes, especially for marginalized groups who may be over or under-represented in datasets,” she said, adding that there are also risks of exclusion and privacy violations.
‘Daunting challenge’
Few countries have introduced regulations to govern generative AI, with China’s “interim” rules, due to take affect on August 15, prioritizing safety concerns and copyright protections.
In Singapore, which has an AI governance framework, the government is an early adopter, with civil servants using a version of ChatGPT for research and speech writing, while being “accountable for their work and responsible for fact-checking and vetting AI-generated content”.
The city-state last month launched a program with Google Cloud to identify 100 “real-world challenges” in the government and industry that can be addressed with generative AI, and to build AI solutions for them.
Meanwhile in the Philippines, there are real fears that generative AI could soon take over jobs in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector that employs about 1.3 million workers and generates $30 billion a year, or about 7% of the nation’s GDP.












Citing research that forecast at least 1.1 million jobs in the Philippines will disappear by 2028 due to AI, Senator Imee Marcos, filed a resolution in May to examine the use of AI in call centers and factories in the country.
“AI is developing faster than most people can comprehend and is threatening to take away jobs and turn employment growth upside down,” she said.
Regulators must “deal squarely with an inevitable technological tsunami” before the widespread adoption of AI in business to guard against “severe unemployment”, she said.
For Jo Gavino, a former BPO worker who now advocates for BPO workers’ rights, this is already the reality.
Gavino and his former colleagues at a BPO center were trained – but only to “keep up with AI” by responding quicker, he said.
“It’s like telling us we need to be better than the AI chatbots,” said Gavino, 24, who volunteers for the BPO Industry Employees’ Network and is chair of Outsourced Workers League, an advocacy group.
“We were hoping that AI will help reduce our workload, but what is actually happening is it seems to replace human labor.” – Rappler.com

Unless you have been living under a rock for the last 12 months Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have recently exploded and is a rapidly evolving field with numerous applications, one of which is the development of large language models (LLMs). These are a type of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) designed to create human-like text and code. Although there’s been a recent surge in conversation about GPTs and LLMs, they’ve been a part of our AI landscape for quite some time. In this blog post, I’ll offer a synopsis of a video in which Martin Keen explains what an LLM is, how it relates to foundation models, and its functionality. I will also discuss how LLMs can be applied to address an array of business issues.
LLM models
LLMs are models that are capable of understanding and generating human-like text. They are a form of GPT, which is a type of AI model that uses machine learning to generate coherent, realistic text. GPTs are trained on vast amounts of text data and are capable of predicting what word or phrase should come next in a sentence. This ability makes them effective in generating human-like text and code.
The relationship between LLMs and foundation models is quite significant. Foundation models are a subtype of pre-trained models that serve as a starting point for creating other models. LLMs fall under this category, as they are often used as a basis for generating more specific models.
How do large language models work?
 Watch this video on YouTube.
Understanding how these large language models function is crucial. They operate through a process called unsupervised learning. To ‘train’ these models, vast amounts of text data are fed into them without any specific task in mind. The model then begins to recognize patterns and structures within the language. Over time, the LLM begins to understand the context and semantic meaning of the language. This comprehension allows the model to generate coherent, human-like text.
In terms of practical applications, LLMs can address a range of business problems. One of the most common uses is in chatbots and customer service. With their ability to generate human-like text, LLMs can power chatbots that provide customer support 24/7. They can answer frequently asked questions, assist with bookings, and even help troubleshoot problems.
Additionally, LLMs can be used for content creation. They can generate blog posts, articles, and social media content, saving businesses significant time and effort. They can also be used in areas like translation services, sentiment analysis, and predictive typing.
In summary, large language models are powerful tools in the world of AI. Their ability to generate human-like text and code has wide-ranging applications that can address various business challenges. While they’ve been around for years, advancements in AI and machine learning are continually unlocking new potentials for LLMs, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Their value to businesses is undeniable, making understanding how they function and how they can be utilized invaluable.

New report by Thomson Reuters shows that industry professionals expect generative AI to dramatically impact the way they work now, creating new opportunities and posing new challenges

The way we work in professional services is undoubtedly undergoing a massive sea change. This revolution, driven by the novel yet undeniable power of generative artificial intelligence (AI), is increasing apace as professional organizations across industries are beginning or continuing to adopt AI into their everyday workflows.
To better understand this revolution and delve into the insights and perspectives of those facing this change on the front lines of their professions, Thomson Reuters today released a new wide-ranging Special Report, Future of Professionals, which surveyed more than 1,200 individuals working internationally in the legal, tax & accounting, global trade, risk management, and compliance fields who are employed at firms, corporate in-house departments, and government agencies based in North America, South America, and the United Kingdom. The purpose of the survey was to gain a better understanding of how the macro-trends impacting professional services businesses are converging with their talent, their customers, and their environment — and how AI, tech, and automation specifically will impact their operations over the next five years.
Among the critical insights, the survey showed that more than two-thirds (67%) of respondents said they believe AI will have a transformational or high impact on their profession over the next five years. Further, almost as many (66%) predicted that AI actually will create new professional career paths.
By any measurement, the report makes clear that generative AI will become a game-changer in the professional services industries, from legal and tax & accounting to corporate and government work.
“Many of the innovations we use today have crept up on us, evolved, and gradually changed the way we work and play. But not generative AI — this is different,” says Steve Hasker, president and CEO of Thomson Reuters, adding that generative AI “has captured our collective imaginations and changed everything.”
Most survey respondents were optimistic around the power of AI, with 45% saying their biggest hopes for AI was in improved productivity, internal efficiency, and client services. Additionally, 67% of respondents indicated their biggest personal motivator was producing high-quality advice — a critical insight considering that to work in the era of generative AI, professionals need to reconsider and redefine what it means to be an advisor and configure their business models to better prepare and service customers now and in the future.
Indeed, respondents’ expectations of improved efficiency and increased productivity due to the power of AI was a common thread throughout this report. “Through the application of AI to perform more mundane tasks, professionals have the unique opportunity to address human capital issues such as job satisfaction, well-being, and work-life balance,” Hasker explains. “This will in turn unlock time for professionals to focus on complex work that adds value to their client’s needs.”
Naturally, of course, many respondents struck some notes of caution around generative AI use in the workplace, including concerns over accuracy, with 25% or respondents citing this concern; job loss (19%); demise of the profession altogether (17%); data security (15%); and ethics (15%).
The Future of Professionals Report also broke down key findings in several critical professional service industries, including:
Legal — Among legal professionals, improved productivity and efficiency were seen as the biggest positive effects of AI (75% and 67%, respectively). And among those respondents at law firms more than half (55%) see AI as an opportunity for increased revenue and lower costs. Further, a large majority (81%) of legal respondents said they expect new services that will create new revenue streams to emerge within the next five years.
A majority (58%) also said they anticipate a rise in their professional skill level, while more than two-thirds of legal professionals see a more consultative approach to advice emerging.
Tax & Accounting — Tax & accounting professionals saw generative AI as a way to free up their time to deliver more value to clients, as more than half (59%) cited productivity as the highest priority for tax & accounting firms, and three-quarters (75%) cited internal efficiency as the highest priority for corporate tax & accounting departments.
Among individual tax & accounting respondents, producing high-quality advice topped the list of personal motivators for more than two-thirds of professionals (67%). Professionals also predicted new career paths will become available (66%), including a rise in roles that do not require traditional tax qualifications (68%), over the next five years.
Government — Talent issues tend to be a higher priority for government professionals than for their corporate counterparts, and government respondents tend to feel more optimistic that AI can help in areas of training, recruitment, well-being, and engagement.
However, government professionals tend to think that their agencies’ AI adoption will be slower than that of their private sector counterparts, due mainly to data security fears and general resistance to change.

Signal: Generative AI more likely to disrupt women’s jobs, warns UN
Generative AI is set to create jobs and transform others, according to the UN's generative AI study.

A recent study (21 August) by the UN’s International Labour Organisation has found that women may be disproportionately at higher risk of having their jobs automated by AI. 
Overall, the paper found that AI would not end human labour but rather creates a future where work is “transformed”.

Clerical work was identified as the sector that would see the biggest impact from generative AI. The UN stresses that this is not necessarily negative, as generative AI has just as much potential to augment clerical work as it does to automate it. 
However, a quarter of clerical tasks examined in the study had the potential to be fully automated. 
Not only does this run the risk of job displacement for women, who have traditionally filled these roles according to the UN, but it could lead to this type of work never emerging in lower income countries. 
The study explains that many clerical jobs have acted as “a vehicle for increasing female employment”.

Balancing AI augmentation and automation will undoubtedly have a “strongly gendered effect” on the job market according to the paper’s authors. Whilst a badly managed technological transition to generative AI could disproportionately harm women, the paper does reaffirm that a well-managed transition could create “important opportunities” for women in the workplace. 
The study also calls for better management of the jobs that will be created to ensure the development of AI itself. 
AI’s development hinges on repetitive tagging and feedback tasks, as well as content moderation of the data it is trained on. 
According to GlobalData’s job analytics, active job postings that mention generative AI have increased by 120% in the last four months. 

From 15 May, 2023 to 14 August, 2023, active job postings have increased from 1,406 to 3,118. The biggest hiring countries were the US, India and Canada. 
In a recent GlobalData survey over 52% of businesses have stated that even though they think generative AI is hyped, they do recognise potential use cases for the technology. GlobalData also found that the most common use cases for AI were in accounting, marketing and customer service jobs. 
Our signals coverage is powered by GlobalData’s Thematic Engine, which tags millions of data items across six alternative datasets — patents, jobs, deals, company filings, social media mentions and news — to themes, sectors and companies. These signals enhance our predictive capabilities, helping us to identify the most disruptive threats across each of the sectors we cover and the companies best placed to succeed.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for Indonesia, which has the largest digital economy in Southeast Asia. The AI ecosystem in Indonesia has been growing rapidly and the Indonesian government has consistently supported digital investments in the country including adopting the National Strategy on AI 2020-2045 outlining a plan to develop the necessary infrastructure and talent pool, recommending the formation of a data ethics board to oversee AI development, as well as creating regulations and national standards for AI innovation.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD243.5 billion of productive capacity in Indonesia, equivalent to close to one-fifth of GDP in 2022. Indonesia has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



In fact, according to a recent McKinsey report, generative AI is now being used by 79% of workers and 22% use it regularly to complete their day-to-day work tasks.
Generative AI is also being used by around 40% of organizations to speed up processes and make workers more efficient.
Future outlook
It’s fair to assume that AI’s impact will include some casualties along the way—the World Economic Forum has estimated that AI will result in 83 million global job losses by 2027.
Separately, Accenture has estimated that 40% of all working hours could be affected by generative AI tools, and by the mid-2030s, up to 30% of jobs could be automated.
And while the majority of those surveyed by McKinsey admit that generative AI will cause significant or disruptive change, particularly in knowledge-based work such as banking and pharmaceuticals, this disruption and adoption of a new way of working will also add to revenue to the tune of 9% globally.
Conversely, manufacturing-based businesses including aerospace, automotive and advanced electronics will experience less disruptive effects.
Making AI work for you
The McKinsey report also highlights how we’re using generative AI to speed up repetitive tasks so that workers can focus on more creative endeavors, which is its primary advantage.
Crafting first drafts of text documents is its most popular use at 9%, followed by personalized marketing (8%), summarizing text documents (8%) and identifying trends in customer needs (7%). ChatGPT is also being used by 5% of workers to draft technical documents and forecast trends or anomalies, while 4% are using the tool to create new product designs.
For tech workers, software engineers in particular, AI is also proving to be invaluable when it comes to creating code faster and more accurately. These include CoPilot, which is driven by the OpenAI Codex language model, and can assist in debugging and preventing data breaches while also writing entire lines of code. Similarly, Tabnine, which is compatible with Python, Rust, Go, Java and Javascript, uses open-source code to offer complete suggestions.
And then there’s Amazon CodeWhisperer. It uses a large language model (LLM) trained on AWS services, and suggests and monitors code as you write it, based on the text prompts initially provided by users.
As the adage goes, if you can’t beat them, join them—and the VentureBeat Job Board is the perfect place to start your search. It features thousands of jobs at companies that are harnessing generative AI and actively hiring, such as the three below.

UK first for the social care sector amid hopes it could help speedily tackle workforce shortages.An avatar – digital representation – of a real-life trainer is being piloted to welcome new staff in multiple languages and teach them various skills including spotting signs of stroke.Social care provider and healthtech company Cera said the avatars could train approximately 20,000 new carers a year if rolled out nationally, with its founder describing it as “an exciting and pioneering development”.We need new innovations to provide greater sustainability to the sector and allow us to do more with less because there is only a growing demand for services, given the ageing population, given the very high waiting listsDr Ben Maruthappu, CeraRecommendedAI can write better university assignments than students, report suggestsRishi Sunak announces Bletchley Park as site of autumn AI summitAI eye scans can detect Parkinson’s up to seven years before symptoms appear, scientists sayThe company is private but said the majority of its business is providing social care on behalf of the NHS and local authorities so staff being trained by the avatars will deliver services in the health service or through councils.A pilot in London and the South East which began this month is expected to have trained around 60 new carers by the end of August.There were around 152,000 vacancies in social care on any given day between April 2022 and March this year, according to the latest report from Skills For Care, which is the strategic workforce development and planning body for adult social care in England.Cera founder and chief executive Dr Ben Maruthappu said the use of avatars could mean training “thousands of people a day at low or no cost, while maintaining the familiar face of their local Cera team”.In an interview with the PA news agency, Dr Maruthappu described it as a “positive and high-impact use” of artificial intelligence (AI).He said: “This is an exciting and pioneering development at an important time for social care.“Given pressures are so high on the NHS and the care sector, we need new innovations to provide greater sustainability to the sector and allow us to do more with less because there is only a growing demand for services, given the ageing population, given the very high waiting lists.“And it is technologies like this that are helping to address these pressures in a very sustainable way.”Sarah Craven, Cera’s operational lead in the pilot area, is the first staff member to have an avatar created and welcomed the development.I used to say I wish I could be in two places at once... this is as close as I think anyone can get to thatSarah Craven, Cera's operational lead in the pilot areaShe said: “People who come into social care love caring for people, that’s what motivates them day in, day out.“Anything we can do to speed up the onboarding process in a safe and more efficient way is hugely welcome.“I used to say I wish I could be in two places at once – welcoming new staff in one part of the region and supporting my current staff in another is the dream with a region like ours that is so geographically spread out – this is as close as I think anyone can get to that.”Age UK, a charity representing older people, said it hoped that AI can enhance training, if used well, but warned it “can’t fully substitute for in-person instruction and support”.Asked about the consequences of the new technology for human trainers, Dr Maruthappu said there will “always” be a need for in-person care and in-person training.He told PA: “For example, showing someone manual handling – how to physically move a patient if they’re in a hoist – that’s something that needs to be done in-person.”Dr Maruthappu said there is already a mix of in-person and online training, but that the use of avatars “makes the online training so much more personalised”.Using avatars is a novel idea and one that we hope will pique the interest of care workers and help them to stay fully engaged in the training programmes on which they are deployedCaroline Abrahams, Age UKAge UK director Caroline Abrahams said: “It’s important that the social care sector keeps up with the exponential progress being made in technology and AI, and exploits it wisely to improve its productivity and effectiveness.“This can only be in the best interests of older people, many of whom will depend on a good social care service at some point in their later lives.“Using avatars is a novel idea and one that we hope will pique the interest of care workers and help them to stay fully engaged in the training programmes on which they are deployed.“Having said that, because social care is at heart a ‘people job’, the most important training that care workers will ever receive is likely to be of the hands-on variety.“As in other ‘people jobs’, the benefits gained by new recruits from working alongside skilled and experienced professionals, watching what they do and how they do it, and reflecting on and discussing their practice with them afterwards, are priceless.”The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) echoed this, saying while it is important to use digital technology, there must be varied approaches to training as “one size doesn’t fit all”.Cathie Williams, joint chief executive of Adass, said: “It’s important to harness the potential for digital technology to improve social care, including new ways to provide training for care workers.RecommendedNvidia sales hit record high as AI chip demand soarsWhite House science adviser calls for more safeguards against artificial intelligence risks“Of course, people learn in different ways, so training must always offer a range of different ways to learn, one size doesn’t fit all.“And the result of any training must always be about developing really good quality care and support based on great human relationships. That’s what enables us to live good lives, not just stay alive when we need support and is at the heart of social care.”Earlier this year social care minister Helen Whately said AI and voice technologies are some of the “really exciting” innovations in social care, describing the use of devices such as voice-controlled virtual assistants as “just the tip of the iceberg” and adding that better use of technology could mean staff spending less time on paperwork.The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.More aboutPA ReadyNHSSouth EastLondonCaroline AbrahamsAge UKHelen WhatelyDepartment of Health and Social Care1/1AI used to train staff in ‘UK first for social care sector’AI used to train staff in ‘UK first for social care sector’A pilot has been launched to train social care workers using artificial intelligence (Alamy/PA)✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Companies are looking to hire more people with experience with artificial intelligence (AI) as the arrival of generative AI tools and platforms forces enterprises to re-think their digital strategies, according to new studies from employment websites.
The studies also documented the AI skills most sought by organizations who hope to use the technology to boost efficiency and production by augmenting and/or automating employee tasks.
Job listing site Upwork on Tuesday released its study on the skillsets of job seekers accepting jobs as well as the search and hiring behaviors of companies in relation to fastest-growing skills category: generative AI. It found that 49% of hiring managers plan to hire more independent talent and 49% say they will hire more full-time employees — both a result of AI deployment plans.
 
 
 













 
 

AI was the fastest-growing category on Upwork in the first half of 2023, with generative AI job posts up more than 1000% in the second quarter of this year compared to the end of 2022; related searches increased more than 1500% in the same time period.

The top 10 generative AI-related job hires were: ChatGPT, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Tensorflow, Image Processing, Pytorch, AI Content Creation, Midjourney, AI Chatbot, LLM tuning, and Stable Diffusion.
 
 
 













 
 

Upwork determined the top AI hires by looking at each job posting and the skills freelance job seekers attached to their online profile; that included gen AI tools, like ChatGPT.
“We looked at the number of jobs hired during January 1 – June 30, 2023 that included Generative AI skills,” said Kelly Monahan, managing director of Upwork’s Research Institute, which performed the study. “We reported on the top 10 Generative AI jobs hired that included one of the Generative AI skills listed in the job posting. Chat GPT rose to the top over that time period. The job hire itself could be a range of activities such as hiring an AI developer who can work with Chat GPT, a Chat GPT writer or a Chat GPT expert to consult on use cases for a company as examples.”
The fastest-growing generative AI-related searches between Q1 and Q2 of this year, according to Upwork, were:

The sentiment around hiring and the surge of activity from companies interested in gen AI are strong early indications that businesses are paying significant attention to the opportunities the fast-evolving technology can provide, according to Upwork. Companies are shifting their focus from singular gen AI tools toward applications and services, including AI content creation, Azure OpenAI, and prompt engineering.
“Generative AI is following a similar adoption curve to other new and emerging technologies,” said Monahan. “When it is first broadly released to the public, people are still determining the specific use cases of the technology, so their searches begin at a broad level. In the case of Generative AI, ChatGPT was the first tool that sparked public attention. As a result, our platform data shows that many of the searches at the beginning of the year were from people coming and looking for freelancers with ChatGPT skills.”

In fact, ChatGPT commanded the largest volume of searches by companies in the first half of 2023. And ChatGPT’s creator, OpenAI, continues to see “a first-mover advantage” with its tool, including the underlying large language models — GPT-3 and GPT-4. ChatGPT is at the top of the list of generative AI-related search terms from those looking to hire, followed by Google’s BERT and Stable AI’s Stable Diffusion.
 
 
 













 
 

On social network and professional networking site LinkedIn, the share of job postings mentioning GPT or ChatGPT increased nearly six-fold from May 2022 to May 2023. And the number of LinkedIn members who hold, or have been holding, “head of AI” positions has nearly tripled in the last five years.

As people have learned more about the capabilities of gen AI, they are beginning to develop a deeper understanding of how it can actually be used. This maturity cycle, Monahan said, is reflected in gen AI-related searches. “Instead of looking for just a single tool, like ChatGPT, they are searching for the diverse use cases of generative AI technologies like AI content creation, services like Gradio, used for building machine learning web apps, and prompt engineering,” Monahan said.
The changes in the hiring market reveal a deeper recognition of the skills needed to implement AI to solve business problems, such as working with Large Language Models (LLMs), the role of prompt engineering, and object detection.
 
 
 













 
 

Object detection is a computer vision technique in which models can be trained to locate, identify, and analyze objects in a digital image or video, according to Monahan. You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a specific object detection tool Upwork sees growing quickly on freelancer profiles as a top generative skill in their profiles.  
In an earlier July study, Upwork found the number of weekly job postings related to genAI like ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Cohere’s Coral, were up more than 450% from a year ago.
The share of global English-language job postings mentioning GPT or ChatGPT is up 21-fold since November, according to LinkedIn’s Future of Work report, which was released last week.
 
 
 













 
 

In fact, 47% of US executives believe using gen AI will increase productivity. Additionally, 44% of executives plan to increase their use of AI at their organization in the next year, and 40% think the technology will help unlock more growth and revenue.

“The rise of AI talent and members adding AI skills has been accelerating since 2016,” LinkedIn said. “With the launch of ChatGPT, we are seeing the promise of AI and how it’s reshaping the skills required at work and at the same time helping people become more productive.”
An analysis of how AI skills are emerging across 25 countries shows that the pace at which LinkedIn members added AI skills to their profiles nearly doubled since the launch of ChatGPT, rising from 7.7% (May–November 2022) to 13% (November 2022–June 2023), LinkedIn said.
 
 
 













 
 

While AI has been used for more than 50 years, generative AI — the algorithm’s ability to generate text, images, or other media — has become a highly sought-after capability, according to Erick Brethenoux, Gartner distinguished vice president analyst.

AI can help organizations with decision support, parse thousands of data points or records in seconds, and replace mundane tasks that can free up employees to perform more important, and creative, jobs. “Generative AI was born out of machine learning techniques. People added rule-based systems and natural language processing and knowledge graphs to AI,” Brethenoux said.
For example, gen AI applications can assist in decision augmentation, or the collaboration of humans and machines, Brethenoux said.
 
 
 













 
 

“I cannot analyze 7,000 dimensions at once,” he said. “Machines can do that. So, then, great — let them analyze the data and find the patterns. Then how to apply those patterns can be at my discretion and could also be helped by a machine.”
Additionally, LLMs can be tailored or customized with APIs to ingest corporate data or fine-tuned through prompt engineering.
For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 LLM is pre-trained as next word or content prediction engines; that’s how most businesses use them — out of the box, as it were. Pre-trained LLMs, which can contain billions or even trillions of parameters, work relatively well at feeding mostly accurate and compelling content.
 
 
 













 
 

At the very least, pre-trained LLMs can be used as a jumping off point by organizations looking to automate some tasks. But, pre-trained LLMs are often trained using older data and are bloated with information.
As a result, LLMs are poised to shrink, not grow, as vendors seek to customize them for specific uses that don’t need the massive data sets in today’s most popular models. Industry-specific use cases, say for financial services or healthcare, require LLMs to generate more unique outputs using the language of those industries and organizations. That will require workers with skill sets that can customize  LLMs for more specific business purposes.
As more employees are trained on AI, fears of job displacement from the technology may subside as workers see the potential for new AI-powered enterprises. For example, there are now 300 AI courses offered on the LinkedIn Learning platform.
 
 
 













 
 

“There are certainly online certification courses that professionals can take to update their resumes and be on top of new and emerging generative AI skills,” Upwork’s Monahan said. “There are plenty of places to start, like on Coursera or Udemy, but companies that have their own open AI services, like Microsoft and Azure, also offer online training opportunities.”

Don’t look now, but the future is here, and with it come the jobs of the future. In fact, more of the future is already behind us – in terms of jobs – than we realize.

2015: AI Jobs of the Future 

In 2015, I wrote, “By 2025, one in four jobs in the American workforce will be jobs that do not exist today.” I also said, “We’re overestimating what AI will be able to do three years from now but underestimating what it will be able to do in 10.” Many of my readers and audience members dismissed or avoided those comments, for two reasons, I found: (1) lack of imagination, and (2) fear.

2008: Jobs of the Future (No AI yet)
Going further back, the first time I published an essay entitled “Jobs of the Future” – but no AI yet – was in October 2008, nine months into the Great Recession. (Remember that “once in a lifetime” event – that we ultimately had two of?) Later that month I was scheduled to do a” Jobs of the Future” presentation to a professional networking group, but the host called me and asked me to present something else. “The furthest into the future anyone in the audience wants to see is to their next unemployment check,” he said. “They’re losing their jobs and their homes. All they want is a job in the present.”

PROMOTED
Look at us now. We’re still riding the greatest job market growth in history, but it’s no longer where the jobs are created (or lost) that counts, but how they are changed.

AI Jobs are transformational
AI is already transforming the job landscape by automating certain many tasks, supporting more than that, and creating countless new opportunities. Just as we have millions of jobs we couldn’t imagine a decade ago, as AI continues its evolution, new job titles will be born. We’ve learned to expect the unexpected – and fortunately, we have two generations – Gen Y and Gen Z – who have proven they’re good at that. They’ll handle this very well, thank you.

AI Data Privacy Manager.
If we didn’t learn from the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2016, we better get a move on. Ensuring privacy, security, and transparency is not just central, it’s existential.
AI Urban Planner. 
I place this very high on the priority list. Despite all the talk of people fleeing the cities, the truth is that we are increasingly growing our urban centers by inward flow of professional talent and outward sprawl of what we now call urban. Not to mention, our aging cities were built with no concern for sustainability while our renewal must be all about that: a huge paradigm shift. Using AI simulations and predictive modeling is key.
AI Climate Change Analyst. 
Glaring evidence of the importance of this job mounts daily: Maui, Southern California, the polar caps, warmer water in the North Atlantic, etc. Meteoric growth in this critical occupation is already happening, especially in the EU, applying AI models to analyze climate data, predict environmental trends, and develop strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change.
AI Trainer/Teacher.
Somebody’s got to design, create, and deliver datasets to train AI models and develop curricula to educate people on AI concepts and technologies.
AI Cybersecurity Analyst.
This is a case of building a corral before the horses get out, rather than scurrying around after they do. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
AI Augmentation Specialist.
One manifestation of a hybrid workplace will be humans work with AI – as coworkers. Facilitating this integration will be tricky.
AI Healthcare Diagnostics Analyst.
This has a huge upside, keeping pace with spectacular advances in the technologies that diagnose and treat.
AI Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Manager.
Overseeing, implementing, and managing RPA will span business operations, ecologic management, space and ocean exploration, wildlife protection, crime, and more.
AI Customer Experience Specialist.
Personalizing customer experiences by analyzing data and predicting customer needs will augment the already active field of UX.
AI Supply Chain Analyst. 
Usually, technology advances start as strategic advantages and then morph into being operational advantages. In supply chain, it could go both ways – at once.
AI Linguist/NLP Specialist.
Developing and refining language models for improved communication between humans and machines should be a job opportunity gor anyone with a degree in Linguistics, Language Studies, and even Fine Arts.
AI Creativity Consultant.
Creativity rarely occurs in a vacuum; it depends on diverse stimuli and diversity of stimuli. Collaborating with AI systems will help in creative efforts across the entire STEAM spectrum.
AI Virtual Reality Architect.
There’s not much of a leap from virtual reality to advanced surgery, infrastructure design and maintenance, agricultural management, military training, and countless other simulations.
Some details could vary, but these job titles should point to what our workplace will look like – or, more accurately, what it’s already looking like.

Many business processes may now be subject to automation and artificial intelligence, but that doesn’t mean everyone needs to be thoroughly skilled in automation and AI development and implementation. A recent survey of executives and employees finds while technical savvy is important, so is business savvy. The most sought-after skills they are seeking in their workforces are time management, teamwork, and communication.


The study of 3,000 global C-suite leaders and 21,000 workers by the IBM Institute for Business Value finds that, yes, AI will affect many jobs, but not in the way many fear. Rather, the pressure will be on people at all levels — from executives to production workers — need to be able to leverage the technology in new ways.

“As AI continues to evolve, its effects will likely intensify across the board, including at the managerial and executive ranks,” according to the team of IBM co-authors led by Jill Goldstein and Bill Lobig. “No level is immune to the impact. This will force executives to rethink job roles, skill sets, and how work gets done.”

What sort of rethinking will be required? “On average, 87% of executives expect job roles to be augmented, rather than replaced, by generative AI,” Goldstein and Lobig found. Disciplines seeing the most changes are procurement (97%), finance (93%), and risk and compliance (93%).

Interestingly, they report, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) skills are “plummeting” in importance, dropping from the top spot in 2016 to 12th place in 2023. AI, automation, and software skills are becoming more accessible to non-technical users, while there’s a greater urgency to connecting capabilities to business growth.

“As technology becomes more user-friendly, employees are also able to do more with less advanced technical skills,” Goldstein and Lobig state. “No-code software development platforms, for instance, let people without a programming background create business-critical prototypes and apps. Plus, as machines take over mundane tasks, people can spend more time on the problem-solving and collaborative work that require stronger people skills.”

“Automating bad processes won’t make them better,” Goldstein and Lobig state. “Break the business down to its essential elements to drive efficiency and deliver real productivity gains.”
The IBM IBV findings map to the views of industry leaders and experts across the spectrum, who agree that those who succeed with AI are those who apply it to business opportunities in a masterful way. “Since this technology is evolving very quickly, it is important for organizations to think in terms of capabilities rather than roles,” says François Candelon, global director of the BCG Henderson Institute.
For example, Candelon continues, “prompt engineering is a highly sought-after role that did not exist a year ago—and may not exist a year from now. What matters most is the organization’s learning capability. The technology is changing much faster than companies are able to adapt.”
With the rise of AI and generative AI, “it’s inevitable that certain job roles will undergo transformation,"" agrees Michael Ringman, CIO at TELUS International. ""As interest in GenAI continues to grow, this technology will create an influx of new jobs, such as data detectives or scientists navigating and uncovering insights from large datasets, prompt engineers crafting instructions for AI systems, and robotics engineers and machine managers overseeing and optimizing AI-powered systems.""
The IBM study anticipates that 15% of executives or senior managers will see an “extreme” or “significant” impact from AI within the next two years, versus 21% of middle management and 17% of first-level management. At least 27% of employees will feel the impact.
The impact may be wide-ranging, and not necessarily negative. “For example, you may choose to use the latest technologies to create a ChatGPT plug-in for your business,” says Candelon. “But, this decision may have unintended consequences as customers are no longer directly coming to your website. To manage these trade-offs, AI initiatives must always draw on a robust understanding of your business and strategy. Moreover, a narrow focus on the technical aspect of AI can alienate other employees and negatively affect their professional identity—to a point where they are reluctant to adopt AI. We’ve found that organizations with employees who personally derive value from AI are five to nine times as likely to get significant financial benefits from AI compared with organizations where employees do not get value from AI.”
The IBM team urges business leaders and managers to see this as a time to “transform traditional processes, job roles, and organizational structures to boost productivity and enable new business and operating models.” In addition, there will be value in building “human-machine partnerships that enhance value creation and employee engagement.” It’s essential to “invest in technology that lets people focus on higher value tasks and drives revenue growth.”
Importantly, while the prospect of AI-driven automation has raised concerns about job displacement, “the role of humans in shaping, implementing and overseeing Gen AI will always remain essential,"" says Ringman. ""Organizations should proactively and carefully explore the opportunities that AI could potentially create for their businesses and employees while considering the needs of society more broadly.""
The crucial capability in the age of AI “is the ability to learn and change faster and continuously,” says Candelon. “As generative AI democratizes the consumption of AI and companies have an opportunity to adopt it with greater breadth and depth, the entire C-suite will need to get involved. The reality is that AI is, above all, a pivotal, multi-faceted technology that deserves to be at the core of an organization’s strategy.""

Generative AI is hyped to disrupt entire industries and GlobalData estimates that the total AI market will be worth $908.7bn in 2023, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% from 2022–30.
For the life sciences industry, this means a major shakeup in the workforce and how organisations are structured. Research from consulting firm Accenture suggests that GenAI may affect roughly 50% of life sciences work hours, and half the time currently spent in work activities at a biopharma company will be either automated or augmented.

As organisations shift to accommodate new tools, life science leaders are paying close attention to the areas that the technology can create the highest value.
In an exclusive interview with Medical Device Network, Kenneth Munie, managing director of Accenture Strategy’s life sciences practice, delves into the impact of GenAI. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Catherine Longworth: Can you explain what generative AI is?
Kenneth Munie: Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that uses machine learning to create content such as text, images, audio, video, design, or software code. It’s not the explanative, descriptive, or predictive AI that we would call classic AI technology – it’s a type of AI that creates things that didn’t exist before.See Also:GE Healthcare buys out Intelligent Ultrasound AI arm How AI is revolutionising medical devices 
CL: What are the use cases for generative AI in life sciences?
KM: It could be something as simple as creating marketing texts or advertising copy from large language models, or it could be something as specific as designing new molecules with generative AI.

For example, Absci achieved a breakthrough approval with its generative AI drug creation and other companies are using the technology for drug discovery. We also see other uses of generative AI to design different modifications to proteins or different protein mutations.
For physicians, generative AI can be used to engage with doctors and patients through conversational AI and the technology can be used to create synthetic data. So, if there’s a rare disease, generative AI can create data based upon patients’ information anonymously. This reduces issues surrounding patient privacy or confidentiality. So, there are many different examples where AI can be used to generate things.
CL: Where across the value chain do you see the technology delivering the most value?
KM: Quite simply, it can deliver value across all parts of the value chain. From product design and development, to manufacturing, commercialisation, supply chain, support, as well as enabling functions such as finance, procurement, legal HR, IT etc.
The basis of Accenture’s research into GenAI was because the technology is new to all industries but has much broader applicability than prior forms of AI. In the past, if you had a task or a question that you needed AI to work on, that was handed over to a group within an organisation that specialised in AI, and they would do their analysis and come back with answers.
Now, we’re seeing the application of GenAI apply to almost everybody in the organisation. The analysis that we did was how will it impact individuals. What’s the application of generative AI or the impact on an individual or roles belonging to different functions?
What we’ve found is that there are two types of impact from generative AI. One is automation, the second is augmentation.
Let’s look at a manufacturing manager – which is a role description that we’ve done analysis for. Generative AI could automate many of the operations within that role. For example, there could be a generative AI agent that summarises information for the marketing manager, and we see that could take up a potential of 30% of the tasks that a marketing manager does in a life sciences company.
The augmentation element could be to look at the usefulness of new products or new technologies in manufacturing, and so generative AI could look at what products and technologies are out there based upon the most recent data, summarise the characteristics of them and their applicability to the specific situation of the marketing manager.
Augmentation is not just about speeding up the task. It’s also about providing more insight or useful insight for the marketing manager to do their job. We see GenAI as impacting around 18.6% of a marketing manager’s role, so overall when you look at it, almost half of that role could be impacted by technology either through automation or augmentation.

CL: What do you see as the limitations of GenAI?
KM: The interesting part is that I don’t believe the limitation is driven by the technology. The limitation is driven by the organisation of talent. For example, if 50% of a marketing manager’s job is impacted by generative AI, what happens next?
If suddenly, 30% of their tasks disappear, what do they fill their time with? The key is the impact must be thought of from an organisational perspective, and it’s a redesign of how that role is established.
You either add more to that role or you reduce the number of roles that you have at that level. Many organisations will need to redesign functions or create new ones. Potentially they could wind up with two different levels of managers – one that oversees all the insight and augmentation, and perhaps a more junior role that oversees all the automation.
The challenge though, is understanding how productivity will impact these roles and creating new or optimised functions. These roles will change to a significant degree, and that’s where we see clients struggling. They get the technology and understand the use case but very few are thinking about how work is reshaped and how that translates into different functions.
CL: How are companies approaching implementation of generative AI within their organisations?
KM: We’ve done surveys of some of our largest clients, and I would say around 20% are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach and this is across all industries. About half or 50% are doing experimentation – so understanding the impact through application and use cases/proofs of concept. Finally, about 30% are taking a top-down C-suite driven approach looking at how to reshape their organisations and reshape distinctive capabilities. It’s a minority of organisations that are thinking this way but if they do it right, these are the companies that gain the most from the technology.
We believe that there is a lot of potential with GenAI but the challenge is getting that impact to turn into financial results. It is not necessarily the tech which will be the hurdle, but the ways of working and how people are organised.
CL: Where is the life sciences world at with adoption of GenAI compared to other industries?
KM: The challenge is always that life sciences is more regulated than other industries, so the implementation of new technologies is generally slower. Of the industries that we cover, we are seeing industrial manufacturers and automotive, large capital-intensive industries, taking the leadership in generative AI for product design and manufacturing applications.
CL: How are workforces currently adapting to the use of these tools?
KM: There have been some studies from Stanford, MIT, and others that have shown that a lot of it is very use-case dependent, but a lot of the early gains or productivity gains have been shown to come from lower experienced workers, meaning taking the lower performers and moving them to average performance and then some smaller boosts to the experienced workers. Overall, this could have implications on company’s talent sourcing strategy and career pathways.
A lot of medical technology clients are at the point where they’re seeing the experience that they have within the organisation ready to retire so it creates an interesting dynamic where these tools might accelerate the growth of new talent within organisations.

The 55-page report surveyed respondents from several countries across multiple roles, adopting a positive stance for AI integration in its outlook.For most job roles in the workforce, the adoption of generative AI would complement the efforts of employees rather than eliminate them. However, the UN agency reports that some roles are more prone to automation than others, with clerical support workers bearing the most risk.Customer service jobs, especially those in Web3, are at a high risk of elimination. During the mass job cuts that plagued the digital currency industry, customer service rolls bore the brunt of the terminations, with over 3,000 professionals losing their jobs.Per the report, travel consultants, bank tellers, clerks, and receptionists could see their roles entirely eliminated due to AI adoption. In terms of gender, the ILO report predicts that women will be the hardest hit of the lot since they make up the bulk of clerical support roles.“3.7 per cent of all female employment in the world is in jobs that are potentially automatable with generative AI technology, compared with only 1.4 per cent of male employment,” read the report.For technicians, sales workers, managers, and elementary occupations, the risk of AI automating their roles stood at less than 5%, with high margins to complement their work processes.Regarding geographical effects, developing countries will be largely unaffected by the integration of generative AI in the workplace. In contrast, developed nations face the largest risks to automation.“Without proper policies in place, there is a risk that only some of the well-positioned countries and market participants will be able to harness the benefits of the transition, while the costs to affected workers could be brutal,” said the ILO.IBM: A chunk of employees will need retrainingA recent report from IBM suggests that 40% of employees in the workforce will require new skill sets to remain competitive in the workplace. Up to 1.4 billion individuals are expected to be affected by the integration of generative AI, with executives urged to invest in the upskilling of talent alongside investment in talent.IBM’s report noted that due to AI, enterprises are rethinking their skill requirements in the workplace, with time management skills being the most sought after while proficiency in STEM is down the pecking order.“As machines take over mundane tasks, people can spend more time on the problem-solving and collaborative work that require stronger people skills,” IBM’s Jill Goldstein and Bill Lobig stated.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Generative AI threatens women's employment more than men's, study finds
9 million men are at risk vs. 21 million women

Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.

In brief: Another study on the impact that generative AI will have on jobs has been published. Mirroring the results of a similar recent report, it concluded that most people will see their positions augmented by the technology as opposed to them becoming automated. However, women and admin workers face the greatest risk of seeing their jobs replaced. 
A new study from the International Labour Organization (ILO) looked at the potential effects generative AI will have on job quantity and quality. The bottom line is that most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented by AI.
Clerical workers were found to be the category with the greatest amount of technical exposure to generative AI. About a quarter of clerical tasks were considered highly exposed, while more than half (58%) had medium-level exposure. The study names typists/word processing operators, travel consultants, scribes, inquiry clerks, contact center information clerks, bank tellers, data entry clerks, and survey and market research interviewers as those whose jobs are most at risk of becoming fully automated.

The risk to clerical workers is a stark contrast to other occupational groups such as professionals, managers, and technicians, who only had a small share of tasks that are greatly exposed, while a quarter of tasks had medium-level exposure.
The study also found that generative AI is likely to impact more women than men. It noted that more than twice the share of female employment is potentially affected by automation, partly due to the higher number of women in clerical work.

ILO estimated that in high-income countries, 7.8% of female jobs (around 21 million) are potentially automatable, while the figure is just 2.9%, or 9 million, for men. Overall, 5.5% of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to automation, whereas in low-income countries, the risk only applies to 0.4% of all employment.

The study, which used the latest GPT-4 large language model that powers ChatGPT, notes that the socioeconomic impacts of generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed. It also warns that the costs to affected workers could be ""brutal.""
ILO's finding mirror a similar report from IBM this week that also predicted generative AI will augment rather than replace jobs. However, the study added that 40% of the global workforce will have to learn new skills over the next three years due to AI implementation, and warned that while AI won't replace people, people who use AI will replace people who don't.

The chief technology officer of a robotics startup told me earlier this year, “We thought we’d have to do a lot of work to build ‘ChatGPT for robotics.’ Instead, it turns out that, in a lot of cases, ChatGPT is ChatGPT for robotics.”
Until recently, AI models were specialized tools. Using AI in a particular area, like robotics, meant spending time and money creating AI models specifically and only for that area. For example, Google’s AlphaFold, an AI model for predicting protein folding, was trained using protein structure data and is only useful for working with protein structures.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

So this founder thought that to benefit from generative AI, the robotics company would need to create its own specialized generative AI models for robotics. Instead, the team discovered that for many cases, they could use off-the-shelf ChatGPT for controlling their robots without the AI having ever been specifically trained for it.
I’ve heard similar things from technologists working on everything from health insurance to semiconductor design. To create ChatGPT, a chatbot that lets humans use generative AI by simply having a conversation, OpenAI needed to change large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 to become more responsive to human interaction.
But perhaps inadvertently, these same changes let the successors to GPT3, like GPT3.5 and GPT4, be used as powerful, general-purpose information-processing tools—tools that aren’t dependent on the knowledge the AI model was originally trained on or the applications the model was trained for. This requires using the AI models in a completely different way—programming instead of chatting, new data instead of training. But it's opening the way for AI to become general purpose rather than specialized, more of an “anything tool.”
Now, an important caveat in a time of AI hype: When I say “general purpose” and “anything tool,” I mean in the way CPUs are general purpose vs, say, specialized signal-processing chips. They are tools that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, not all-powerful and all-knowing. And just like good programmers don’t deploy code to production without code review and unit tests, AI output will need its own processes and procedures. The applications I talk about below are tools for multiplying human productivity, not autonomous agents running amok. But the important thing is to recognize what AI can usefully do. Ars VideoHow Scientists Respond to Science Deniers
So to that end, how did we get here?
Fundamentals: Probability, gradient descent, and fine-tuning
Let’s take a moment to touch on how the LLMs that power generative AI work and how they’re trained.
LLMs like GPT4 are probabilistic; they take an input and predict the probability of words and phrases relating to that input. They then generate an output that is most likely to be appropriate given the input. It’s like a very sophisticated auto-complete: Take some text, and give me what comes next. Fundamentally, it means that generative AI doesn’t live in a context of “right and wrong” but rather “more and less likely.”
Being probabilistic has strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses are well-known: Generative AI can be unpredictable and inexact, prone to not just producing bad output but producing it in ways you’d never expect. But it also means the AI can be unpredictably powerful and flexible in ways that traditional, rule-based systems can’t be. We just need to shape that randomness in a useful way.
Here’s an analogy. Before quantum mechanics, physicists thought the universe worked in predictable, deterministic ways. The randomness of the quantum world came as a shock at first, but we learned to embrace quantum weirdness and then use it practically. Quantum tunneling is fundamentally stochastic, but it can be guided so that particles jump in predictable patterns. This is what led to semiconductors and the chips powering the device you’re reading this article on. Don’t just accept that God plays dice with the universe—learn how to load the dice.
The same thing applies to AI. We train the neural networks that LLMs are made of using a technique called “gradient descent.” Gradient descent looks at the outputs a model is producing, compares that with training data, and then calculates a “direction” to adjust the neural network’s parameters so that the outputs become “more” correct—that is, to look more like the training data the AI is given. In the case of our magic auto-complete, a more correct answer means output text that is more likely to follow the input.
Probabilistic math is a great way for computers to deal with words; computing how likely some words are to follow other words is just counting, and “how many” is a lot easier for a computer to work with than “more right or more wrong.” Produce output, compare with the training data, and adjust. Rinse and repeat, making many small, incremental improvements, and eventually you'll turn a neural network that spits out gibberish into something that produces coherent sentences. And this technique can also be adapted to pictures, DNA sequences, and more.

Generative AI is going to revolutionize the SEO industry, but perhaps not in the way you think.
Yes, your day-to-day job as an SEO will most likely look different in a few years. But are bots going to replace you? 
“Absolutely not,” said Britney Muller, Marketing & SEO Consultant at Data Science 101, and Dave Davies, Amplification Team Lead at Weights and Biases. But there’s no denying the industry is evolving.
So how will generative AI change SEO as a profession and what can you do to stay ahead of the curve? Muller and Davies shared their thoughts on generative AI and the future of SEO at SMX Advanced.
AI is not replacing SEO
Muller was adamant that AI would not be coming for SEO jobs. However, she did note that the industry would have to adapt depending on how Google incorporates AI into search results:

“AI is not the be-all and end-all. In fact, I think the shine will start to wear off as we continue to see the limitations of large language models (LLMs) and how much additional work is required to do things well.”
“LLMs have so many issues that the researchers building this technology have yet to figure out. They are based on a probability distribution and are consistently not factual.”
“Google has done information retrieval very well within search and I think LLMs could be a nice addition to really better define the questions that people have and surface additional information.”

Technical SEOs will have an advantage 
Davies added that technical SEOs may be better positioned to handle the change that generative AI brings than those specializing in content SEO:

“John Mueller from Google said that as long as machines read websites, technical SEO will remain as important as it is. I think that summarizes exactly what sort of world we’re heading into now.” 
“I think technical SEOs are going to have a bit of an advantage – but content SEO will eventually follow. It just just has to change. The structure that they’ll be optimizing for I think will change.”


Links may evolve
Both Davies and Muller agreed that links may change form and not be such a significant ranking factor in the future. Things like mentions or references to a site may become more valuable signals than traditional links. As Davies explained:

“I’m not saying link building is dead, but I think its value is about to be significantly adjusted. It will evolve and might not look like the traditional links that we know and use today – but some version of that instead.”
“Think about the way LLMs are constructed in this linguistic space. They use tokens and they use relationships to make connections. Those things are still very important.”
“The whole mission of neural networks is to establish understanding between different things and so I believe that will still carry weight – but it might not look as specific as links and link building. Perhaps it could be mentions instead? Perhaps it could take the form of something else and just evolve.”

Prompt customization is key
SEOs will need to master prompt customization for AI to deliver the best results, according to Muller. Fine-tuning based on goals and data is crucial vs. a one-size-fits-all approach.

“You really need to customize prompts, learn about prompt engineering and implement those things strategically. I know Andrew Ng just came out with a really great quick and easy course, partnered with Open AI, on that very topic and does a beautiful job explaining those key concepts. So I would definitely check that out,” Muller said. 
“ChatGPT actually has an API that you can use to customize prompts. It makes things a bit easier for the people that I work with, for my teams, for my clients, and it kind of puts the power in their hands as far as here’s how we need to approach this with an iterative process.”

Saving time on content creation
Numerous SEOs are exploring generative AI for content creation, including headlines, product descriptions and articles. There are current concerns with the quality of responses, however, these issues could potentially be resolved over time, as Davies pointed out:

“Generative AI can write quite well. Is it right all the time? No. It’s just a little hack right now. But moving forward, this will speed things up – like with tasks that I was previously doing manually such as looking at what entities were on a page.”
“I still need to use my brain and go OK, [generative AI] missed this and that. I then also need to fact-check. But this saves me probably half an hour per piece of research.”


Search may expand beyond webpages
In the future, search may move beyond webpages into new environments that don’t yet exist on the web today.

“In the next five years, I think we’re just going to see a move into two different sorts of landscapes. I think search will diminish a little bit and move into, I don’t want to say Metaverse, but into different environments that don’t exist right now,” Davies said.

Simplifying code
Muller already uses ChatGPT extensively as a code assistant, highlighting that it’s particularly adept at tasks like generating Python scripts:

“I think it’s important to make note that code in its nature is supposed to be unambiguous, unlike human language, and so generative AI is a lot better, in my opinion, at generating accurate code outputs for things I’m trying to accomplish, whether it be a Python script for a program or just pandas to clean up data. It’s phenomenal at those tasks.”

Judicious use is required
Although generative AI will transform SEO as a profession, careful application is still essential due to the potential for incorrect uses – and this is the reason Muller doesn’t believe that this technology represents the end of SEO as a career. At least not yet.

“Remember, generative AI is a prediction model based on a probability distribution. So if you imagine that it only read let’s say 100 books that were in the realm of sci-fi, and you ask it a medical question, it’s not going to do so well. But it might do really well with generating a new sci-fi character,” Muller said.
“Given that context, generative AI is only as good as the text and information it’s trained on, which is inherently problematic because ChatGPT and LLMs are essentially trained on all of the Internet, which isn’t the best place to grab completely factual information or have representation across marginalized groups of people and topics.”
“These models don’t have emotions. They aren’t reasoning. They don’t have common logic like humans do. And so you have to be really, really, really careful about how you use them, because it’s very easy when you enter a prompt to automate the bias that you already have by the sheer nature of how you ask a question, it’s going to follow that train of thought.”

Celestial bodies have become actors in our myths and folklore. And from the stars and heavens, we draw inspiration and even religion.But the night skies have also taught us how to keep time and coordinate our days and seasons. We have long used the night skies to live our lives more predictably and make our way through the world more purposefully.Job: But we’re not the only ones.I’m Jacob Job, and you’re listening to Scientific American’s Science, Quickly. Today, part four of our five-part series on the Nighttime Bird Surveillance Network—an informal but important global audio dragnet that tracks some of the billions of migratory birds as they fly through the night.Benjamin Van Doren: If you’re lucky, and it’s a clear night, and the moon is illuminated, there are so many birds migrating on average on these nights that if you use a telescope and look at the moon for a few minutes, you’re likely to see a bird high overhead flying and silhouetted in front of the face of the moon.Seeing birds fly in front of the moon or hearing the calls from above, I found really thrilling because it felt like I was tapping into this vast mysterious pulse-of-the-planet phenomenon that was just so much bigger than me.[CLIP:Theme music]Job: Migratory birds navigate to their summer and winter homes by way of the moon and stars. On any given night during migration, there might be thousands of birds flying in the skies above you and tens or hundreds of millions more moving across the continent.We still don’t fully understand the true scope of this mass movement. But now science is turning to machines to unlock the secrets of nocturnal migration.Job: The nighttime bird surveillance network all started with one six-foot sound dish, an expensive studio microphone on reel-to-reel tape and a bunch of hay bales more than 60 years ago. In time, the mics got a lot smaller, and the network grew and grew.Curated by Our EditorsUsing Human-Sized Microphones and Hay Bales, They Unlocked the Mysteries of Bird MigrationJacob JobThey Tap Into the Magical, Hidden Pulse of the Planet, but What is the Nighttime Bird Surveillance Network?Jacob JobDogs’ Visible Emotions Are Muddled by Floppy Ears and Short, Squished FacesLori YoumshajekianThese Animals are Physics WhizzesTom Siegfried & Knowable MagazineToday people all over the world have created a vast, informal network of night sky listeners.Interpreting all of these data, however, has created a new challenge.It’s one that scientists at the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology are tackling head-on.Van Doren: My name is Benjamin Van Doren. I am a scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.Job: Benjamin grew up in New York State and is a postdoctoral research fellow who studies the science of bird migration. His interest in birds goes back a long way, about as far back as his ties to the Lab of Ornithology.Van Doren: I particularly got into birds when I was about eight years old in third grade, and that was thanks to a classroom program that involved watching birds at bird feeders outside the classroom and recording what we saw and actually submitting our data to the ornithologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, which I thought was the coolest thing.I was really intrigued by the puzzle of bird identification, that I could learn the tricks to identifying a bird and then be able to put that knowledge to use outside in the real world when I saw a flash of color go by or, later on, heard a sound.Job: During high school, his interest grew deeper.Van Doren: I also started to get really interested in bird migration, and for a bird-watcher, migration is a really exciting period of the year because each day can bring an entirely new set of birds or species to your local park or even your backyard—birds that are in the middle of these long journeys of thousands of miles.Job: But what really sealed Benjamin’s fate as a nighttime bird migration fanatic was a talk he attended at the lab on, you probably guessed it, nocturnal migration.Van Doren: I was captivated by that. And the additional layer of mystery is that songbird migration in large part occurs at night, so it’s also literally shrouded in darkness.Job: He decided to start monitoring birds on his own.Van Doren: I ended up starting a research project in high school that included making audio recordings and looking at radar data. This was a whole nother level of experiencing something that was hidden to so many other people, so I really found that exciting, and I’m still pretty much doing that today.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newslettersJob: And now he’s busy solving the puzzle of how to quickly and accurately analyze thousands of hours and many terabytes of nocturnal migration data.But more people are joining the nighttime surveillance network. More and more data are flying in from nighttime listening stations. Benjamin is one of the few researchers trying to get arms around all of it.And he has a big data problem on his hands.A single night of recording produces anywhere from eight to 12 hours of audio that is about one to three gigabytes in size. And that’s only at one location. Hundreds of people are recording migration all across the U.S. and beyond. Nightly audio intelligence from the network then needs to be combed through to find moments where migratory birds emitted nocturnal flight calls, or NFCs, above the microphone. During especially busy nights, that can mean more than 20,000 NFCs in a single recording from one site.Then comes the problem of deciphering those calls.Van Doren: Flight calls are very short vocalizations. They might last a fifth or even a twentieth of a second, and so it takes a lot of skill and practice to learn how to identify these calls, especially by ear—something I personally don’t feel that confident at. And processing hours and hours of passive audio recordings can be extremely tedious and difficult.Job: And if you’re in the business of studying migratory birds like Benjamin and other scientists at the Lab of Ornithology are, that can get overwhelming.Van Doren: We have hundreds, thousands, maybe tens of thousands of hours of recordings that we may want to analyze, which is just way too much for the small number of skilled humans who can do this sort of thing by hand.So ... we really need computers to do some of the work for us to be able to get any useful, large-scale information out of these long passive audio recordings. And so that’s why we turn to machine learning.Job: Machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, is something we’ve all been hearing a lot about lately. But really, it’s been around for quite some time.Van Doren: Machine learning describes such a vast array of computational tools that it is really everywhere in our lives, everywhere from credit-card-fraud detection to facial recognition to my phone suggesting which apps to open at a certain time of day.Job: I mean, even as I wrote this episode, Google Docs suggested, oftentimes correctly, the next word or phrase I planned on typing. That’s possible because of machine learning. But Benjamin uses a specific type for bird call data.Van Doren: One area of machine learning is computer vision, which we can use to distinguish dogs from cats in pictures, for example—or, in our case, distinguish different birds on audio recordings by feeding the computer not the raw sound itself but actually the visual representation of sound as a spectrogram, really a picture that represents the sound.Job: Basically the spectrograms Benjamin is referring to are visual fingerprints of nocturnal flight call audio.Van Doren: We feed the computer these spectrograms that we’ve classified as one species or another, and then, as we repeat that thousands and thousands of times, the computer learns to be able to distinguish one species from another.Job: So if we want a computer to learn how to identify dogs in pictures, you feed it many thousands of images of different dogs: small ones, large ones, dogs of all colors, dogs in different poses. Eventually, after enough training like this, the computer can recognize if a dog is present in most any picture you present it.Van Doren: If we train our models well enough, it can give us an accurate, or at least useful, estimate of the numbers of birds that were passing overhead, which species they were. And so very quickly, perhaps 300 [times] faster than real time, we can begin to process thousands of hours of audio in an efficient manner with these kinds of tools.Job: If you’re a birder, you may already be familiar with this technology. The Lab of Ornithology added a feature to its Merlin Bird ID app called “Sound ID”.Essentially, if you hear a bird outside and want to know what it is, you can tap this feature in the Merlin app and point your phone’s microphone toward the singing bird. After analyzing the spectrogram of the bird’s song, the app spits out its best guess as to what species of bird is singing in front of you.It’s highly accurate and really useful, kind of like Shazam for birds. I asked Benjamin if people could use this feature to identify NFCs.Van Doren: The tools and underlying technology behind something like Merlin, they can be applied to the flight call problem, this flight call challenge, but as you say it is trickier because there’s less information encoded in a 50-millisecond chip than in [a] several-second song of a Northern Cardinal, for example.So it makes it more difficult for the computer to make the identification accurately, but when you provide enough data, the computer gets good enough that it can hopefully overcome those types of shortcomings.And so one thing that I’m working on right now is trying to take that next step to develop a system based on some of the same technology that underlies Merlin but applied specifically to the challenge of identifying nocturnal flight calls.Job: Benjamin is hopeful this tool will be available in the not too distant future. And by creating such a tool, all of a sudden, the problem of ID’ing hard to identify night calls slowly begins to disappear.And this could help unlock the greatest mysteries of migration.Van Doren: We currently have a poor understanding of what birds are doing at the species level when they’re actively migrating, and flight calls can give us a window into how birds are interacting with the landscape, how they’re interacting with human-dominated areas like cities, and importantly, tell us how different species are behaving differently in response to the environment, to the landscape and also with each other.I think there’s a lot that we have yet to learn about how birds are interacting during migration. They’re saying something up there, and in my view, there’s a lot we don't understand about what exactly they’re communicating as they are participating in these journeys of thousands of miles. So being able to monitor birds at such a large scale will provide us the kind of information we need to make informed conservation decisions going forward.[CLIP: Theme music]Job: And that’s where we’re headed in our final episode on the Nighttime Bird Surveillance Network. We illuminate some of the threats birds face during migration and how scientists are combining weather radar and night call monitoring to aid migratory bird conservation efforts.Kyle Horton: It’s really important for us to monitor those passages, especially in a time where birds are facing many different threats.Things tend to not look amazing for migratory birds right now.Job: Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose and Kelso Harper.Don’t forget to subscribe to Science, Quickly.

There’s been quite a bit of buzz over the past year about generative artificial intelligence (A.I.), especially in the context of chatbots like ChatGPT. Tech professionals are experimenting with this new technology and, in many cases, figuring out how to integrate it into their respective companies’ tech stacks.

But which generative A.I. skills and tools are most in demand? The answer can help tech professionals adjust their training and potentially land more job interviews. According to Upwork’s latest analysis of the generative A.I. market, the top 10 generative A.I.-related job searches from companies included, in descending order:


ChatGPT
BERT
Stable Diffusion
TensorFlow
A.I. Chatbot
Generative A.I.
Image Processing
PyTorch
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Bard


This analysis took place between January and June 2023. “OpenAI continues to see a first-mover advantage with ChatGPT, including its underlying models GPT-3 and GPT-4, at the top of the list of generative AI-related search terms from those looking to hire, followed by BERT and Stable Diffusion,” Upwork added in a note accompanying the data.

“Many of the skills with the largest quarter-over-quarter growth in searches indicate a shift from singular generative AI tools toward generative AI applications and services, including A.I. content creation, Azure OpenAI, and prompt engineering,” the note continued.

For tech professionals everywhere, gaining baseline knowledge of generative A.I. seems increasingly essential. From there, it’ll only pay to master tools and frameworks such as ChatGPT, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. It’s a good get that A.I. will fundamentally change many tech jobs in the years to come; after all, it’s already having a sizable impact on software development.

While the number of A.I.-related jobs is still relatively small and concentrated in a few key areas, expect mentions of the technology to proliferate in job postings. Companies everywhere want tech specialists who can make apps, services, and backend infrastructure “smarter” through the use of machine learning and A.I.

Certain projections hint at the potential loss of hundreds of millions of jobs, underscoring the transformation of professions and the need for swift and strategic adaptations by organizations to ensure their survival. Curiously, despite being at the forefront of technology, high-tech employees seem to underestimate the scale of this change. A mere 51% of workers in the tech sector believe that the rapid advancements in AI have minimal or no influence on their company's strategies. This data originates from Alignment Labs, a technology startup collecting unique insights into the high-tech industry's trends. A scant 10% perceive a significant impact from artificial intelligence, and a mere 2% consider it central to their strategy. Notably, individuals in management positions tend to better comprehend AI's implications. Distinctions emerge between those in technical and non-technical roles. Employees in less technical positions such as Operations, QA, or Customer Success predominantly report negligible impact. Responses from developers fluctuate based on their specific roles. Algorithm engineers appear less concerned about the impact compared to Full Stack developers who regard these technological advancements as notably influential.   Alon Blum, Co-founder and CPO at Alignment Labs, notes, ""The sense of security among technology workers, even an innocent one, isn't surprising. We witnessed a similar pattern in the tech industry during the economic crisis and market bubble burst. After the crisis, tech workers, especially the youth who hadn't experienced a crisis before, remained complacent. Our data indicated that 82% of the workers in the industry believed the economic situation wouldn't affect them or their companies, right before widespread layoffs."" Blum suggests that managers are likely more exposed to strategic discussions, enhancing their understanding of the technological leap's consequences. He highlights, ""Although certain companies might remain untouched by AI's impact on strategy, many employees remain complacent. They perceive it as distant, irrelevant for now. In reality, hardly any company dealing with deep tech remains unimpacted by AI strategically. This complacency is irrational."" He adds, ""Oddly, tech-savvy individuals adopt new tools less because they grasp how they work."" In other industries, the situation isn't much better. A Salesforce survey of over 4,000 employees globally reveals that 56% believe generative AI will fundamentally change their jobs, and 62% anticipate that these tools will demand different skill sets. Employees anticipate that generative AI will enable them to focus on strategic tasks and save time. 65% believe it will permit concentration on strategic work, potentially saving five weekly work hours—equivalent to a month annually for full-time staff. The latent potential of AI tools remains largely untapped. While 54% of workers believe generative AI will propel their careers forward, 62% admit to lacking the skills required for effective and safe technology utilization. Moreover, the survey underscores a gap between employee aspirations to learn and their companies' provision of skill improvement opportunities. Approximately 40% of workers express uncertainty about effectively employing generative AI at work. 43% admit lacking knowledge about leveraging generative AI with trusted data sources while upholding first-party data security. Furthermore, 53% struggle to maximize the potential of generative AI. Most managers (70%) share the sentiment that employees lack the necessary skills for effective and secure generative AI use.      From an employer perspective, managers perceive tangible advantages in bridging the AI skills gap for organizational cost savings. A significant 82% believe that generative AI will lower overall business expenses, while 80% assert that it will contribute to revenue growth. ""Generative artificial intelligence offers significant opportunities for both organizations and employees. As it becomes increasingly recognized and discussed as a powerful tool within the workplace, the skills gap is likely to widen,"" states Illy Ben Haim, Human Resources Director at Salesforce Israel. ""Today, companies bear the responsibility of furnishing the essential tools and strategies to facilitate swift adaptation. Organizations need to adjust to this new capability by defining their trajectory and establishing a learning framework equipped to manage perceptual shifts and employee cognitive patterns. (How can artificial intelligence capabilities be integrated into roles without rendering them obsolete? What skills can be cultivated in the era of artificial intelligence to support ongoing personal development?) Furthermore, they must establish clarity concerning evolving roles in the age of artificial intelligence applications.""","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/firwc3kmk'}",708.0,,5211.Ctech-5220.ctech.News,,,,https://stream.geniusplus.ai/K63G3ZAB1W3GHOKBNwQ9/1721708124793_640x480_thumbnail.jpg,2024-07-18T19:50:24.000Z,PT7M26S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'interactionType': {'@type': 'http://schema.org/WatchAction'}, 'userInteractionCount': 2026}","{'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews', 'name': 'CTech'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/category/5220', 'name': 'News'}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 With the online world obsessing about chatbots, some AI (artificial intelligence) phrases are entering the mainstream conversation. One of those is large language models or LLMs, and you can't read about OpenAI or chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard for long without running into it. But outside of computer science, not many people know what this technology is.

 Large language models power the AI chatbot tech that's getting so much discussion these days. And whether you're eager to see if AI can help you write an email on your Android (it probably already is) or are worried about students cheating with chatbots (there's a lot to unpack there), it's important to understand how they work. So let's dive into the mathematical morass that's large language models and see what's going on! 


 What are large language models (LLMs)? 
    






 These models, which are based on machine learning and neural network technology, analyze and label different parts of a language so that they can ""talk"" like a person. Or, in ChatGPT's case (and the other GPT family like GPT-3 and GPT-4), imitate different tones and conversations, and some are better than others. This is part of the natural language processing or NLP discipline. Large language models are a key part of the chatbot AI and are built to continue learning as long as they can process more examples of human language. 

 LLMs don't learn grammar like humans do. Instead, they follow a unique process that labels different parts — say, words in a sentence — so LLMs can make a good mathematical guess at how to write or talk. With enough study, these deep learning models can make a good guess, good enough to imitate a college essay or a helpful customer service representative.

 LLMs are inherently complex, and we don't have the time to give an entire college course on them (although that would be fun). Instead, let's break down some of their important parts and how these machine-learning models work. 

 Tokenization 
 Tokenization is the process of turning everyday human language into sequences that LLMS can understand, a part of natural language processing. That involves assigning sections (usually words or parts of words) number values and encoding them for rapid analysis. Think of it like the AI way of teaching phonetics. Tokenization's goal is to create context vectors, which are like cheat sheets or formulas for the AI to guess how a sentence goes. 

 The more the AI studies language and gets information about how language fits together, the better guesses it can make about what words come next in certain kinds of sentences. Add that together over and over again, and you get models that can reproduce different ways humans talk on the internet. 






 Transformer models 
 A transformer model is a neural network that analyzes sequential data and looks for signs about how that data fits together, like which words are most likely to follow other words. These models are made of blocks or layers, each focusing on a different type of analysis to help understand what words fit together and what words don't. Sometimes, they get their own names, like the open source BERT. They form foundation models that are the basis for all LLMs. 

 Credit for transformer creation is generally given to Google's engineers in the late 2010s. As mentioned above, transformer models don't learn a language. Instead, they use algorithms to understand how humans write words. Feed a transformer model a bunch of hipster blogs about coffee, and it quickly learns how to write a generic hipster piece about coffee. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques like reinforcement learning give the model feedback about when it's wrong. Transformer models are the foundation of LLM language generation, and they can be increasingly complex depending on their purpose, so complex that they need lots of servers to hold the large-scale model. 





 Their creators devise creative ways to classify words so that the models understand how they work. For example, positional encoding embeds the order of words in sentences so that the model always knows what order they come in, even if words are provided randomly. Attention mechanisms like self-attention assign more importance to some parts of sentences than others, allowing the models to recognize what humans emphasize when writing. 

 Prompts 
 Prompts are the inputs that developers give LLMs to tokenize and analyze, basically training data for different use cases. Prompts can be nearly anything. For chatbots, for example, prompts are tons of online writing, essays, articles, and books (which is why some authors are suing). The more prompts an LLM gets in the training process, the better it can predict the next word and create sentences. That's because language, especially the casual language used by humans online, is redundant and frequently predictable. 






 Prompts also influence how the AI sounds and responds to things, which can cause trouble. Many of us remember that one of Microsoft's early attempts at online AI was quickly shut down after it became a Nazi because its prompts were from Twitter users. Choosing the proper prompts for a deep learning AI is essential. Services like ChatGPT try to cast a wide net while providing important parameters about what not to include. Lots of fine-tuning is involved, and frequent tweaks to learning algorithms help AI models learn how to treat data or perform specific tasks. 



 Chatbots use large language models, right? Is that a good thing?

 Today's new AI chatbots do, it's how they generate text and answer questions. Basic chatbots, like those found on brand website pop-ups or Facebook stores, don't use this technology and barely qualify as AI in many cases. But services like the family of GPTs, Google's Bard, Bing AI, Pi, and others use different kinds of LLMs. A growing number of apps use simpler models to imitate human speech, like the latest therapy apps (with mixed results). 

 By this point, you may be wondering if LLMs are responsible for AI-generated art from things like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney. Basically, yes, visually generative AI are versions of LLMs. They use similar models to look at visual aspects instead of written language. That's how they can roughly understand objects, subjects, and different art styles. 

 But art and text data aren't the only things LLMs are useful for. These are just the beginning. State-of-the-art AI systems are learning molecular structures and protein sequencing in the same way, which helps scientists and pharmaceutical companies discover new solutions. They're handling minor coding tasks and metadata work to make websites better and more accessible. And general-purpose models are helping humans communicate better in different languages. Even everyday uses, like summarizing long reports for busy readers, have large-scale advantages. 







 Are large language models dangerous? 
    

 Dangerous in the sense that they're going to create murderbots to take over Earth? No. They're also probably not going to take over many jobs unless those jobs are simple and repetitive. For LLMs, context is difficult. They can't easily understand new information and can never reflect on what to say before saying it. 

 Still, these models have other issues that can make them dangerous. Most issues boil down to a few root causes: 






 They can spread disinformation or biased opinions: LLMs and their chatbots don't know if the information is accurate. They only know, in a literal way, what they've been told and how to repeat it in different ways. Chatbots have been caught spreading disinformation and been accused of political bias, among other problems. It's hard to create a large language model with internet information that doesn't run into disinformation issues. And sometimes, LLM-powered chatbots produce fake information, including fake financial numbers for corporations and fake cases for lawyers. AI developers sometimes call these hallucinations, and it's hard to optimize them away. 

 They can allow dangerous behavior: You may have heard the stories about how ChatGPT's grandma exploit had granny giving away illegal keys to licensed software or telling you how to make napalm, despite filters to prevent behavior like this. When a large language model consumes enough information, it can teach you how to do about anything, and for today's chatbots, that can include a lot of Dark Web stuff. So far, creators haven't found an effective way to stop it entirely. 






 They're a privacy risk: The massive datasets fed into large language models can also contain some sensitive information, including your information. That includes info about you that's easy to find online or on public social. It can even include conversations you've had online or online activity that advertisers use. Since LLM AIs are new, there's not much robust privacy protection preventing this. 

 They're energy hogs: LLMs are huge and consume a ton of energy. That's bad news for companies trying to lower their carbon footprints, and leads to many associated environmental costs. 

 They don't have any ethics: People can use tools like ChatGPT to create almost anything they want. Now, schools need new ways to detect fake AI essays. People can ask ChatGPT to generate insulting or hateful content or ask it to impersonate someone for catfishing, blackmail, or other purposes. It may even write code for malware or whip up fake research about why vaccines don't work. These are issues that can't be solved with a simple filter, and we're only beginning to see the ramifications. 








 Plotting the future of technology with LLMs 
 Large language models use advanced AI tools to categorize language (or other data) in such a way that lets them understand how humans communicate. That's largely influenced by the parameters set and the prompts fed into LLMs, which is how tools like ChatGPT are formed. 

 The future of LLMs can seem scary and for a good reason. But despite the pitfalls this new technology creates, LLMs have many powerful and positive uses. We have a lot to learn about how to use them, how to structure them so that they're safe to use, and how to feed them the correct prompts. Deepfakes and essay cheats are only a couple of the results when we get things wrong. Welcome to the wild west of language-based AI. It's going to be quite a ride.

Generative AI models are all the rage these days, so it's easy to get caught up in the hype and fall short of delivering real value. The only way to make these emerging models deliver more value is to measure what matters to your organization and improve on the results.







The trouble is that there are many ways to quantify generative AI initiatives and models, from performance and accuracy to precision, utility and ROI. Agreeing on the appropriate metrics upfront can mean the difference between a costly experiment and bottom-line value.
Enterprises should focus on two key types of metrics for generative AI, according to Christine Livingston, a managing director in the emerging technology practice at Protiviti. The first type is related to the performance of the model itself, such as response time, precision and accuracy. These measures should also be considered in the context of the use cases and capabilities a model requires.
The second type of metric is the value delivered. ""It is important to establish an anticipated benchmark for generative AI, such as reducing the time and effort spent to perform tasks, increasing throughput, or increasing demand generation,"" Livingston said. These metrics inform the enterprise of where and when to invest further in generative AI initiatives and ensure models continue to deliver value over time.

Customize metrics for specific use cases
Quantifying the performance of generative AI models can be challenging due to the vast number of use cases, said Buddhi Jayatilleke, chief data scientist at Sapia, a human resources AI platform. And the performance of LLMs can be defined in different ways across the development lifecycle. Various metrics provide more value across pre-training, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback processes.
""The gold standard for evaluating generative models often involves human judgment, but this can be costly and slow, particularly at scale,"" Jayatilleke said. One approach is to use human evaluation sparingly and strategically, perhaps to validate and calibrate automated metrics. It's also helpful to set up feedback loops to learn from users, and to keep abreast of the latest research on new evaluation benchmark data sets to add to the automated tests.
Metrics can vary by the job function and service offered, said Todd Johnson, president of U.S. enterprise applications at Nexer Group, an IT services and consulting firm. Customer service scenarios can use traditional metrics such as customer retention, customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Score. Productivity scenarios can be more difficult to measure directly. For example, the task completion rate needs to be balanced against work quality measures.
Johnson recommends carefully rolling out new tools or models by creating test groups to provide baselines and evaluate different tools. ""Ultimately, it's still going to be a human decision as to whether these tools make us better at our job or not,"" he said.


Areas to be evaluated with generative AI metrics
Here are eight areas -- and some of their metrics and benchmarks -- that should be tracked and evaluated to gauge the success of enterprise generative AI programs and projects.
1. ROI
From a financial perspective, measuring ROI helps determine if and how a machine learning (ML) program or project delivers meaningful value. But this value can come from various benefits such as increased sales, profits, productivity or customer engagement. ""Many generative AI-based projects in organizations are still in the research stage, making it hard to predict their exact value,"" said Matan Libis, vice president of products at SQream, a data preparation platform for ML.
Libis recommends setting clear KPIs for success and allocating a sufficient budget for research.
2. Goal completions
Measuring goal completions, which reflect how many tangible and desirable business outcomes a model achieves, is another way to evaluate generative AI achievements, according to Israel Krush, CEO and co-founder at conversational AI platform Hyro.
For example, in an app that helps patients schedule physician appointments, Hyro measures how many such appointments the app handled end-to-end. Developing a new measure for each use case can show when it's delivering value. ""It's never been easier to add a fun and engaging chatbot to your website,"" Krush said, ""but if you don't really understand what it's there for, what's the point of having it?""
3. Fidelity
Another empirical method to gauge the success of generative AI-based systems in organizations is fidelity, which assesses the similarity between generated output and real data. A high fidelity score indicates the model's proficiency in producing realistic and accurate results. Libis said this aspect is critical for building trust in this technology, as both organizations and their customers rely on these models to serve them faithfully and avoid misinterpretation.
However, achieving maximum ROI and fidelity together might not always be possible. Sometimes, improving one can come at the cost of the other. Libis has found it helpful to build a shared understanding of the application's specific requirements to strike the right balance between ROI and fidelity based on project goals and priorities.
4. Task performance
It's also helpful to assess task performance, Jayatilleke said. This area looks at how well the model responds to a given prompt, such as summarizing some text, solving a math problem or performing common-sense reasoning. A task-specific benchmark data set and related metrics can help evaluate how well the model performs against the benchmark.
Jayatilleke often uses the Massive Multitask Language Understanding, or MMLU, benchmark that covers subjects across STEM, the humanities, social sciences and more, ranging from an elementary to advanced professional level. Other relevant metrics include the following:

Generation consistency, which measures whether similar prompts in the same context can lead to almost semantically similar responses.
Prompt sensitivity, which measures how detailed a prompt needs to be to get the optimal response from the LLM.

5. Safety
Safety metrics help test for risks such as ethical concerns about generative AI, truthfulness, toxicity and security. This can include measuring the prevalence of racially biased responses, AI hallucinations or leaks of confidential information. Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA can complement human expert testing. Running multiple automated tests covering various concerns is the best practice, according to Jayatilleke. But as the training data and training parameters change, these benchmarks might not be able to capture the new learnings of the model.
6. Personality
At Sapia, Jayatilleke's team set up their own metrics to assess the personality projected by the different versions of the OpenAI GPT models. Their metrics related to personality dimensions or the emotional intelligence of the generative AI models that power chatbots to help better understand and compare their behavior. They found significant differences between GPT-2, ChatGPT -- built on GPT-3.5 -- and GPT-4. This research helped them establish a baseline that could be used to evaluate how further adjustments to these models affect interactions with users.
7. Accuracy
Accuracy measures how well a model's predictions or outputs align with the desired results, which is not always easy to assess. ""LLMs, in general, have an accuracy problem, and no one has been able to determine a standard method for evaluating an LLM's quality in this regard,"" said Yonatan Geifman, CEO and co-founder of Deci, a deep learning development platform.
It's often easier to assess accuracy in domains such as coding using benchmarks including the HumanEval database. In other domains, there are multiple evaluation methods to choose from, including the following:

Perplexity is a metric that evaluates a language model's ability to predict the next word in a word sequence.
Inception score, or IS, is a mathematical algorithm that measures the quality of generative AI images.
Fréchet inception distance, or FID, analyzes images generated by generative adversarial networks for realism and diversity.
Precision is a metric that measures the number of correct predictions made by a generative AI model.
Recall details the ratio of positive samples classified by a model as positive vs. the total number of positive samples generated.
F1 score measures an AI model's accuracy using the precision and recall factors.
Bilingual evaluation understudy, or BLEU, is a metric used to automatically evaluate machine-translated text against reference text.
Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation, or ROUGE, measures the quality of a machine-translated summary against one created by a human.
Metric for evaluation of translation with explicit ordering, or METEOR, scores machine translations based on word-to-word matching against a reference translation.
Consensus-based image description evaluation, or CIDEr, measures a machine-generated sentence against human-generated information that is known to be real and true.
Manual evaluation is when a human compares machine-generated results on a case-by-case basis.

It's also common to ask users to count the number of likes or suggestions they accept.
The more significant challenge, Geifman said, lies not in choosing which metrics to use, but in selecting the appropriate evaluation data sets on which to apply these metrics. Inaccuracies are being discovered in some of the most commonly used data sets for evaluation. There are also concerns that large models such as GPT-4 were exposed to these evaluation data sets during training, and therefore they cannot be used as an objective evaluation data set.
8. Inference speed
Inference speed quantifies the model's performance in terms of speed and efficiency at runtime.
The latency of the model is typically measured in iterations per second, which directly affects the inference cost of the model. Lower latency leads to reduced compute cost, a smaller carbon footprint and an improved overall user experience. ""It is important to consider model speed early in the process, as slow inference performance can become a major barrier for business scalability and operational cost efficiency,"" Geifman said.


Challenges in setting up a metrics program
It's important to note that many challenges can arise when setting up a metrics program for generative AI models. Some of these top challenges, according to Doug Ross, vice president and head of insights and data at Sogeti, part of Capgemini, include the following:
Subjectivity
Generative models often create outputs, such as text or images, meant to be consumed and interpreted by humans. Human evaluation is subjective, and individuals might disagree as to the quality of the result. This can make it difficult to establish a benchmark or baseline for evaluation. One way to overcome this is to crowdsource using multiple human evaluators to assess the results.
Bias
Models can mimic or even amplify biases in training data or methods, which can have ethical consequences. Monitoring for bias is an important step, and more diverse training data sets are helpful. A 2023 Capgemini Research Institute report, ""Harnessing the Value of Generative AI: Top Use Cases Across Industries,"" found that 51% of surveyed organizations cited a lack of clarity on underlying training data as a challenge stalling generative AI implementations.
Scalability
As models and data sets grow, the computational power and attendant expenses can also increase. Efficiency and financial metrics can help plan for and address scalability challenges.
Attacks
Some models are susceptible to attacks, such as jailbreaks, that leak information or provide unwanted outputs. Red team testing of models is helpful to determine if additional safeguards are needed.
Selecting the right metrics
Given the various ways to gauge model accuracy, performance and efficiency, choosing the right metrics becomes a key factor in a production deployment.
Monitoring
Continuous checks of model output will help ensure the model does not drift or that answers do not change over time. This can be done with automated testing and human oversight.


The future of generative AI metrics
Tools to assess performance and benefits are a work in progress. Experts expect to see advances on many fronts.
Veracity can be a challenging, if not impossible, metric to establish for LLMs, Livingston observed. She predicts significant developments in the ability to monitor and measure the authenticity and veracity of responses and outputs to determine drift and bias movements.
Libis expects to see more progress on explainability and interpretability metrics, while Jayatilleke believes it is time to consider better metrics to measure the carbon footprint of training generative models. It will also be important to develop metrics to assess the contamination of future training data sets with AI-generated content as those become ubiquitous, he said.
Johnson predicts that additional telemetry will become part of generative AI tool sets to provide detailed data on how the AI model is used. It will also provide insight into how the model is performing and guidance on where there is room for improvement.
Ross expects to see improved performance evaluation metrics that better capture model accuracy and generalized performance. Some promising new metrics include precision and recall; FID+, an enhancement on the Fréchet inception distance algorithm; and learned perceptual image patch similarity, or LPIPS, distance.
""A combination of better evaluation techniques, more diverse training data sets and transparent architectures are likely to be among the directions used in improving objective measures of model performance,"" Ross said.

PT Staff: How is generative AI reshaping the healthcare landscape?



Deborah Weinswig: Right now,what we're seeing is that it's having dramatic impact in terms of how people think. And when you start to look at it from a kind of healthcare provider perspective, that's where we're actually seeing some of the biggest changes now.



And if you think about whether it's around imaging, whether it's around clinical trials, I mean, it is having, I think, much more of an impact than anybody ever would have expected in healthcare specifically. And you start to think about how you can engage with a customer in a physical store. And we're starting to see AI move onto devices. And so this idea that you have that kind of compute power, literally in the palm of your hand, and you can start to really think differently about how you don't have to know everything, you'd have to have the prompt to get the answer. And so, you can take care of customers and I think there's an immediacy. And there's also a kindness now; I find it's expected because when you have a prompt and you ask a question, it's responding very kindly. And so, if you kind of just cut and paste as opposed to adding in your own voice, it's talking in a very nice way. And so, this whole idea that, whether it's at the beginning of the lifecycle in terms of raw materials all the way to consumption, generative AI plays a role today. And we're seeing a lot of experiments that are being run. But I think that some of those are actually turning into full blown impact on organizations. Right now, we're actually seeing more of an impact in healthcare specifically, [which is] kind of moving over into like retail pharmacy clinics and obviously the doctor's office as well, and ultimately, I think [it will impact] the relationship that people have with the consumer.



PT Staff: What factors influence the economic argument for generative AI?



Deborah Weinswig: Economics is really what it always boils down to. And if you think about it, we had Metaverse and Web3 a year ago. And that was easy because companies would develop a non-fungible token (NFT) that had value in terms of being able to be sold, and there was an immediate kind of revenue stream—very clear and concise. And there's also the opportunity to talk to the consumers about what you were doing. You could see it. It's digital, but you'd have it in your phone or whatnot [and] you can send it to people.



The challenge, and sometimes with generative AI, is that you can't really see it, you just have to kind of understand it. And so I do think that in some cases, what we're seeing is that it really is the most senior people in the organization who are making some of these decisions because there's this inability to see what it can do. But if you start to think about it:



[First], I'd look at demand forecasting and do a much better job of understanding generative AI. Take when we talked about drug shortages. There are shortages of all kinds of things right now (i.e. take going to the store and facing organized retail crime) [which shows that] there are other things that are driving [drug shortages]. [Generative AI] can do a better job with demand forecasting, number 1.



Secondly, [generative AI can provide] better data and better insights (around retail media networks) so that those retailers who have the traffic, whether it's online or offline, are being properly rewarded. That's significant.



Third, if you start to think about being able to monetize [generative AI], whether it's the anonymization of your consumer data, or anonymiz[ing] some of the other data in your organization. And then, besides that, you can monetize your internet protocol (IP). So, there's now these other revenue streams, whether you are a healthcare provider or whether you're a retailer with your brand, that didn't even really exist 12 months ago.



And so, I think deciding where to start, that's where some of the (I'd say) frustration is. So, I think you just must make a move. Run a few experiments and see what works. If you're also, let's say, not an international company, in some ways it's easier because where you're experimenting is going to be somewhat homogeneous. What we're seeing is a lot of companies that are global are having greater challenges making some of these decisions, because how does this translate outside of the home market? What is the cost of running these large language models? And there are other factors that come into play on the economic side.



But I think that ultimately, we're going to see fewer hours required to do basic tasks— this may [increase] the ability to drive employee engagement and reduce turnover because people are going to enjoy their jobs more. And then I think that ultimately, the numbers we're seeing is that employees are getting back about 33% to 40% of their time. And so, one of the questions that we've been grappling with is, “Are employers going to think about assigning them more tasks? Or are they going to be able to figure out kind of how to use that time to fill in some of what they're doing, and also maybe spend time learning new things to do?”





PT Staff: How can generative AI be used to stay on top of emerging market trends/overcome obstacles in pharmacy?



Deborah Weinswig: So personally, [I’m] somebody who spent a lot of time thinking about adherence and the challenges that we face, especially as somebody who's had aging parents an have had to worry about these [things], such as “I’ve laid out all the boxes for them, but do they know what time is it [so they take their medications on time]? Did they did they go down [the pillbox rows] instead of across? How do I make sure?”



So this idea that [generative AI] can now help with adherence to me, [reflects how it can] impact outcomes and impact our health immediately. And in starting to think about some of these other things—[especially} because generative AI has almost a sensing mechanism—It’s this idea that before running out of your prescription, a new one is delivered to you (obviously you're opting into that), number 1, and number 2 is this idea that, let's say, the efficacy isn't there and you're having some kind of reaction [to the drug]? Your ability to then get the kind of medication at the right time and let’s say in the right kind of form factor is also really critical.



Three, the ability to reach out to someone; I mean, there are these chatbots and they are becoming increasingly intelligent. And so this idea that they can answer questions for you about how to take your medication, if you're seeing any contraindications or if you have any kind of reaction, it’s this idea that you have a kind of partner almost who is there every step of the way. You have your doctor, obviously, and you have your healthcare system. But this is also then removing some of the burden for everyday questions. And chat boxes can also do higher level work if you will. They can be more proactive, and it frees up the pharmacist’s time from a lot of the more maintenance aspect of their jobs.



And one thing to think about, if we start to think about clinics and if you think about the future of pharmacy is— we talked about this idea before we started the official interview— around food prescriptions. In many kinds of pharmacy situations is a wide assortment of food. And so the idea that, not only can I get advice from a pharmacist that is really personalized, you can call it precision medicine, or personalization at scale. But, there's this idea that not only are you getting the right medication for yourself at the right time, [but] you're getting great advice from the pharmacist… who can start to talk to you about some of what you're eating and how you're eating it, how you're feeling and whatnot, and provide advice. And I think this idea that we start to look at the whole human, if you will, the whole customer in a different way than we've been able to before, I think that we are on the precipice of that. They can save the healthcare system a lot of money and a lot of time and have much better outcomes.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/patients-pharmacists-do-not-need-to-see-generative-ai-to-understand-it-s-potential-in-pharmacy'}",,en-US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marketing and Sales Leaders Want More Generative AI in Their Work [Chart]



Eric Hal Schwartz  on August 25, 2023 at 4:00 pm


Marketing and sales leaders are feeling cautious enthusiasm about deploying generative AI within their organizations, according to a McKinsey study. The consultant group found that respondents saw moderate potential value across potential applications in areas like lead generation, campaign optimization, and personalized outreach. That said, significant gaps remain between interest and implementation, as can be seen in the chart above.
The survey came back with a whopping 90% of respondents saying they believe their teams should utilize generative AI and machine learning techniques often or very often. This aligns with estimates that marketing and sales functions stand to gain the most economic value from deploying AI systems. The numbers in the chart point to ongoing interest in applying generative AI more often than is currently done. That said, a full 60% said their organizations rarely or never do this. Recognizing this potential may be why 85% said they rarely or never use generative AI. It demonstrates the disconnect between eagerness to adopt AI and real-world rollout.
Survey participants were most excited about employing generative AI during the early stages of the customer journey. Lead identification, marketing optimization, and personalized outreach hold the most appeal compared to other use cases. The appeal stems from capabilities like processing vast datasets to identify high-potential leads, rapidly generating tailored messaging and creative content, and automating communication at scale. As seen in data gathered by McKinsey and other researchers, the perceived economic impact of generative AI is enormous, and a rapidly growing number of companies are eager to pursue the technology in any form that might benefit them.

It warned, however, that clerical work would likely be the hardest hit, potentially hitting female employment harder, given women’s over-representation in this sector, especially in wealthier countries.
An explosion of interest in generative AI and its chatbot applications has sparked fears over job destruction, similar to those that emerged when the moving assembly line was introduced in the early 1900s and after mainframe computers in the 1950s.

However, the study produced by the International Labour Organisation concludes that: “Most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI.”
This means that “the most important impact of the technology is likely to be of augmenting work”, it adds.
The occupation likely to be most affected by GenAI – capable of generating text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models and other data – is clerical work, where about a quarter of tasks are highly exposed to potential automation, the study says.
But most other professions, like managers and sales workers, are only marginally exposed, it said.
Still, the UN agency’s report warned that the impact of generative AI on affected workers could still be “brutal”.
“Therefore, for policymakers, our study should not read as a calming voice, but rather as a call for harnessing policy to address the technological changes that are upon us,” it said.

This FallStep 1: Assume all students are going to use the technology.Share full article143Read in app Credit...Víctor ArceBy Kevin RooseAug. 24, 2023Leer en españolLast November, when ChatGPT was released, many schools felt as if they’d been hit by an asteroid.In the middle of an academic year, with no warning, teachers were forced to confront the new, alien-seeming technology, which allowed students to write college-level essays, solve challenging problem sets and ace standardized tests.Some schools responded — unwisely, I argued at the time — by banning ChatGPT and tools like it. But those bans didn’t work, in part because students could simply use the tools on their phones and home computers. And as the year went on, many of the schools that restricted the use of generative A.I. — as the category that includes ChatGPT, Bing, Bard and other tools is called — quietly rolled back their bans.Ahead of this school year, I talked with numerous K-12 teachers, school administrators and university faculty members about their thoughts on A.I. now. There is a lot of confusion and panic, but also a fair bit of curiosity and excitement. Mainly, educators want to know: How do we actually use this stuff to help students learn, rather than just try to catch them cheating?I’m a tech columnist, not a teacher, and I don’t have all the answers, especially when it comes to the long-term effects of A.I. on education. But I can offer some basic, short-term advice for schools trying to figure out how to handle generative A.I. this fall.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFirst, I encourage educators — especially in high schools and colleges — to assume that 100 percent of their students are using ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools on every assignment, in every subject, unless they’re being physically supervised inside a school building.At most schools, this won’t be completely true. Some students won’t use A.I. because they have moral qualms about it, because it’s not helpful for their specific assignments, because they lack access to the tools or because they’re afraid of getting caught.But the assumption that everyone is using A.I. outside class may be closer to the truth than many educators realize. (“You have no idea how much we’re using ChatGPT,” read the title of a recent essay by a Columbia undergraduate in The Chronicle of Higher Education.) And it’s a helpful shortcut for teachers trying to figure out how to adapt their teaching methods. Why would you assign a take-home exam, or an essay on “Jane Eyre,” if everyone in class — except, perhaps, the most strait-laced rule followers — will use A.I. to finish it? Why wouldn’t you switch to proctored exams, blue-book essays and in-class group work, if you knew that ChatGPT was as ubiquitous as Instagram and Snapchat among your students?Second, schools should stop relying on A.I. detector programs to catch cheaters. There are dozens of these tools on the market now, all claiming to spot writing that was generated with A.I., and none of them work reliably well. They generate lots of false positives, and can be easily fooled by techniques like paraphrasing. Don’t believe me? Ask OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, which discontinued its A.I. writing detector this year because of a “low rate of accuracy.”It’s possible that in the future, A.I. companies may be able to label their models’ outputs to make them easier to spot — a practice known as “watermarking” — or that better A.I. detection tools may emerge. But for now, most A.I. text should be considered undetectable, and schools should spend their time (and technology budgets) elsewhere.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMy third piece of advice — and the one that may get me the most angry emails from teachers — is that teachers should focus less on warning students about the shortcomings of generative A.I. than on figuring out what the technology does well.

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.Last year, many schools tried to scare students away from using A.I. by telling them that tools like ChatGPT are unreliable, prone to spitting out nonsensical answers and generic-sounding prose. These criticisms, while true of early A.I. chatbots, are less true of today’s upgraded models, and clever students are figuring out how to get better results by giving the models more sophisticated prompts.As a result, students at many schools are racing ahead of their instructors when it comes to understanding what generative A.I. can do, if used correctly. And the warnings about flawed A.I. systems issued last year may ring hollow this year, now that GPT-4 is capable of getting passing grades at Harvard.Alex Kotran, the chief executive of the AI Education Project, a nonprofit that helps schools adopt A.I., told me that teachers needed to spend time using generative A.I. themselves to appreciate how useful it could be — and how quickly it was improving.“For most people, ChatGPT is still a party trick,” he said. “If you don’t really appreciate how profound of a tool this is, you’re not going to take all the other steps that are going to be required.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere are resources for educators who want to bone up on A.I. in a hurry. Mr. Kotran’s organization has a number of A.I.-focused lesson plans available for teachers, as does the International Society for Technology in Education. Some teachers have also begun assembling recommendations for their peers, such as a website made by faculty at Gettysburg College that provides practical advice on generative A.I. for professors.In my experience, though, there is no substitute for hands-on experience. So I’d advise teachers to start experimenting with ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools themselves, with the goal of getting as fluent in the technology as many of their students already are.My last piece of advice for schools that are flummoxed by generative A.I. is this: Treat this year — the first full academic year of the post-ChatGPT era — as a learning experience, and don’t expect to get everything right.There are many ways A.I. could reshape the classroom. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, thinks the technology will lead more teachers to adopt a “flipped classroom” — having students learn material outside class and practice it in class — which has the advantage of being more resistant to A.I. cheating. Other educators I spoke with said they were experimenting with turning generative A.I. into a classroom collaborator, or a way for students to practice their skills at home with the help of a personalized A.I. tutor.Some of these experiments won’t work. Some will. That’s OK. We’re all still adjusting to this strange new technology in our midst, and the occasional stumble is to be expected.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut students need guidance when it comes to generative A.I., and schools that treat it as a passing fad — or an enemy to be vanquished — will miss an opportunity to help them.“A lot of stuff’s going to break,” Mr. Mollick said. “And so we have to decide what we’re doing, rather than fighting a retreat against the A.I.”Kevin Roose is a Times technology columnist and a host of the podcast “Hard Fork.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Aug. 29, 2023, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: How Schools Can Cope and Grow When Their Students Are Using A.I..

The rise of AI has film and TV unions on edge.Aaron Fernandez for NBC NewsPrintSaveCreate your free profile or log in to save this articleAug. 23, 2023, 2:05 PM EDTBy David IngramFilm and television studios are trying to hire people with expertise in artificial intelligence, even as their writers and actors are out on strike citing the industry’s plans for AI and other concerns. Six entertainment companies, including Disney, Netflix, Sony and NBCUniversal, have been advertising for at least 26 positions related to AI in recent weeks, according to an NBC News search of online job listings. The companies are looking to pay many of the potential software developers more than $200,000 a year and, in some cases, far more, the job listings say. (NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News.)Streaming giant Netflix has been advertising 18 positions related to AI or machine learning, according to a search of the company’s jobs site. One of the positions would pay as much as $1 million to develop video games based on recent advances in AI, the ad says. The company jobs page doesn’t say how long the positions have been listed.A search of job sites turned up eight AI-related open positions at more traditional, establishment media companies. Two major unions, representing actors and writers, are on strike after contract negotiations with the studios broke down on an array of issues, including pay and the use of AI. The 26 AI-related job openings seen by NBC News vary widely in how much they relate to creating content, which has been a primary anxiety in discussions of how AI will affect the livelihood of creative professionals. Some of the openings are focused on the back end of certain products, such as using AI to personalize search results, while other positions are more directly about content generation or supporting others who might do content generation. Even for AI jobs not directly related to creating content, the job openings are one indication of where production companies are putting their resources. As streamers and creative companies are facing a labor crisis, they’re actively seeking AI specialists — and they’re willing to pay high salaries for them. Many of the job openings refer to duties such as building an AI platform or innovation lab, suggesting that the companies are building for the long term rather than seeking an immediate alternative to striking workers. The use of AI to generate content is a major sticking point for striking writers and performers. Union leaders say that AI-generated digital actors threaten to one day take work from their members, with some creators including Sarah Silverman already claiming in lawsuits that tech companies are using their words or likeness to train AI replacements. Fran Drescher, president of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, has called AI “poison.” “When you have a combination of Wall Street, greed, technology, whiz kids that I am not seeing exemplify a great deal of empathy — it’s a deadly cocktail, in my opinion, and I don’t want us to have to drink that poison anymore,” she said in a July 28 episode of the guild’s podcast. “Everybody’s watching dystopia series as entertainment, while my members are living it,” Drescher said. In contract negotiations, SAG-AFTRA is asking for compensation for performers who contribute to AI products and for AI companies to seek consent beforehand. The broadcasting company Sinclair is looking for someone to head its AI content efforts. Best known for conservative-leaning local news, Sinclair also has other media holdings and says it needs a director of AI for its innovation lab. Though the company is based in suburban Baltimore, the job would be in Los Angeles, according to the listing. “You will be at the helm of the development and implementation of generative AI solutions throughout our organization,” the ad says. The base salary is listed as up to $175,000 a year. Generative AI involves creating content and it has taken off in the past year, thanks to the viral success of apps like image generators, such as DALL·E 2, and chatbots, like ChatGPT. Some analysts believe that generative AI has only begun to shape the entertainment industry and how people spend their leisure time. A spokesperson for Sinclair said no one was immediately available for an interview or comment. A spokesperson for the Writers Guild of America West, which represents striking Hollywood writers, declined to comment on the AI job openings. SAG-AFTRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news site The Intercept reported last month that Netflix was offering as much as $900,000 a year for a single AI product manager. The job would involve overseeing an internal platform used by its AI software developers, according to an archived copy of the job ad. Another position for an engineering manager at Netflix would pay up to $900,000 a year for overseeing how the service uses AI to keep customers happy, the ad says. RecommendedCulture & TrendsCulture & TrendsHow Kamala Harris became part of Charli XCX's 'Brat' summerCulture & TrendsCulture & TrendsThe internet has entered its Kamala Harris 'coconut tree' era“Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence powers numerous aspects of the Consumer Experience, including innovation in content discovery and personalization for members, identifying and attracting new members to our product, optimizing our payment processing, and many more,” according to the listing. Other Netflix positions included ones in which potential hires will use machine learning to personalize viewers’ recommendations, or to support back end cloud-computing technology.“We free Netflix engineers from the complexity of modern software development, allowing them to focus on creating world-class entertainment,” says one ad for a director of Netflix’s internal engineering platform. The listing says total compensation for the role would typically be between $330,000 and $1.8 million, the highest pay among all the AI ads that NBC News found. A spokesperson for Netflix, which is based near San Jose, California, declined to comment except to point to a statement in May from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, an industry trade group for studios. (NBCUniversal is a member of the alliance.) The industry group said at the time: “AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone. For example, writers want to be able to use this technology as part of their creative process, without changing how credits are determined, which is complicated given AI material can’t be copyrighted. So it’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing.” Hollywood studios have been circumspect about their strategies related to generative AI. Disney CEO Bob Iger has spoken about using AI to create efficiencies and called the technology disruptive but has not given details. Actor Bryan Cranston said he had “a message for Mr. Iger” at a rally in New York last month when the ""Breaking Bad"" star vowed, “We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots.” Disney has been advertising for four AI-related jobs, according to the listings. They include a senior manager for machine learning engineering based in San Francisco, leading a team “to build state of the art event-driven real-time ML ecosystem;” a senior vice president for post-production and innovation with responsibilities that include being “on the leading edge of technology developments, like Artificial Intelligence;” a San Francisco-based machine learning engineer, and a data scientist in Santa Monica, California, working on machine learning and advertising. Overall, Disney and its subsidiaries listed 367 technology-related job openings on LinkedIn, according to a search of the site Monday. Disney did not respond to requests for comment on the job openings. Sony is hiring for a senior research scientist and manager to focus on AI ethics in its Sony AI division. That division was established in 2020 and, according to the job ad, it’s a “research organization pursuing the mission to use AI to unleash human creativity,” working closely with other company divisions, including film studio Sony Pictures. “Sony has many real-world AI applications at the intersection of entertainment and technology, and we are looking for smart, enthusiastic people who want to research, develop and deploy techniques for FTA,” the ad says. FTA refers to fairness, transparency and accountability, three areas that Sony says it wants to research. A Sony spokesperson said in an email: “This is not a job with the entertainment company. Sony AI, which was established 3 years ago, is run out of our corporate headquarters in Japan. The AI Ethics Office operates within Sony AI.” Sony says it’s working on an array of applications for AI, including a digital race car driver named Sophy for the video game franchise Gran Turismo and potential robotic assistants for chefs. NBCUniversal has advertised for a vice president in charge of product, personalization and search. The responsibilities listed include using machine learning to build recommendation and personalization systems. A spokesperson for NBCUniversal said the role is focused on honing customer recommendations and has no connection to the creation of content. Warner Bros. Discovery had one listing for an AI-related position: a senior software engineer based in San Francisco to work on AI-driven recommendations and personalization features for Max, the app formerly known as HBO Max. A spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. David IngramDavid Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more likely to enhance jobs by automating tasks rather than eradicating them. However, the potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, found a new study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO). 

The study titled ‘Generative AI and Jobs: Analysing Global Effects on Quantity and Quality of Employment’ proposes that the majority of occupations and sectors face only partial exposure to automation. They are more prone to being supplemented rather than entirely replaced by the latest advancements in Generative AI, like chatGPT. Also Read:

The primary consequence of this technological advancement is anticipated to involve shifts in job quality, particularly concerning factors such as work intensity and autonomy, rather than causing widespread job loss.
Among various jobs, clerical work emerged as the category with the highest technological susceptibility. Approximately twenty-five per cent of tasks within this category were identified as having a substantial level of exposure, while over fifty per cent of tasks exhibited a moderate degree of exposure. 
On the other hand, within occupational groups like managers, professionals, and technicians, only a minor portion of tasks were categorised as highly exposed, while around twenty-five per cent of tasks had a medium level of exposure.
Generative AI's gendered impact
According to the study's findings, the potential impacts of Generative AI are expected to vary notably between men and women. The study reveals that the proportion of female employment facing potential automation is more than double that of males. This discrepancy is attributed to the higher concentration of women in clerical roles, particularly in countries with moderate to high income levels. 
Given that clerical positions have historically been a significant avenue of employment for women during countries' economic advancement, one potential outcome of Generative AI is the absence of certain clerical jobs in lower-income nations.
Generative AI's geographical impacts
Conducted on a global scale, the study underscores significant variations in how different countries are impacted, aligning with their developmental stages and technological disparities. It reveals that in high-income nations, approximately 5.5 per cent of the overall workforce faces potential exposure to the automation repercussions of this technology. 
In contrast, low-income countries experience a notably lower risk of automation, affecting only around 0.4 per cent of employment. The prospects for job augmentation remain relatively consistent across countries. This implies that implementing appropriate policies could potentially enable developing nations to harness substantial advantages from this new phase of technological advancement.
The study also suggests that the socioeconomic repercussions stemming from Generative AI will primarily hinge upon the strategic management of its dissemination. It advocates for the formulation of policies that facilitate a structured, equitable, and inclusive transition process. 
Essential components for effective management include prioritising the input of workers, offering skill development programs, and establishing comprehensive social safety nets. Neglecting these aspects could lead to the possibility that only a select few countries and market participants with adequate preparation will derive advantages from this emerging technology.
The authors of the study emphasise that the ""outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined. It is humans that are behind the decision to incorporate such technologies and it is humans that need to guide the transition process.""

Do you expect the additional productivity AI creates to displace workers? What can I do to ensure I am seen as a valued employee? – WhitneyAnswer: I can understand why you, or any of us, may be apprehensive about being displaced by artificial intelligence! New research reveals that nearly one-quarter (23%) of U.S. workers are concerned that workplace automation will replace their job in the next five years. Workplace automation has already impacted nearly 10% of U.S. workers. AI may displace some jobs, but it is just as likely to result in the creation of new jobs too. Remember that AI is designed to help us, not to replace human connection. AI isn’t all-encompassing; it has its limits. Work will always need the human component because what we create and produce ultimately serves other humans. Even before AI existed, there have always been steps employees could take to demonstrate their value to their organization. That will not change. For instance, you can take on new assignments or projects and volunteer to help wherever needed. Do more than asked and do it well. And be on the lookout for more efficient or cost-effective ways of doing things in your job.It’s also essential to continue to learn and grow your skills by taking classes, receiving training, or taking advantage of other professional development opportunities. Be a problem solver and share your ideas with your manager.Make no mistake, AI will be a reality. We can choose to run from it and limit our opportunities and growth or embrace it to expand our performance, productivity and potential. Careers aren’t linear, so our skill sets shouldn’t be static. The world of work will need people to develop the knowledge and expertise to manage, monitor and measure the output of AI. Explore how AI may be relevant in your role and career. Be proactive and talk with your supervisor about AI and how to better serve customers, clients and the organization.AI is not going anywhere anytime soon, so now is a pivotal time for us to figure out how to leverage AI to our advantage. Don’t let fear of technology blind you to the opportunities it presents for your growth and advancement.Job searchHow deep should I go when discussing a contentious job separation? Ask HRMean boss?Here's how to deal with a difficult or toxic manager: Ask HRHow will my lack of a formal university degree affect my chances of obtaining a new position in the HR field, despite having 15 years of experience as an HR generalist and director and certifications? – KelleyThe challenges you face may depend on the level of HR job you are interested in. Sometimes higher-level HR jobs require a degree, but not always. Your substantial experience, along with your certifications, can offset not having a degree. Research suggests 9 out of 10 employers report being ready to accept candidates without a four-year college degree. In addition, the study also found 66% of employers are open to hiring candidates with a recognized certification.Once you identify a position of interest, review the minimum position requirements. The job posting may list a degree, but if it also includes the words “desired” or “preferred,” then the degree is not a requirement. Tailor your resume specific to the job you are applying for and highlight how your experience directly matches what the company is looking for, such as the skills, knowledge, and abilities to perform certain HR functions. And highlight your achievements in 15 years of HR experience that have been impactful in your previous and current organizations.Even if a degree is required, apply for it. What do you have to lose? You can include in your cover letter why you feel you are the best candidate for the job, despite not having a degree.I hope these suggestions will help you land your next dream job!

Generative AI will augment jobs, not destroy them ILO study findsby Freya LucasAugust 23, 2023

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more likely to augment existing jobs rather than destroy them through the automation of tasks, rather than taking over roles entirely, a new study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has found.
 
The findings are timely as the early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector begins to grapple with the logistical and ethical considerations presented by AI in a sector which is so driven by connection and authentic relationships.
 
Generative AI and Jobs: a global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality suggests that most jobs, sectors and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as chatGPT. 
 
Therefore, the greatest impact of this technology is likely to not be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy.
 
For sectors such as ECEC, where administrative tasks such as documenting children’s learning, disseminating information to parents and other stakeholders and complying with regulatory elements, this may prove advantageous. 
 
Clerical work was found to be the category with the greatest technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure. In other occupational groups – including managers, professionals and technicians – only a small share of tasks was found to be highly exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels.
 
Researchers took in a global perspective to reach the findings, with notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development, linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps.
 
They found that 5.5 per cent of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only some 0.4 per cent of employment. On the other hand, the potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries.
 
The potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, the study finds, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation. 
 
This is likely due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high- and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of Generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries.
 
The socioeconomic impacts of Generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed. It argues for the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair and consultative transition. Workers’ voice, skills training and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few, well-prepared countries and market participants will benefit from the new technology.
 
“Outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined,” researchers conclude. 
 
“It is humans that are behind the decision to incorporate such technologies and it is humans that need to guide the transition process”.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is more likely to augment jobs, by automating some tasks rather than taking over a role entirely, a new study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has found.Founded in October 1919 under the League of Nations, the ILO is one of the first and oldest specialised agencies of the United Nations.The study, “Generative AI and jobs: A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality”, suggests that most jobs and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of generative AI, such as ChatGPT.Therefore, the ILO says, the greatest impact of this technology is likely to not be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy.Since Microsoft-backed OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT as a prototype on 30 November 2022, the chatbot has gone viral.Among other capabilities, ChatGPT interacts in conversational dialogue form and provides responses that can appear human. The text-based chatbot can also draft prose, poetry or computer code on command.Tech giants such as Google, Meta, Amazon Web Services, IBM and Oracle have since released their own versions of generative AI models.The Brainy Insights estimates the generative AI market will grow from $8.65 billion in 2022 and reach $188.62 billion by 2032.Highest impactThe ILO study took two principal approaches to the analysis of automation of occupations. The first was to use data on job vacancies to understand how demand for specific skills evolves over time.The second approach was to focus on occupational structures, with the idea of estimating the automation potential of tasks or skills that make up a given job.Clerical work was found to be the category with the greatest technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly-exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure.In other occupational groups – including managers, professionals and technicians – only a small share of tasks was found to be highly-exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels, says the labour body.The study, which is global in scope, documents notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development, linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps.It finds that 5.5% of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only 0.4%.On the other hand, the potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries, ILO notes.The potential effects of generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, the study finds, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation.“This is due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high- and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries,” says ILO.Wait and seeThe paper concludes the socio-economic impacts of generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed.It argues for the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair and consultative transition. Workers’ voice, skills training and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few, well-prepared countries and market participants will benefit from the new technology.The authors note the “outcomes of the technological transition are not pre-determined. It is humans that are behind the decision to incorporate such technologies and it is humans that need to guide the transition process.”These findings align with some of the most recent literature on generative AI systems with a global focus.A recent study by McKinsey (2023) points to a similar group of “knowledge work” occupations and tasks as having the highest level of exposure, though with a significantly higher suggested level of displacement.The Word Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) global survey, which focused on large enterprises, also lists clerical and administrative jobs among occupations with the fastest expected declines (WEF 2023).Estimates provided by Goldman Sachs (2023) suggest a slightly higher level of potential automation than ILO’s calculations, but with the general conclusion aligning with the organisation’s main finding that “most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI”.Share",http://schema.org,BreadcrumbList,,['https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/08/ChatGPT-1-2023.jpg'],"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Admire Moyo', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/contributors/JAPero3qZBqQb6mG'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'ITWeb', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/contributors/organizations/2010/11/resized/itweb-logo-c.xl.gif'}, 'description': 'Business technology news and information portal for South Africa’s tech professionals and decision makers.'}",Generative AI to augment rather than destroy jobs,2023-08-22T10:43:01+02:00,2024-05-20T11:36:06+02:00,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/nG98Yd7LdA7X2PDJ', 'name': 'Enterprise Solutions'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Generative AI to augment rather than destroy jobs', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/generative-ai-to-augment-rather-than-destroy-jobs/KzQenvjydEbqZd2r'}]",,,,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/generative-ai-to-augment-rather-than-destroy-jobs/KzQenvjydEbqZd2r,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The burnout levels are higher among Gen X government workers (53 percent), women (50 percent), and lower-income employees (49 percent).Government employees say the top causes of burnout include their workload and staffing shortages, both at 53 percent. Nearly three-fourths of government workers (70 percent) say that increased flexibility in working hours or days would help reduce their burnout.When asked about Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), most government workers (64 percent) indicate they do not expect the emerging technology will impact their stress levels on the job. Yet, a growing body of research indicates that when properly implemented, AI can help improve worker efficiency and productivity. Millennials (31 percent) and male employees (21 percent) are most likely to say that AI can help reduce job stress. These findings are from the 2023 Eagle Hill Consulting Workforce Burnout Survey conducted by Ipsos from August 3-8, 2023. The survey included 1,347 respondents from a random sample of employees across the U.S. including 555 federal, state, and local government workers.""It's encouraging that burnout levels for government employees are trending downward, but worker burnout is still much too high,"" said Melissa Jezior, president and chief executive officer of Eagle Hill Consulting. ""In recent weeks, we've witnessed the immense pressure and stress on government employees battling multiple natural disasters across the nation. Meanwhile, jurisdictions from coast to coast are plagued with teacher shortages and government leaders continue to face chronic problems hiring and keeping employees.""Jezior said, ""It's imperative that government leaders address worker burnout head-on. That means having open conversations with employees to understand the causes of their burnout and collaborating to implement realistic solutions. Workers who are stressed and tired can't perform at optimal levels, and it could push them to look for another job.""""One area to closely monitor will be the impact of more government employees shifting back to in-person work. Our research indicates that government employees value in-person work, but they also want flexibility to alleviate burnout and stress. In fact, we found that government employees are worried about their work-life balance and commuting times that often come with in-person work. Finding the right balance of in-person and remote work will be increasingly important for government managers and leaders,"" Jezior said.The survey's key findings are as follows:When asked how staff shortages are impacting their workload, 87 percent of government workers experiencing burnout said it's covering the workload for unfilled positions, 45 percent said it's training new hires, 42 percent said it's helping others learn their job.Most employees (65 percent) who experience burnout feel comfortable telling their manager or employer they feel burned out.When asked how to reduce burnout, 70 percent said increased flexibility would help, followed by decreasing their workloads (69 percent). Other solutions include offering a four-day work week (67 percent), reducing administrative burdens (61 percent), working from home (60 percent), providing better health and wellness benefits (55 percent), offering more on-site amenities (50 percent), and providing workers with the ability to relocate or work from multiple locations (42 percent).The research also signals that government worker departures are likely to continue with more than one quarter of government workforce (29 percent) saying they plan to leave their job in the next 12 months. The planned departure rates are highest for lower income (41 percent), younger (34 percent), and female (33 percent) government employees.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/hrtech/64-percent-of-government-employees-say-generative-ai-will-not-impact-job-stress-research/103045902'}",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,contactus@ethrworld.com,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it casts a widening skill gap within the tech sector. To amplify the capabilities of technology, a bridge must be forged to cultivate the tech environment.Addressing this exigent demand, the ETHRWorld Futures Skills Conference 2023 orchestrated a panel discussion that gathered luminaries from the HR domain across diverse sectors to explore the theme ""Generative AI Ushering In A New Era Of Personalized And Interactive Learning At Scale."" The crux of this discourse revolved around the profound implications of AI and VR tools.Automation in the job sector and Generative AIThe conversation commenced with insights from Raghav Gupta, MD of Coursera India &amp; Asia Pacific, who shared findings from a pre-pandemic study by Oxford University that delved into automation's effects on low-skilled job sectors. He highlighted the shift occurring in high-skilled job landscapes with the advent of Generative AI. As we delve deeper into this technology-driven society, it becomes evident that AI presents a spectrum of opportunities, capable of generating solutions across software development, auditing, marketing, and even sales.Raghav noted, ""Attributes least susceptible to automation include empathy, negotiation, problem-solving, active listening, and digital collaboration."" His statement unveiled both the awe-inspiring potential and the confounding challenges that AI adoption brings.Key takeaways from his presentation The emphasis on the Importance of upskilling due to technology changes, even for high education levels.Even though Generative AI has gripped the economy, still Human skills like empathy, problem-solving, and negotiation remain intact.Reservations persisted concerning the possible advantages of personalized learning with Chat GPT and the direction of future learning trends.Triggers and Impact on Workforce LearningIn another notable discourse, Bidisha Banerjee, SVP of Talent Culture &amp; Employer Branding at Welspun Group, dissected the digital transformations leading to the incorporation of AI, including ChatGPT. This shift extends beyond the IT sector, permeating areas such as marketing, supply chain management, and other spheres.&ldquo;I think there is a sense of FOMO,&rdquo; said Banerjee, When asked about the Dynamic nature of the business environment, she marveled upon the FOMO Factor if humans still distinguish themselves from the captivating world of AI. She acknowledged the presence of new-age technology, being an indispensable part of our lives, the adaption of which will help integrate and amplify the human skillset.Her conclusion resonated: ""Technology won't displace our jobs; instead, it will amplify our efforts, providing room to engage in strategic work.""As the discussion progressed, Ina Bajwa, VP-HR at Tata Communications, unveiled a comprehensive exploration of the transformative technology landscape. She highlighted the business landscape's dynamic shifts over the past four years, catalyzed by the post-pandemic 'great reset,' necessitating adaptability. The solution, as the panelists fervently posited, lies in adopting the platform strategy, driven by the imperative for upskilling and reskilling through Generative AI.Ina emphasized the importance of fostering a value-centric model for employees, focusing on personalized and contextualized learning programs that foster mobility. Amidst experimentation with ChatGPT, the organizational landscape is defined not only by possibilities but also by limitations.Ina's discourse culminated with a powerful statement: ""The global market, currently valued at 8 billion, is projected to reach 126 billion within the next seven years."" She candidly acknowledged the ongoing ""experimentation phase,"" with distinct use cases for generative AI in the learning context continuing to unfold.Evolving Tech Landscape and Skill Dynamics&ldquo;Impacted is a polite way of saying jobs will get eliminated, jobs will change&rdquo;, as said by Raghav, casting a spell that tempts even the most ardent of human creators, to cede that pace with which the change is evident.Drawing attention to an evolving landscape where technology transcends departments, becoming intrinsic to businesses, Raghav cited instances like Microsoft and KPMG's staggering $12 billion alliance, exemplifying a tech-driven metamorphosis even in traditionally unassuming domains like auditing.He underscored a McKinsey report that expanded AI's reach into software, sales, marketing, content generation, research, development, and customer observation.Metrics for Tapping The Business OutcomeFurther, Bidisha delved into a comprehensive report on the metrics followed by the Welspun Group for enhancing the skills of the employees. She emphasized the concept of &ldquo;Skill benchmarking&rdquo; which offers skill tests, such as assessing proficiency in digital transformation. The second alternative that she shared focussed on the projects linked to the learning platform. While she mentioned: &ldquo;At the end of the year we have something like a shark tank where people are to come back with innovative ideas and process improvement, change improvements from the manufacturing floor and other sectors of the industry within our organization.&rdquo; Thirdly, she shared how the Welspun group has incorporated talent and succession outcomes, which help them to generate a knowledge-based outcome to measure competency throughout.Ina shed light on skills development's pivotal role within their organization, stating: ""We've mirrored that internally in terms of program effectiveness."" She highlighted employee progress toward career aspirations, showing a ""3 to 5% increase,"" facilitated by an AI-based ecosystem.Ina accentuated how companies like OpenAI and Google plan to invest trillions into distinct ChatGPT use cases, contextualizing content for global business. The focus on deep skilling was underscored, with learning outcomes directly tied to business impact. Holistic assessments encompassed learner experience, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and adaptive evaluations, ensuring meaningful growth aligned with organizational goals.Wrapping up the discussion, Raghav stressed that overcoming AI-induced challenges requires upskilling of thoughts and ideas. His optimistic note resonated: ""Skills pay the bills."" He concluded, ""Learn or become irrelevant,"" underlining the urgency of adapting to the shifting landscape.""","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/generative-ai-paves-the-way-for-personalized-and-interactive-learning-at-scale/102934073'}",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679564249-et-hr-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,contactus@ethrworld.com,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The newest tech fad is artificial intelligence (AI). And the face of the technology is ChatGPT which is a large language model that helps people brainstorm, write articles, translate text, conduct research, generate ideas, cheat on exams, or simply just have someone to talk to. With its ability to “speak” in simple, conversational language, ChatGPT is a glimpse of what AI technology is capable of.
AI can generally process certain types of information faster than humans.  Initially, the technology will assist humans with their work. But eventually, AI will slowly replace some of these workers altogether. These workers pay payroll taxes which fund Social Security, Medicare, and state programs. If these workers disappear, then the tax base declines and these safety net programs are in jeopardy. How can the government prepare for this?

For clarification, let’s compare the the tax treatment of human employees and machines. Both the employer and employee equally pay a portion of an employee’s payroll tax which is based on their income. Employers also pay similar employment taxes to the state to fund its unemployment and disability programs. Self-employed people similarly pay self-employment taxes on their income. For 2023, only the first $160,200 of wages or self-employment income is subject to Social Security tax every year.
Also, employers must generally file quarterly employment tax returns with the IRS and the state.
Conversely, if a business purchases equipment that uses AI technology, it is not subject to federal and state employment taxes and return filing requirements. This is because AI is not considered an employee. At least not yet. Instead, the business can opt to take a tax deduction for the full purchase through a Section 179 deduction. Or it can choose to deduct a portion of the cost over a number of years through depreciation. The cost of routine repairs is fully deductible. The cost of major equipment upgrades can be either fully deducted or depreciated.




Due to its nature, AI will not demand things like a living wage or remote work. Nor will it unionize, go on strike, or file employment-related lawsuits.
This is nothing new as businesses have in the part purchased equipment to automate certain tasks and make existing work more efficient. Computers and even smartphones have made computational work easier. But recently, AI has been able to perform creative tasks, such as write poems, essays, articles and even scripts. The use of AI is a point of contention in the 2023 Writers Strike. One demand is that AI can only be used as a tool to help research or facilitate script ideas and not to replace writers.
As AI technology improves, the role of humans in the labor force will change. Workers with skills in robotics or computer science will be in demand and are likely to be highly paid. So in the short run, there may not be a dramatic effect on payroll taxes as young people or those seeking a career change adapt. But older people and those who devoted a great deal of time in their current professions might be unable or unwilling to become robot repairmen.
Assuming that AI technology has advanced enough to threaten the solvency of Social Security, unless the system is fundamentally changed, taxes will have to increase. But who should have to pay the lost payroll taxes?
One option is to have the AI manufacturers pay through an excise or supplemental tax. But this would create three problems. First, it will be hard to determine what technology would be considered AI and thus subject to the tax. Will it need to have sentience or its own consciousness and can it give advice or make decisions? If AI is simply defined as a program that reduces or eliminates the need for human labor, then a lot of everyday items like a computer or a smartphone would be subject to this tax.

The other problem is that the excise tax will be passed on to customers. This assumes there is little to no competition and economic substitutes.
The final and most significant problem is that taxing AI technology could hinder or even destroy its development in the U.S. Experts in the field will move to other countries to continue their work. This could put the U.S. in an economic and even military disadvantage.
Another option is to tax businesses that use AI to replace workers. One way to do it is to reduce or disallow a business tax deduction for the purchase of AI technology (South Korea did this in 2018). Also, maintenance expenses paid can be subject to payroll taxes similar to how employees are paid. Like the manufacturers, businesses will try to pass on the tax to its customers through increased prices although, if the business has a large amount of competitors, it will have to pay the tax to stay price competitive.
The final option is to force taxpayers to pay more. This can be done by raising the age for eligibility to receive social security benefits or increase the payroll and self-employment tax rates. Obviously, people are not going to like having to pay more and wait longer for benefits. Many are living paycheck to paycheck. A forced tax increase could result in reduced spending on other areas. This can have negative collateral economic effects which can last years before the economy adapts.
While AI-driven job displacement could potentially impact social security funding by altering the composition of the workforce, the overall effect depends on a variety of complex factors. If only something was available to quickly digest all of this complex information into advice in a conversational format.

ISLAMABAD: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more likely to augment than destroy jobs by automating some tasks rather than taking over a role entirely, a new study released by International Lab­our Organization (ILO) says.
The study, “Generative AI and Jobs: A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality” released on Monday, suggests that most jobs and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by the latest wave of Generative AI, such as chat GPT.
“The greatest impact of this technology is likely to not be job destruction but rather the potential changes to the quality of jobs, notably work intensity and autonomy,” the study suggests.
Clerical work was found to be the category with the greatest technological exposure, with nearly a quarter of tasks considered highly exposed and more than half of tasks having medium-level exposure. In other occupational groups — including managers, professionals and technicians — only a small share of tasks was found to be highly exposed, while about a quarter had medium exposure levels.


Women’s vocations to be affected more by automation, new study says

The study, which is global in scope, documents notable differences in the effects on countries at different levels of development, linked to current economic structures and existing technological gaps. It finds that 5.5 per cent of total employment in high-income countries is potentially exposed to the automating effects of the technology, whereas in low-income countries, the risk of automation concerns only some 0.4pc of employment.
The potential for augmentation is nearly equal across countries, suggesting that with the right policies in place, this new wave of technological transformation could offer important benefits for developing countries.
The potential effects of Generative AI are likely to differ significantly for men and women, the study finds, with more than twice the share of female employment potentially affected by automation.
This is due to women’s over-representation in clerical work, especially in high and middle-income countries. Since clerical jobs have traditionally been an important source of female employment as countries develop economically, one result of Generative AI could be that certain clerical jobs may never emerge in lower-income countries.
The study concludes that the socio-economic impacts of Generative AI will largely depend on how its diffusion is managed. It argues for the need to design policies that support an orderly, fair and consultative transition.
Workers’ voice, skills training and adequate social protection will be key to managing the transition. Otherwise, there is a risk that only a few, countries will benefit from the new technology.

South African contact centre employees are worried generative artificial intelligenceARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEGetting started with generative AI?
Digicloud’s Google Cloud partners can guide your success! (AI) will take over their jobs, as the industry across the globe increasingly incorporates AI-powered agents into their processes.This is according to analysts, who say generative AI will disrupt the traditional business process outsourcing (BPO) industry by automating more and more tasks for agents, prompting employees to fear their duties may eventually be entirely replaced.However, the BPO industry says generative AI technologies will likely supplement their human agents and not necessarily replace them, as many customers still prefer human interactions, especially for sensitive or complex issues.Employers across the globe are anticipating millions of jobs across industries to be displaced by the growing adoption of emerging technologies in the workplace.Flux Trends researcher and trend-spotter Faeeza Khan explains: “Generative AI is sparking anxiety among call centre workers all around the world. “The Philippines employs roughly 1.6 million BPO workers and is one of the world’s largest centres for BPO. Political and business leaders there are in the process of formulating a plan to deal with AI replacing human jobs. See also Generative AI to augment rather than destroy jobsChatGPT forces SA varsities to rethink plagiarism policies“In March, Google demonstrated new generative AI capabilities for call centres and there are a multitude of customer service platforms to choose from.”Khan points out that while generative AI will play a critical role in SA’s BPO industry, it will enhance roles rather than replace them. This will be done by enabling efficiency through automation of repetitive tasks, improving agent productivity and in turn revolutionising the entire customer operations function.“The incorporation of generative AI in the customer service realm is becoming crucial in order for businesses not to be outcompeted. The benefits are clear. “However, businesses should not ignore the human cost and should make efforts to enable their workforce to perform higher-value work that’s still beyond the scope of AI. Upskilling programmes for BPO workers to gain the necessary expertise is recommended,” she adds.Faeeza Khan, head of research at Flux Trends. SA’s BPO sector has the potential to create 775 000 jobs by 2030, according to a report by consultancy firm McKinsey.A June 2023 McKinsey report reveals generative AI will automate 60% to 70% of employee workloads globally, with the customer centre industry being among the top sectors that will be augmented by the emerging tech.Laurent Leclercq, CTO of BPO solutions provider Merchants, says while generative AI will more likely add value than substitute workers in SA’s BPO industry, it does pose a certain level of threat.“The ongoing adoption of generative AI technologies can pose challenges to job creation in the South African BPO sector, specifically for roles that include routine tasks, are repetitive in nature and can be easily automated. “AI solutions can also be deployed to scale up or down easily, based on demand, without the need for recruitment, training or other overheads associated with hiring human agents. “Once trained appropriately, these systems tend to make fewer errors in repetitive tasks compared to humans. This efficiency can make them preferable for tasks where precision and consistency are crucial,” notes Leclercq.While generative AI can pose challenges to traditional job creation in the BPO sector, it will not necessarily mean the end of jobs in the industry, with many customers still preferring the “human touch”, he adds.According to Leclercq, Merchants approaches the use of generative AI technologies within its contact centres opportunistically and with specific focus on client-driven value requirements.“The emotional intelligence and understanding that humans offer cannot be fully replicated by AI. In essence, the digital economy has elevated the role of contact centre agents from mere problem-solvers to critical brand representatives, equipped with technology and empowered to offer an enhanced and integrated customer experience. “With the ever-increasing rise in cyber threats, human agents also have a key role to play in ensuring dataDATAData Sciences: Your Partner in Innovative IT Solutions.

The complex tasks often required of agents will always require human interaction. “While AI is extremely useful for simple automated tasks, human beings need emotional connection, especially when experiencing heightened emotions,” explains Singh.While CCI South Africa has not incorporated generative AI in its processes, the company plans to do so, he adds. The role of the contact centre agent has evolved significantly over the years, in the advent of the digital economy.“With improvements in technology, the contact centre landscape has evolved even further and is now what is called ‘omni-channel’.Furthermore, I believe the analytic power of AI will help us to better utilise macro-economic factors, and how they interact with human needs and experience to best make use of our local resources. “For the BPO industry, one of these key resources is the massive potential held by the unemployed youth. I believe that through this process, we will be able to further drive job creation using these analytics,” notesSingh.Mithum Singh, MD of CCI South Africa.

Snapchat Introduces “Dreams” with Generative AI: How Does it Work?By  

				Shodi Madian			



		 /  August 22, 2023 


Snapchat, the social media giant known for its quirky filters and unique features, is taking its plunge into the world of generative AI once again. The latest addition to Snapchat’s AI lineup is called “Dreams,” and it’s all about creating captivating images that go beyond the ordinary. In this article, we’ll be taking a deep dive into the ins and outs of Dreams, exploring how it works and functions.
Snapchat’s Generative AI “Dreams”
Earlier this year, Snapchat introduced us to “My AI,” a chatbot powered by generative AI technology. This chatbot was no ordinary text responder; it could send back Snaps, not just text. This feature allowed users to share glimpses of their activities and receive creatively generated snapshots in response, making conversations more dynamic and engaging.
Now, Snapchat is gearing up to take generative AI to the next level with its upcoming feature, “Dreams.”



This exciting revelation comes from the insights of app developer and researcher Steve Moser.
Unlike the previous AI chatbot, Dreams focuses on creating images that transport you and your friends into imaginative worlds.
Imagine being able to stand against the backdrop of a fantastical landscape or sharing a laugh with your friends in a scene straight out of your dreams; that’s what Dreams is all about.

The buzz around Dreams began in the early spring of 2023 when a reverse engineer named Alessandro Paluzzi uncovered this exciting feature. He revealed that Dreams would let users place their personal images into AI-generated worlds. Now, this remarkable feature has earned its spot within the Snapchat app, nestled between the camera studio and direct stories.
How does “Dreams” work?

Snapchat is working hard to make Dreams a reality. It’s developing features that allow users to either capture new images or upload personal ones.

Once you provide the image, Snapchat’s AI magic steps in.
It takes your picture and crafts a brand-new image that places you in scenarios you’ve only dreamed of.

Remember the app “Remini” that took the world by storm? It allowed users to turn their selfies into polished images suitable for professional platforms like LinkedIn without needing an expensive photoshoot.

Snapchat’s Dreams feature takes a similar approach but with a twist.
Instead of just enhancing your portrait, it transforms your selfie into an image that drops you into imaginative locations and scenarios.

Getting the perfect shot for Dreams

Snapchat’s AI needs a clear starting point to make the magic happen. That means providing clear images with distinct user features.

Blurry photos or ones with too many people won’t work well with Dreams.
Also, having a variety of poses, expressions, and lighting conditions in your pictures will help the AI create even more captivating images.

Sharing Dreams with friends
Additionally, Snapchat has something even cooler in store. Alongside individual Dreams, they’re also working on “Dreams with Friends.” This feature allows you to give your friends permission to join in on the AI-generated fun. Imagine creating shared images with a friend where both of you are immersed in some extraordinary scenario, all thanks to the power of AI.

Get ready to turn your selfies into fantastic dreams and share them with your friends in ways you’ve never imagined before. Welcome to the future of social media, where AI meets creativity in the most captivating way possible.

So what should the next generation of workers be trying to pursue?Hibaq Farah and Tom AmbroseTue 29 Aug 2023 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Aug 2023 09.21 EDTShareTeenagers deciding their future this year have a lot to contend with. In England, those who sat their A-levels suffered the biggest results drop on record while the top grades in GCSEs also fell. And now they face the question: will the career I choose to pursue even exist by the time I enter the workforce?Artificial intelligence has hit the mainstream with the popularity of generative AI programmes driven by large language models such as ChatGPT. Businesses are increasingly adopting the technology. A study, which was published last week by the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, suggests 57% of workers are using such tools to save time in the office, especially for summarising meeting notes and long documents.Yet the automation of such tasks also means the chance to eliminate or reduce certain roles, not just in administration, but across many fields as the technology becomes more sophisticated. According to a survey of professionals by Thomson Reuters published last week, 67% of respondents believe AI will have a great impact on their profession in the next five years, while more than half predict the technology will create new career paths.So exactly what are those new professional opportunities that the next generation of workers should be trying to pursue?‘It’s all being disrupted’“There is no such thing as a future-proof career anymore,” says Dr Andrew Rogoyski, the director of innovation and partnerships at the Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence at the University of Surrey.“AI and other forms of automation have been disrupting and changing careers for years now and generative AI is the latest technology encroaching on careers that we previously thought safe from technological advances – it’s all being disrupted by AI.”According to Rogoyski, subjects such as science, engineering and cyber-security will continue to be in demand, despite AI assistive technologies that may be used in the field. Similarly, careers in healthcare that involve human-to-human interaction: nursing, social care and medicine for example.“I would advise students to become AI literate, you don’t have to be coding AI software but you will probably be using AI tools in your future career so get a head start. Careers may always evolve, change and dissolve, my advice to students is to be flexible, imaginative and brave,” Rogoyski says.James Knightley, the chief international economist at the Dutch banking group ING, doubts “very much that any career will be untouched by AI”. He suggests one safe bet is to become a skilled artisan, for example learning high-end carpentry.‘Learning the machine’One area that looks in real trouble is the creative sector, with Rogoyski saying roles such copywriting and graphic design could be gradually outsourced to AI. The sector has struggled with the advancement of generative AI tools: from writers striking in Hollywood against such tools being used to produce scripts and story ideas, to film-makers using image generators in their work such as DALL-E 2.But Prof Sunil Manghani at Winchester School of Art is encouraging his students to get acquainted with the technology. He has started bringing AI into sessions with students, for example, in a project with Tate Britain: “One of the phrases we’ve found ourselves using is ‘learning the machine’,” Manghani says.AI can also make the industry more accessible, says Ed D’Souza, who is also a professor at Winchester. “It’s a challenge to education: do you need to go to an art or design school to enter into parts of the industry? The good thing is that AI and the potential of using this for people without those skills is that they can learn through the machine, they can enter the industry at different points.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People trained in using AI are therefore going to be at a significant advantage to those who are not.“We clearly have a skills shortage in many professions and the opportunity AI could open to have people from many different backgrounds enter the world of professional work without necessarily having to have the same qualifications.“If we can tap into it in the right way by investing in education and training, it really opens up the ecosystem. AI can be a great leveller.”Another area of opportunity is health. Owen Addison, a professor of oral rehabilitation at King’s College London, welcomes AI as a potential safety net for diagnosticians in the future.“I actually see AI as being likely to empower dentists to be better diagnosticians and to be able to provide preventative care and monitoring better with such support systems in place,” he says.“But the surgical part of the role will remain something that requires highly skilled personnel to do and it’s not something that’s going to be quickly removed.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Work & careersfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceRepublicans claim a ‘coup’ attempt to delegitimize Kamala Harris’s candidacy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for some time, but the launch of ChatGPT last November took it mainstream, sparking excitement and suspicion in equal measure. It reached 100 million users in just two months, becoming one of the fastest-growing internet services ever. However, ChatGPT’s ability to generate human-like text, answer questions, and more has left people asking, could it replace our jobs?


Throughout history, people have been skeptical of new technologies, with old ways often deemed best. There were concerns that the telephone would make people lazy and anti-social and that the television would negatively impact the radio (which faced similar criticism), replace reading and conversation, and destroy family life. The car, the elevator, the refrigerator – many things we take for granted today were rejected at first.

It’s natural to be wary of the unknown, but businesses shouldn’t let their distrust of AI stop them from exploring its potential. Experimenting with AI is the best way for leaders to face their fear while evaluating the technology’s capabilities and limitations. And there are plenty of both.

Automated Processes

Perhaps one of the most obvious business benefits of AI is the automation of repetitive, time-consuming processes.
Many of the tasks performed by businesses are a drain on people’s time. Take a typical HR department that finds itself answering the same, basic employee questions. By using a digital assistant, HR can concentrate on more business-critical tasks while employees can quickly find the information they need, boosting productivity. The same applies to sales and customer service. Rather than waiting to speak to a representative, AI lets customers access the information they need when they need it.

AI can reduce administrative time and optimize many other aspects of business operations by automating the human element.
Some businesses are already using AI to onboard new hires. AI helps by automating the delivery and receipt of the necessary paperwork, company policies, and login information – eliminating delays and creating a positive experience that helps set the tone for an employee’s tenure. Digital assistants can also guide new employees through their induction – proactively suggesting the next steps and recommending learning materials and background reading to get them quickly up to speed in their new role.

Faster, Better-Informed Decisions
AI’s ability to automate, augment and support business decision-making is also worthy of attention. The theory is that leaders can make quicker decisions involving complex data unclouded by cognitive biases, improving business operations and enhancing the customer experience.

For example, AI specialists Peak use “customer transaction data – taken from thousands upon thousands of purchases – to learn what products certain segments of customers are buying together. This model is then used to recommend complementary products on the website.” Amazon and Netflix use a similar approach to provide personalized recommendations.
The beauty of AI is that it analyzes vast quantities of data and spots patterns that might not be obvious to the human eye or brain. IT author Thomas Erl cites the example of a company that, through AI, identifies a weakness in its business operations. It found that after customers return products, they are less likely to buy again or will buy less from the company – highlighting the returns process as a vital area for improvement and competitive advantage. Similarly, a company might use AI to analyze job applicants and the candidate journey to identify trends, such as when people typically drop out and make improvements. Of course, it’s then up to leaders to decide what steps to take.
Supporting Content Creation
A more contentious but no less exciting application of AI is content creation. Can AI produce the nuanced copy of a skilled writer? Not yet, but it can streamline the creative process.
Jasper, for instance, is a marketing-focused version of Chat GPT that can generate various types of customer-facing content, from blogs, social media posts, and web copy to sales emails and advertising copy.
However, in Tiger Recruitment’s experience, AI-generated content has limitations and struggles to emulate a company’s voice and tone. AI will never know your company and industry as well as your marketing team and text can sound stilted, but it can help with research and ideas. Say you’re tasked with writing social media posts on a keyword or topic – AI can suggest ideas and even produce a first draft. It requires human input to insert prompts and carefully review any content produced. But it can create efficiencies, allowing marketers to focus on other tasks.
Complementary Not Replacement
It’s easy to get carried away with the possibilities of AI – this article barely scratches the surface. But it’s important to be aware of its limitations, many of which are because it’s an emerging technology and lacks human qualities such as empathy, critical thinking, and creativity. It can’t magically drive efficiencies or deliver insights – it needs access to quality data, and at this stage in its evolution, human oversight is required.
There are data privacy and integrity issues too. As Devon Lovell, People Partner and HR Consultant at Fitzgerald HR points out in a podcast on AI in HR, what you put into ChatGPT is no longer yours – even if you delete it, it’s still there, which raises important questions about confidentiality.
The accuracy and authenticity of AI is another concern, with Lovell adding, “It’s not a human being and there can be biases in Chat – based on who uses it. You could get a biased opinion on something without even realizing it.”
When it comes to AI, there are still issues to be ironed out, but as the debate intensifies and the technology advances, business leaders will need to consider if and how AI has a place in their organization. As with most innovations, the challenge will be to weigh up the risks of adopting the technology against the risk of rejecting it and falling behind.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds much promise for the Republic of Korea. The Korean government developed its National Strategy for AI in 2019, building on the National AI R&D Strategy and Data Industry Vitalization Strategy, to revitalize Korean economy, transform Korean society and close the gap with global AI leaders. In 2022, the current administration announced 12 areas of National Core Technology, one of which is AI, and recognized the strategic importance of advancing AI to harness its scientific, diplomatic, and economic potential. As one of the most AI-ready countries in APAC, South Korea is creating a data dam to bolster its data ecosystem and make public data accessible to businesses and individuals to enhance AI innovation. To further strengthen the AI policy landscape, the Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee of Korean National Assembly passed a proposed legislation (currently making its way through the parliament) to enact the AI Act which sets out the key principles for safe and responsible development of AI with the aim of improving the lives of Koreans.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD 476.3 billion of productive capacity in South Korea, equivalent to a quarter of GDP in 2022. South Korea has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

Learn why human oversight is so important to this technology.,,,,"  Artificial IntelligenceGenerative AI in legal tech: Balancing innovation with human oversight August 28, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  August 28, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Generative AI is a powerful tool for legal professionals - one that requires human oversight.It’s nearly inescapable. The transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere. From the curated programs Netflix suggests for you, to your smart refrigerator telling you when to buy more milk, to the online ads for things you didn’t even know you wanted, AI has become ubiquitous in our lives.  The same applies to the legal profession. Artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, is all the buzz in the blogs, conferences, meeting rooms, and water-cooler conversations of legal professionals. It comes filled with possibilities – and reservations. Both expectations hinge on human oversight. Jump to ↓   Understanding AI  The good, the bad, and the technical  Human oversight  Will you make generative AI standard practice? Understanding AI By its simplest definition, AI is technology that allows a computer to operate in a “human” way. It takes in data from its training and its surroundings and returns information based on what it learns or senses. Many terms contribute to the lexicon of AI, but generative AI creates the most noise. Generative AI is a type of machine learning that creates drafts of content like documents, images, songs, and art in response to prompts from the user. These tools comb through large volumes of content to create “the best” response to the prompt. Rather than extracting data, as AI can do in things like contract management software, it generates data, like drafting a brief. ChatGPT is one of the best-known types of generative AI.  The good, the bad, and the technical A recent survey of law firm professionals concluded that a large majority of those surveyed (82%) believe that GenAI can be readily applied to legal work. However, a slight majority (51%) felt that generative AI should be applied to legal work. That dichotomy suggests some hesitation in using generative AI in legal technology for the high-stakes work of lawyers. Here are the factors to consider: HallucinationsNo, you’re not seeing things. But your chatbot might be generating them. Hallucinations are when generative AI creates false information. In a 2023 example, a US personal injury attorney used a chatbox to help prepare a court filing that contained six made-up cases. When his opponent and the judge discovered his error, the mortified attorney apologized that he didn’t know a chatbox could falsify information. Generative hallucinations can appear credible because AI is designed to create coherent text. BiasBias is a human function and since humans train the algorithms that AI uses, those biases can be passed along. Without proper protocols in training, including diversity in the training team, unconscious bias can be baked into machine learning models. TransparencyYou don’t have to know how to cook a fancy French recipe to appreciate its deliciousness. And you don’t have to know how AI works to utilize its benefits. But you should know why an algorithm has arrived at the decision it provides. Transparency means the AI vendor you choose should be able to explain how their system works, what it is capable of, and where the data comes from.   Special ReportRead more about evolving attitudes of generative AI in the legal industry.Access the full report Human oversight Human expertise is the silver bullet of artificial intelligence. Despite what science fiction tells us, machines are machines, and they don’t operate unless programmed and instructed by humans. Human expertise is critical on both sides of the AI equation: user and vendor. User expertiseA continuing concern for legal professionals is that AI will replace lawyers. Not so. In the definition above, “generative AI creates drafts of content,” the emphasis should be placed on drafts. Regardless of what AI generates, it needs human eyes on it to ensure that what has been created is accurate and pertinent to the prompt. In the same way an attorney would oversee the work of an entry-level employee, monitoring and managing AI is a good business practice. This oversight plays a crucial role in minimizing risks, maintaining control, and harnessing the benefits of AI in a responsible manner. Vendor expertiseIt all comes down to trust. The personal injury lawyer trusted ChatGPT to create court documents for his case, and it failed him miserably. For an industry-specific AI platform, industry-specific expertise is important to establish trust. In the legal world, few organizations compare to the industry expertise of Thomson Reuters. With more than 500 bar-admitted attorney-editors, and a team of cutting-edge data scientists, Thomson Reuters brings human intelligence into its artificial intelligence solutions. When training generative AI legal technology, a specific data set beats a broad data set. You don’t want data from Wikipedia, Twitter, or even Google; you want accurate, targeted information that’s been curated by professionals. Thomson Reuters brings that, in addition to proprietary content from products like Westlaw Precision and Practical Law.  Will you make generative AI standard practice?The coming of generative AI in legal technology is a given. But when legal professionals decide to make it a standard practice remains a question. The efficiencies it brings by creating drafts need to be quantified with regard to the time it takes to review and monitor the results. By replacing time spent on monotonous tasks with ones utilizing legal expertise, organizations of all sizes will see an increase in profits and employee satisfaction.  Charting the Course for the Future of Generative AISee what Thomson Reuters President and CEO Steve Hasker has to say on the buzz of generative AI.Read blog post   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceTechnology",http://schema.org,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative artificial intelligence, including large language models such as ChatGPT and image-generation software such as Stable Diffusion, are powerful new tools for individuals and businesses. They also raise profound and novel questions about how data is used in AI models and how the law applies to the output of those models, such as a paragraph of text or a computer-generated image.

“We’re witnessing the birth of a really great new technology,” said Regina Sam Penti, SB ’02, MEng ’03, a law partner at Ropes & Gray who specializes in technology and intellectual property. “It’s an exciting time, but it’s a bit of a legal minefield out there right now.”
At this year’s EmTech Digital conference, sponsored by MIT Technology Review, Penti discussed what users and businesses should know about the legal issues surrounding generative AI, including several pending U.S. court cases and how companies should think about protecting themselves.  
AI lawsuits
Most lawsuits about generative AI center on data use, Penti said, “which is not surprising, given these systems consume huge, huge amounts of data from all corners of the world.”
One lawsuit brought by several coders against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI is centered on GitHub Copilot, which converts commands written in plain English into computer code in dozens of different coding languages. Copilot was trained and developed on billions of lines of open-source code that had already been written, leading to questions of attribution.  
“For people who operate in the open-source community, it’s pretty easy to take open-source software and make sure you keep the attribution, which is a requirement for being able to use the software,” Penti said. An AI model like the one underpinning Copilot, however, “doesn’t realize that there are all these requirements to comply with.” The ongoing suit alleges that the companies breached software licensing terms, among other things.
In another instance, several visual artists filed a class-action lawsuit against the companies that created the image generators Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DreamUp, all of which generate images based on text prompts from users. The case alleges that the AI tools violate copyrights by scraping images from the internet to train the AI models. In a separate lawsuit, Getty Images alleges that Stable Diffusion’s use of its to train models infringes on copyrights. All of the images generated by Stable Diffusion are derivative works, the suit alleges, and some of those images even contain a vestige of the Getty watermark.


Just because something is out there for free doesn’t mean it’s free of rights.

There are also “way too many cases to count” centered on privacy concerns, Penti said. AI models trained on internal data could even violate companies’ own privacy policies. There are also more niche scenarios, like a case in which a mayor in Australia considered filing a defamation lawsuit against ChatGPT after it falsely claimed that he had spent time in prison.
While it’s not clear how legal threats will affect the development of generative AI, they could force creators of AI systems to think more carefully about what data sets they train their models on. More likely, legal issues could slow down adoption of the technology as companies assess the risks, Penti said. 
Fitting old frameworks to new challenges
In the U.S., the two main legal systems for regulating the type of work generated by AI are copyrights and patents. Neither is easy to apply, Penti said.
Applying copyright law involves determining who actually came up with an idea for, say, a piece of visual art. The U.S. Copyright Office recently said that work can be copyrighted in cases where AI assisted with the creation; works wholly created by AI would not be protectable.  
The patent office, which offers a stronger form of protection for intellectual property, remains vague on how patent law will apply to the outputs of AI systems. “Our statutory patent system is really created to protect physical gizmos,” Penti said, which makes it ill-equipped to deal with software. Decade by decade, the office has reconsidered what is and is not patentable. At present, AI is raising critical questions about who “invented” something and whether it can be patented.
“In the U.S., in order to be an inventor, at least based on current rules, you have to be a human, and you have to be the person who conceived the invention,” Penti said. In the case of drug development, for example, a pharmaceutical company could use AI to comb through millions of molecular prospects and winnow them down to 200 candidates and then have scientists refine that pool to the two best possibilities.
“According to the patent office, or according to U.S. invention laws, the inventor is the one that actually conceived those molecules, which is the AI system,” Penti said. “In the U.S., you cannot patent a system that’s created using artificial intelligence. So you have this amazing way to really significantly cut down the amount of time it takes to get from candidate to drug, and yet we don’t have a good system for protecting it.”
Given how immature these regulatory frameworks remain, “contracts are your best friend,” Penti said. Data is often seen as a source of privacy or security risk, she added, so data isn’t protected as an asset. To make up for this, parties can use contracts to agree on who has the right to different intellectual property.  
But “in terms of actual framework-based statutory support, the U.S. has a long way to go,” Penti said.
What a murky legal landscape means for companies
The legal issues accompanying generative AI have several implications for companies that develop AI programs and those that use it, Penti said.

Study: Generative AI helps inexperienced workers  


Developers might need to get smarter and more creative about where they get training data for AI models, Penti said, which will also help them avoid delays caused by a lack of clarity around what’s permissible.
Companies beginning to integrate AI into their operations have several options to reduce legal risk. First, companies should be active in their due diligence, taking actions such as monitoring AI systems and getting adequate assurances from service and data providers. Contracts with service and data providers should include indemnification — a mechanism for ensuring that if a company uses a product or technology in accordance with an agreement, that company is protected from legal liability.
“Ultimately, though, I think the best risk-mitigation strategy is proper training of employees who are creating these systems for you,” Penti said. “You should ensure they understand, for instance, that just because something is out there for free doesn’t mean it’s free of rights.”

Here's How to Prepare - Bloomberg Law,2023-08-28,Bloomberg Law,https://news.bloomberglaw.com,"PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare.",,"PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare.","PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare.",,,"PwC’s Anthony Abbatiello looks at how artificial intelligence will change the workplace, what will stay the same, and what companies can do to prepare. Generative artificial intelligence has more potential to change the workforce than almost any technological innovation since the internet began. And it’s being used to change how businesses can efficiently and effectively get work done.What’s more, employees are excited to use it. PwC’s 2023 Global Hopes & Fears Survey shows that 52% of respondents have identified at least one way generative AI will positively impact their work. Savvy businesses are implementing generative AI in a variety of ways in their workforce. Transforming work and automating routine, non-value-added tasks can free workers to pursue a human-led, tech-powered approach to business objectives.What’s ChangingGenerative AI tools can improve the employee experience, for example, by transforming systems used for changing 401(k) and benefits-related programs. Instead of navigating a maze of confusing menus, employees can ask for exactly what they want, and those programs can successfully execute their requests.Generative AI also has the ability to help employees focus on strategic rather than repetitive tasks. Content creation, project management, information analysis, and more time-intensive tasks can be rerouted through generative AI tools, freeing up employees to focus on upskilling, increasing impact, and more efficiently handling their workload.Of course, generative AI is by no means infallible; it can produce incorrect results. It can also be subject to biases, especially current large language models that can be influenced by the biases of the content they were trained on.There are techniques and governance we can use to help mitigate these risks for businesses using generative AI. We assert that generative AI is used to help people, and that people are ultimately accountable for the quality of work and decisions.Human ingenuity and critical thinking should be used to confirm the quality of generative AI conclusions. With the technology still in its infancy, particularly as a business tool, human oversight is necessary for thoughtful implementation.What’s Not ChangingGenerative AI is supplementing and aiding various jobs and freeing workers from time-consuming, repetitive tasks. First, many companies are planning strategic implementation of generative AI and large language models to proactively address privacy challenges and better prepare their workforce.Second, generative AI can effectively be used as an augmentation tool. It can digest large amounts of data and provide summaries but ultimately is intended to help people to perform analysis and recommend decisions. It doesn’t replace the accountability people have on outcomes and decisions.Further, generative AI is already creating new jobs, including prompt engineer, a person skilled at optimizing generative AI task requests. In the coming years we will see many more jobs designed around using, managing, and transforming generative AI in responsible ways.Like many new technologies, its potential effects can cause fear. However, as familiarity with generative AI grows, and it becomes a regular part of life, people will see the benefits in their lives and work.How to PrepareGenerative AI will soon be a fixture of many industries and to enable implementation that’s not only effective but can improve the workplace, companies must prepare now.First, businesses can establish a generative AI governance team. This group would be tasked with understanding how generative AI will affect their business and industry as a whole, looking into both intended and unintended consequences. They can also establish generative AI policies.Similar to HR policy, a guide on responsible generative AI use can set expectations and limits on the use of the technology in the workplace, giving employees confidence in how generative AI can be implemented.Once a policy is in place, generative AI can be adapted to help deliver business outcomes. Companies should manage and prioritize where they focus on generative AI solutions based on business goals and to confirm necessary regulations are followed. This is where human oversight and understanding is key.To pave the way for effective deployment, industry leaders are upskilling their employees on the transformative power of responsible AI usage, so they understand the tools and in-demand skills needed to leverage this technology now and as it evolves for the future. The goal is to augment the workforce and elevate their work, automating tasks and providing data and insights. Upskilling modules will include a diverse range of learning modalities and gamification strategies to enhance engagement and adoption.The deployment of generative AI isn’t the end of the road. Like any tool, it will improve as the underlying technology evolves. With careful and considerate implementation, this paradigm-shifting tool will benefit businesses and employees alike.This article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.Author InformationAnthony Abbatiello leads PwC’s workforce transformation business, delivering HR transformation, talent strategy, change management, organizational development, and rewards services to CEOs and CHROs across sectors and functions.Write for Us: Author Guidelines Continue Reading  Learn more about Bloomberg Law or Log In to keep reading:  Learn About Bloomberg Law  AI-powered legal analytics, workflow tools and premium legal & business news.

These tools can rapidly process and synthesize information and generate new content. The jobs most exposed to automation now are office jobs, those that require more cognitive skills, creativity and high levels of education. The workers affected are likelier to be highly paid, and slightly likelier to be women, a variety of research has found.College-Educated Workers Are Most Exposed to A.I.Researchers at OpenAI estimated the share of tasks in each occupation that could be assisted by A.I. tools.





The median percentage of tasks that could be done by A.I. in jobs that require a high school diploma or less is 10 percent. It's 18 percent for those requiring a high school diploma; 38 percent for a two-year or vocational degree; 70 percent for a four-year degree; and 64 percent for a graduate degree.

Students, faculty and administration are all concerned about the role of artificial intelligence in education and its implications for the future. (Illustration by Emily Faith Morgan, University Communications)




























Generative artificial intelligence has the power to shape the world we all live in, so learning how to harness and deploy that power should be part of a University of Virginia education, a new faculty report says.
Just don’t use ChatGPT to write your papers for you.
AI and its implications have been on the minds of UVA faculty for a while, especially after OpenAI released ChatGPT, a computer program that mimics human writing, in November. Last spring, a seven-member AI task force, which included an Honor Committee representative, brought together more than 300 faculty members for cross-Grounds discussions and collected survey responses from 504 students and 181 faculty members, and gathered input from other universities.
The task force, which completed its report this summer, looked into how the emergence of this new technology may affect what and how students learn and how it is assessed. It found that faculty want students to develop artificial intelligence literacy – but with faculty guidance to use AI properly to learn core material more effectively and efficiently.
“AI can serve as a powerful and effective tutor,” the report stated.
There is, however, a “but.” While artificial intelligence can provide students with information, task force members think it could also disrupt important elements of the learning experience by reducing the opportunities for students to turn to professors for help and guidance with a subject. The report marks two sides of the artificial intelligence coin, providing opportunity to learn more while posing the threat of learning less.

“On the upside, high-quality, individualized tutoring has the capability to increase student learning in many subjects,” the report said. “On the downside, AI can function as an undetectable and endlessly customizable paper mill, undermining learning across Grounds.”
The task force advises faculty members to be precise in their expectations regarding artificial intelligence use in their courses.
“Students need clear guidelines for how and when generative AI can be used,” the report advised. “In the spring 2023 semester, 77% of student survey respondents reported that their instructors did not make their AI policies clear to them. In designing learning experiences, instructors must be transparent about how and why AI may, should, or may not be used in the course and in specific assignments.”
Once students achieve a better understanding of artificial intelligence, faculty may delve deeper into course content or expand course goals. Faculty members may also need to reassess what writing skills they want students to develop.
“Generative AI can short-circuit learning: students can outsource the work of research, analysis, and writing to these tools,” the report said. “Yet if we help students write with AI in deliberate, meaningful ways, these tools can become powerful writing partners for students and can augment their learning. AI can aid writers in generating new ideas, providing samples and models to follow, offering generalized feedback, helping writers get unstuck and assisting in the editing process.”
The task force report said faculty members may change their assessment process to thwart artificial intelligence, including in-class, pen-and-paper examinations and reducing take-home work. At the same time, task force members caution faculty against using tools that promise to detect AI because they generally prove unreliable.
The provost’s office, through its Q&A pages, discourages faculty from using AI for grading, to safeguard students’ work.

“Students’ original work is, in most cases, their intellectual property, and thus instructors may not enter a student’s original work into an AI tool that will add that work to the tool’s data set,” the answer read. “AI tools are not effective for grading most kinds of assignments, including writing assignments. However, some AI tools can help to ease the grading process, for example by organizing the work and facilitating the use of rubrics.”
The provost’s office also advises students against entering sensitive, personal or proprietary information into an AI program because the programs use new information to help evolve.
While the report stressed the need to adjust to AI, it said there are many obstacles to harnessing it effectively, including limited AI literacy. AI is still rapidly evolving and some faculty are not prepared to reassess their teaching goals and methods, while others only see the downside of artificial intelligence.
The provost’s office encourages faculty members to become familiar with AI applications, because their students already are. But the office also cautions students that using AI to complete assignments may violate the University’s Honor Code.
The task force composed a series of recommendations, including a ""Teaching in a Generative AI World” website, launching an AI-centered assignment design workshop, launching a series of AI workshops in the fall, developing AI expertise at the Center for Teaching Excellence, and offering programs for graduate students and others with instructional responsibility.
Other recommendations include recruiting faculty to launch AI-learning conversations within their departments, funding AI-related grants, developing field-specific AI learning techniques for the central website, and considering a teaching and learning conference.
“This technology is increasingly shaping research, communication and the world of work, and its role in higher education will continue to evolve,” wrote Brie Gertler, vice provost for academic affairs, in a letter to faculty members.
“The Task Force Report provides a fascinating and thoughtful picture of how this technology is already affecting teaching and learning in higher education, and notes that faculty who shared their views with the task force expressed nearly unanimous support for ensuring that students develop AI literacy,” Gertler wrote.

Enterprises are expected to require increased understanding and oversight of generative AI tools among software engineering leaders in the coming years, according to research from Gartner. By 2025, the consultancy predicts that “more than half” of all software engineering leader role descriptions will include explicit requirements for oversight of generative AI as firms increase their use of the burgeoning technology. Gartner said the study highlights both the increased adoption of tools among enterprises as well as the evolving requirements of senior practitioners in effectively harnessing generative AI to deliver value. Haritha Khandabattu, senior director analyst at Gartner, noted that the emergence of generative AI will have a profound effect on future managerial role requirements. LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITPro“Outside of generative AI’s impact on technology implementation, it also changes the managerial responsibilities of software engineering leaders,” he said. In the long term, the consultancy said firms will expect software engineering leaders to consider a range of variables when deploying and effectively harnessing generative AI. This includes more finely curated team management based on relevant skills, as well as an innate understanding of the ethical considerations of using generative AI tools. Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Like any disruptive technology, we need to pause and think instead about how AI, when leveraged and managed in the right ways, has the potential to change our relationship with what we do and how we do it.When it comes to learning and development (L&D) opportunities, that means understanding how this technology can bring value.Have you read?AI: 3 ways artificial intelligence is changing the future of workThe tasks AI should take over, according to workersNot only can it help advance how we learn, but it can expand the scope and access to L&D experiences to nurture the broadest possible pipeline of diverse and future-ready leaders.Changing how people learnThe pandemic rush to cross-train, retrain or uplevel employee skills may have subsided, but the volatility of the past few years has only underscored the need for continuous professional development. Employees now cite a company’s L&D investment as a significant factor in their willingness to stay or sign on with a new employer. In turn, 80% of employers do not plan to reduce their L&D budgets in 2023, contributing to a $395 billion global investment in employee development. The resulting demand may pose capacity challenges, whether an organization is looking to stand up its own L&D function or partner with an external provider. Enter AI, which has already shown to be a useful L&D tool in providing:● Personalized and engaging learning experiences● Pre-training assessment and predictive analytics that can adjust to maximize a learner’s potential● Content creation that frees up L&D professionals to focus on programme strategies● Ability to scale to meet demand – whenever, however, and for whatever number of learnersHistorically, there has been both a perceived and real trade-off between the quality and scalability of learning (one-to-one tutors deliver more value to students than 50-person classrooms). When leveraged well, AI holds the potential to break this cost/quality compromise by allowing high-quality learning to, for the first time, be hyper-personalized at scale.For example, AI will be able to pair content from outside providers with a company’s own content to create a truly customized learning journey aligned to both the leaders’ and the company’s objectives. Additionally, through AI, companies can integrate their leadership development solutions with communications channels – such as email, messaging apps and video conferencing platforms – to receive learning recommendations and/or in-the-moment coaching based on projects in progress, conversation topics, virtual presentations, and more.Without the limitations of human, financial or time resourcing, generative AI has the potential to further the reach of high-impact, high-quality learning experiences so they’re available for broader and more diverse audiences.AI democratizes learning and developmentWhen it comes to diversity, AI has had its challenges. Like most technology, it’s based on data and rules that are provided by humans – and their inherent biases. That might make it easier to dismiss the technology out of hand, particularly with its exponential potential to proliferate those biases. But they’re already present in existing online and offline learning experiences. So why not use the power of AI to help course-correct and mitigate inequities?OpenAI recently announced a grant programme to encourage discussion and democratic governance of AI behaviour. This goes beyond the due diligence any company should conduct to understand the current technology – where the data comes from, how it’s curated, the training and rules infrastructure, and how it aligns with the company’s values and approach to employee development. This grant programme is presumably looking toward the future role of AI in our lives and its impact on society.But the technology is not the only operational behaviour that needs scrutiny. In businesses, development opportunities are typically limited to those who are identified as having high potential as leaders. Yet that identification may have more regard for proximity to current leaders than the actual performance of those outside an inner circle. That’s where the true power lies in using AI to promote leadership diversity. Generative AI with a natural language interface is much more engaging and accessible than any version of AI we have had before. That makes it easier to use to expand scope and nurture potential leaders at all levels by promoting development equity – equitable access for underrepresented groups to formalized, career-enhancing development opportunities – for maximum impact.Measuring real-world impact of L&DL&D is often viewed as nebulous and difficult to measure. I’ve seen a lot of companies lower their expectations about what can be shared to justify development efforts, even though they have the data – they’re just missing a framework. Measuring L&D impact comes down to defining its relationship to business objectives. In my experience, investing in development helps drive measurable impact in the following areas and AI can be a critical enabler of these outcomes:● Retention: encouraging leaders to stay by helping them feel better supported and secure in their skillset. AI can contribute by providing on-demand, always-on availability for leader development.● Productivity: improving engagement to motivate leaders to go above and beyond for their organizations. AI can contribute indirectly by increasing efficiency for L&D professionals and enabling programme innovations, and directly by offering interactive experiences for learners. ● Goal achievement: equipping leaders with the skills they need to better achieve organizational goals. AI can contribute to curriculum content and scaling efforts, and build upon pre-development assessments with objective, post-development evaluations.Operating within a framework ensures a company is capturing data that is useful over time. Because we know that business priorities will shift or even pivot in the face of accelerating change.DiscoverWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about diversity, equity and inclusion? Show moreThe COVID-19 pandemic and recent social and political unrest have created a profound sense of urgency for companies to actively work to tackle inequity.The Forum's work on Diversity, Equality, Inclusion and Social Justice is driven by the New Economy and Society Platform, which is focused on building prosperous, inclusive and just economies and societies. In addition to its work on economic growth, revival and transformation, work, wages and job creation, and education, skills and learning, the Platform takes an integrated and holistic approach to diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice, and aims to tackle exclusion, bias and discrimination related to race, gender, ability, sexual orientation and all other forms of human diversity. The Platform produces data, standards and insights, such as the Global Gender Gap Report and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 4.0 Toolkit, and drives or supports action initiatives, such as Partnering for Racial Justice in Business, The Valuable 500 – Closing the Disability Inclusion Gap, Hardwiring Gender Parity in the Future of Work, Closing the Gender Gap Country Accelerators, the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality, the Community of Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officers and the Global Future Council on Equity and Social Justice. Three years ago, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, companies made commitments to diversity and inclusion that they are still struggling to realize. They may have the intention. Or the data. Or now the technology. But it takes all these working in concert to move the needle on leadership diversity. It also takes a shift in perspective. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging should be integral, not additive, to corporate goals. Each decision point for a company is an opportunity to build equity and inclusivity into the process. That includes the use of AI to meet new expectations for agility and lifelong learning for everyone. Leveraging AI technology responsibly in parallel with equitable internal processes and infrastructure is what will support sustainable leadership diversity in the future of work.

I love the analogy of ChatGPT that Hubspot CTO Dharmesh Shah shared at the start of the year:
“Netscape was to the Internet what ChatGPT is to Artificial Intelligence.
“The Internet existed before Netscape. But the browser helped millions of mere mortals connect the dots on what could be done, and dream of what could be.”
As this breakout year for generative AI unfolded, that analogy has largely come true.  Unlike some technology breakthroughs that find adoption in organizational siloes or bubble up from the bottom, generative AI has been widely accessible from the start.  Across seniority levels, functions, and industries, the mainstream are using gen AI for work and play.
McKinsey recently shared a study that 79% of respondents say they’ve had some exposure to gen AI and 22% are regularly using it in their own work.  One-third say their organizations are already regularly using generative AI in at least one function.  Three-quarters expect gen AI to cause “significant or disruptive change in the nature of their industry’s competition” in the next three years.
Salesforce reported that 67% of IT leaders are prioritizing generative AI for business in the next 18 months, with one-third naming it a top priority.
And yet, incorporating gen AI into business isn’t just another software implementation.  It’s not plug-and-play.  There are a lot of implications and risks, some known and many unknown.
Even as organizations rush head-first into gen AI, there still aren’t a lot of guardrails.  McKinsey found that just 21% of organizations already using gen AI have any established policies.  Only 32% are mitigating for risks of inaccuracy and only 25% for risks of IP infringement.
This early hype and experimentation stage with generative AI will eventually mature.  
I like this insight from Eric Vandevelde, the AI practice chair at Gibson Dunn:
“It was foreign for boards 15 years ago to think about privacy and have chief privacy officers at the design level of products and services. The same thing is going to happen with AI.”
Here are a few related cartoons I’ve drawn over the years:

Artificial Intelligence: Imitation of Art or Creative Supertool?
The rise of generative A.I. demands urgent reflections on what it means not only to make art but also to make money making art.

			By Josh Tyson • 08/30/23 2:05pm 



















































 


Whether we realize it or not, a great many writers have been using A.I. daily for decades. Spell check, after all, was born in 1971 at Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It became a common tool in Word sometime in the early aughts, and I remember having a sense then that using it was somehow cheating. I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, but at some point, it started feeling lazy not to use spell check. Besides, the artistry isn’t in the ability to spell words correctly but the ability to synthesize experiences into words people can relate to.

In the wake of powerful new expressions of A.I., like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and a slew of other generative models, the line between the artist and the tool is starting to blur. The implications are massive, both in terms of how people leverage creativity to make a living and in how we decide to define art.
When it comes to our notion of work, the new maxim on the streets bears sober consideration: A.I. isn’t coming for your job; someone using A.I. is coming for your job. A graphic designer leveraging tools like text to image, sketch to image, generative fill and text effects from Firefly, Adobe (ADBE)’s beta collection of generative models, is likely to outpace the designer who isn’t using them.
It’s rather exciting in the near term, but it raises questions about what could happen when these tools outpace the graphic designer using them. Is that a bad thing? The answer probably depends on your view of capitalism or how intertwined your work is with your identity. I see the glimmer of a possibility that by automating the tedium that fills so much of our lives, A.I. might help us break free from the productivity mindset that requires using quantity as a metric of accomplishment instead of quality.
In this moment, however, the sheer power of these nascent tools prompts another question: Will models this powerful and ubiquitous initiate the ruinous decimation of human creation? An artistic armageddon?
I turned to Scott Bourne for an answer. An author, publisher, former pro skateboarder and American expat living in Paris, Scott was a fellow contributor to SLAP skateboarding magazine back in the early days of spell check, but his writing always carried the extra weight of having been punched out on a typewriter. There was no autocorrect in Scott’s world, and to this day he carries no pocket computer, sending much of his correspondence out the old-fashioned way, in envelopes, sometimes sealed with discs of melted wax.
When I asked Scott if he’d be interested in collaborating with Bournebot, a personal large language model (LLM) trained on all of his output—decades worth of poems, stories, interviews and emails—the answer came quickly: “Not in the slightest.”
“What most interests me in this time of technology is touch: human touch and staying human,” he said. “I think it is understood that time is what makes things great. The longer it takes to create something, the better it is, whether it be wine, whisky or a work of art. Haste makes waste, and I think we are wasting a lot of time on speed. Write, rewrite, write again and again and again. Then revise and write it once more.”
What was interesting about his reply was that it echoes an approach to A.I. that I’ve been exploring for the past few years. If technology is going to become more powerful and intertwined with our lives, I’d prefer an outcome that puts a premium on humans’ creativity and problem-solving skills—one where our eyeballs aren’t tethered to glowing screens. Maybe if we’re having conversations with technology instead of staring at it, A.I. can become an invisible ally. Maybe machines can give us the gift of time. Maybe we’ll spend that time having meaningful interactions with other people. Maybe we’ll use it in artistic endeavors: to write and rewrite. Or will it be so easy to point A.I. to the task of writing out our ideas that we won’t bother to take the time?
“No A.I. is ever going to have an experience, so it could never write my poems,” Bourne said. “No A.I. is ever going to feel love or pain or any of the emotions that have created Scott Bourne. I am not just blood and guts; there’s a hard road in there, some hitchhike and fist fight, a little jail time and freight ride. A.I. could only imitate, and all my life I have been avoiding imitations. I think it’s kind of ironic that people now prefer an imitation to the real thing.”
His argument made me think of Oscar Wilde’s assertion that “life imitates art far more than art imitates life.” As I’ve come to understand it, he means that what we experience as life is just what art has taught us exists. I also spoke with New York Times bestselling author and business leadership coach Charlene Li, who loved the idea of having her own LLM (and was actually in the exploratory stages of crafting one).
“It’s not just another me, it’s a better me,” she said of this potential ally. “Seventy percent of what I do, I can now do with GPT. I can do more of the 30 percent that’s unique to me and keep working with the technology to keep adding on to that, and I can do other things—higher-order, more value-added things.”
So, there’s no one answer, just fronds of perception dangling overhead. The task at hand is to wrap your head around generative A.I. and then decide how you want to incorporate it into—or attempt to eliminate it from—your life.
Generative A.I. has kicked over the barrier of technical training as a means to create art. People who feel compelled to explore artistic expression but who don’t have the natural talent or hard-earned skills are now in a position to share their visions. Generative A.I. has the power to raise marginalized voices and engender widespread empathy. But is it bad for people who have trained extensively as artists? That seems likely in scenarios where technology directly threatens livelihoods or intellectual property, and there are already artists litigating around these points.
Perhaps the root problem is that making money as an artist has always been hard as hell. Most of the artists I know have a stable of side-gigs that let them make both art and a living. The lucky ones are able to combine their artistic abilities with something marketable, like graphic design or cosmetology. Getting paid to write short stories, record reviews and band interviews for SLAP felt like a huge break twenty years ago. It was one of many freelance writing gigs I maintained, and I still needed to work odd jobs on the side. From my experience, it’s only gotten harder to find paid work as a writer.
Right now, I feel like I can outperform LLMs. As a trained writer, I don’t have a lot of use for ChatGPT. My favorite thing to do with generative A.I. so far has been feeding Stable Diffusion 2 odd prompts in hopes of getting unsettling results (“Alf eating pasta” continues to deliver).
Rebecca Evanhoe, co-author of a popular book in experience design circles, Conversations With Things: UX Design for Chat and Voice, shared a similar viewpoint on large language models: “I think it’s going to be real hard to get that pen out of my hand. Writing is so essential to my thought process, I can’t really tell you what I think [about something] until I’ve written about it… If I can’t write, I’m not even doing the thinking… But I am a person who has a gift in writing, and I have a lot of training in writing. Writing is very painful for lots of people.”
Writing can be excruciating, and I know it’s only a matter of time before generative A.I. will surpass my writing abilities by certain metrics, most notably speed. In the commercial marketplace, my value as a writer might shrink even further, but I agree with Scott that it will be exceedingly difficult for a machine to replicate my experience.
Our innate human ability to synthesize our experiences for creative problem solving will be hard for technology to infringe upon. That potentially matters less if we’re all adrift in an endless, churning sea of quasi-personalized, auto-generated content that has immense technical prowess but no pulse. That’s why it seems critical for artists and creatives to find ways to use these tools that will augment their abilities, not replace them.
Whether it’s a busy artist using ChatGPT to craft email updates for their mailing list or a designer using generative tools to produce a wider variety of work for clients, technology used responsibly can provide tangible gains in terms of income while also shaping the form these powerful technologies assume. Machines are destined to become more intertwined with our lives. With generative A.I. readily available, there’s an opportunity right now for people to decide what that will look like.
Recently, I was part of a conversation about technology and the nature of art with Laura Herman, a researcher at the University of Oxford. We discussed many aspects of generative A.I. and creativity, but her thoughts on intentionality have been echoing in my head.
“Naturally, when I look at a piece of artwork… I think about ‘What was the artist trying to convey?’ and ‘Why did they do this?’” Herman said. “It can be just physical intentionality—it could be conceptual intentionality. Now [these] new technologies [are] shifting the visibility of intentionality and shifting how that intentionality is brought to bear on the ultimate artwork—there’s so much to think about in that space.”
In a world oversaturated with generative content, it’s possible that people will be more drawn to art that’s being created by humans. On paper, machines can play jazz, but does anyone want to watch one take an extended solo over Coltrane’s “Giant Steps”? What is the quality of the intentionality in that kind of content? Like most of the things we call art, the very heart of jazz is so tied to human experience and discipline that a machine’s best attempt would be eternally relegated to the status of imitation.
Maybe the question isn’t will the tool usurp the artist but will we let it?

Published: 31 Aug 2023


 
Disinformation and inappropriate content abound in digital environments, and users may struggle to determine the source of such content or how to filter it out.







Content moderation is commonly used as a social media screening practice. It enables the approval or rejection of comments and content created and posted by users. The task involves removing rule-violating content to ensure published posts adhere to community guidelines and terms of service.
AI can aid in that process. It searches for, flags and eliminates AI-generated content that violates the rules or guidelines of a social media platform, website or organization. This includes any audio, video, text, pictures, posts and comments deemed offensive, vulgar or likely to incite violence.

What is content moderation?
Historically, organizations have moderated content with human moderators who would review all content before it published, said Jason James, CIO at retail software vendor Aptos. The moderators would check the content for appropriateness and either approve and post or disapprove and block it.
Unfortunately, users would often not know if their content was rejected or, if so, the criteria for the rejection process. The entire process was manual and prevented real-time responses to postings. Approval was also ultimately subjective to the decision and leanings of a single moderator.
As a result, many organizations adopted a mix of automated and human intervention to moderate content, James said. Human moderation on top of automation is critical because, if something offensive fell through the cracks, the organization would face serious consequences.
Automated moderation occurs when user-generated content posted through the platform or website is automatically screened for violating the platform's rules and guidelines. If it does, the platform either removes it altogether or submits it for human moderation, said Sanjay Venkataraman, chief transformation officer at ResultsCX, a CX management vendor.



If an organization has strong best practices for content moderation, then it could more easily embrace AI tools to moderate content.







Moderation for AI-generated content
AI content moderation is a machine learning model. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and incorporates platform-specific data to catch inappropriate user-generated content, Venkataraman said.
An AI moderation service can automatically make moderation decisions -- refusing, approving or escalating content -- and continuously learns from its choices. Moderation for AI-generated content is complex, and the rules and guidelines are evolving in tandem with the pace of technology, Venkataraman said.
""Content created using generative AI and large language models is very similar to human-generated content,"" Venkataraman said. ""In such a scenario, adapting the current content moderation processes, AI technology, and trust and safety practices becomes extremely critical and important.""
As generative AI brings a lot of contextual understanding and adaptability into content generation, moderation tools must be reinforced with advanced AI capabilities to detect nonconformance, Venkataraman said. That includes training the AI models with larger numbers of data sets, using humans to validate a higher sample of content, collaborative filtering with community-generated feedback on published content, and continuous learning and feedback.
AI-generated content is increasing, and organizations must adapt to the rapid pace, James said.
""As content can be created faster, the need to review and moderate content more quickly also increases,"" James said. ""Relying on human-only moderators could create a backlog of reviewing content -- thus delaying content creation. The delays created impact collaboration, ultimately resulting in a poor user experience.""





5 types of AI content moderation
Organizations have five methods they can adopt to effectively use AI content moderation to scale. They are the following:

Pre-moderation. Businesses can use NLP to look for words and phrases to ensure content meets their guidelines, including words and terms that could be offensive or threatening. If they met those criteria, the content could be automatically rejected, and the user warned or blocked from future postings. This automated approach limits the need for human moderators to review every post.
Post-moderation. This method enables users to post content in real time without going through pre-moderation review. When a user posts something, a moderator would review the content. With this method, users could see content that violates community guidelines before a moderator notices and blocks it.
Reactive moderation. This method enables users to serve as moderators, who review posts to determine if they meet or violate their own community standards. This method crowdsources moderation to the community rather than using and employing human moderators.
Distributed moderation. This approach is similar to reactive moderation, where users vote to determine if a post meets or violates their own community standards. The more positive votes received, the more users see it. If enough users report the post as a violation, the more likely it is blocked from others.
User-only moderation. This enables users to filter out what they deem to be inappropriate. The moderation is only done through registered and approved users. For example, if several registered users report the post, the system automatically blocks others from seeing it.



How AI will affect content moderation
Generative AI will continue to lead the AI evolution, James said. This will put greater pressure on organizations to invest in AI at some level to remain competitive. That, in turn, will make AI content moderation a must-have capability.
""AI will be more heavily used to not only create content, but [to] respond to postings on social media,"" James said. ""This will require that organizations employ AI-empowered content moderation to not only automate, but also modernize their existing process.""
AI can enable faster, more accurate moderation with less subjective review by human moderators, James said. And, as generative AI models evolve and become more advanced, content moderation will become more effective over time.
""Already, [AI] can automatically make highly accurate automated moderation decisions. ... By continuously learning from every decision, [it's] accuracy and usefulness can't help but evolve for expanded usefulness,"" Venkataraman said.

With the release of a host of generative AI features for Grammarly, students now have a rich set of tools available to help them with every aspect of their writing. From collaboration to feedback to citations and even guidelines on appropriate use, Grammarly has embraced generative AI as an essential tool for student learning.


Enhanced Editorial Collaboration
A generative AI did not write this article, but one did read it and make suggestions. And the result is better for it. Editing is increasingly in short supply. One hundred years ago, being published was difficult, but if one was, one was almost certainly edited. Today, anyone with a computer can find an outlet in which to be published; the challenge is finding an editor. Grammarly, with its ever-watchful eye, is the next best thing.

Having an AI read one's writing is intensely valuable. The standard joke is that the average article in an academic journal has at most three readers, including the author, the editor, and three to five referees. For much non-academic online writing, where there is neither editor nor referees, a better estimate for the number of readers is slightly under one; that is if one includes the author.

PROMOTED
Long ago, Grammarly advanced from being a copyeditor looking for misspellings and grammatical mistakes to being a more full-bodied editorial assistant, monitoring tone and use and making suggestions on improving clarity or achieving the desired effect. With the release of Grammarly’s readily accessible generative AI components, the editorial assistant becomes an editorial collaborator, ready to brainstorm ideas, evaluate the strength of a thesis statement, explore counterarguments, and otherwise add value during the writing process.

Built For Students
Educators may worry that with the complete set of features, Grammarly will free students from the drudgery of actually having to do their own homework. While it is always a bad idea to bet against the ingenuity of students looking to evade work, Grammarly has provided safeguards.

When asked, ""Can you do my homework for me?” Grammarly politely declines, stating:
I'm sorry, but as an AI-powered assistant, I am not able to do your homework for you. However, I can provide you with resources and guidance to help you complete your homework on your own. Is there a specific subject or assignment you need help with?

(Note: Ironically, when writing this article, Grammarly looked at this quoted response and made some editorial suggestions to make it less wordy. So, it is clearly not always taking its own advice when it comes to the AI’s output.)

This type of safeguard, gently reminding students to do the work themselves, is tightly integrated, and Grammarly will discourage students from generating long-form text by AI if they attempt to do so. Messaging within the product redirects them to ideate with Grammarly instead while reminding them to adhere to their institution’s or instructor’s policies.
When asked how Grammarly keeps students from abusing generative AI, the reply is informative:
Grammarly ensures that generative AI is not abused by implementing strict security protocols and constantly monitoring its system. They have a team of experts who are dedicated to ensuring that the use of AI is transparent and that student data is protected at all times. In addition, Grammarly does not collect any personal information that is not necessary for the functioning of their service. By taking these measures, Grammarly is able to provide a safe and secure environment for students to improve their writing skills with the help of AI technology. 
This point about privacy is an important one. In speaking with Grammarly’s Head of Education, Jenny Maxwell, she noted that, unlike some generative AI systems, Grammarly keeps student information secure, allowing students to write freely about any subject without worrying about having ideas or personal information passing irretrievably into the ether.
Manageable Guidance
Grammarly does an excellent job of keeping its guidance manageable. Whereas unconstrained ChatGPT provides page-long explanations or suggestions with 8 to 12 bolded options, Grammarly keeps things to a handful of sentences, helping students stay focused on the task without getting lost in a web of possibilities.
Two simple examples demonstrate this point.
When asked to help brainstorm ideas for an essay on Sherlock Holmes, Grammarly replies: “Of course! There are many potential angles to consider for an essay on Sherlock Holmes” and then proceeds to delineate three possibilities and prompts the student to ask if additional help is wanted. The total response is 103 words.
When asked the follow-up question, “What is unique about Holmes's deductive reasoning skills?” Grammarly again gives a precise response, using only 47 words to spell out the unique attributes.
At 103 words for the first response and 47 words for the second, these are replies that students can absorb and respond to. By comparison, the same questions put to ChatGPT generate replies of 395 and 414 words, respectively. The answers may be more comprehensive, but in the context of a student writing an essay, they are less likely to be helpful, especially if students are supposed to construct the argument themselves.
Addressing Educator Concerns
Grammarly, especially when enhanced with generative AI, has its detractors. Their concerns are primarily of two kinds: those having to do with developing the skill of writing and those having to do with students doing the work assigned to them.
As regards the former, when the question is put to the AI, Grammarly provides an excellent summary of potential concerns.
[With] Grammarly … there are some limitations and potential drawbacks to consider. For example, the AI-powered assistant may not always catch every error, and some suggestions may not be applicable or may even be incorrect. Additionally, relying too heavily on Grammarly may hinder the development of writing skills, as users may become overly dependent on the tool instead of learning to identify and correct errors themselves.
Just as spellcheck has for the most part improved spelling, making people aware of grammatical errors when they are made is more likely to improve grammatical understanding than to prevent its formation.
Regarding the latter concern, that of AIs doing the assignments for the students, here is where the work falls back on the teachers to craft assignments so that they cannot be completed by just handing a single prompt to a generative AI.
The best teaching occurs when a teacher can attend to a student’s work process rather than just looking at the work product. Assignments that shine a light on student research, student idea formation, outlines, and drafts, leading to papers, rather than just looking at a final result, will be much harder to fabricate. They will also provide more significant opportunities for effective teaching.
Embracing the Inevitable
Mathematics has long had to address the challenge of advanced tools–calculators, spreadsheets, symbolic computation, etc.–that can render obsolete traditional homework. This does not mean that problem sets are no longer assigned, only that the assigned types have changed. Similar changes will need to be made for writing assignments.
The reality is that generative AI tools are here to stay. They can either be incorporated into teaching or left for students to use in the shadows. If teachers can keep their eyes fixed on the goal of writing as the clear expression of well-reasoned ideas, they should have no problem finding a place to use tools like Grammarly.

The tech giant is aiming to get on a strong competitive footing against Amazon and Microsoft, but experts say there’s plenty of challenges for the technology in the world of medicine.

At the end of each hospital shift, the outgoing nurse has to quickly bring the incoming one up to speed about all of the patients under their care. This “handoff” can take multiple forms, including conversations, handwritten notes and electronic medical records. “[It’s] a risky part of the healthcare journey, because we're transferring information from one healthcare provider to another,” says Michael Schlosser, senior vice president of care transformation and innovation for HCA Healthcare. “We have to make sure that it's done in an accurate way and that nothing falls through the cracks.”

Schlosser and his team at Nashville-based HCA – one of the largest healthcare systems in the country with 180 hospitals and around 37 million patients a year – thought this transfer of information could be a good opportunity to apply generative artificial intelligence. Large language models are good at summarizing and organizing data. But when HCA scoured the market for potential vendors, Schlosser says they couldn’t find any companies building solutions for this handoff issue.

HCA had an existing partnership with Google Cloud, so they turned to Google’s software suite called Vertex AI, which helps customers build and deploy machine learning models. Google offers its own foundation model, known as PaLM, but the platform is model agnostic, meaning customers can also swap in and build on OpenAI’s GPT-4, Facebook’s Llama, Amazon’s Titan or any other model of their choosing.

In a bid to woo more healthcare customers, Google has also been developing a healthcare-specific large language model. The company announced Tuesday it will release the latest version – called Med-PaLM 2 – to a wider number of customers in September. HCA is one of several healthcare customers that has had early access, along with the pharmaceutical giant Bayer, electronic health record company Meditech and digital health startups Infinitus Systems and Huma. This renewed push into healthcare comes as Microsoft and Amazon are making their own AI-powered inroads into the sector, and it’s far from clear which will come out on top when the dust clears.

“We’re still five minutes into the marathon,” Gartner analyst Chirag Dekate says of the healthcare AI landscape.
In 2021, Google disbanded its standalone Google Health division but said health-related efforts would continue across the company. Its recent AI solutions in the industry are geared towards solving piecemeal problems. For example, Google released AI tools last year to help healthcare organizations read, store and label X-rays, MRIs and other medical imaging. Earlier this year, the company unveiled AI tools to help health insurers speed up prior authorization.
The use case focus is necessary because of AI technology itself, says Greg Corrado, head of health AI at Google. Despite the hype over large language models, he says it’s “naive” to expect them to be “able to do anything expertly off the shelf,” adding that “In practice, these systems always require identification of specific use cases.”
When it comes to large language models, Google has been playing catchup to OpenAI, the startup behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, which has received $10 billion investment from Microsoft. In 2022, Microsoft acquired Nuance Communications for $18.8 billion, giving it a major foothold to sell new AI products to hospital clients, since Nuance’s medical dictation software is already used by 550,000 doctors. “Nuance has an enormous footprint in healthcare,” says Alex Lennox-Miller, an analyst for CB Insights, which makes Microsoft “well-positioned” for the use of its generative AI software for administrative tasks in the sector.
Before the generative AI boom, Amazon, Microsoft and Google were all competing for cloud customers. With $48.1 billion in cloud revenue in 2022, Amazon holds around 40% of the market share, according to technology research firm Gartner. Microsoft follows with 21.5%, while Google places fourth behind Alibaba Group with more than $9 billion in cloud revenue and 7.5% of the market.
It’s also no surprise that they are all now trying to specifically target healthcare customers, a complex and heavily regulated industry, says Dekate. He says that’s because if you’re able to prove use cases in a more complex environment, like healthcare or financial services, then it signals to other customers that generative AI is ready for broader adoption.
But no one is there yet. What all the cloud companies have presented to customers are building blocks, says Dekate. That is, plenty of ways to utilize their AI platforms in bespoke applications their customers have to build. But what those customers want are fully-built solutions.
“Amazon, Google and Microsoft are fighting it out to dominate the commanding heights of the generative AI economy,” says Dekate. “But none of them have articulated a good enough vertical story.”
Because healthcare is so highly regulated and the consequences of mistakes are high, generative AI use cases need to start out very small. For HCA that means one hospital – UCF Lake Nona – is currently piloting the handoff tool as a proof-of-concept. The AI ingests patient data from the past 12 hours, including lab results, medication, important events, and spits out a transfer summary, that also includes suggestions for what the oncoming nurse should be thinking about in the next 12 hours, says Schlosser.
While it’s built using Google’s Vertex AI software, HCA has been experimenting with different foundation models, including PaLM and Med-PaLM. “We're actually doing a lot of head-to-head testing right now to see where does the generic model work better, and where does a medically-trained model provide more accuracy and better outcomes,” says Schlosser. “I imagine both will actually have important roles in the future we're trying to create.”
The idea of using multiple models to solve a complex problem, known as “composite” artificial intelligence, presents an interesting challenge for the cloud providers, says Dekate. They are simultaneously offering their own in-house models but also partnering with other companies in order to offer “the promise of choice,” he says. Dekate expects that more and more we’ll start to see Google, Microsoft and Amazon start offering services to help customers be able to evaluate different models. Schlosser says HCA has so far been taking a manual approach to evaluation by having doctors and nurses evaluate the outputs of the model relative to what the human team would do as a side-by-side comparison.
Corrado says that at the state of the art right now, generative AI models can be likened to “an eager, studious assistant that's trying very hard to do a good job. And you should view the output critically, as a draft and say, Okay, well, what did you miss? What did you get wrong?”
OpenAI has taken the view that bigger is better when it comes to the amount of data that the model is trained on. Its GPT-3 model, which was trained on the open internet, had around 175 billion parameters and the latest version, GPT-4, is thought to have more than 1 trillion parameters (though the company has not publicly confirmed the total amount). Google says the largest PaLM and Med-PaLM models have 540 billion parameters. The company declined to comment on the size of PaLM 2.
But as models are trained on more and more data, there can be issues with performance. In July, a group of researchers from Stanford and UC Berkeley said their tests suggested that GPT-4’s performance had suffered some degradation over time, echoing anecdotal reports that can be seen on developer fora. Although this was a preliminary finding and researchers are still learning how generative AI models work, this does spark some concern, especially as it’s not entirely clear how such AI systems arrive at their answers. “One of the biggest problems in healthcare for these algorithms is going to be the difficulty they have with transparency,” says Lennox-Miller.
Corrado says these concerns are precisely why Google is experimenting with niche LLM models that are trained on narrower sets of data. Without tailoring models towards specific use cases, such as healthcare, he says, “you run the risk of just having a Swiss army knife, which is not the best knife, and it's also not the best screwdriver. And it's also not the best toothpick. And we think that it's better, particularly in these high value settings, to do domain adaptation, understand what the use case is, and have the same kind of rigorous quality evaluation and version control that you would expect from a real product.”
Another challenge for most large language models is that they’re not constantly learning. They typically have a cutoff date for their training data. For example, the free version of ChatGPT was trained on data until September 2021. But knowledge in healthcare is always advancing, so doctors who use these tools need to have a good sense of how recent the data they’re working with is. Corrado says Google is still deciding what the cutoff will be, but that it will be communicated to customers. “We don't rely on these systems to know everything about the practice of medicine,” says Corrado.
In the hospitals of the future, Schlosser envisions an “AI assistant to the care team,” that he believes will have “amazing power in reducing administrative burden.” HCA has also been working with Google and the publicly-traded ambient AI company Augmedix to automate medical note-taking in the emergency room. Schlosser says around 75 doctors at 4 HCA hospitals are using the technology. The “holy grail” for doctors, he says, is that they could focus on providing care to patients and “the documentation would take care of itself.” The reason they’re starting in the emergency room is because that is one of the most complicated venues to prove the technology actually works.
When it comes to using Augmedix’s tool, the doctor directly asks the patient for their consent to record the examination and use an AI tool for note-taking, says Schlosser. For the nurse handoff tool, which is not patient-facing, it falls under HCA’s broader privacy consent around using patient data for research and process improvement, he says. HCA is also working on using generative AI for ER discharge summaries, as well as handoffs from the ER to inpatient. Schlosser says as HCA thinks about scaling the use of AI for administrative purposes, the company will have to consider “the right way to let all patients know that an AI is part of a care delivery process.”
Consent and privacy are major concerns around the use of AI in healthcare and Google generated significant controversy with an earlier partnership with the hospital system Ascension using AI to analyze millions of medical records. In 2019, reports of the company’s “Project Nightingale,” raised concerns about data privacy and security. Both Google and Ascension said the work was compliant with federal patient privacy laws.
In the case of PaLM and Med-PaLM, Google says that none of the models are being trained on patient data at HCA or any other customer. “HCA's data is HCA's data and nobody else's,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian tells Forbes. “Think of it as a vault in our cloud that only is used to train the version of the model that they're using. It's not shared with anybody else. None of that data is used to improve our base model.”
Despite the challenges to generative AI from technical capabilities to privacy and data concerns, Schlosser is optimistic that tools built on technology will become part of the standard toolkit for doctors. HCA is taking a slow approach built on alleviating some of the burdens of their day to day job, he says, because he thinks once doctors start embracing AI, they’ll be positioned to guide the best way to use it for more complicated applications.
“I want clinicians to fully embrace AI as a partner that's making their life easier, before we start getting into some of those more controversial areas,” he says.

The business landscape has undergone a significant shift over the past few years because of artificial intelligence (AI). This technological advancement has innovated business practices and is changing the way we work.
Businesses are increasingly turning to AI to solve problems and perform tasks that have traditionally required human intelligence. Across different industries and occupations, AI is being used to detect patterns, make predictions and even create content.
However, the rapid rate of AI adoption is putting workplaces at risk of overlooking its potentially adverse impacts, particularly those that could impact the health and well-being of workers.
AI in the workplace
The type of AI currently being used in workplaces has a narrowly defined role. It primarily augments the work being performed by humans, as seen by customer service chatbots, robots working alongside factory workers or cancer diagnostic platforms.
The recent strike of the Writers Guild of America offers an example of workers in a field once previously thought to be shielded from automation fighting to protect their jobs from the use of generative AI to write scripts and produce creative content in Hollywood.
But future types of AI might be very different than the ones we are seeing now. In the future, AI that matches, or even surpasses, human intelligence might be introduced into workplaces. These stronger, more capable forms of AI will undoubtedly change the role of human workers.

Some economists project that up to 300 million full-time jobs could have some portion of their tasks performed by AI. Others predict that the quickly growing advancement and use of AI could also create a number of new jobs that require workers to work alongside machines.
Worker health and well-being
Throughout history, periods of technological transformation have introduced new tools to workplaces and altered working conditions in ways that have impacted worker health in both positive and negative ways. 
The increasing availability of smartphone technology, for example, has given rise to the digital gig economy characterized by temporary and freelance work, or short-term contracts. While this shift presents novel work opportunities, it also contributes to widespread labour market precarity that has negatively impacted the well-being of workers.

Our understanding of how AI will impact working conditions and worker health, however, is not yet clear. There are several ways in which current (and future) forms of AI could bring advantages and disadvantages to workers.
On one hand, AI could be used to perform strenuous tasks that pose the greatest risk to workers’ health. It could also identify occupational hazards and employees’ physical and mental well-being in real-time to quickly deliver health and safety solutions.

At the same time, AI being more applicable to some industries or occupations could result in inequities within the labour market. Currently, the occupations where AI is least useful are those that involve unpredictable and highly physical job tasks (e.g., nursing aides, janitors, food service workers) or those that have leadership responsibilities (e.g., chief executive officers).
Some predict AI has the potential to contribute to a hollowing out of the labour market, with widening income gaps and disparate effects on worker health.
The adoption of AI within the workplaces could also increase the intensity and stressfulness of work or create pressure among humans to keep up with machines. And in cases of biased design, AI could reinforce discriminatory workplace practices faced by workers from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.
Prioritizing health research on AI
According to a recent report led by the non-profit Institute for Work & Health and informed by a multidisciplinary team (including me), research about the health impacts of AI should take several critical directions.
There is a need for research to better understand how increasingly autonomous and advanced versions of AI will impact working conditions and worker health. Equally vital is the creation of a road map for AI design that optimizes health.
The report also underscores the importance of research that can be put into practice. Research needs to meaningfully inform discussions about the health and safety implications of AI adoption, as well as the regulations needed to safeguard human health.
Workers should also be able to access evidence to better understand the potential impacts of the technology — both harmful and helpful — on their jobs and well-being, and to gain practical insights on how to safely work alongside AI.
AI will bring rapid and large-scale changes to the working world. Without evidence of the health-related challenges and opportunities AI may present, it will be difficult for decision-makers to protect and promote worker health and safety. 
There is a critical need for research that can be used to understand, anticipate and address AI’s potential risks and opportunities for the human workforce, and to ensure that worker health and well-being is at the forefront of AI adoption.

The future of work has long been plagued by anxieties about automation. The newest technology to evoke both anxiety and optimism is generative AI.Questions have been raised regarding whether jobs may be replaced by AI as a result of advancements in generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard. Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being utilised as a spark for writing ideas and helping with repetitive content generation, yet it is unlikely that it will ever match the genuine originality of humans.Ultimately, the extent to which AI will take away jobs depends on various factors, including the rate of AI advancement, the willingness of businesses to integrate AI into their operations, government policies, and societal attitudes. Jobs will be enhanced by AI in the future. However, one may make the case that work replacement for some results in job augmentation for others. Although it is impossible to anticipate how generative AI will advance, discussions of this technology's potential importance for the future of work center on its present capabilities. So, is AI really poised to take over your job? Let&rsquo;s find out. The 'AI age' has arrivedAn important step forward in the public's exposure to AI technologies was marked with the introduction of ChatGPT. Machine learning models are beginning to engage with people in the real world as part of this new wave of technological change, showcasing its advantages and disadvantages.According to the Future of Jobs Report, approximately 75% of questioned enterprises anticipate implementing artificial intelligence, which will result in high churn, with 50% of organisations anticipating job growth and 25% anticipating job losses.      According to a research from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, artificial intelligence played a role in over 4,000 job losses last month as interest in the quickly developing technology's capacity to carry out sophisticated organisational functions and reduce workloads has increased. Analysts point out that while generative AI is still in its infancy, it is already producing new occupations, similar to other technologies that have displaced human employees.Disruptions aheadAccording to an IBM report, over the course of the next three years, the introduction of AI and automation will require 40 per cent of the workforce to upgrade their abilities. The 3.4 billion people employed worldwide, or about 1.4 billion, will be impacted.In the following years, we are likely to see a paradigm shift from humans helping machines to humans helping machines.According to the World Economic Forum, 85 million jobs would be lost to AI worldwide by 2025. Furthermore, according to the organisation's ""The Future of Jobs Report 2020,"" technology will add 97 million new jobs over the next few years.Artificial intelligence (AI) increases human productivity and intelligence. Although it is difficult to foresee change on a larger scale, it most certainly exceeds our expectations. Not only will AI improve the efficiency of coding, marketing, legal, and administrative tasks, but it will also fundamentally alter how all types of enterprises and organisations are created and operated.When 42% of organisations are considering how to utilise AI in the near future and 35% of businesses are currently utilising it, concerns about AI replacing jobs are justified. The likelihood of worker layoffs increases as AI technology develops and becomes less dependent on human participation, even though this does not necessarily imply that workers are being fired.What do the reports say?According to the ILO, businesses only think AI is capable of performing a limited set of tasks, thus it may complement human employment rather than displace it.The demand for quickly expanding skills, such as AI/machine learning, cloud computing, cybersecurity, product management, project management, and digital social media, represents a seismic shift in the job market with a billion jobs projected to dramatically change within the next ten years as a result of AI.Workers won't soon be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI). However, the IT giant IBM said in its analysis that those who use AI will replace those who don't.Around 300 million jobs, or 18% of all jobs worldwide, could be automated, according to a new Goldman Sachs analysis, with more developed countries being severely impacted than emerging markets.The worldwide corporate software, healthcare, and financial services industries are all projected to be significantly impacted by improvements in AI, according to a separate analysis from Goldman Sachs research. The corporate software sector appears to be entering the next wave of innovation after the growth of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud computing revolutionised how we function as a society, with well-known tech firms ready to release their own generative AI tools.      The bottom lineThe latest research by the International Labour Organization (ILO) of the United Nations asserts that while AI will revolutionise labour, it won't necessarily eliminate jobs.The ILO believes that while AI may not completely replace most professions, it may complement them. According to the ILO, businesses only think AI is capable of performing a limited set of tasks, thus it may complement human employment rather than displace it.There are two sides to this story: robots and artificial intelligence (AI) will displace certain human occupations, but they'll also bring about the creation of new ones. As AI technologies advance, new industries and business models may emerge, leading to the creation of jobs that we can't fully predict at this moment. Although it's possible that parts of your job duties could be replaced by AI, it's crucial to realise that AI does not always take the place of human workers. As a result of AI investments, many tasks will become obsolete, necessitating the development of new roles and capabilities. Hence, it will be safer to say that AI will not replace a job, but a person using AI will.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/will-ai-take-away-your-job/103109447'}",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679574770-et-hrsea-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,contactus@ethrworld.com,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Canva, the world’s only all-in-one visual communication platform, has released new data on professionals’ understanding of AI as its presence in the workplace and culture expands.


From the boardroom to recent graduates, professionals at every level are navigating the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence at work. As businesses race to reap the benefits of AI, employees are trying to balance their performance with spending time learning new tools, though many lack the time or resources to do so effectively. The result is a collective experience in which professionals are being inundated with conversation about AI, both at work and in their personal lives, but don’t yet have a deep or practical understanding of how to best use the technology.


The survey of 1,000 professionals in a business setting, conducted by global research and data partner Sago, indicates that employees are feeling increased pressure to appear tech-savvy and up to date with the latest trends amongst peers and friends. Amid this sea change, employers have an opportunity to foster AI skill-building to prevent imposter syndrome in the workplace.


The survey unveiled a range of reactions to AI’s rise:



Professionals feel a need to keep up appearances as they learn:


26% say they have sometimes exaggerated their knowledge of AI or generative AI at work to keep up with superiors or colleagues.



72% of professionals said they were familiar or very familiar with the term “artificial intelligence,” but this number dropped to 51% when asked about familiarity with “generative AI.”





Millennials are leading the uptake and adoption of AI, having the most positive perceptions of generative AI in the workplace:


59% said that they believe generative AI is part of the solution when it comes to helping humans achieve their full potential in the workplace, compared to 43% of Gen Z.



Meanwhile, over a third (36%) of Gen Z said they felt like AI is a problem when it comes to humans achieving their full potential at work, compared to 18% of millennials.





AI know-how is increasingly important outside of work, too:


While 35% of professionals have used AI tools in the workplace, more (43%) have used AI in a personal capacity.



21% of respondents say they have overstated their knowledge with friends and family. Why? 26% said it was because they did not want to look foolish for not knowing or needing to ask for clarification.





Even senior leaders feel behind when it comes to AI knowledge:


More than a third of senior leaders (VPs and above) said they have exaggerated their AI knowledge in work (38%) or personal (39%) settings, suggesting that when it comes to learning AI, the playing field is level despite differences in experience.





Despite their knowledge gaps, professionals clearly believe in the importance of learning AI:


41% of professionals worry that they will fall behind in their jobs if they don’t know how to leverage AI.



Those who have worked to improve their AI and generative AI knowledge find it fun (44%) and confidence-boosting (35%).





Given nearly all (85%) professionals indicated they are at least somewhat interested in improving their AI and generative AI skills and knowledge, employers may be well poised to offer time for learning and access to easy-to-learn tools that best suit their teams’ needs.


“The AI space is evolving faster than any one of us can grasp alone. It’s a simultaneously thrilling and overwhelming opportunity that people are naturally reacting differently to,“ said Cameron Adams, co-founder and Chief Product Officer at Canva. “In our product, we’ve tried to make it a no-brainer to start using AI when designing in Canva by embedding it in familiar or intuitive ways. A quick and empowering way to start learning AI is by using it for low-stakes tasks, like a meeting agenda or a lesson outline. Creating a culture of sharing AI experiences and learnings among teams can prevent people from feeling behind and spark new discoveries.”


To put respondents’ feelings about AI into perspective, Canva created five audience segments based on the data that reveal which professionals are driving – or detracting from – the conversation around generative AI:



Emerging leaders – 23% of professionals surveyed – committed themselves to learning AI over the past 4-6 months and are leading or actively participating in AI work conversations. These are the ""firstcomers"" or ""early adopters"" of workplace technology.



Learners – 13% of professionals – are starting to commit themselves to learning and are active listeners in AI conversations (soon-to-be emerging leaders). These are the ""fast followers"" of generative AI tools at the office.



AI Curious – 28% of professionals – this is the ""silent majority."" They are currently non-users but already see the connection to gen AI and their careers. They know they should start learning, but there's a blocker (this is the next group to ""convert"") and the way we do that is largely a) making gen AI practice ""fun and exciting,"" b) lean into curiosity at the consumer level to grow confidence for professional uses, and c) show how AI can help them do their work faster and improve quality.



Detractors – 19% of professionals – are those actively pushing against AI tech, calling it ""a fad"" and believing it's ""part of the problem"" at work.



Imposters – 17% of professionals – are often ambiguous, sometimes looking like emerging leaders (or other audiences), but their hallmark is that they admit they have stretched the truth about generative AI skills at work, and overreport knowing fake AI terms.

Syrian media institutions are still far from the accelerating pace of the artificial intelligence revolution and are not effective in investing in it to develop various journalistic styles at a time when international media outlets are employing artificial intelligence in their work and in developing creative content and in front of the tendency of major technical companies to program applications that serve the traditional press.
The obstacles affecting AI in Syrian newsrooms are divided between logistical, technical, and knowledge obstacles, in addition to government restrictions that limit access to some of these tools for journalists residing inside Syria.





In this file, Enab Baladi discusses AI benefits for journalists and asks experts, academics, and journalists about its risks to the profession and the consequences of keeping pace with this development or not on media institutions.
Tools for journalists and organizations
Artificial intelligence has been associated with various fields, including the world of journalism, some of which benefit journalists in their daily work and some that benefit media corporations in providing better access to their audience.
Shehata al-Sayed, CEO of the Osh Group for Technology and Artificial Intelligence Industries, told Enab Baladi that the field of journalism and media is witnessing rapid developments with the advent of AI technologies and its use in this field and that by using appropriate tools, journalists can be helped to produce high-quality news content in a faster time.
One of the most important areas in which artificial intelligence tools benefit journalists is the ability to generate texts and preliminary content based on available data and facts, which saves time and effort in preparing reports. Also, summarizing tools allow journalists to quickly summarize long texts to extract key points.
Machine translation enables journalists to cover events from different regions in multiple languages accurately and quickly, while smart search tools provide the ability to search a huge amount of information to obtain relevant quotes and figures, according to al-Sayed.
Advanced tools allow verification of information and allegations, while other tools provide the ability to produce visual and audio content, including graphics, video clips, and audio, with high quality and lower cost.
Thanks to advanced forecasting and data analysis techniques, audience patterns and trends can be detected, which helps produce more in-depth and specialized press materials, according to al-Sayed.
Investigative journalist Abdul-Latif Haj Mohammad, a graduate of the London School of Economics in the field of discovering artificial intelligence and studying in the field of ethics in artificial intelligence, told Enab Baladi that in the midst of the “artificial intelligence revolution,” countless tools have emerged that can help journalists in different ways. Among them is the Bard tool that Google recently launched in Arabic, and it is one of the other tools the company is working on, according to Haj Mohammad.
Google is testing a tool known internally as Project Genesis that could take details of current events, for example, and generate news content from them, people familiar with the matter told The New York Times in July.
Google offered this tool to major American news organizations, such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and News Corp, which owns several media outlets, which expressed concern about the “ridiculing” of this tool for the effort of journalists in producing accurate and creative material.
The AI tool, according to News Corp, is a kind of personal assistant for journalists to automate some tasks and save time while taking into account ethical responsibility, and that it will help guide the publishing industry away from errors of generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT.

Technologies towards better audience reach
The 2023 annual report of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism highlighted the public’s tendency to receive information through social media, and with the development of technologies added to these platforms using artificial intelligence, the report recommended that the media focus more on determining how social media can be used to attract new people to follow.
The report warned of a wave of personalized news content driven by artificial intelligence but potentially “unreliable.”
AI technology can be used to create news summaries and personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors, which can help journalists reach a larger audience and create more relevant and engaging news, according to investigative journalist Haj Mohammad.
Among the artificial intelligence systems currently available, Haj Mohammad sees three technologies that publishers should be looking for and media leaders should invest in:

 Natural Language Processing (NLP): These are artificial intelligence systems that can read, write, translate, and generate texts, such as the ChatGPT platform that is based on Neuro-Linguistic Programming technology.


 The recommendation system: It is an artificial intelligence technology based on machine learning and deep learning, and it can be used to customize sites. Examples of its uses include users receiving advertisements for products they searched for previously, and it is also used in article recommendations.


 Computer vision or image recognition: It is a technology that has the ability to recognize images.

Through the latest technology, representatives from eight global news organizations worked on a project called “AIJO” (an abbreviation of the first two letters of artificial intelligence and the first two letters of journalism in English), which takes advantage of the power of artificial intelligence in several criteria, including, to understand, identify and mitigate newsroom biases, by identifying men and women in images, and calculating how equal they appear in reports and news, similarly to how much ethnic diversity is in the published news space.
In turn, the CEO of Osh Technology Group, Shehata al-Sayed, said that through predictive modeling technology, current news events and public opinion trends can be predicted using data, which allows the production of relevant content.
Search engines within the news site must be optimized to make them smarter to meet the search needs of readers, and bots can be used to automate routine tasks, such as publishing content and monitoring social media, according to al-Sayed.




Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation or approximation of human intelligence in machines. The goals of artificial intelligence include computer-enhanced learning, reasoning, and perception. AI is being used today across different industries, from finance to healthcare.
There are currently many applications of artificial intelligence, the most important of which are expert systems, natural language processing, voice recognition, machine vision, or image recognition. Artificial intelligence as a term has been used in its current form since 2003 and is taught academically as a branch of computer science.




Barriers to the use of artificial intelligence in the Syrian press
Syrian media corporations and their journalists face many obstacles to using the new tools of artificial intelligence, which threatens the possibility of benefiting from them in developing their work and the content presented to the public, whether it is visual, audio, or written.
These obstacles are divided into three main sections: financial, technical, and training.
Arabic language, cognitive deficiency, and authoritarian grip
The technical barriers that organizations and independent journalists face are directly related to two main factors. The first is that most of the new tools do not support the Arabic language.
This may create a major obstacle for the journalist during his work, as well as the media not investing in departments where programmers, data analysts, and journalists meet to design and test tools that serve journalistic work, whether through artificial intelligence or otherwise.
According to the Syrian journalist Murad al-Quwatli, Syrian institutions, like their Arab counterparts, are waiting for and trying to use what is produced in the United States and Europe, but not all tools and programs that serve journalistic work reach the region, and if they do arrive, their use is restricted by the fact that they are tools of the institution that developed and produced them. Therefore, it is rare for an Arab media outlet to have its own artificial intelligence tool.
The CEO of Osh Group, Shehata al-Sayed, told Enab Baladi that the most prominent difficulties are the scarcity of AI tools and applications in the Arabic language compared to the English language in terms of morphology, parsing, and grammar and that the leading companies in this field are preoccupied with working in the English language, as it is a global and dominant language.
In addition to the foregoing, the poor accuracy of some machine translation tools and automatic transcription of Arabic texts due to the complexities of the latter, the lack of availability of data and the huge Arabic content needed to train artificial intelligence models, and the difficulty of accessing advanced algorithms, because a limited number of companies control them.
According to al-Sayed, these problems can be solved by encouraging Arab startups to develop artificial intelligence tools suitable for the Arabic language and the needs of media content, making huge data sets available to the private and public sectors, to train and develop artificial intelligence algorithms, and establishing joint laboratories between universities and media institutions, to research and develop the use of AI in journalistic work.
This requires providing the necessary technical infrastructure, including devices and networks, to accommodate these technologies, according to the AI expert.
Haj Mohammad sees continuous learning as an important tool in the hands of journalists, and they can allocate time to learn about what is new and changes that occur in the profession of journalism.
One of the obstacles is the process of training on artificial intelligence tools, which may require a certain experience to deal with them in order to reach the best possible results, and in light of the lack of access to all technologies to the Syrian and Arab press institutions, this seems difficult.
Al-Quwatli pointed out that Europe and the United States already have institutions that provide training on artificial intelligence tools, but the Middle East and North Africa region needs more time.
Al-Quwatli believes that media organizations and journalists in Syria and the Arab region are still new to learning about the capabilities of artificial intelligence in journalistic work, which began practically with the ChatGPT boom in 2022.
He added to Enab Baladi that this does not mean that there are many journalists who have come a long way in increasing their skills by using artificial intelligence tools and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and their experience can be used.
In addition to the above, there is no talk in the Syrian press or among Syrian journalists inside Syria about the use of artificial intelligence in their work, as the authorities block the websites of the most popular artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT and Bard.
The Syrian authorities are constantly blocking various websites and pages on the Internet, most of which are opposition-affiliated websites, including some useful global websites such as social media, but they later lifted the ban on social media after popular pressure.

Financial barriers to independent institutions
Most AI tools offer paid services with annual or monthly subscriptions, and some of these tools require special training for journalists to learn to use them, which leads to additional financial burdens for organizations or freelance journalists.
These obstacles pose a challenge to independent press organizations, which may not receive significant annual funding from a specific entity on a continuous and permanent basis.
Al-Quwatli says that the high financial cost of artificial intelligence programs and tools poses a challenge to invest in them, explaining that artificial intelligence tools are not limited to ChatGPT, but there are programs and tools dedicated to analyzing data, audience behavior, etc., and the cost of subscription is high.
While press institutions in the region are facing great financial challenges, they also find themselves facing a new challenge represented in investing in artificial intelligence tools, whether by producing them or subscribing to paid services, according to al-Quwatli.
New AI tools play an active role in journalism and its development, which prompted al-Quwatli to create his own guide in which he collected these tools while analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, pointing out that journalistic institutions that do not pay attention to AI will find themselves very late in the next five years.
The CEO of Osh, al-Sayed, told Enab Baladi that the high cost of owning artificial intelligence tools and the difficulty of financing them by media institutions is one of the major difficulties faced by journalistic work.
The establishment of financial support funds and business incubators to support artificial intelligence projects is one of the solutions that institutions can follow to solve this problem, according to al-Sayed.
For his part, journalist Haj Mohammad said that only large media companies have the necessary financial resources to invest in expensive technologies and develop their own algorithms in this field.
While al-Quwatli believes that there are few solutions in this context, it remains for journalists and institutions to resort to using free copies as a temporary solution despite their limited usefulness and the inability to use them for free for a long time.

Does AI threaten journalists?
The speed of digital transformation threatened hundreds of thousands of jobs globally as the business world changes over time, and the future of work indicates an enlightened perspective on what companies and institutions need according to the data of digitization and technological developments amid the increasing revolution of robots and estimates of artificial intelligence solutions as a substitute for humans in many jobs.
According to a study by McKinsey and Company for global management consulting on the future of work for the year 2023, one in 16 workers may have to change their profession by 2030, representing more than 100 million workers across the economies of eight major countries, which together represent more than 60% of the world’s population.
The study considered that job growth will be more concentrated in jobs that require high skills, such as healthcare or science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
In terms of journalism and media work, the Reuters Institute for Digital News 2023 report showed that the public prefers to get news from celebrities, influencers, and social media personalities rather than journalists and media professionals.
And the projections of the Center for Education and Workforce at Georgetown University in the United States showed that newsroom jobs, including visual and radio news anchor, reporter, and staff writer, will decrease by 3% from 2022 to 2031.
Auxiliary, not obsessive
Dr. Mona Abdel Maksoud, assistant professor at the Faculty of Mass Communication at Cairo University, told Enab Baladi that the future of journalistic work with artificial intelligence is a “promising” future due to its rapid development.
Abdel Maksoud believes that it saves the journalist from many tasks that used to consume his time and effort in order to produce routine work that does not require much creativity.
The assistant professor at the Faculty of Mass Communication gave an example that artificial intelligence will save the journalist the work of collecting and organizing information, dealing with big data, and revising it, as it was before, as the journalist currently relies on simultaneous translation, access to a number of information sources through open sources, as well as communication with decision makers and departments of officials through social media platforms.
In the part related to verifying information, Abdel Maksoud pointed out that the past period witnessed the development of a large number of tools that can help the journalist verify and revise the information and base it on evidence and data in order to start relying on it in monitoring.




Investing in AI in developing the journalist’s work will save a lot of effort and make him focus on creative and innovative matters, and any journalist who has not and will not develop his tools with or without artificial intelligence is writing the end of his journalistic career himself.
Dr. Mona Abdel Maksoud – Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Mass Communication at Cairo University




Mattia Peretti, who manages JournalismAI — a research and training project at Polis, the international journalism think tank of the London School of Economics, considered that artificial intelligence does not steal journalistic jobs nor replace the journalist, but it can take on some tasks, and the user decides what they are.
Peretti stated that artificial intelligence can carry out several tasks that support the work of the journalist, and like any other technical innovation before, it changes the roles of the newsroom, but it is up to journalists after that to decide what they ask of artificial intelligence, as artificial intelligence does not have ambition in itself, nor the ability to steal jobs in the foreseeable future.
Dr. Arwa al-Kali, a trainer in data journalism, media, and news verification, believes that artificial intelligence cannot take over the work of information fact-checkers, but rather it can assist and guide them through various tools, and information-checkers are the ones who verify the authenticity of the news and the validity of its sources.
Al-Kali stated that it is not possible to rely on artificial intelligence to generate journalistic work because what it provides needs to be scrutinized, and it also provides false information and can confuse.
The trainer al-Kali’s assessment came during a training session that Enab Baladi attended virtually on information auditing and artificial intelligence, presented by the Pamela Howard Forum to cover global crises in cooperation with the International Journalists’ Network (IJNet).
After many information errors were discovered in AI platforms for generative conversations, the term “AI hallucinations” appeared, which describes chatbots fabricating the information provided, a problem that many technical experts doubt can be solved.
Keeping abreast of AI
The academic, Abdel Maksoud, expected that the journalist who is content with only collecting information manually, machine translation, or superficial media interviews, or even limiting himself to basic analytical skills and ordinary routine skills, will “disappear” and will have no place in the future of journalism.
Even with regard to critical thinking, problem-solving, innovation, and creativity, Abdel Maksoud suggested reaching a certain stage in the future in which artificial intelligence would be a competitor to humans, pointing to the need for people to be prepared for how to employ intelligence to serve their capabilities and capacities.
According to the Reuters Institute report on the trends and expectations of journalism, media, and technology for 2023, it is necessary to train journalists to work with artificial intelligence in order to avoid or reduce the effects of job displacement that it may cause.
The report pointed out the need for news organizations to invest in training journalists to work with artificial AI systems effectively and for news organizations, developers, and regulatory bodies to cooperate to set standards and guidelines for the ethical use of generative artificial intelligence in journalism.

Does it threaten journalists’ charter of ethics?
Various media outlets follow work mechanisms and professional charters that govern the manner in which they deal with various aspects of work.
Although these charters differ in their linguistic form, in line with the institution’s work style, identity, and the extent of its independence, at least six principles of journalism and media values constitute a common denominator that many media outlets seek to achieve in their coverage, namely accuracy, impartiality, objectivity, integrity, credibility, and independence.
In the face of any differences between what is narrow at the institutional level and what is broader at the professional level as a whole, in June 2019, the International Declaration of Professional Ethics for Journalists was adopted, which is an amended version of the Bordeaux Declaration issued in 1954, under the name of the International Federation of Journalists’ Declaration of Principles on the Conduct of Journalists.
The amended declaration consists of a preamble and 16 clauses specifying the rules and method for the journalist’s dealings with his sources and colleagues and the methods that can be used to obtain news and data, with the necessity for the journalist to acknowledge that fraud, distortion of facts, slander, spreading abuse and smearing reputation and unfounded accusations are a serious professional failure.
Articles 5 and 6 of the Declaration stipulated that the principle of speed in disseminating breaking information or news should not take precedence over the principles of verifying its sources and giving the concerned parties the opportunity to respond to them. The journalist should also make every effort to correct any information published that turns out to be inaccurate.
Faced with these principles and many others that fall within the same framework, workers in journalism and information verification stress the necessity of having rules for artificial intelligence that define what is available and possible and help the journalist in developing his tools and what is dangerous to the profession and affects its ethics in terms of undisciplined practices or uses.
The founder of the Verify-Sy platform, Ahmed Primo, told Enab Baladi that talking about standards governing the uses of artificial intelligence is not premature, as misleading, inaccurate, or fake content using artificial intelligence techniques is present and widespread, and major media organizations and journalists have fallen into the trap, and the content has been treated as accurate content, like the pictures that spread of the arrest of former US President Donald Trump.
In Primo’s opinion, these matters added a burden on fact-checkers and journalists to raise awareness for users of communication sites, media institutions, and journalists.
In terms of artificial intelligence means to combat misleading content, there are some techniques that people may use for research motives that do not start with curiosity and do not stop at research purposes, which provide exaggerated content, completely subjective, what calls for concern about the future of journalism or information, whether as journalists or contemporaries of a new experience present strongly.




It is necessary to develop media codes of honor and standards that journalists follow with regard to AI, and this takes a long time to reach our Arab region and a longer time for the journalist and the recipients of information to understand it at the same time.
Ahmed Primo – Founder of the Verify-Sy platform




The recipient is exposed daily to a lot of misinformation with the emergence of content that is not subject to the standards of accuracy and objectivity.
However, access to artificial intelligence will facilitate the spread of the phenomenon of “fake journalists,” “fake programmers,” and “fake artists.” These tools do not mimic everyone’s professions, but they will turn many into incompetent people in their professions, according to Primo.
The issue requires a lot of effort, awareness, and caution, as the image today can lie, and the sound can be imitated, or an exact copy can be created, according to the founder of the Verify-Sy platform.
Primo stressed the need to develop tools for fact-checkers and those affected by this phenomenon to come up with means that enable them to discover content based on this technology and distinguish it from unreal content, with the need to spread more media awareness and create curricula related to media education to teach it, similar to curricula for erasing technology illiteracy.
Investigative journalist Abdul-Latif Haj Mohammad agrees with Primo that the development of some programs to a large extent in generating and organizing information does not negate the role of the journalist in verifying the information he receives, without denying that there are basics in verifying information, photos, videos and different types of data that some journalists have not realized yet.
Haj Mohammad also indicated the need to work on a comprehensive guide that outlines the broad lines for the use of artificial intelligence, as artificial intelligence systems can have a built-in bias by creators that leads to prioritizing certain stories or viewpoints over others or neglecting human groups on political grounds, for example, and stifling its views.
Journalist Murad al-Quwatli believes that holding discussions at the level of press institutions is a means of determining the mechanisms for using artificial intelligence and identifying the ethical and professional aspects in dealing with this technology.
This necessitates cooperation between journalistic institutions, specifically in a region such as the Middle East, in a way that serves to advance journalistic work and agree on the basis for new tools in the profession, concludes al-Quwatli.

Enab Baladi asked AI
ChatGPT is one of the most popular artificial intelligence tools, which is used in many fields and sectors, including journalism.
Enab Baladi asked ChatGPT what it can offer to journalists, and its answer was as follows:
1- Idea generation: The tool can help journalists exchange ideas about articles, headlines, and news story angles by providing a brief general idea on a specific topic and requesting a model for generating creative ideas.
2- Research assistance: The tool can be used to collect basic information or statistics and contexts for reports and articles by requesting the provision of data, facts, or explanations related to the requested topic.
3- Drafting and planning: It can help draft outlines or initial drafts of articles by asking for expansion in different sections or obtaining supporting details.
4- Preparing for press interviews: The tool can be used to simulate interview questions and answers. This helps anticipate possible responses and improve the final result.
5- Editing and Proofreading: The tool helps review and edit written content, suggest sentences with alternative wording, and correct grammatical and spelling errors.
6- Accuracy: The tool helps verify the validity and accuracy of information before it is presented to the public.
7- Explain complex topics: The tool can explain complex topics to journalists in simple ways, which is reflected in the materials presented to the public later.
8- Breaking news: ChatGPT can generate quick summaries based on the available information, which helps in the completion of breaking news.
9- Interactive content: The tool helps create interactive elements such as surveys and tests.
10- Translation: It provides fast translation from several different languages.
ChatGPT concluded that although it is a valuable tool for journalists, it is essential to verify the information received and for the journalist to be aware of ethical considerations and potential biases within the information.

Most Americans haven’t used ChatGPT; few think it will have a major impact on their job
By Eugenie Park and Risa Gelles-Watnick

For the latest survey data on ChatGPT, see “Americans’ use of ChatGPT is ticking up, but few trust its election information.”
The debut of ChatGPT has led some tech experts to declare it part of a “robot revolution.” But most Americans haven’t used ChatGPT, and only a small share think chatbots will have a major impact on their jobs. Even fewer Americans say chatbots would be helpful for their own work, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted July 17-23.
How we did this
Pew Research Center has long explored Americans’ perspectives on emerging technologies and uses of artificial intelligence. The current study examined adults’ experiences with chatbots such as ChatGPT, particularly in relation to their jobs. This survey was conducted among 5,057 U.S. adults from July 17 to 23, 2023. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race and ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.
Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

Who has used ChatGPT?

Among those who have heard of ChatGPT, 24% say they have ever used it. That amounts to 18% of U.S. adults overall.

Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have used ChatGPT. Among those who have heard about ChatGPT, about four-in-ten adults under 30 have used it; that share drops to 19% when looking at 50- to 64-year-olds and to just 5% for those 65 and older.


College-educated Americans stand out: 32% of adults who have a college degree or more education and have heard of ChatGPT have used it.


Among those who have heard of the chatbot, men are more likely than women to report using ChatGPT (29% vs. 19%).

How do Americans use ChatGPT?

One-in-five U.S. adults who have heard of ChatGPT say they have ever used it for entertainment. A similar share (19%) say they have used it to learn something, while 16% of those who have heard of the tool and are employed say they have used it for tasks at work.
Younger adults are more likely than their older peers to have used ChatGPT for education or amusement. For example, among those who have heard of ChatGPT, three-in-ten adults under 30 have used it for learning, compared with 11% of those 50 and older.
Similarly, 29% of adults who are under 50 and have heard of ChatGPT have used it for entertainment, while 10% of their older counterparts have done the same.
There is a similar pattern among employed adults who have heard of the tool: Those under 50 are more likely than those 50 and older to report having used ChatGPT for work (18% vs. 10%).
Adults with a high school education or less who have heard of ChatGPT are significantly less likely than their peers with higher levels of formal education to have used ChatGPT for entertainment, learning or work. For example, among those who have heard of ChatGPT, 13% who have a high school diploma or less say they have used it to learn something new, compared with roughly one-in-five or more of those with some college (21%), a bachelor’s degree (19%) or a postgraduate education (26%).
How has ChatGPT use changed recently?

More Americans who have heard of ChatGPT are using it for work and learning today than when the Center first asked about this in the spring. For example, the share of employed adults who have heard of ChatGPT and have used it for work tasks increased from 12% in March to 16% in the new survey, which was conducted in July. The share who have used ChatGPT to learn something has also risen slightly during this time.
Which industries do Americans think will be most affected by chatbots?
Generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT may have its greatest impact on jobs that were traditionally thought to be immune from automation – namely, higher-paying jobs that require a college education.

In the Center’s new survey, about half or more of those who have heard of ChatGPT say chatbots will have a major impact on software engineers (56%), graphic designers (54%) and journalists (52%) over the next 20 years. Smaller shares think chatbots will have a major effect on teachers (44%) or lawyers (31%).  
But Americans are less likely to think chatbots will impact their own job. Some 19% of employed adults who have heard of ChatGPT think chatbots will have a major impact on their job. Another 36% say it will have a minor impact and 27% expect no impact at all.
Which Americans are most likely to think chatbots will affect their own jobs?

Among employed adults who have heard of ChatGPT, 60% of those ages 30 to 49 say chatbots will have a major or minor impact on their own job in the next 20 years. This is the highest percentage of any age group.
Those with more formal education are also more likely to think chatbots will have an impact on their job. For example, among working adults who have heard of ChatGPT, 71% of those who have a postgraduate degree say this, compared with 60% of those with a bachelor’s degree only and even smaller shares of those with some college (48%) or a high school diploma or less (42%).
Views on this question also vary by industry.

Those who work in information and technology and have heard of ChatGPT are the most likely to say chatbots will have a major or minor impact on their job. Three-quarters of these workers say this, including 37% who say chatbots will have a major impact on their work.
Around two-thirds (66%) of those who have heard of ChatGPT and work in education banking, finance, accounting, real estate or insurance think chatbots will affect their job.
At the other end of the spectrum, 40% of adults who have heard of ChatGPT and work in hospitality, service, arts, entertainment or recreation say chatbots will affect their job.
Will chatbots help people do their jobs?

Most employed Americans don’t anticipate chatbots being very helpful for their own work. Only 15% of working adults who have heard of ChatGPT say chatbots would be extremely or very helpful for their job, with 5% saying they would be extremely helpful.
Younger workers who have heard of ChatGPT are more optimistic that chatbots would help them do their job.
Workers with higher levels of formal education are also more optimistic. Those who have heard of ChatGPT and have a college degree are slightly more likely than those without a college degree to say these types of tools would be helpful for their job.
How do Americans feel about government regulation of chatbots?

The emergence of ChatGPT has sparked conversations about government regulation of artificial intelligence.  
Asked which is their greater concern, two-thirds of those who have heard of ChatGPT say it’s that government will not go far enough in regulating chatbot use. Some 31% instead say their greater concern is that the government will go too far.  
Of those who have heard of ChatGPT, majorities of Democrats and Republicans say their greater concern is not enough regulation. But this view is more common among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents than among their Republican and Republican-leaning counterparts (75% vs. 59%).
CORRECTION (Oct. 25, 2023): In a previous version of this post, the chart on views about chatbots and government regulation incorrectly stated that the findings were based on employed adults. The chart is based on adults who have heard of ChatGPT. This change does not affect the analysis or conclusions.
Note: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

discussing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform ideas into products of economic value.

The discussions took place last Thursday (24 August) during the first meeting of the Artificial Intelligence Committee to study the mechanisms of employing AI to develop the efficiency of economic and institutional performance held at the Ministry.

The meeting discussed ways to develop a mechanism to support the process of converting ideas into products of economic value for the transition to the knowledge economy and the employment of artificial intelligence to develop the efficiency and effectiveness of the performance of the national economy and to create a stimulating work environment.

Regarding the committee and its objectives, the Spokesperson for the Ministry of Economy and Trade and member of the Artificial Intelligence Committee, Fawzi Wadi, told <em>Libya Herald </em>that the committee was established by a decision of the Minister of Economy and Trade, Mohamed Al-Hwej. Its aim is to achieve maximum benefit from the technical and informational development in the world and the boom in the field of financial and business technology to ensure the establishment of a diversified economy based on sound scientific foundations.

Wadi pointed out to work on improving the indicators of the knowledge economy in Libya to reduce the gap between it and the developed countries in this field and to take advantage of the returns offered by this economy, which calls for diagnosing the reality of the national economy and shedding light on the most important challenges facing Libya and ways to overcome them to reach a knowledge economy.

He stressed the development of an action plan that guarantees the use of AI to serve the Libyan economy and in line with the available capabilities and creative ideas of Libyan youth and to ensure the success of their projects. The Ministry of Economy and Trade seeks, he added, through its various mechanisms and affiliated institutions to find local and international financing opportunities for them in addition to supporting projects based on innovation and renewal.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://libyaherald.com/2023/08/economy-ministry-discussing-use-of-artificial-intelligence-to-transform-ideas-into-products-of-economic-value/'}",,,,,,2023-08-27 16:31:54Africa/Tripoli,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://libyaherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LH-New-Logo-Light.svg'}",,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/libyaherald/', 'https://twitter.com/libyaherald', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/libyaherald', 'https://libyaherald.com/feed']",,,,,,https://libyaherald.com/#website,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://libyaherald.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Economy Ministry discussing use of artificial intelligence to transform ideas into products of economic value,2023-08-27 16:31:54,2023-08-27 14:31:54,,,,,,,,

How will AI impact the job market?




story by Allison Sylte
published Aug. 31, 2023
















Are robots coming for us? 
According to one study, roughly half of our jobs could be done by existing automation technologies. Meanwhile, the STEM fields that were considered some of the safest careers in the not so distant past are now thought to be some of the most vulnerable to being replaced by artificial intelligence. 
“This is critical, because previous waves of automation have always affected mostly low-skilled jobs that require routine tasks,” said Boris Nikolaev, an assistant professor in the Colorado State University College of Business. “The new wave of AI technologies, however, will have the biggest effect on white-collar jobs that require significant personal investment in education, like finance, marketing, writing and legal services.”
Nikolaev has started to teach the next generation of business leaders how to embrace potentially disruptive technology through a new class called “Artificial Intelligence and Strategic Value Creation,” which offers students the opportunity to learn the mechanisms behind AI, how it can help with certain tasks and the potential ethical pitfalls that might exist along the way.
“To quote an IBM study: ‘AI won’t replace people, but people who use AI will replace people who don’t,’” Nikolaev said. 













How concerned should we be about losing our jobs to AI?








Worries about jobs lost to new advancements are hardly new. 
Two centuries ago, 90% of the U.S. population worked in agriculture, but as technology has improved, less manpower has been required for the same output, placing that number at closer to 2% in the modern day. Meanwhile, workers have simply shifted careers into fields that require a human skillset, be it manufacturing when there was less demand in the agricultural sector to delivery driving and programming when e-commerce changed the face of traditional retail. 










“Historically, new technologies have created winners and losers among workers and sectors, depending on their ability to adjust to changing skill set requirements and occupational structures.” ”
— Boris Nikolaev, assistant professor, College of Business










Teaching the next generation how to work with AI 
That’s why it’s all the more important for workers to embrace – rather than resist – an increasingly automated world. Gaurav Jetley, an assistant professor of computer information systems in the CSU College of Business, teaches two courses catering to all backgrounds of students that explain how AI and machine learning models work, where to apply them and how they can be used to create actionable business insights. 
Jetley says he encourages all of his students to at least learn rudimentary coding skills as well as how to become comfortable with adapting to new software. 
“Lifelong learning and adaptability have always been keys to success, since what is the norm today may be a relic of the past as soon as the next month,” he said. 
While AI might be more efficient for certain tasks, Jetley said the next generation of workers should focus on developing their critical thinking and ability to adapt to changing situations, and plan on pursuing continued education as new skill sets become more in demand. 
To put it more succinctly, some skills won’t fall by the wayside. “In a way, there’s nothing to worry about,” Nikolaev said. “Just be yourself: a human.”

Artificial intelligence is upending many industries at the moment, and in the filmmaking world, a key area that is currently under threat of automation is storyboarding. 
Numerous AI tools have been released this year with the aim of replacing storyboard artists, and among the most advanced-looking I’ve run across is Storyboarder.ai, which claims to offer a solution to the “laborious and time-consuming process” of storyboarding. The company proposes that it can create “professional storyboards quickly and effortlessly.”
The video below describes how it works. Users upload a PDF of their screenplay to the cloud-based platform. The software then analyzes the script to create a shotlist. The user then reviews the shot descriptions, and selects some general settings for each shot. The program then generates the images, which can be further refined for style and content. 

The product is developed by Germany’s Fynal, a film production company based in Dortmund and Essen that bills itself as the “largest film production [company] in the Ruhr area.” 
A competing product is Storyboardhero from Singaporean tech company Ilathys. This product requires the user to create their script within the software, which doesn’t seem as useful as Storyboarder’s automated analysis of a script written in an industry-standard format.
Jean-Christophe Bouglé, co-founder of StoryboardHero, says, “We have been creating videos for clients for more than 10 years through our video agency called Fewstones. It used to take us days to create scripts and storyboards. That’s why we created StoryboardHero, an AI storyboard generator. We have been able to drastically reduce the time needed to create full storyboards for our clients and prospects.” 
One curious feature of Storyboardhero is the company also offers an option for its in-house artists to redraw the storyboards, which seems to defeat the purpose of using their software in the first place.
While these are storyboard-specific AI programs, it’s becoming clear that people are also using more generic AI tools for the purpose of boarding. In this Youtube video, the creators explain how they’re using the generative AI program Runway to create a primitive version of storyboards:


Amid’s Take: In the near-term, these AI storyboard tools appear to have greater applicability to live-action filmmakers than animation, because production storyboards in animation have to convey much more information than just shot composition and framing. However, it’s not difficult to envision a near-future where animation producers begin incorporating these technologies into productions, which would allow them to hire fewer storyboard artists whose role would be to refine pre-existing AI-generated boards.
What cannot be denied is that these technologies are progressing faster than the animation industry’s response to the tech. AI will soon be a competitor for industry jobs that have existed for the last century in animation production. Artists (and their representative unions) need to develop a response to this new threat and make clear to producers why human board artists should not, and more importantly cannot, be replaced by AI technologies.

Walmart: Generative AI tool will assist workers, not replace them


Walmart said its new generative AI tool aims to free employees from repetitive tasks. Officials said that while AI boosts efficiency, it has limitations.

Published: 30 Aug 2023


 
Walmart has deployed My Assistant, a generative AI tool for employees to help with generating content generation and summarizing large documents, acting as an overall ""creative partner"" for employees.







In detailing the new tool Wednesday, Walmart officials also tried to address broad concerns that AI tools like this will replace employees.
""There continues to be heightened debate about AI and automation, as well as its impact on the future of work,"" wrote Donna Morris, executive vice president and chief people officer, and Cheryl Ainoa, executive vice president of new business and emerging technologies, in a post on LinkedIn. ""Here's our belief: it will take both people and technology to deliver on our purpose to help people save money and live better.""
Generative AI ""can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it's trained on,"" the executives wrote.
This technology will free employees ""from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing more time and focus for improving the customer/member experience,"" according to the blog post.
Walmart may be ahead of some of the major HR vendors in releasing generative AI tools to help with employee productivity. Analysts and vendors see HR departments as significant users of the technology because their work substantially involves tasks where generative AI has seen successes, including communications, report writing and data analysis.

GenAI and productivity promises
""What Walmart is doing is intriguing because it's putting some of the highly personalized aspects of generative AI directly into the hands of the workforce,"" said Ben Eubanks, chief research officer at Lighthouse Research & Advisory.

To illustrate how generative AI tools can be helpful to employees, Eubanks imagined some of the prompts employees can enter, such as, ""Explain my healthcare benefits in language a high school graduate can understand,"" or, ""During orientation, who are three people who I should connect with?""
In a new report, the Boston Consulting Group believes generative AI could boost HR productivity by up to 30%. It said generative AI can accomplish this by ""dramatically increasing self-service"" as well as content creation, visualization and as much as half of onboarding tasks.
""Generative AI promises to lower the frictions and boundaries between humans and software in a way we haven't seen before,"" said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Gownder sees generative AI as a powerful aid for customer-facing roles. ""Navigating traditional mobile apps can be time-consuming and requires a learning curve,"" he said.
But a natural language generative AI interface can become a bridge to interact with backend systems such as inventory databases, making it easier for frontline workers ""while also lowering the burden of training them to use multiple software systems,"" he said.Patrick Thibodeau covers HCM and ERP technologies for TechTarget Editorial.

Dive Brief:

Walmart rolled out My Assistant, a generative AI-powered tool, to all non-store U.S. employees, the company announced Wednesday. 
The feature is available to 50,000 employees in a desktop and mobile app interface within Me@Campus, the company’s employee app. The tool can accelerate draft writing, act as a creative partner or summarize large documents, according to Walmart. 
The company also expects to use the tool for new hires during orientation and to help employees better understand company benefits during annual enrollment. Walmart will continue to build out the tool to support integrated self-service capabilities. 





















Dive Insight:
As enterprises grow more familiar with what generative AI can do for employees, adoption at scale has picked up among the largest organizations.
Commercial real estate company JLL released its proprietary large language model to its more than 103,000-member workforce earlier this month. Consulting firm PwC is rolling out its conversational AI assistant to employees in a phased approach, with around 1,000 employees having access to the tool as of August 15. McKinsey also equipped 7,000 employees with a generative AI tool this month.
Walmart has now joined the pack, giving access to its generative AI tool to more than 50,000 corporate employees. The company said it does not believe generative AI will take over for workers, but rather serve as a tool to allow employees to spend less time on monotonous, repetitive tasks. 
“Generative AI can help us work faster and more efficiently, but it also has limitations: it lacks judgment, has a limited understanding of context and is only as good as the data it’s trained on,” said Donna Morris, EVP and chief people officer at Walmart, and Cheryl Ainoa, EVP, new businesses and emerging technologies at Walmart, in a LinkedIn post Wednesday. “For out-of-the-box, truly brand-new thinking – that’s what humans are good at.”

The discount giant is including a generative AI-based feature called “My Assistant” in the new Me@Campus “super app” it is providing to tens of thousands of corporate employees. Generative AI is based on machine learning (ML) and can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.
The Me@Campus app also has features designed to aid employees in managing their careers, and finances, obtaining required learnings, and working on teams. Walmart says it is also working toward using the app for new associate orientation and to help associates better understand and choose their benefits during annual enrollment. 
In a LinkedIn post, Donna Morris, executive VP, chief people officer and Cheryl Ainoa, executive VP, new businesses and emerging technologies, Walmart, said MyAssistant will help employees with tasks such as speeding up the drafting process, serving as a creative partner, and summarizing large documents.
Ideally, Walmart hopes this technology will free employees from monotonous, repetitive tasks, allowing them more time and focus for improving the customer experience. In June 2023, the company rolled out the Walmart GenAI Playground, an early-stage internal generative AI tool where employees  can explore and learn about the new technology. 
“My Assistant has the potential to change how our associates work and solve problems,” Morris and Ainoa said in the LinkedIn post. “The conversation around GenAI continues to grow, sparking interest and curiosity around how it will reshape our work, interactions, and relationships. We believe GenAI will revolutionize the retail industry, make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers/members, and create better work experiences for associates.”
Walmart leverages AI across the enterprise
While Walmart is still developing its generative AI capabilities, the retailer has been actively integrating AI into its enterprise. At the kickoff of its recent two-day 2023 Investment Community meeting, Walmart unveiled a plan for what the discount titan says is “a new more connected and automated supply chain which will improve the experience for customers and associates and simultaneously increase productivity.” Over half of Walmart’s fulfillment centers could be automated within three years. The retailer expects the outcome to improve in-stock levels, inventory accuracy and flow across all fulfillment channels.
Walmart also utilizes applied AI to identify when an item purchased online can be fulfilled from one of its 4,700 stores instead of fulfillment centers. This step is intended to reduce both the number of miles driven and the number of boxes used for shipping.
To ensure that items can more sustainably travel from stores to customers’ homes, the retailer combines multiple orders on single delivery routes and delivers them using electric vans.
Other examples include the retailer utilizing advanced AI capability and employee expertise to streamline digital product discovery for Spanish-speaking customers.

With AI pervading almost every domain, there is excitement, concern and questions over where the technology can lead us. Little wonder, its impact is so fiercely debated. (Watch video)The Good 3 excerptsAI is the formative force impacting the world today across every dimension.AI can help you express what you want to say with the right information, in the right way at the right time with the right context.AI will fundamentally shift the way that we use time, ideally in a way that allows us to thrive, be excited, get more joy and laugh with others.2 video momentsI could see a world where your job is more interesting because you're applying judgement more often than you are doing the ministerial type parts of all of our jobs. (watch video)AI can serve us as coach and mentor, allowing us to have a better sense of who we are and create a sense of self-awareness which allows us to value ourselves and have others value us more. (watch video)1 insightArtificial Intelligence has the potential to make our lives exciting and our work interesting. It can enhance human well-being. In the words of Dr John Halamka, ""five years from now if you are doing colonoscopy without AI, that's malpractice.""The Bad 3 excerptsThere is also the possibility that AI takes us into a very dark place.In some ways it's inherently more threatening than automation for physical work.AI will be able to give us answers to questions but we will never understand why AI came to that conclusion.2 video momentsThere's a lot of interest and concern in Artificial intelligence and knowledge work in some ways it's inherently more threatening than automation for physical work because we're used to tools for physical work for centuries now. (watch video)What worries me more is that some of the AI tools have become so good at language and logic that we start to imbue them with these other aspects of humanity and we start to trust and believe in them. (watch video)1 insightIt could gradually lead us to a space where we stop using our reason and put entire faith in AI. In the words of Fareed Zakaria, ""we are returning to a pre-enlightenment world where we know what the answer is but we don't know why"".The way ahead3 excerptsCompanies will have to help workers adapt to AI and provide at-scale training opportunities. People will require assistance to incorporate AI into the work they are doing, so they view the tech not as a threat but as a sort of helpful assistant or co-pilot.If people are to trust AI, there has to be transparency about the algorithms being used by the AIs, everything from what data is being used to how it is being analysed.Governments and agencies will have to figure out what the right amount of regulation is in order to not stifle the budding technology but also to not let loose a monster. 2 video momentsWe aren't going to go directly to Star Trek, but what you are going to get is a much larger population that is much more tapped into their human potential. (watch video)We know how to architect values into technology. I am confident that we will create a software constitution that preserves some values. (watch video)1 insightWe should not try to regulate technology rather we should try to regulate use. Looking at the risks and rewards of every possible individual use of AI is crucial to guiding us to a world where the net benefit to society is distinctly positive, says Dr. Daniel Huttenlocher.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/artificial-intelligence-good-bad-or-scary/articleshow/103135523.cms,,en,,,,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-103135962,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1181614,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/103135523'}",,,,,,

Generative AI is a kind of artificial intelligence that creates new content, including text, images, audio, and video, based on patterns it has learned from existing content. Today’s generative AI models have been trained on enormous volumes of data using deep learning, or deep neural networks, and they can carry on conversations, answer questions, write stories, produce source code, and create images and videos of any description, all based on brief text inputs or “prompts.”
Generative AI is called generative because the AI creates something that didn’t previously exist. That’s what makes it different from discriminative AI, which draws distinctions between different kinds of input. To say it differently, discriminative AI tries to answer a question like “Is this image a drawing of a rabbit or a lion?” whereas generative AI responds to prompts like “Draw me a picture of a lion and a rabbit sitting next to each other.”

This article introduces you to generative AI and its uses with popular models like ChatGPT and DALL-E. We’ll also consider the limitations of the technology, including why “too many fingers” has become a dead giveaway for artificially generated art.











 
 
 
The emergence of generative AI
Generative AI has been around for years, arguably since ELIZA, a chatbot that simulates talking to a therapist, was developed at MIT in 1966. But years of work on AI and machine learning have recently come to fruition with the release of new generative AI systems. You’ve almost certainly heard about ChatGPT, a text-based AI chatbot that produces remarkably human-like prose. DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have also drawn attention for their ability to create vibrant and realistic images based on text prompts.

Output from these systems is so uncanny that it has many people asking philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness—and worrying about the economic impact of generative AI on human jobs. But while all of these artificial intelligence creations are undeniably big news, there is arguably less going on beneath the surface than some may assume. We’ll get to some of those big-picture questions in a moment. First, let’s look at what’s going on under the hood.
How does generative AI work?
Generative AI uses machine learning to process a huge amount of visual or textual data, much of which is scraped from the internet, and then determines what things are most likely to appear near other things. Much of the programming work of generative AI goes into creating algorithms that can distinguish the “things” of interest to the AI’s creators—words and sentences in the case of chatbots like ChatGPT, or visual elements for DALL-E. But fundamentally, generative AI creates its output by assessing an enormous corpus of data, then responding to prompts with something that falls within the realm of probability as determined by that corpus.











 
 
 
Autocomplete—when your cell phone or Gmail suggests what the remainder of the word or sentence you’re typing might be—is a low-level form of generative AI. ChatGPT and DALL-E just take the idea to significantly more advanced heights.
What is an AI model?
ChatGPT and DALL-E are interfaces to underlying AI functionality that is known in AI terms as a model. An AI model is a mathematical representation—implemented as an algorithm, or practice—that generates new data that will (hopefully) resemble a set of data you already have on hand. You’ll sometimes see ChatGPT and DALL-E themselves referred to as models; strictly speaking this is incorrect, as ChatGPT is a chatbot that gives users access to several different versions of the underlying GPT model. But in practice, these interfaces are how most people will interact with the models, so don’t be surprised to see the terms used interchangeably.
AI developers assemble a corpus of data of the type that they want their models to generate. This corpus is known as the model’s training set, and the process of developing the model is called training. The GPT models, for instance, were trained on a huge corpus of text scraped from the internet, and the result is that you can feed it natural language queries and it will respond in idiomatic English (or any number of other languages, depending on the input).











 
 
 
AI models treat different characteristics of the data in their training sets as vectors—mathematical structures made up of multiple numbers. Much of the secret sauce underlying these models is their ability to translate real-world information into vectors in a meaningful way, and to determine which vectors are similar to one another in a way that will allow the model to generate output that is similar to, but not identical to, its training set.
There are a number of different types of AI models out there, but keep in mind that the various categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Some models can fit into more than one category.
Probably the AI model type receiving the most public attention today is the large language models, or LLMs. LLMs are based on the concept of a transformer, first introduced in “Attention Is All You Need,” a 2017 paper from Google researchers. A transformer derives meaning from long sequences of text to understand how different words or semantic components might be related to one another, then determines how likely they are to occur in proximity to one another. The GPT models are LLMs, and the T stands for transformer. These transformers are run unsupervised on a vast corpus of natural language text in a process called pretraining (that’s the P in GPT), before being fine-tuned by human beings interacting with the model.











 
 
 
Diffusion is commonly used in generative AI models that produce images or video. In the diffusion process, the model adds noise—randomness, basically—to an image, then slowly removes it iteratively, all the while checking against its training set to attempt to match semantically similar images. Diffusion is at the core of AI models that perform text-to-image magic like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E.
A generative adversarial network, or GAN, is based on a type of reinforcement learning, in which two algorithms compete against one another. One generates text or images based on probabilities derived from a big data set. The other—a discriminative AI—assesses whether that output is real or AI-generated. The generative AI repeatedly tries to “trick” the discriminative AI, automatically adapting to favor outcomes that are successful. Once the generative AI consistently “wins” this competition, the discriminative AI gets fine-tuned by humans and the process begins anew.
One of the most important things to keep in mind here is that, while there is human intervention in the training process, most of the learning and adapting happens automatically. Many, many iterations are required to get the models to the point where they produce interesting results, so automation is essential. The process is quite computationally intensive, and much of the recent explosion in AI capabilities has been driven by advances in GPU computing power and techniques for implementing parallel processing on these chips.











 
 
 
Is generative AI sentient?
The mathematics and coding that go into creating and training generative AI models are quite complex, and well beyond the scope of this article. But if you interact with the models that are the end result of this process, the experience can be decidedly uncanny. You can get DALL-E to produce things that look like real works of art. You can have conversations with ChatGPT that feel like a conversation with another human. Have researchers truly created a thinking machine?
Chris Phipps, a former IBM natural language processing lead who worked on Watson AI products, says no. He describes ChatGPT as a “very good prediction machine.”
It’s very good at predicting what humans will find coherent. It’s not always coherent (it mostly is) but that’s not because ChatGPT “understands.” It’s the opposite: humans who consume the output are really good at making any implicit assumption we need in order to make the output make sense.
Phipps, who’s also a comedy performer, draws a comparison to a common improv game called Mind Meld.











 
 
 
Two people each think of a word, then say it aloud simultaneously—you might say “boot” and I say “tree.” We came up with those words completely independently and at first, they had nothing to do with each other. The next two participants take those two words and try to come up with something they have in common and say that aloud at the same time. The game continues until two participants say the same word.
Maybe two people both say “lumberjack.” It seems like magic, but really it’s that we use our human brains to reason about the input (“boot” and “tree”) and find a connection. We do the work of understanding, not the machine. There’s a lot more of that going on with ChatGPT and DALL-E than people are admitting. ChatGPT can write a story, but we humans do a lot of work to make it make sense.
Testing the limits of computer intelligence
Certain prompts that we can give to these AI models will make Phipps’ point fairly evident. For instance, consider the riddle “What weighs more, a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?” The answer, of course, is that they weigh the same (one pound), even though our instinct or common sense might tell us that the feathers are lighter.
ChatGPT will answer this riddle correctly, and you might assume it does so because it is a coldly logical computer that doesn’t have any “common sense” to trip it up. But that’s not what’s going on under the hood. ChatGPT isn’t logically reasoning out the answer; it’s just generating output based on its predictions of what should follow a question about a pound of feathers and a pound of lead. Since its training set includes a bunch of text explaining the riddle, it assembles a version of that correct answer.
However, if you ask ChatGPT whether two pounds of feathers are heavier than a pound of lead, it will confidently tell you they weigh the same amount, because that’s still the most likely output to a prompt about feathers and lead, based on its training set. It can be fun to tell the AI that it’s wrong and watch it flounder in response; I got it to apologize to me for its mistake and then suggest that two pounds of feathers weigh four times as much as a pound of lead.











 
 
 
Why does AI art have too many fingers?
A notable quirk of AI art is that it often represents people with profoundly weird hands. The “weird hands quirk” is becoming a common indicator that the art was artificially generated. This oddity offers more insight into how generative AI does (and doesn’t) work. Start with the corpus that DALL-E and similar visual generative AI tools are pulling from: pictures of people usually provide a good look at their face but their hands are often partially obscured or shown at odd angles, so you can’t see all the fingers at once. Add to that the fact that hands are structurally complex—they’re notoriously difficult for people, even trained artists, to draw. And one thing that DALL-E isn’t doing is assembling an elaborate 3D model of hands based on the various 2D depictions in its training set. That’s not how it works. DALL-E doesn’t even necessarily know that “hands” is a coherent category of thing to be reasoned about. All it can do is try to predict, based on the images it has, what a similar image might look like. Despite huge amounts of training data, those predictions often fall short.
Phipps speculates that one factor is a lack of negative input.
It mostly trains on positive examples, as far as I know. They didn’t give it a picture of a seven fingered hand and tell it “NO! Bad example of a hand. Don’t do this.” So it predicts the space of the possible, not the space of the impossible. Basically, it was never told to not create a seven fingered hand.
There’s also the factor that these models don’t think of the drawings they’re making as a coherent whole; rather, they assemble a series of components that are likely to be in proximity to one another, as shown by the training data. DALL-E may not know that a hand is supposed to have five fingers, but it does know that a finger is likely to be immediately adjacent to another finger. So, sometimes, it just keeps adding fingers. (You can get the same results with teeth.) In fact, even this description of DALL-E’s process is probably anthropomorphizing it too much; as Phipps says, “I doubt it has even the understanding of a finger. More likely, it is predicting pixel color, and finger-colored pixels tend to be next to other finger-colored pixels.”











 
 
 
Potential negative impacts of generative AI
These examples show you one of the major limitations of generative AI: what those in the industry call hallucinations, which is a perhaps misleading term for output that is, by the standards of humans who use it, false or incorrect. All computer systems occasionally produce mistakes, of course, but these errors are particularly problematic because end users are unlikely to spot them easily: If you are asking a production AI chatbot a question, you generally won’t know the answer yourself. You are also more likely to accept an answer delivered in the confident, fully idiomatic prose that ChatGPT and other models like it produce, even if the information is incorrect.
Even if a generative AI could produce output that’s hallucination-free, there are various potential negative impacts:

Cheap and easy content creation: Hopefully it’s clear by now that ChatGPT and other generative AIs are not real minds capable of creative output or insight. But the truth is that not everything that’s written or drawn needs to be particularly creative. Many research papers at the high school or college undergraduate level only aim to synthesize publicly available data, which makes them a perfect target for generative AI. And the fact that synthetic prose or art can now be produced automatically, at a superhuman scale, may have weird or unforeseen results. Spam artists are already using ChatGPT to write phishing emails, for instance.
Intellectual property: Who owns an AI-generated image or text? If a copyrighted work forms part of an AI’s training set, is the AI “plagiarizing” that work when it generates synthetic data, even if it doesn’t copy it word for word? These are thorny, untested legal questions.
Bias: The content produced by generative AI is entirely determined by the underlying data on which it’s trained. Because that data is produced by humans with all their flaws and biases, the generated results can also be flawed and biased, especially if they operate without human guardrails. OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, put safeguards in the model before opening it to public use that prevent it from doing things like using racial slurs; however, others have claimed that these sorts of safety measures represent their own kind of bias.
Power consumption: In addition to heady philosophical questions, generative AI raises some very practical issues: for one thing, training a generative AI model is hugely compute intensive. This can result in big cloud computing bills for companies trying to get into this space, and ultimately raises the question of whether the increased power consumption—and, ultimately, greenhouse gas emissions—is worth the final result. (We also see this question come up regarding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.)


The downsides of generative AI
For more generative AI’s downsides, read InfoWorld’s Peter Wayner on 10 reasons to worry about generative AI.

Use cases for generative AI
Despite these potential problems, the promise of generative AI is hard to miss. ChatGPT’s ability to extract useful information from huge data sets in response to natural language queries has search giants salivating. Microsoft is testing its own AI chatbot, dubbed “Sydney,” though it’s still in beta and the results have been decidedly mixed.











 
 
 
But Phipps thinks that more specialized types of search are a perfect fit for this technology. “One of my last customers at IBM was a large international shipping company that also had a billion-dollar supply chain consulting side business,” he says.

Their problem was that they couldn’t hire and train entry level supply chain consultants fast enough—they were losing out on business because they couldn’t get simple customer questions answered quickly. We built a chatbot to help entry level consultants search the company’s extensive library of supply chain manuals and presentations that they could turn around to the customer.
If I were to build a solution for that same customer today, just a year after I built the first one, I would 100% use ChatGPT and it would likely be far superior to the one I built. What’s nice about that use case is that there is still an expert human-in-the-loop double-checking the answer. That mitigates a lot of the ethical issues. There is a huge market for those kinds of intelligent search tools meant for experts.

Other potential use cases include:

Code generation: The idea that generative AI might write computer code for us has been bubbling around for years now. It turns out that large language models like ChatGPT can understand programming languages as well as natural spoken languages, and while generative AI probably isn’t going to replace programmers in the immediate future, it can help increase their productivity.
Cheap and easy content creation: As much as this one is a concern (listed above), it’s also an opportunity. The same AI that writes spam emails can write legitimate marketing emails, and there’s been an explosion of AI copywriting startups. Generative AI thrives when it comes to highly structured forms of prose that don’t require much creativity, like resumes and cover letters.
Engineering design: Visual art and natural language have gotten a lot of attention in the generative AI space because they’re easy for ordinary people to grasp. But similar techniques are being used to design everything from microchips to new drugs—and will almost certainly enter the IT architecture design space soon enough.

Conclusion
Generative AI will surely disrupt some industries and will alter—or eliminate—many jobs. Articles like this one will continue to be written by human beings, however, at least for now. CNET recently tried putting generative AI to work writing articles but the effort foundered on a wave of hallucinations. If you’re worried, you may want to get in on the hot new job of tomorrow: AI prompt engineering.

Is Generative AI Stealing From Artists?Adobe Stock

This is a problem that we’ve only had to deal with in the last year – since Generative AI took the world by storm. Tools like ChatGPT can write stories, songs or plays, while Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2 can produce images of anything we can describe to them.

But should the credit (and royalties) go to the person who used the tool to create the art or to the company that built the AI tool? Or to the humans whose original works were used to train the AI in the first place?

PROMOTED
Because generative AI is so new, we simply don’t have an answer to this question yet. But a growing number of artists whose work has been ""scraped"" from the internet to train AI engines are launching legal action against AI companies, which they claim are profiting from their work without giving them credit or payment.

At stake are both compensation and control – with artists understandably believing they should have the right to decide how their work is used and to be financially compensated for its use. So let's take a look at some of the issues involved and some of the arguments that could have an impact on the future roles of both AI and art in society.

The question of who owns the rights to works of art created by AI will go before the courts, as individual artists as well as corporations, challenge the right of AI service providers to use their works without permission.

Artist Eva Toorent is one of the founder members of the European Guild for Artificial Intelligence Regulation (EGAIR). She believes that AI companies should have to obtain artists' opt-in consent before using their work to train algorithms that can create other works.
She recently told the BBC, “If I’m the owner, I should decide what happens to my art.”
Accusations of breach of copyright have also been made by Getty Images, which alleges that 12 million of its proprietary photographs were used by Stability AI, without its permission, to train its Stable Diffusion image generation tool.
It’s hard to deny the crux of their argument, which is that current IP and creative rights legal frameworks designed to protect artists from having their work used without permission or compensation are simply not adequate for the AI era.
As things stand, an artist’s work can simply be used again and again as a generative AI tool pumps out any number of cloned or derivative artworks. ChatGPT, for example, is capable of writing “in the style of” many human authors if instructed to do so – including myself.
Toorent, for example, says she realized the scale of the problem when she visited a gallery displaying AI artwork and was able to identify works that were based on her own style.
From a financial point of view, it seems clear from an ethical perspective that when AI companies stand to make enormous profits from this technology, artists whose talent contributed to their success deserve their cut. OpenAI, for example, attracted investment of $10 billion from Microsoft based on its potential to generate revenue in the future.

Inspiration vs. Plagiarism
There are a number of arguments that AI companies could put forward in order to get around their responsibility to artists.
One might be that training an AI system on human-created art is no different to a human artist taking inspiration from other human artists and going on to make their own art that reflects that influence.
But I would say that this doesn't quite hold up – a human artist taking inspiration from another human will – unless they are an outright plagiarist - add their own human qualities to come up with something that exhibits their own human creativity. A computer algorithm can't do that – it might mash it together with influences from other human artists, but it will never create anything that is truly new or original.
Or it could be argued that generative AI – and the huge potential for driving efficiency and growth that it promises - simply would not be possible without a huge amount of training data. And that obtaining permission for everything they use simply isn’t practical. There are some examples, however, of AI companies attempting to do just that. Adobe has exclusively trained its Firefly generative AI on images that it holds the rights to. It even offers to indemnify customers who use its tools against future claims against them.
Another argument might be that using an artist’s work to train an Ai algorithm doesn’t necessarily cause any harm or loss to that artist or devalue the original work. This argument will become harder to stand up if it transpires that artists are indeed losing out on work to AIs, though!
AI companies might try to go down the road of claiming that compensating everyone whose work is used might be too difficult due to the number of artists involved and the scale of the training datasets. It's possible that technology could provide a solution here, though, with AI and distributed ledger systems like blockchain potentially being used to create automated payment systems in the future.

The Future of Art and AI
I believe that generative AI has the potential to be truly transformative in many positive ways. It can make our day-to-day lives simpler, it can reduce the amount of time we spend on soul-destroying and repetitive tasks, and it can enable us to express creativity without being held back by technological barriers.
The positive impact this could have on society, however, would be offset if it also means creative people have to become accustomed to others taking their work and profiting from it - particularly if it can be used in ways that they may have moral or ethical objections to. Musicians, for example, frequently deny permission for their music to be used at political rallies. As things stand, there would be nothing to stop a politician from using AI to create music ""in the style of"" any particular band and using it as they see fit.
Upcoming legislation and court battles may go some way toward establishing a framework that will allow us to govern and regulate these matters in a more satisfactory way. Certainly, any legislated change is more likely to favor the artists, who are inherently disadvantaged by the current status quo.
But of course, money talks – and we can expect the AI providers – such as global tech giants Google, Microsoft and Meta – to strongly oppose any changes that will inhibit their ability to innovate (and make money).
All that’s certain right now is that as we explore this new intersection of art and technology, we are in uncharted territory. Finding a solution that keeps everyone happy without compromising artistic creativity or technological innovation will involve finding answers to some of the core ethical questions around AI and its place in society. In the long term, this is likely to be a good thing for all of us.

Josh TaylorTue 8 Aug 2023 19.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Aug 2023 19.23 EDTSharePublishers should be able to opt out of having their works mined by generative artificial intelligence systems, according to Google, but the company has not said how such a system would work.In its submission to the Australian government’s review of the regulatory framework around AI, Google said that copyright law should be altered to allow for generative AI systems to scrape the internet.The company has called for Australian policymakers to promote “copyright systems that enable appropriate and fair use of copyrighted content to enable the training of AI models in Australia on a broad and diverse range of data, while supporting workable opt-outs for entities that prefer their data not to be trained in using AI systems”.The call for a fair use exception for AI systems is a view the company has expressed to the Australian government in the past, but the notion of an opt-out option for publishers is a new argument from Google.

When asked how such a system would work, a spokesperson pointed to a recent blog post by Google where the company said it wanted a discussion around creating a community-developed web standard similar to the robots.txt system that allows publishers to opt out of parts of their sites being crawled by search engines.Google’s comments come as news companies such as News Corp have already reportedly been initiating conversations with AI companies about payment for scraping news articles.Dr Kayleen Manwaring, a senior lecturer at UNSW Law and Justice, told Guardian Australia that copyright would be one of the big problems facing generative AI systems in the coming years.“The general rule is that you need millions of data points to be able to produce useful outcomes … which means that there’s going to be copying, which is prima facie a breach of a whole lot of people’s copyright.”Google calls for relaxing of Australia’s copyright laws so AI can mine websites for informationRead moreManwaring said the laws differed in different countries regarding what AI systems are allowed to ingest, but said the notion of an opt-out system would turn copyright on its head.“If you want to reproduce something that’s held by a copyright owner, you have to get their consent, not an opt out type of arrangement … what they’re suggesting is a wholesale revamp of the way that exceptions work.”Toby Murray, associate professor at the University of Melbourne’s computing and information systems school, said Google’s proposal would put the onus on content creators to specify whether AI systems could absorb their content or not, but he indicated existing licensing schemes such as Creative Commons already allowed creators to mark how their works can be used.“They may well be hoping try to create norms early on that say other companies do not to have to pay for this content,” he said.Manwaring said copyright could break down if the problem wasn’t resolved, which would probably be to the detriment of smaller content creators.“I think it’s going to be a big issue that continues, particularly as powerful entities have their copyright ripped off. But at the moment non-powerful entities are very likely getting their copyright infringed left, right and centre, if a lot of people’s suspicions are correct and AI training sets are using a lot of material from the internet.”At Senate estimates in May, the Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked the communications department whether the government was considering a scheme similar to the news media bargaining code to force AI companies to pay for scraping sites.In response in July, the department pointed to the government’s AI regulation consultation, said the government was examining future policy settings for news media as part of its news media assistance program, and was considering a Treasury review of the news media bargaining code.Submissions to the AI consultation closed last week. It is understood hundreds of submissions have been received, but so far none have been published online.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleInternetComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's how to harness it at work.,,,"By Simmone ShahAugust 9, 2023 11:42 AM EDTBefore last year, Jana Soldicic’s understanding of artificial intelligence was mostly limited to what she’d read on the pages of science fiction novels. But in the fall, after getting the chance to use the technology in real life as she played around with the generative AI tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, she got more curious. “I really wanted to know what was behind it. I knew it couldn’t be magic,” Soldicic said. She searched online and found Elements of AI, a self-paced, online course created by MinnaLearn and The University of Helsinki that provides an introduction to artificial intelligence designed for people without a background in technology, and was surprised by how much she enjoyed the course.“I got a little bit addicted to it,” she says. “It gave me a basic understanding of what AI is now and what it could be.” The experience gave her a deeper understanding of how artificial intelligence actually operated—far beyond what she might have learned from messing around with the publicly available programs. Now, she’s bringing that knowledge to her work as an event planner. “I now have more of an understanding what it could do for me, my work, [and] my colleagues, other than just creating texts or pictures.”Soldicic, who is based in Hamburg, Germany, uses AI text-to-image generators like DALL-E to bring adverts and flyers to life with designs that it might have previously been impossible for her to create on her own. “We wanted little squirrels on a tandem bike for one event [flyer], and you could never find such a picture in real life. I put in ‘two squirrels on the tandem bike’ [on DALL-E] and there were so many different and cool results. I didn't have to find somebody to realize my idea, I could just do it at home.” Read More: Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the Pandemic—And Robots and AI Are Replacing Them Faster Than EverArtificial intelligence is expected to drastically change the way most of us work, but it’s a shift many are unprepared for. Amid all the chatter around AI, there is increasing concern about the threat it may pose to workers, ranging from screenwriters and background actors to lawyers. A recent Goldman Sachs report found that as many as 300 million jobs around the world could be affected by AI and automation, but a Boston Consulting Group survey found that adoption has so far been largely limited to the C-suite. According to the June survey, 80% of executives said they used generative AI regularly, while only 20% of frontline employees reported the same. Meanwhile, a study earlier this year by human resources analytics firm Revelio Labs found that the jobs most threatened by AI are largely held by women. Read More: The Writers Strike Is Taking a Stand on AIIn the face of this change, people like Soldicic are trying to skill up in AI and bring what they learn to the workplace—and many courses are emerging to help them do it. “It's clear that this is one of those moments where people are really trying to get a handle on what's happening,” says Dan Brodnitz Global Head of Strategy at LinkedIn Learning. “This is about the opportunity for AI to improve our jobs and to augment our professional lives. To navigate that, people are going to and already [are] super motivated to invest in themselves.” AI and the future of workExperts say AI will likely transform the workplace, though it is developing so rapidly that we may not know all the ways it could change how we will be working in the future. A recent survey by McKinsey estimated that generative AI tools could theoretically automate work that takes as much as 70% of an employee's time and that AI could replace half of workers' daily work activities by 2045– around a decade earlier than their previous estimates. The shift stands to impact knowledge-based workers, in jobs that have traditionally had higher wages and educational requirements, according to McKinsey. However, experts say the shift will likely mean people will be required to use tools such as generative AI in the same way we use search engines and word processors. “AI is not just about automating jobs and replacing people,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. By far the biggest benefits are having AI work with humans and help them be more productive.” Read More: The AI Job That Pays Up to $335K—and You Don't Need a Computer Engineering BackgroundBrynjolfsson, along with researchers Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond, authored a study in which generative AI was used by over 5,000 customer support agents at a call center, and found that AI tools boosted workers productivity, reduced attrition, and were especially helpful for early-career workers. Through machine learning, the generative AI systems were able to use pattern recognition to identify successes and failures in customer service approaches. “It listened in on a whole bunch of transcripts and calls, and could see the patterns that turned out well the ones that didn't turn out well,” says Brynjolfsson. “It captured that tacit knowledge and passed it on to the less experienced workers.”Brynjolfsson said the AI system was able to recommend specific features to solve a customer’s problems, or a tone of voice or phrasing that might work better. “Maybe no human had ever written down those rules before but the AI system, by looking at literally millions of transcripts, was able to pick up on these patterns.”AI tools are likely going to impact tasks that are “routine, predictable, or standardized,” according to Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology and author of I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes Us Unique. Though it might be tempting to brush off the sudden rise of AI tools as just a fad, Chamorro-Premuzic says it’s important to become as familiar as possible with the tools, as they are likely to become ubiquitous. “These are tools that everybody will use, and if you're the only person not even trying it out or not using it, you might actually suffer,” he says, comparing such resistance to deciding not to use Google’s search engine.Read More: The AI Arms Race Is Changing EverythingAnd even if employers don’t expect workers to be experts in AI now, being comfortable with AI tools and how they operate could potentially provide a leg up as tools begin to become more commonplace in the workplace. “When employers know that an employee or an applicant has experience with AI, that could potentially be more appealing to them, even if they're not a tech company,” says Amber Clayton, senior director of knowledge center operations at the Society for Human Resource Management. “I think many employers are looking at this right now as an opportunity to be more efficient.”Training up on AIVille Valtonen, MinnaLearn’s CEO and co-founder, believes truly understanding AI is only possible by going  back to the basics. MinnaLearn’s Elements of AI course teaches students the patterns and probabilities that make artificial intelligence what it is, so they have the confidence to adapt alongside the technology. “The AI field moves so fast. There are hundreds of tools coming daily. So we think it's really useful that people learn the high level things first, and then they can apply that in the world. That’s something you can use for much longer than a specific tool.” The course is free and requires no advanced math or programing experience. “We wanted to create a course for that 99% of people who can’t code and still wanted to understand how AI was being used in the world around them,” says Valtonen. More than one million people from 170 countries have signed up to take MinnaLearn’s online Elements of AI course. The company also offers a paid version of the program tailored towards businesses and it plans to launch a new chapter on generative AI this summer. Read More: Column: AI Is Not an Arms RaceThere are also more tailored courses for workers and jobseekers looking to learn specific skills. Learners looking to understand the tools that might prove useful in particular roles or sectors could turn to LinkedIn Learning—LinkedIn’s educational arm— for example. It offers more than 100 courses covering artificial intelligence, on both the theoretical and practical fronts. These range from “Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Generative AI” to “Artificial Intelligence for Business Leaders.” Pricing for an individual LinkedIn Learning subscription begins at $19.99 per month, with the option to pay for individual courses. The courses are broken down into bite-sized chapters, many of which come in at under five minutes. “We've designed it so you can use the time you have available to learn what you need to learn,” Brodnitz says. “It's all designed to give people a lot of control.” Alphabet also offers a range of courses through the Google Cloud Skills Boost platform.Art Munin decided to take some courses on AI after his employer, a tech company that helps colleges and universities with enrollment management, began deploying an AI tool of its own. “After learning about our AI tool, I was not satisfied just trusting that it worked. I wanted to know how it worked,” he told TIME in an email. Munin has taken several LinkedIn Learning courses, including “Deep Learning: Getting Started” and “Applied Machine Learning: Foundations.” As conversations around artificial intelligence and its use cases begin to enter public conversation, he says the course has allowed him to better discern fact from fiction when it comes to the impacts and concerns around AI. “There is a gigantic difference between AI being used in military missile defense, for example, and AI supporting the recruitment of college students. These courses have helped me with a language and knowledge base to navigate these complex conversations and advocate for the reasonable use of AI in my field of work.” How to make AI work for you While there has been some legitimate concern about AI coming for many of our jobs, there are ways workers can use AI to help them improve at their jobs. Consider the ways AI systems might impact your specific field, and how it can help make your workflow more efficient, suggests Amanda Johnstone, CEO of the technology research and development lab, Transhuman. For example, when trying to brainstorm creative lab experiments that meet specific educational standards, a teacher can ask ChatGPT to help, rather than generating ideas on their own, she says.It can even be as simple as asking the tool to  draft an email or social media post. “Try not to make it too technical,” Johnstone says. “You can have AI create 50 social media posts for you. And then spend half a day timing them to post [rather than] the next three months or you can have artificial intelligence draft the next ten newsletters for you.”Johnstone advises against approaching the prompt like a Google search. Instead, be specific in how you prompt the tool. “When you're prompting AI or working with AI, you need to think ‘what do I really want the end result to be?’; Do I want it to create a newsletter for our target audience bringing in real time data?’ Think about the end outcome and reverse engineer,” she says.For those interested in experimenting with generative AI tools, experts say that a great first step is to simply take the time to play around with them—especially while there are versions of platforms like ChatGPT that are free to access. “Have fun with it, test it in your own way, thinking about the problems that you might have,” Chamorro-Premuzic says. “It's definitely trial and error.”Read More: The Workers Behind AI Rarely See Its Rewards. This Indian Startup Wants to Fix ThatFor some learners,  the benefits of using AI at work has been a pleasant surprise. Damian Wolfgram, a California-based product manager who took Minnalearn’s Elements of AI course, says that outsourcing more mundane tasks like agenda-setting or double-checking a draft’s grammar has drastically increased his productivity. “I'm able to get 80% of whatever that task is done in just 20% of the time,” he says. “I'm the benefactor of that, because it frees up my bandwidth to do other things.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Dean Gillian Lester on AI and the Future of Work






How much is artificial intelligence—and the algorithms it generates—changing the experience and nature of work? What does that mean for employees’ privacy and the future of the legal profession?












Gillian Lester, Dean and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Law, is an employment law scholar whose interests include income inequality, public finance policy, workplace law, and the design of social insurance laws and regulations. Here, she shares her insights and ideas about the ways artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world of work.
Will the exponential growth of AI transform workplaces and the lives of employees in ways similar to past technological advances?
Absolutely. It’s a technological paradigm shift, like the Industrial Revolution. The deep interplay between technology and the nature of work is a reality that goes back to the printing press and, before that, the invention of tools—the march of human progress. Work is always in a dynamic relationship with social and technological change, including automation. There are some jobs that used to take multiple people to do and that now, a single machine can do without human assistance.
Will there be a wholesale loss of jobs?
That question is more complicated. Some jobs will disappear in the short run, for sure—some estimates are that one-quarter of existing jobs in the U.S. and Europe could be replaced entirely by AI, with others being affected to varying degrees. In the longer run, AI will certainly create jobs as well, as innovation begets new forms of production, challenges, and opportunities. The balance between these forces remains to be seen.
What about privacy and AI? Employers are using AI to monitor workers. Amazon surveils warehouse employees with cameras and the scanners they use to track inventory. Many corporations have access to their employees’ emails. Aren’t those examples of an invasion of privacy? 
Surveillance in the workplace is not a new phenomenon. There have always been bosses watching workers to make sure they’re moving the widgets along the assembly line. And there’s nothing per se unlawful about a manager monitoring a worker to measure their productivity and see that the task at hand is getting done. That said, there are more and less humane ways to monitor workers, and it will be important, as AI makes surveillance easier, to attend closely to basic protections of dignity and civil liberties of workers.
What are the legal protections for public and private sector workers in terms of privacy? 
For workers in the public sector, the Constitution doesn’t have a section devoted purely to privacy—although to the extent workplace privacy enjoys any constitutional protection at all, much of it grows out of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on search and seizure.
For those who don’t work in government, some combination of tort law and state statutes offer a patchwork of privacy protections. So, for example, there might be legislation preventing an employer from monitoring worker productivity by using a hidden camera that also records any conversations the employees might have. As detailed and extensive as legislative and common law privacy protections might appear to be, the devil is in the details. It is often held that so long as a worker has consented to monitoring, surveillance, or a search, the employer is within its right to engage in the practice without legal liability. But that consent can be sweeping. A worker might sign something when they fill out their employment application that states that they hereby consent to whatever monitoring happens in the future—and they might not even remember signing the form. But are they really going to sue for unconscionability of the contract? And if you work at Amazon, and that’s the big local employer, and you need your job, you may not have that much choice about consent to that monitoring. 
What types of workers are most vulnerable to surveillance? 
Workers with less nuanced or complex tasks are more likely to be monitored, and that will tend to track a class hierarchy in the workplace. Workers in the lowest-wage jobs are most likely to be subject to automated monitoring techniques that may be done through invisible electronic means. Workers who are the least advantaged may face the greatest burden of this type of monitoring. Gig workers—the Uber drivers, the TaskRabbit workers—may be using their own phones, but the platform they work with is monitoring them; it’s just wired into the system, and that’s part of the deal. But those gig workers are also independent contractors and not defined as employees for purposes of laws that might exist to protect employees and require, for example, their consent. So, gig workers beware: You may be subject to a great deal of surveillance enabled by the technology platform you need to do your job.
Switching to the legal profession, many law students and young lawyers are worried that AI and ChatGPT will take away their jobs. Is that a reasonable fear?
AI makes certain tasks that primarily junior lawyers have done in the past much easier. ChatGPT can write a reasonably competent memorandum that will cite cases and synthesize precedents in a particular area, and produce a first-draft level narrative account in an area of law. It can also be useful in taking complicated language and breaking it down into simpler language. But there are absolute hazards associated with overdependence on ChatGPT. It can invent cases that don’t actually exist, and it can make assertions that are overly confident. You really need to check all citations and make sure everything is correct as well as balanced. When you’re a lawyer, if you get things wrong, the consequences are very serious. 
What are some unique lawyering skills that AI can’t replace?
When you’re training to be a lawyer, a big piece of what you’re learning is to exercise nuanced judgment in hard situations where the answers aren’t obvious. And bots are not so good at looking at all circumstances; what they know is what they see in the database. But what they don’t know is the preferences of the client, the risks of different strategies in light of the idiosyncrasies of the parties, and so on. A bot can’t “read the room” in a negotiation or a courtroom. These are real limitations that bring into sharp relief the distinctiveness of human judgment, as well as the interpersonal, relational side of lawyering.
There’s so much fear about AI. What do you see as the upside?
This new technology will be a game changer in the advancement of human knowledge, creating untold new possibilities, new innovations, and new frontiers of human activity.

  Machine learning helped Waseem Alshikh plow through textbooks in college. Now he’s putting generative AI to work, creating content for hundreds of companies.
Born and raised in Syria, Alshikh spoke no English, but he was fluent in software, a talent that served him well when he arrived at college in Lebanon.
“The first day they gave me a stack of textbooks, each one a thousand pages thick, and all of it in English,” he recalled.
So, he wrote a program — a crude but effective statistical classifier that summarized the books — then he studied the summaries.
From Concept to Company
In 2014, he shared his story with May Habib, an entrepreneur he met while working in Dubai. They agreed to create a startup that could help marketing departments — which are always pressured to do more with less — use machine learning to quickly create copy for their web pages, blogs, ads and more.
“Initially, the tech was not there, until transformer models were announced — that was something we could build on,” said Alshikh, the startup’s CTO.
Writer co-founders Habib, CEO, and Alshikh, CTO.
“We found a few engineers and spent almost six months building our first model, a neural network that barely worked and had about 128 million parameters,” an often-used measure of an AI model’s capability.
Along the way, the young company won some business, changed its name to Writer and connected with NVIDIA.
A Startup Accelerated
“Once we got introduced to NVIDIA NeMo, we were able to build industrial-strength models with three, then 20 and now 40 billion parameters, and we’re still scaling,” he said.
NeMo is an application framework that helps companies curate their training datasets, build and customize large language models (LLMs), and run them in production at scale. Organizations everywhere from Korea to Sweden are using it to customize LLMs for their local languages and industries.
“Before NeMo, it took us four and a half months to build a new billion-parameter model. Now we can do it in 16 days — this is mind blowing,” Alshikh said.
Models Make Opportunities
In the first six months of this year, the startup’s team of fewer than 20 AI engineers used NeMo to develop 10 models, each with 30 billion parameters or more.
That translates into big opportunities. Hundreds of businesses now use Writer’s models that NeMo customized for finance, healthcare, retail and other vertical markets.
Writer’s Recap tool creates written summaries from audio recordings of an interview or event.
The startup’s customer list includes household names like Deloitte, L’Oreal, Intuit, Uber and many Fortune 500 companies.
Writer’s success with NeMo is just the start of the story. Dozens of other companies have already downloaded NeMo.
The software will be available soon for anyone to use. It’s part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, full-stack software optimized to accelerate generative AI workloads and backed by enterprise-grade support, security and application programming interface stability.
Writer offers a full-stack platform for enterprise users.
A Trillion API Calls a Month
Some customers run Writer’s models on their own systems or cloud services. Others ask Writer to host the models, or they use Writer’s API.
“Our cloud infrastructure, managed basically by two people, hosts a trillion API calls a month — we’re generating 90,000 words a second,” Alshikh said. “We’re delivering high-quality models that compete with products from companies with larger teams and bigger budgets.”
NVIDIA NeMo supports an end-to-end flow for generative AI from data curation to inference.
Writer uses the Triton Inference Server that’s packaged with NeMo to run models in production for its customers. Alshikh reports that Triton, used by many companies running LLMs, enables lower latency and greater throughput than alternative programs.
“This means you can run a service for $20,000, instead of $100,000, so we can invest more in building meaningful features,” he said.
A Wide Horizon
Writer is also a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that nurtures cutting-edge startups. “Thanks to Inception, we got early access to NeMo and some amazing people who guided us through the process of finding and using the tools we need,” he said.
Now that Writer’s text products are getting traction, Alshikh, who splits his time between homes in Florida and California, is searching the horizon for what’s next. In today’s broad frontier of generative AI, he sees opportunities in images, audio, video, 3D — maybe all of the above.
“We see multimodality as the future,” he said.

AI cybersecurity pioneer, BlackBerry, calls for caution with consumer-grade Generative AI tools in the workplace 
WATERLOO, ON, Aug. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today released new research revealing that 75% of organizations worldwide are currently implementing or considering bans on ChatGPT and other Generative AI applications within the workplace. 61% of those deploying or considering bans said the measures are intended as long term or permanent, with risks to data security, privacy, and corporate reputation driving decisions to take action. 83% also voiced concerns that unsecured apps pose a cybersecurity threat to their corporate IT environment.
Despite their inclination towards outright bans, the majority also recognize the opportunity for Generative AI applications in the workplace to increase efficiency (55%) and innovation (52%), and enhance creativity (51%). When it comes to using Generative AI tools for cybersecurity defense, the majority of respondents (81%) remained in favour, suggesting that IT decision makers don't want to be caught flat-footed and give cyber criminals the upper hand.
Shishir Singh, Chief Technology Officer, Cybersecurity, at BlackBerry calls for organizations to take a cautious yet dynamic approach to Generative AI applications in the workplace, saying: ""Banning Generative AI applications in the workplace can mean a wealth of potential business benefits are quashed. At BlackBerry, the pioneer of AI cybersecurity, we are innovating with enterprise-grade Generative AI, keeping a steady focus on value over hype, and are exercising caution with unsecured consumer Generative AI tools. As platforms mature and regulations take effect, flexibility could be introduced into organizational policies. The key will be in having the right tools in place for visibility, monitoring and management of applications used in the workplace.""
The research also revealed that although 80% of IT decision makers agree that organizations are within their rights to control the applications that employees use for business purposes, 74% think that such bans signal ""excessive control"" over corporate and BYO devices.
For CIO's and CISO's, unified endpoint management (UEM) provides the required controls over which applications can connect to the corporate environment, ensuring enterprise security together with user privacy by containerizing corporate data. At a time when consumer-grade Generative AI and other unregulated applications are unsecure, an enterprise-grade UEM solution, such as BlackBerry UEM, is critical to organizations.
Join Shishir Singh, CTO, Cybersecurity at BlackBerry, for a BlackBerry LIVE broadcast exploring highlights of the report on August 10, 2023, at 12 p.m. ET. Follow BlackBerry on LinkedIn for updates on how to join the event.

The coming AI era will require new human skillsgetty

When ChatGPT made its debut in November 2022, it changed the world forever. Not only did it become the fastest-growing consumer software application of all time, but it might also be the first wave of artificial intelligence-powered tools that promise to change how humans work, now and into the future. Some have even gone so far as to say that ChatGPT is leading the way for a fourth industrial revolution.

That’s why the majority of HR managers (58%) who participated in a recent survey by TalentLMS agree that the adoption of AI at work is increasing job insecurity among employees—especially those from older generations.

PROMOTED
As a result, 43% of HR executives think their company will face a skills gap because of the rise of AI. That explains why HR managers predict that AI literacy will be a must-have skill for employees, regardless of whether they work in technical or non-technical roles. At the same time, just 14% of employees report receiving any AI training so far.

“To remain relevant all employees should be able to understand, interact with, and leverage AI technologies effectively,” says Thanos Papangelis, CEO and co-founder of Epignosis, the company that builds the TalentLMS learning management system.

An opportunity—and a threat


1/1

The generative power of what ChatGPT can do—producing reams of text in just seconds—truly boggles the mind. It’s no surprise then that just about every organization out there has begun experimenting with ways to leverage that power in one way or another, including automating restaurant drive-throughs.
A separate 2023 survey conducted by TalentLMS on the topic of AI tools like ChatGPT found that 76% of employees estimate that most daily tasks will be done with the help of AI over time.
Not surprisingly, nearly half of the respondents to that same survey (44%) said they fear that AI will replace them in the future.
“AI is a threat and an opportunity at the same time,” says Papangelis.
To adapt to this coming AI era, Papangelis says that employees should embrace the new technology, understanding that being able to use AI systems will help them remain competitive in the fast-evolving job market, adapt to changing work dynamics, and seize emerging roles that require AI integration.

Unlocking AI with professional skills
One of the most interesting and counterintuitive findings from the TalentLMS research is that the skills employees will need to thrive in the AI era go beyond coding or tech skills.
“Our survey showed that even in an era when artificial intelligence will dominate the world of work, soft skills will remain important,” says Papangelis. “In most cases, strong soft skills will help employees stand out and excel in the AI-driven workplace, while AI systems and tools will mainly take over processes and tasks that are repetitive.”
I have long preferred the term “professional” skills over “soft” skills, but I get Papangelis’s point—especially when you look at the three skills areas that HR managers say they will prioritize when looking to hire employees in the AI era:


Interpersonal skills: Active listening, managing people, creating synergies;
Cognitive skills: Problem-solving, creativity, originality, imagination, ability to learn;
Self-management skills: Adaptability, decision-making and ownership, and planning.


When I asked Papangelis about why professional skills like these will matter when applied to AI, he told me that AI is not a substitute for skills like empathy, emotional intelligence, creativity and critical thinking.
“Professional and interpersonal skills play a crucial role in collaboration, problem-solving, and innovation, which are areas where AI often falls short,” he says. “Additionally, as AI becomes more integrated into the workplace, employees will need to work alongside AI systems, making effective communication and teamwork essential for achieving optimal results.”
In other words, it’s your humanity that will make you all the more valuable in the age of AI.

Why it’s humans who will make AI work
Despite AI's impressive ability to process vast amounts of data and provide insights, it still lacks human-like cognitive abilities in certain areas.
“Human imagination, creativity, and problem-solving are essential skills for innovation, thinking outside the box, and tackling complex, non-routine challenges,:” says Papangelis. “AI will work with humans side by side and augment human decision-making. But it is still dependent on our input and prompts to function optimally, particularly in areas requiring creative problem-solving and imagination—especially for complex tasks.”
That’s why the most essential interpersonal skill according to HR managers is the ability to listen—a universal skill that is broadly applicable regardless of job role.
“Even in an AI-dominated world attentive listening builds bonds of understanding between people and leads to an environment of respect, enriched with diverse opinions,” says Papangelis. “Furthermore, AI implementation often involves collaborative efforts. Effectively communicating ideas, understanding the needs of various stakeholders, and managing teams are all essential for successful AI projects.”
Papangelis also notes that AI applications in areas such as customer service rely on understanding and addressing human preferences, emotions and concerns.
“Organizations can benefit from this skill on multiple fronts, from having exceptional teamwork and smooth workflows to building meaningful workplaces,” he says.

Room for skepticism
While it’s easy to be amazed by what AI tools like ChatGPT can do, it’s just as important to recognize that it remains far from perfect. For instance, AI algorithms are designed based on data inputs, which may include biases or inaccuracies. That’s why it remains crucial for people to remain skeptical in a healthy way and to fact-check the results that AI tools produce.
“Fact-checking the results, as well as mastering the art of AI prompts is definitely something that employees should get proper training on in order to be able to harness the full power of AI and avoid its risks,” says Papangelis.
I fully agree that the path forward with AI is not to avoid it, but to find ways to lean into it. That’s how we can truly turn AI from a threat into an opportunity—for everyone.

Artificial intelligence is changing everything. Just ask the CEOs of public companies who can’t seem to stop bringing up the topic on earnings calls. Or ask one CEO, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, who just elevated an AI-oriented exec to his “S-team,” overseeing AI across Amazon. Clearly, AI is a big deal. But what about you, a developer working for one of those businesses? What’s the impact on you?
If you’re worried AI will take your job, relax. It won’t. If you’re worried that AI will write all your code for you while you sip mai tais on a beach, well, it won’t do that, either. As O’Reilly Media Vice President Mike Loukides argues, ChatGPT will absolutely change the way software development is done, but not as dramatically as we sometimes think, and generative AI won’t necessarily make coding easier. Rather, like all technological advances, generative AI enables developers to focus their time more effectively.

[ Coding with AI: Tips and best practices from developers ]

Let’s talk numbers
As Loukides highlights, maybe 20% of a developer’s time is spent writing code. That number might be generous. Given the mix of meetings and other things that crowd a developer’s ability to focus, some peg actual coding at 10%. With this in mind, a coding assistant that promises to magically remove a developer’s coding would not help all that much. Much better would be an AI assistant that promises to show up for all your meetings. (Please? I’d pay lots of money for that.)











 
 
 
However much time a developer spends writing code, AI coding assistants such as Amazon CodeWhisperer or GitHub Copilot can help you use that time much more effectively, as I’ve written. As developer Simon Willison suggests, “ChatGPT (and GitHub Copilot) save me an enormous amount of ‘figuring things out’ time. For everything from writing a for loop in Bash to remembering how to make a cross-domain CORS request in JavaScript—I don’t need to even look things up anymore, I can just prompt it and get the right answer 80% of the time.”

Of course, to know when the answer is right and when it’s wrong, you have to be a fairly experienced developer, as I’ve called out. Less experienced developers won’t know when the syntax or suggestions are simply wrong. But generative AI can make a good developer into a great developer—or at least a much more productive developer. Or not. As Loukides argues, “If 20% of your time is spent coding, and AI-based code generation makes you 50% more efficient, then you’re really only getting about 10% of your time back.” That surplus time could be spent on understanding the user needs so that your coding time is spent on the highest impact code.
But developers do other stuff, too. So far we’ve saved a small percentage of time but haven’t fixed any of the other issues that developers handle. Security. Testing and debugging. Design. Even at the most optimistic projections about AI’s impact on coding, developers are looking at full employment for many years to come.











 
 
 
But maybe the nature of their programming will change.
If it looks like programming and smells like programming
If you’ve spent any time with generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, whether for writing code or editing pictures or something else, you know how important the prompt is. The more detailed the prompt, the better the output. People have started to adorn their LinkedIn profiles with “prompt engineer” job titles. Though a bit meaningless today, they soon won’t be. As Loukides captures, “Writing a detailed prompt really is just a different form of programming. You’re still telling a computer what you want it to do, step by step.”
For developers, it means that in order to save some coding time, you’re going to need to invest time in understanding the underlying large language models that you’re prompting. As Microsoft Research developer Victor Dibia notes, “In my experience, optimizing your prompts (being specific, placement of important instructions, wording, etc.) to work for smaller models does lead to more reliable output behavior for larger models.”











 
 
 
With this step into prompt engineering, we may have entered the next phase of programming. As Loukides points out, “It’s a step towards a new kind of programming that doesn’t require a formally defined syntax or semantics. Programming without virtual punch cards. Programming that doesn’t require you to spend half your time looking up the names and parameters of library functions that you’ve forgotten about.” This is programming, every bit as much as the Java code you wrote last year. But different.
As a developer, you’ve got a long and fulfilling career ahead of you. Generative AI doesn’t eliminate your job, though it’s very likely going to change it. We can call some of this change “prompt engineering,” but it’s still programming, and it still requires smart developers. No one gets a pass from the robot overlords of this AI-fueled future.

All of this is in order to improve its ability to leverage AI in three ways: To do better work for clients, to improve its own operations, and to transform the way it works for clients.

Recently, I caught up once again with Accenture’s Paul Daugherty. Five years after the publication of his book Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI, I took the chance to ask him about the developments we’ve seen since its publication. We also talked about how the arrival of generative tools like ChatGPT will affect the ongoing AI-driven transformation of enterprises.

Generative AI – the game changer

“Over the course of my career,” says Daugherty, “I’ve been really amazed by technology four times.”
PROMOTED
The first was the Lisa – the early Apple computer that popularized the idea of a personal computer with a graphical user interface. The second was browsing the internet for the first time. The third was the arrival of the smartphone.
“The fourth was about 18 months ago when I started to see the progress in …specifically large language models (LLMs).
“The pace of advancement was becoming breathtaking, and some of the capabilities … to understand language and the generative capabilities to create content. Not just diagnose and evaluate or predict …really is game-changing in terms of the impact on business.""

Amazing though it undoubtedly can be, Paul still sees businesses struggling to work out how and where to apply it. Often it isn’t that they have problems identifying use cases – there are plenty of them. Rather, stumbling blocks are around understanding which ones are likely to help them achieve business goals and where investment should be prioritized.

This is backed up by recent stats collated by Accenture that shows that 98 percent of executives believe generative AI will be essential to their strategy going forward.
“So that shows you the level of interest and the impact that executives see this having on their business,"" says Daugherty.

How Accenture is Using AI 
Potential applications fit into one of the three categories mentioned at the start of the article. Further to that, they are broken down into five types of applications: creating, automating, advising, protecting and coding.
Accenture’s digital media business, Song, is a flagship for its use of creative, generative AI. Song is involved with innovating in content creation by understanding the plethora of new tools that are available. Client use cases it is involved with range from marketing and outreach to drafting regulatory documents for life sciences companies.
It has also assisted banking customers with automating back-office processes using GPT-3.5 and implemented its advisory capabilities in customer services operations.
The “protect” implementations are showcased by a worker safety solution created for energy companies. This involves pulling together real-time information on what is happening in a facility in order to improve safety outcomes.
And coding refers to using the super-human ability of LLMs to generate computer code, which enables software developers to become more efficient and productive.
Altogether, Daugherty tells me, Accenture is involved with helping over 100 of its clients implement generative AI projects.
Investing in Capabilities 
Not all of the $3 billion in investment that Accenture has just announced it will make in its AI and data capabilities will go on generative AI.
“Generative AI is clearly game-changing for all the reasons I've talked about – but data and AI broadly have tremendous opportunities for companies,"" says Daugherty.
“It’s not even just about AI – it’s about data and how you pull together the data foundations, the modern data platforms and the cloud-based platform to drive the opportunity.”
As well as doubling the size of the data and AI team, Accenture has developed a tool called AI Navigator, designed to help its clients find their way through the baffling and ever-expanding range of enterprise AI opportunities open to them.
What models does a business need to work with, and how can they be used? Is it best to just use an existing API? Does data need fine-tuning or customizing? How can prompt engineering be used? ""That's what the AI navigator for Enterprise will help our clients with,"" says Daugherty.
Responsible AI
We understand that algorithmic bias can create societal inequalities and decision-making done by opaque black box machinery, incomprehensible to most humans, has the potential to cause harm.
Then there’s the potential for a breach of privacy related to computer vision applications such as facial recognition.
These issues (and many more) have made us aware of the importance of pursuing ""responsible AI.""
Daugherty tells me that – as far as he is aware, at least - Accenture was the first organization to establish a formal compliance program around responsible AI.
“It’s even more critical with generative AI … we’re working with a lot of stakeholders, regulators and governments, as well as our clients, to establish … responsible AI capabilities.”
This “responsible AI framework” ensures that questions can be asked and answered around matters of bias, fairness, privacy and security relating to any AI projects.
On top of that is a “diagnostic tool” used to evaluate the risk level of any AI-related work.
Daugherty says, ""There are certain types of AI categorized as high risk, versus … different levels of risk … and do you know, in your organization, where are you using what might be considered high-risk AI?
“I would submit most organizations really wouldn’t have an idea right now.”
Part of the answer lies in having a solid and reliable inventory of every application within an organization that involves AI. This means that each one can be individually risk assessed and monitored for outcomes as stakeholders build their own understanding of what has to be done to ensure AI is used responsibly.
The Future?
Where do Daugherty and Accenture see this all leading? And what other technologies will they be putting to work alongside AI to accelerate this wave of digital transformation?
Accenture’s 2023 technology vision document – titled When Atoms Meet Bits – highlights digital identity, trust and transparency, next-generation AI and what it refers to as “science technology” as the biggest trends to watch.
And while some believe the concept has gone off the boil, Daugherty is happy to report that he believes “The metaverse is alive and well.”
“The idea of making the two-dimensional digital world three-dimensional is real. There's a lot of activity happening around the metaverse; witness Apple’s new headset launch.”
As well as generative AI, next-generation AI covers a range of frameworks and concepts, including ""common sense AI"" and explainable AI.
Then there are next-generation computing architectures, including quantum computing and biocomputing. The first of which is already being implemented in Accenture client deliveries.
And after that? Only the final frontier: “There are lots of interesting advances happening in space technology, both what happens in space … satellite communications … experiments in space. And also how you can use information from space [like] low-Earth orbit satellites for transformative applications back on Earth.”

The rapid adoption of generative AI models after the launch of ChatGPT promises to radically change how enterprises do business and interact with customers and suppliers.








Generative AI can support a wide range of business needs, such as writing marketing content, improving customer service, generating source code for software applications and producing business reporting. The numerous benefits of generative AI tools -- especially reduced costs and enhanced work speed and quality -- have encouraged enterprises and individuals alike to test such tools' capabilities in their work.
However, as with any emerging technology, rapid implementation could be risky, opening the door to threat actors to exploit organizations' vulnerabilities. In today's complex IT threat landscape, using generative AI tools without careful consideration could result in catastrophic consequences for enterprises.

Security risks associated with using generative AI in enterprise environments
Understanding the potential risks of using generative AI in an enterprise context is crucial to benefiting from this technology while maintaining regulatory compliance and avoiding security breaches. Keep the following risks in mind when planning a generative AI deployment.
1. Employees exposing sensitive work information
In enterprise environments, users should be cautious about any piece of data they share with others -- including ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatbots.
A noticeable recent incident is the data leakage caused by Samsung employees who shared sensitive data with ChatGPT. Engineers at Samsung uploaded confidential source code to the ChatGPT model, in addition to using the service to create meeting notes and summarize business reports containing sensitive work-related information.



The Samsung case is just one highly publicized example of leaking sensitive information to AI-powered chatbots. Many other companies and employees using generative AI tools could make similar mistakes by revealing sensitive work information, such as internal code, copyrighted materials, trade secrets, personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential business information.
OpenAI's standard policy for ChatGPT is to keep users' records for 30 days to monitor for possible abuse, even if a user chooses to turn off chat history. For companies that integrate ChatGPT into their business processes, this means employees' ChatGPT accounts might contain sensitive information. Thus, a threat actor who successfully compromises employees' ChatGPT accounts could potentially access any sensitive data included in those users' queries and the AI's responses.
2. Security vulnerabilities in AI tools
Like any other software, generative AI tools themselves can contain vulnerabilities that expose companies to cyberthreats.
In March, for example, OpenAI took ChatGPT offline to fix a bug in the chatbot's open source library that had enabled some users to see chat titles from another active user's chat history. It was also possible to see the first message of a newly created conversation in someone else's chat history if both users were active around the same time.
In addition, the same bug revealed the payment-related information of 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers who were active during a specific time period, including the customers' first and last name, email address, and last four credit card number digits. In another recent incident, the cyberintelligence firm Group-IB found more than 100,000 compromised ChatGPT accounts advertised for sale on dark net marketplaces.
3. Data poisoning and theft
Generative AI tools must be fed with massive amounts of data to work properly. This training data comes from various sources, many of which are publicly available on the internet -- and, in some cases, could include an enterprise's previous interactions with clients.
In a data poisoning attack, threat actors could manipulate the pre-training phase of the AI model's development. By injecting malicious information into the training data set, adversaries could influence the model's prediction behavior down the line, leading to false or otherwise harmful responses.
Another data-related risk involves threat actors stealing the data set used to train a generative AI model. Without sufficient encryption and controls around data access, any sensitive information contained in a model's training data could become visible to attackers who obtain the data set.
4. Breaching compliance obligations
When using AI-powered chatbots in enterprise environments, IT leaders should evaluate the following risks related to violating relevant regulations:

Incorrect responses. AI-powered tools sometimes give false or superficial answers. Exposing customers to misleading information could give rise to legal liability in addition to negatively affecting the enterprise's reputation.
Data leakage. Employees could share sensitive work information, including customers' PII or protected health information (PHI), during conversations with an AI chatbot. This, in turn, could violate regulatory standards such as GDPR, PCI DSS and HIPAA, risking fines and legal action.
Bias. AI models' responses sometimes demonstrate bias on the basis of race, gender or other protected characteristics, which could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Breaching intellectual property and copyright laws. AI-powered tools are trained on massive amounts of data and are typically unable to accurately provide specific sources for their responses. Some of that training data might include copyrighted materials, such as books, magazines and academic journals. Using AI output based on copyrighted works without citation could subject enterprises to legal fines.
Laws concerning chatbot use. Many enterprises have begun integrating ChatGPT and other generative AI tools into their applications, with some using AI-powered chatbots to answer their customers' inquiries immediately. But doing so without informing customers in advance risks penalties under statutes such as California's bot disclosure law.
Data privacy. Some enterprises might want to develop their own generative AI models, a process likely to involve collecting large amounts of training data. If threat actors successfully breach enterprise IT infrastructure and gain unauthorized access to training data, the resulting exposure of sensitive information contained in compromised data sets could violate data privacy laws.




Besides security, generative AI also poses challenges such as algorithmic bias, hallucinations and technical complexity.







Best practices for security when using generative AI tools in the enterprise
To address the numerous security risks associated with generative AI, enterprises should keep the following strategies in mind when implementing generative AI tools.
1. Classify, anonymize and encrypt data before building or integrating generative AI
Enterprises should classify their data before feeding it to chatbots or using it to train generative AI models. Determine which data is acceptable for those use cases, and do not share any other information with AI systems.
Likewise, anonymize sensitive data in training data sets to avoid revealing sensitive information. Encrypt data sets for AI models and all connections to them, and protect the organization's most sensitive data with robust security policies and controls.
2. Train employees on generative AI security risks and create internal usage policies
Employee training is the most critical protective measure to mitigate the risk of generative AI-related cyber attacks. To implement generative AI responsibly, organizations must educate employees about the risks associated with using this technology.
Organizations can set guidelines for generative AI use at work by developing a security and acceptable use policy. Although specifics will vary from organization to organization, a general best practice is to require human oversight. Don't automatically trust content generated by AI; humans should review and edit everything AI tools create.
AI use and security policies should also specifically mention what data can be included in queries to chatbots and what is not permitted. For example, developers should never feed intellectual property, copyrighted materials, PII or PHI into AI tools.
3. Vet generative AI tools for security
Conduct security audits and regular penetration testing exercises against generative AI tools to identify security vulnerabilities before deploying them into production.
Security teams can also train AI tools to recognize and withstand attack attempts by feeding them with examples of cyber attacks. This reduces the likelihood that a hacker will successfully exploit the organization's AI systems.
4. Govern employees' access to sensitive work data
Apply the principle of least privilege within enterprise environments, enabling only authorized personnel to access AI training data sets and the underlying IT infrastructure.
Using an identity and access management tool can help centralize and control employees' access credentials and rights. Likewise, implementing multifactor authentication can help safeguard AI systems and data access.
5. Ensure underlying networks and infrastructure are secure
Deploy AI systems on a dedicated network segment. Using a separate network segment with restricted access to host AI tools enhances both security and availability.
For organizations hosting AI tools in the cloud, select a reputable cloud provider that implements strict security controls and has valid compliance certifications. Ensure all connections to and from cloud infrastructure are encrypted.
6. Keep an eye on compliance requirements, including regularly auditing vendors
Compliance regulations are constantly evolving, and with the uptick in enterprise AI adoption, organizations will likely see more compliance requirements related to generative AI technology.
Enterprises should closely monitor compliance regulations affecting their industry for any changes related to the use of AI systems. As part of this process, when using AI tools from a third-party vendor, regularly review the vendor's security controls and vulnerability assessments. This helps ensure any security weaknesses in the vendor's systems do not traverse into the enterprise's IT environment.

Three-quarters of global businesses are currently implementing or considering bans on ChatGPT and other generative AI applications within the workplace, with risks to data security, privacy, and corporate reputation driving decisions to act. That’s according to new research from Blackberry which found that 61% of companies deploying/considering generative AI bans view the steps long term or permanent. Blackberry’s findings draw from a survey of 2,000 IT decision makers across North America (USA and Canada), Europe (UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands), Japan, and Australia.
The data come a week after the publication of the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs which details the key security and safety challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), which many generative AI chatbots are built on. It also comes as organizations are facing up to the reality of needing to implement specific generative AI security policies amid the skyrocketing growth and adoption of the technology within businesses. One key question on many people’s minds is the extent to which generative AI is ushering in a new era of shadow IT.
Security concerns driving generative AI bans
Despite the majority of the IT decision makers surveyed recognizing the opportunity for generative AI applications in the workplace to increase efficiency (55%) and innovation (52%), and enhance creativity (51%), 83% voiced concerns that unsecured generative AI apps pose a cybersecurity threat to their corporate IT environment, driving inclination towards complete bans, according to Blackberry. What’s more, while 81% of respondents are in favor of using generative AI tools for cybersecurity defense to avoid being caught flat-footed by cyber criminals, 80% believe organizations are within their rights to control the applications that employees use for business purposes.
 
 
 













 
 

Organizations should take a cautious, yet dynamic approach to generative AI applications in the workplace, said Shishir Singh, CTO cybersecurity at BlackBerry. “Banning generative AI applications in the workplace can mean a wealth of potential business benefits are quashed. As platforms mature and regulations take effect, flexibility could be introduced into organizational policies. The key will be in having the right tools in place for visibility, monitoring and management of applications used in the workplace.”

CISOs must develop generative AI policies that tackle risk without stifling innovation
Appropriate, business-aligned security policies controlling the use of generative AI should be high on the CISO’s agenda right now. The challenge for CISOs is to develop cybersecurity policies that not only embrace and support business adoption of this technology but effectively address risk without stifling innovation. Any who think they can put this off for a year or two to see how generative AI develops, hoping to retrofit a security policy appropriate for generative AI’s pervasiveness later down the line, should carefully consider what happened with shadow IT. Businesses were slow off the mark from a security policy perspective to deal with personal technology when it began being used for corporate activities.

Imagine, if you will, a time when writing code was an arduous task, limited only to those with years of education and experience. A time when, much like a painter creating a masterpiece, each line of code had to be meticulously crafted and curated. Then, like a magic spell, generative AI appeared on the scene and turned the world of programming on its head, as I describe in my book on this topic. If you're finding it hard to imagine, then hold tight, because that's precisely the journey you will undertake based on my interview with Sam McKay, the Founder and CEO of Enterprise DNA.


The Generative AI Revolution
Generative AI has been a game-changer in the realm of programming, especially with the advent of low-code/no-code platforms. Imagine if you could tell a genie to build you an app, and voila! It's done. That's what generative AI feels like. It translates high-level instructions into functional code, turning anyone into a developer, even without extensive coding knowledge. It's like having a universal translator, but instead of languages, it translates abstract ideas into tangible applications.

However, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. As liberating as this sounds, it's crucial to remember that foundational coding skills are still an essential piece of the puzzle. While generative AI can bake the cake, it often needs a human hand to add the icing and sprinkles.

PROMOTED
The Evolution and Breakthroughs in Generative AI
Generative AI has not always been this advanced. Think of it as a superhero origin story, starting from a humble beginning and growing stronger with each challenge. The turning point was the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a brainchild of Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues. GANs are like an artist and a critic locked in an eternal battle, producing incredibly high-quality synthetic data.

Another significant leap was the introduction of transformer-based models, such as the GPT series. Think of these models as diligent students, absorbing sequential data and producing impressive language generation capabilities. From GPT-1 to GPT-4, these models have grown in strength and power, enabling them to generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

Generative AI has not just stayed within the confines of academia and research but has made a significant impact across industries and society. It's like a modern-day renaissance, influencing art, creativity, healthcare, virtual reality, gaming, language translation, and assistive technologies. It's akin to having an invisible workforce, creating new content, generating synthetic medical images, translating languages, and even making virtual assistants sound more natural.
Training a generative AI model is akin to training a marathon runner. It requires vast resources, time, and a careful balance to avoid overfitting (where the model memorizes the training data and fails to generalize to new data). Overcoming these challenges is a bit like training a pet; it requires patience, consistency, and a lot of treats (or in this case, computational power and time).
Despite its superpowers, generative AI has its kryptonite. It can sometimes suffer from mode collapse (repetitive and limited output), lack of control over the output, and inference errors. However, with continuous research and development, these issues can be addressed, much like a software update fixing the bugs in a system.
The Ethical Maze of Generative AI
With great power comes great responsibility, and generative AI is no exception. Misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, and content moderation are just a few ethical considerations that we need to navigate carefully.
And that’s short-term concerns. In the long term, experts highlight that AI poses a serious risk of human extinction. It's much like walking a tightrope, balancing the benefits of generative AI while ensuring its responsible use.
The Future Implications
Generative AI will have a profound impact on society. Art and creativity will be revolutionized, with artists collaborating with AI to create new art forms. The entertainment industry will offer personalized and immersive experiences, tailoring content to individual preferences. Brands will use AI for personalized marketing, creating a more targeted interaction with consumers. The job market will see the emergence of new roles, focusing on high-level skills, such as system design, architecture, debugging, and problem-solving.
Generative AI's coding ability will automate repetitive tasks, increase productivity, and enhance collaboration between humans and AI, creating a symbiotic relationship that will redefine the programming landscape. However, programmers will need to navigate ethical considerations and focus on high-level skills to leverage the full potential of this technology. And we need to address extinction risks.
So buckle up, dear readers. We are on the cusp of a generative AI revolution, and it's going to be a thrilling ride.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been in the news, most recently concerning the Hollywood actors’ strike about the potential impact of AI in filmmaking.
Another story involved AI being used to replicate the voice of the Canadian rapper Drake in a track that went viral.
These stories raise questions about performers’ rights, and also lead people to wonder: will AI replace artists?
These questions are also germane given recent advances in generative artificial intelligence 
trained on a vast amount of existing images that have been used to create new images based only on user-provided prompts.

I am a composer who has used creative AI in my music and sound practice for almost two decades. My creative practice and research has focused upon the potential for a collaborative relationship between artists and AI. From my perspective, while we are in a time of disruption where many artists will need to renegotiate terms of their labour in a new technological context, there are also opportunities for different forms of collaboration.
AI-generated images
AI-generated high-quality images range from concept art for video games to photorealistic works. 
Examples of generative AI visual art include fantastical images: 



Image created by the author using dreamstudio.ai using the prompt: ‘Astronaut playing a violin while riding a blue horse in a field of sunflowers fantasy art.’ Notice the floating violin bow and incorrect right hand position.


Works can also mimic the style of existing artists. 



Image created by the author in dreamstudio.ai using the prompt: ‘Young person holding a bullhorn and a red flower in the style of Banksy.’


The freely available online systems used to create the above images are examples of the progress made in artificial intelligence being used to generate novel material. Perhaps the biggest advance is these systems’ ease of use: they are readily usable and accessible to the general public.
Will AI replace artists?
On one hand, the answer to whether AI will replace artists is no. 
Generative AI is a powerful tool that can expand the possibilities of art making and will still require the guiding hand of a human artist. As with any new technology, some creative processes will become both easier and less time-consuming with AI. 
For example, an artist interested in generating visual imagery can suggest a prompt and the AI produces it immediately. Instead of taking hours or days to experiment with an idea, it may take minutes or even seconds.  
The current image-producing systems still require human interaction through both a text prompt and the curation of its output, itself an artistic act. 
On the other hand, these limitations will soon be overcome: human-provided prompts can easily be replaced by generated prompts (which some systems already allow for). 
Research into creative AI has already produced systems that can evaluate their own output through aesthetic judgements (rather than only mimicing its data set).   
As such, there is the very real potential that an endless supply of fully AI-produced artwork will constitute much of the imagery we see online and flood the market. 
Reasons to hope
For many practising artists there are reasons to hope. 
Creative AI can allow some artists greater time and energy to explore artistic avenues, thereby producing not just more art, but potentially more paradigm-shifting art. 
Artist and scholar Philip Galanter, who explores art theory bridging the gap between the cultures of science and the humanities, has defined “generative art” as “any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.”
Generative art-making practices have been around for decades (arguably much longer). Human interaction with these systems can produce truly stunning work.

Current systems can only produce mashups of existing data. While the output may be novel in that a given output may never have existed previously, its esthetic value may be limited. 
AI, labour and creativity
The music industry has been driven by style-replicating processes for decades, in which an artist may produce a genuinely novel work and then others fill the available space around it with variations of that work’s style. It takes true creativity to produce something outside the existing paradigm and AI is nowhere near that stage. 
However, it won’t be long before those producers merely creating the same formulaic songs will be in direct competition with AIs that can do so much more efficiently. 
The generative AI used to recreate Drake’s voice was trained on many copyrighted songs featuring his voice. In such cases, music industry figures argue 
this broke copyright law. In this case, an artist used AI as a tool to create something new; it is doubtful anyone would argue it was the AI itself that was being creative. 
Apart from the legal and ethical question of using his voice, Drake can be considered as being replaced labour. 
In the case of Hollywood actors in danger of having their likenesses reproduced in a similar fashion by an AI, it will be directors and producers that are the creative artists, and the actors the displaced labour.  
In my own work, I have never viewed AI as replacing anyone. Instead, I consider it an alternate creative voice trained on my own esthetics. I have gone out of my way to continue to work with human artists who interact with my systems. 


One movement from “A Walk to Meryton,” the latest work involving generative AI by the author.

My latest album places the musebots, my creative AI, before my own name, but still clearly credits the individual musicians with which I   — and my AI system — collaborated.
In this work, the AI generated the entire composition, including selecting all the individual sounds. My role (after the musebots were coded) was to listen to the final work and decide whether I should ask my human musical collaborators to play with it.
AI is nothing without humans
We are on the precipice of systems being able to generate entire songs. Many of the roadblocks to such generation have been, or are close to being, solved. 
This includes successfully separating the different elements of a song — the melody, the bass, the beat — to allow them to be analyzed individually. Given this information, AI can then begin to understand how music is put together structurally, a major step beyond the current generative models that use simplistic building block methods for creating data.
But like the image-generating systems, AI music will be a mashup of what is already out there. It will require the collaboration of human artists to point it in novel directions and determine whether the output is even worthwhile. 
AI will not replace artists in the future; instead, they will be needed more than ever.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the U.S. labor market, and a couple of new studies have found certain trends in the workplace that could shape the future of work in America. NBC New York’s Linda Gaudino reports.



What to KnowThe U.S. labor market saw 8.6 occupational shifts with most people departing food services, in-person sales and office support positions, according to McKinsey Global Institute.The findings state health, STEM, transportation, warehousing, business and legal professionals are projected to be growing under AI, while office support, customer service, sales, production work and food services are the worst impacted by AI acceleration.About a fifth of U.S. workers are considered to have ""high exposure"" to AI, based on Pew Research Center data.
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the U.S. labor market with advanced language capabilities and automation to enhance work options, but a couple of recent studies have found certain trends in the workplace that could shape the future of work in America.
During the COVID pandemic, from 2019 to 2022, the labor market saw 8.6 occupational shifts with most people leaving food services, in-person sales and office support for other occupations, according to a new report by McKinsey Global Institute.

The study suggests that positions that declined and flourished during the pandemic will keep that trend moving forward. The data expects an additional 12 million occupational shifts may be possible in the next seven years. 
Health, STEM, transportation, warehousing, business and legal professionals are projected to be growing under AI, while office support, customer service, sales, production work and food services are the worst impacted by AI acceleration, based on the research.
Jobs remaining strong with a slower growth trajectory are creatives, art management, property maintenance, education, builders, community service, agriculture and mechanics.

""It's definitely a very powerful tool. Not sure how it's going to affect the future, but definitely something to keep in mind,"" Martha Yin, an investment banker in New York City, said to NBC New York.

The survey found that workers are willing to pivot career paths, while tighter labor markets encourage companies to hire broadly. Position shifts in food and customer services accounted for 2.5 million changes in occupation. 
Fast food counter workers, cooks, waitstaff, retail sales, cashiers and hairstylists are just a few of the most common jobs that people decided to leave to pursue something else.
""No, I don't think AI is going to be that intense. Before it [AI] takes over police officers, I think that's going to take a lot more time because I think that's a little too crazy,"" said Jonathon Cruz, a New Jersey state trooper.
AI tools can identify data patterns, write code, design and strategize with or without human help. With this technology, about 30% of hours currently worked could be automated by 2030, based on the data.
The research stated workers earning less than $40,000 per year are up to 14 times more likely to change occupations by the end of the decade than higher-paid earners.
While the McKinsey Global Institute projects certain occupational shifts due to AI, another recent analysis shows U.S. workers are hopeful concerning the AI impacts.
About a fifth of U.S. workers are considered to have ""high exposure"" to AI, particularly workers who identify as women, Asian, college-educated and high-paid workers, according to the Pew Research Center.
The top industries with the most exposure to AI are science, technology, finance, insurance, real estate and public administration. The industries with the least exposure are managerial, administrative and food services, based on Pew Research.
The Pew survey showed that workers more likely to see AI exposure do not necessarily feel their jobs are at risk. About one-in-four workers in professional, scientific and technical services believe AI will help more than hurt them, with about 20% of workers in government, public administration and military polling the same.
Yin and fellow investment banker, Niko Molina, both shared with NBC New York that they do not feel threatened by AI in their employment, especially as banking relies on building client relationships.
In contrast, four-in-ten workers in hospitality, services and arts are not sure about the influence of AI on their jobs.
""I think it [AI] can change the future, but it could also have a negative impact on the public,"" William Lee, a sneaker business owner, told News 4.

Live00:0000:0000:00 Aug 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney (DIS.N), opens new tab has created a task force to study artificial intelligence and how it can be applied across the entertainment conglomerate, even as Hollywood writers and actors battle to limit the industry's exploitation of the technology.Launched earlier this year, before the Hollywood writers' strike, the group is looking to develop AI applications in-house as well as form partnerships with startups, three sources told Reuters.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAs evidence of its interest, Disney has 11 current job openings seeking candidates with expertise in artificial intelligence or machine learning.The positions touch virtually every corner of the company - from Walt Disney Studios to the company's theme parks and engineering group, Walt Disney Imagineering, to Disney-branded television and the advertising team, which is looking to build a ""next-generation"" AI-powered ad system, according to the job ad descriptions.Advertisement · Scroll to continueA Disney spokesperson declined to comment.One of the sources, an internal advocate who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said legacy media companies like Disney must either figure out AI or risk obsolescence.This supporter sees AI as one tool to help control the soaring costs of movie and television production, which can swell to $300 million for a major film release like ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" or ""The Little Mermaid."" Such budgets require equally massive box office returns simply to break even. Cost savings would be realized over time, the person said.For its parks business, AI could enhance customer support or create novel interactions, said the second source as well as a former Disney Imagineer, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The former Imagineer pointed to Project Kiwi, which used machine-learning techniques to create Baby Groot, a small, free-roaming robot that mimics the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" character's movements and personality.Machine learning, the branch of AI that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed, informs its vision systems, so it is able to recognize and navigate objects in its environment. Someday, Baby Groot will interact with guests, the former Imagineer said.AI has become a powder keg in Hollywood, where writers and actors view it as an existential threat to jobs. It is a central issue in contract negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of America, both of which are on strike.Disney has been careful about how it discusses AI in public. The visual effects supervisors who worked on the latest ""Indiana Jones"" movie emphasized the painstaking labors of more than 100 artists who spent three years seeking to ""de-age"" Harrison Ford so that the octogenarian actor could appear as his younger self in the early minutes of the film.SAG-AFTRA actors and Writers Guild of America (WGA) writers walk the picket line during their ongoing strike outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, U.S., July 31, 2023. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab'STEAMBOAT WILLIE'Disney has invested in technological innovation since its earliest days. In 1928 it debuted ""Steamboat Willie"", the first cartoon to feature a synchronized soundtrack. It now holds more than 4,000 patents with applications in theme parks, films and merchandise, according to a search of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records.Bob Iger, now in his second stint as Disney's chief executive, made the embrace of technology one of his three priorities when he was first named CEO in 2005.Three years later, the company announced a major research and development initiative with top technology universities around the world, funding labs at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It closed the Pittsburgh lab in 2018.Disney's U.S. research group has developed a mixed-reality technology called ""Magic Bench"" that allows people to share a space with a virtual character on screen, without need for special glasses.In Switzerland, Disney Research has been exploring AI, machine learning and visual computing, according to its website. It has spent the last decade creating ""digital humans"" that it describes as ""indistinguishable"" from their corporeal counterparts, or fantasy characters ""puppeteered"" by actors.This technology is used to augment digital effects, not replace human actors, according to a source familiar with the matter.Its Medusa performance capture system has been used to reconstruct actors' faces without using traditional motion-capture techniques, and this technology has been used in more than 40 films, including Marvel Entertainment's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""""AI research at Disney goes back a very long time and revolves around all the things you see being discussed today: Can we have something that helps us make movies, games, or conversational robots inside theme parks that people can talk to?"" said one executive who has worked with Disney.Hao Li, CEO and co-founder of Pinscreen, a Los Angeles-based company that creates AI-driven virtual avatars, said he worked on multiple research papers with Disney's lab while studying in Zurich from 2006 to 2010.""They basically do research on anything based on performance capture of humans, creating digital faces,"" said Li, a former research lead at Disney-owned Industrial Light & Magic. ""Some of these techniques will be adopted by Disney entities.""Disney Imagineering last year unveiled the company's first initiatives in an AI-driven character experience, the D3-09 cabin droid in the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser hotel, which answered questions on a video screen and learned and changed based on conversations with guests.""Not only is she a great character to interact with and always available in your cabin, which I think is very cool, behind the scenes, it's a very cool piece of technology,"" Imagineering executive Scott Trowbridge said at the time.The Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.

Nearly all executives (96%) recognise that generative AI is a key topic in the boardroom, with the majority confirming that their leadership is a strong advocate. As per the report, organisations see generative AI as an opportunity to drive revenues. Despite apparent risks, such as copyright infringement or cybersecurity, 74% of executives believe that the benefits posed by generative AI outweigh the associated concerns.

They believe that its integration will lead to an 8% increase in sales and a 7% decrease in costs. Additionally,  those surveyed indicated that they  expect to see a 9% improvement in customer engagement and satisfaction, and operational efficiency.""Generative AI is a transformational force for innovation in organisations, accelerating industry-specific use cases to create value, and it's no surprise that it's already at the top of the agenda of virtually every large organisation,"" comments Franck Greverie, Chief Portfolio Officer and Group Executive Board Member at Capgemini. ""While generative AI can enable numerous benefits for businesses and employees alike, adopting a human-centric approach while scaling the technology and implementing necessary guidelines will be key to fostering trust in the workplace. As businesses accelerate their generative AI journeys, they must prioritise implementing it sustainably across the organisation.""The high-tech industry is leading the way in generative AI integrationExecutives in the high-tech industry are the ones most convinced (84%) that the overall impact of generative AI will be positive. Nearly 70% of executives in that industry said their organisations have generative AI pilots underway, and 18% state that they have already implemented generative AI across some locations or business functions.

As AI technologies continue to evolve at a rapid pace, HR leaders may want to begin using or increase their department's use of AI to take advantage of some of its potential benefits, like reducing user error and saving time. However, HR leaders should be aware of some of AI's disadvantages before incorporating it into their department's processes.







While AI use isn't a new concept in HR, machine learning and generative AI have brought it to the front of the cultural conversation. Generative AI can, for example, help HR employees answer employee questions. But HR leaders should consider problems like bias in AI, as these problems can lead to major consequences.
Here are some key points to consider.

The pros of using AI in HR
Some of the benefits of using AI in HR involve HR professionals using it to help them with their work and AI removing the possibility of human error.
1. AI can save time
AI can potentially offer significant time savings for HR departments by eliminating routine tasks.

Julia Lamm

For example, generative AI can assist with tasks such as fielding routine employee inquiries, said Julia Lamm, workforce transformation partner at PwC, an international professional services firm headquartered in London. A generative AI engine can answer questions about vacation allocation or the process involved when an individual is applying for a leave of absence. HR employees could also potentially use generative AI to create the internal announcements they regularly distribute throughout their organization's communications channels.
AI can also potentially help with more knowledge-intensive projects, such as training content development.
One of Lamm's clients used a generative AI tool to develop a production script for a training video about ethics and compliance.
""It was a really solid first draft that they said they might have spent a couple of weeks working on [otherwise],"" she said.
2. AI can reduce errors
HR employees may make mistakes when entering data. Using AI can help solve that problem.

Alexander Kriebitz

Factors that compromise how humans perform their jobs, such as fatigue, don't affect AI, said Alexander Kriebitz, researcher at the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.
""For those tasks that can be replicated [and] that are very standardized, AI appears to be better than human beings,"" Kriebitz said.


The cons of using AI in HR
HR leaders should be aware of some of the drawbacks of using AI in HR as well. Using AI without knowing about potential consequences can lead to employee distrust and organizational legal risk.
1. AI can be biased
AI bias during the hiring process is one of the biggest drawbacks of using AI in HR. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced this past May that employers using AI hiring tools are liable for potential discriminatory hiring practices.

Paul Starkman

HR leaders must ensure they're adopting products that don't expose their organizations to risk, said Paul Starkman, employment attorney with Clark Hill PLC, a law firm located in Detroit.
""They're going to be responsible for their vendors' decisions and choices, [as well as for] the products that they choose to use in their organization,"" he said.
HR leaders should ask certain questions during the software purchasing process to ensure they're aware of any potential bias.
Company leaders should develop ethical procurement standards for vetting vendors, including those selling AI-driven technology, Kriebitz said. These standards would require vendors to explain how their AI models work in detail. HR leaders should also test AI technology first when deploying it.
""After the test, try to understand -- with your own data, not data provided by the external party -- how the system functions and whether there have been cases of discrimination,"" Kriebitz said.
2. Employees don't trust AI accuracy
While AI may be capable of responding to routine employee inquiries, employees may not be confident that they're receiving accurate information.
Lamm's clients say their HR employees' work has not been reduced by chatbots because employees still follow up with HR to confirm the information.
""I don't think the trust is really there yet,"" Lamm said.
3. Employees and job candidates distrust AI use
Companies must clearly communicate about how they're using AI so their employees -- and, potentially, job candidates -- feel comfortable with organizational operations.
Companies must share the fact that they're using AI, its company uses and the oversight from humans, Starkman said.
""If people think that it's all Big Brother and that we're being managed by machines versus people, that's going to make the employment situation much more adversarial,"" Starkman said.
Transparency is the key.
""[If the AI use isn't transparent, then] it's going to cause more problems than it might be worth,"" Starkman said.

The Big Picture


 The Walt Disney Company has formed a dedicated team to explore the potential of AI in its entertainment empire, despite ongoing strikes by Hollywood writers and actors concerned about AI's influence. 
 Disney has created 11 job positions focused on AI and machine learning, indicating a desire to expand its use of AI across divisions such as studios, theme parks, and advertising. 
 The strikes have caused disruptions in Disney projects, including the production of
 Deadpool 3
, 
Thunderbolts
, and 
Blade
, as unions and studios remain at an impasse over fair treatment, equitable pay, and respect for workers' contributions. 






 The Walt Disney Company has initiated a dedicated team to delve into the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential applications throughout its expansive entertainment empire. This comes amidst ongoing strikes involving the Hollywood writers and actors who aim to limit what they see as the technology's dangerous and growing influence within the industry.

Actors Who Had Major Glow Ups





 Commencing earlier this year, prior to the Hollywood writers' strike, this task force is actively exploring internal AI development avenues and forging partnerships with emerging startups. The company's desire to expand into the world of AI, and by design – costcutting, presents 11 open job positions that specifically seek individuals proficient in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  

 These job opportunities span a wide spectrum within Disney, encompassing divisions ranging from Walt Disney Studios and the inventive unit Walt Disney Imagineering to Disney's theme parks, television ventures, and the advertising sector. It's worth noting that the ad team appears to be pursuing the ability to craft an AI-powered ad system termed ""next-generation,"" as detailed in the descriptions of these job postings.

 Disney's growing interest in expanding their use of A.I. comes hot on the heels of the news that the company was hiring for an R&D Imagineering position that requires expertise in generative AI, indicating their unfortunate interests in seeing how far they can take the potential of AI tools. The company came under fire for debuting their limited series Secret Invasion and trumpeting the opening titles, which had been created using generative AI, in the midst of a strike designed to highlight the fact that AI was taking jobs from skilled workers. 







 How Will The Strike End? 
 As the entertainment industry explores the integration of artificial intelligence into production processes, a parallel struggle is unfolding as actors and writers advocate for their rights. The long-standing issue of inadequate residuals for movies and TV shows persists, offering unacceptable compensation to the very individuals who contributed to the triumph of these projects. The impact of the strike has been significant, causing disruptions in various projects at Disney, such as the production of Deadpool 3, Thunderbolts and Blade. 

 As the impasse continues, both studios and unions find themselves entrenched in the same positions established before the breakdown of pre-strike negotiations. This unfortunately prevailing status quo is continuing to cast a vast shadow of uncertainty across the entertainment industry as the workers strike to earn what is rightfully theirs—fair treatment, equitable pay, and respect.

",,,,"Artificial Intelligence/Tech/AppsQuizlet’s AI study tools think I’m a bad studentQuizlet’s AI study tools think I’m a bad student / Students now use AI to study, but how will I, a non-student, fare?By  Emilia David, a reporter who covers AI. Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy. Aug 9, 2023, 4:55 PM EDTShare this story3 Comments / 3 NewQuizlet, a tool that helps personalize studying for students, recently released a set of new AI-powered features. Quizlet is one of the many educational platforms embracing generative AI to facilitate learning, despite consternation from teachers when ChatGPT first burst into the scene. I no longer have assignments to read, but to do my job, I have to read tons of news articles, reports, and research papers fairly quickly. I wondered: can I use Quizlet to make my job easier and test how much of my beat I actually understand?Oh man, it didn’t turn out well for me. Quizlet released several AI-powered tools on August 8th. Memory Score schedules reviews and tracks scores to help users remember the material. Quick Summary takes key concepts from readings. Brain Beats turn flashcards into songs — a far cry from the mnemonics I used as a kid to remember the order of operations. And Q Chat lets students talk to a ChatGPT-powered tutor. Before adding generative AI, users had to manually add questions to custom flashcards and quick quizzes. Quizlet Plus users, who pay $7.99 a month or $35.99 a year, have unlimited access to the new features. Quizlet gave me early access to one of the features called Magic Notes. (Sadly, I didn’t get to try the song generator.) Magic Notes lets users upload or copy-paste text, and Quizlet summarizes it, then offers an outline, sample essay questions, creates flashcards, and even puts together a practice test. I decided to plug a story by The Verge’s Makena Kelly into Magic Notes. This story is frequently open in my browser as I tend to link back to it often, which means I’ve read it more times than I can count. After pasting the story, Magic Notes generated a bullet-point summary of the article’s main ideas. It offered me a sample essay prompt to discuss the importance of AI companies investing in AI safety, and then there was the practice test. I got a solid D on the practice test, answering nine of the 15 questions correctly. In my defense, some of these questions were nonsensical. Quizlet offered me a list of terms with options for “definitions” and asked me to say whether they matched. (Terms and definitions were sometimes but not always phrased in the form of a question, like on Jeopardy.) For this one, it asked if the definition “Open-sourcing it for researchers and most commercial use” matched the term “What is watermarking in the context of AI-generated content.” Okay, odd phrasing because that’s not how I would define watermarking. The correct answer was: “What did Meta announce about their language model Llama 2?” I’m sorry, but what?!Quizlet’s Magic Notes in action.It did get some questions to mostly make sense. Quizlet prompted me to define AI voice assistants. The answer choices were “What is the importance of responsibility in AI,” “What are measures related to cybersecurity,” “What is the concern regarding enforcement of AI commitments,” and “Which type of AI-generated content would not be covered by watermarking.” The correct answer is the last one. This one was a gimme.Next, I put in one of my stories, thinking I should do better because I wrote the thing, and I feel like I understand what I wrote. Somehow, Quizlet believed the phrase “fostering trust” was an actual term I was looking to define in the story. It isn’t. I simply needed a synonym for “building trust.” Quizlet does say the technology isn’t foolproof and will occasionally return incorrect or problematic answers, so make sure to continue guiding your child while using the features. Quizlet built its new AI features with various generative models, including GPT-3.5. Students were some of the first to embrace generative AI and ChatGPT. This prompted panic from educators who worried kids used the tools to cheat. School districts banned access to ChatGPT. In May, New York rescinded its ban. Since then, generative AI has become more ubiquitous. Like every other sector out there, education-focused platforms want to take advantage. Quizlet is not the only kid-focused startup exploring generative AI for students. Smartphone for Kids maker Pinwheel announced PinwheelGPT, basically ChatGPT for kids with less complex vocabulary. Inside Higher Education said AI in education will grow to a $25 billion industry by 2030 from $2 billion in 2022. Magic Notes did do a pretty good job summarizing the article, and maybe a news story isn’t the best way to test out a study guide. Some news articles summarize an event or talk about company plans; not everything is defined. News assumes a reader already knows the context stories talk about.So I put in Shakespeare Sonnet 116, mainly because I studied it in college a decade ago. Magic Notes did better, and more importantly, I did better in the practice quiz. The questions made sense. For example, who is the author of the sonnet? William Shakespeare, of course. What are tempests in the sonnet? Obstacles or turbulent times. But the quiz still didn’t do well with ambiguity. It asked me to choose the best definition to match with the phrase “Love as an unchanging and unwavering force.” The two choices were “What is the meaning of ‘marriage of true minds’?” and “What is the central theme of Sonnet 116?” I said it was the marriage of two minds; the correct answer is the latter. That is a valid answer, even though I can argue why my choice was right. But I am a literature major and believe literature should be open to interpretation.Quizlet is a tool for students to get an overview of the topics they discuss in class so they have a quicker grasp of the material before a lecture. It is not a place to discuss the choice of nature and time as imagery and relate it to Shakespeare’s life. These questions were fine for that — but, in general, pretty basic.I played with Quizlet’s Magic Notes for a few days and kept pasting in different texts, from research paper abstracts to opinion pieces, to varying degrees of success. It isn’t perfect, though I could see how students can find these AI-powered study tools helpful. It breaks down concepts and saves time when reading denser material. Then again, does no one use CliffsNotes anymore?Comments3 Comments / 3 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeNew chips, new screens, new gadgets | The Vergecast

That’s according to a new survey from BlackBerry, which found that 75% of organizations across the globe are considering or implementing workplace bans on ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies.There are two main reasons that organizations are in favor of bans:Privacy and security: 67% of respondents cited privacy and security as reasons for bans on ChatGPT and generative AI. Generative AI requires data in order to produce results, and companies are concerned employees may upload sensitive company data to the chatbot—or bots like it—thus putting proprietary information at risk.Reputational risk: The second reason is the risk to corporate reputation, which 57% of respondents cited. The survey did not elaborate on how organizations feel that ChatGPT use could hurt their reputations, but one possibility is if clients know the company is using generative AI, why should the client stick with the company and not just use generative AI tools themselves to produce the work that the company is currently producing for them?When it comes to pushing for ChatGPT and generative AI bans in the workplace, a CEO is not the most likely person to do so. Instead, the push for a ban is most likely to originate from the organization’s chief technology officer, chief information officer, or chief security officer—in other words, people who may have more technical knowledge than the CEO. Here’s how all corporate leaders compare when looking at who implements the bans most often:CIO/CTO/CSO/IT: 72%CEO: 48%Legal Compliance: 40%CFO/Finance: 36%HR: 32%Interestingly, while 80% of IT decision-makers think organizations have it within their right to declare bans on ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies, 74% of those polled also feel that total bans are a sign of “excessive control” over BYO and corporate devices.advertisementThe survey was conducted between June and July 2023 and involved 2,000 decision-makers in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia.

For example, the following video&#039;s description references that.In the description of the above livestream is a line that says:&amp;quot;Voice&#65306;Anti-Entropy AI&amp;quot;On a related note, Tears of Themis also used AI to replace Jiang Guangtao&#039;s voice when the voice actor was cooperating with police on an investigation at the time.

Read to know some of the applications of AI that are impacting industries worldwide.,AI is on top of the business world and making some severe impact. Read to know some of the applications of AI that are impacting industries worldwide.,,," A common goal among companies in today’s data-driven world is to become smarter—to know where the market opportunities lie, where supply chain logjams are and where process improvements can be found. Data science has been the fuel behind this trend, and now data science is itself becoming smarter. Thanks to astonishing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and its sub-segments machine learning and deep learning, companies are achieving new levels of efficiency in data analysis that impact their entire business. The rising tide of AI adoption across industries will drive significant growth in the next decade, with AI software revenue set to reach almost $90 billion by 2025. AI’s presence is tantalizing to data scientists and business managers alike who seek to let machines do the number crunching to make the business smarter on a holistic level.
AI on the Fast Track
A leading indicator of a market segment’s growth path can usually be found by following the money trail. Investors and venture capital (VC) firms are always looking for big growth opportunities, and they are finding one now in the AI business. Forbes recently reported that there has been a 14x increase in the number of active AI startups since 2000, and investment into these startups by VC firms has increased 6x in that period. Meanwhile, companies that both build and utilize AI applications are on a similar growth path, with jobs requiring AI skills increasing 4.5x since 2013. If you are looking to start your AI journey, then check out our AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp.
IT Is a Big AI Beneficiary
It should come as no surprise that the department that deals full-time with data—namely the IT organization—is perhaps the biggest beneficiary of AI’s capabilities. A Harvard Business Review study reports that between 34 and 44 percent of global companies they surveyed are using AI to help resolve employee technical support issues (imagine a smart response system to streamline common questions and troubleshoot others), automate internal system enhancements (machine codes can be used to calculate where bottlenecks can be fixed), and ensure that employees only use technology from approved vendors (picture a smart authorization engine that keeps up with daily updates and knows vendor subsidiaries and partners).
But AI Is Cross-enterprise Too
Where else is AI finding a home? Among the most common examples of AI in the enterprise are image recognition and tagging, patient data processing, localization and mapping, predictive maintenance, predicting and thwarting security threats, and intelligent recruitment and HR management techniques. But perhaps the most active adoption is being seen in the marketing and sales operation, where intelligent use of data and the ability to learn from human interactions can produce big financial benefits. In a Statista worldwide survey, 87 percent of current AI adopters said they were using or considering using AI for sales forecasting and for improving e-mail marketing. While sales forecasting is often automated by technology to a point, it can be vastly improved with an AI agent that monitors and reacts to customer interactions and shifting market patterns. Email marketers similarly can create a sense of one-to-one marketing through more intelligent targeting and content creation for various audiences.
The bottom line is also important. McKinsey found that companies who benefit from AI initiatives and have invested in infrastructure to support its scale achieve a three to fifteen percentage point higher profit margin. Healthcare, financial services, and professional services are seeing the greatest increase in their profit margins as a result of AI adoption.
Examples of Companies Taking the Lead in AI Adoption
Here are a few examples of how specific companies in various industries are leveraging AI in their businesses:
According to the McKinsey study, tech giants including Baidu and Google spent between $20B to $30B on AI in 2016, with 90 percent of this spent on R&D and deployment, and 10 percent on AI acquisitions. The current rate of AI investment is 3x external investment growth since 2013. 
Netflix has also achieved impressive results from the AI algorithm it uses to personalize recommendations to its 100 million subscribers worldwide, improving search results and avoiding canceled subscriptions from frustrated customers who couldn’t find what they wanted (with a potential impact of $1B annually). 
Financial data specialist Bloomberg uses techniques like computer vision and natural language processing to improve the breadth of information available through their ubiquitous terminals that financial staff use to access market information. Users can use natural language in queries instead of specialized technical commands, which is analyzed and executed by AI. 
Uber has a core team providing pre-packaged machine learning algorithms 'as-a-service' to its team of mobile app developers, map experts, and autonomous driving teams. These capabilities are used to better predict traveling habits and improve maps using computer vision, and to create algorithms for its autonomous vehicles. 
And Royal Bank of Scotland recently launched a natural language processing AI bot that will answer its banking customer questions and perform simple banking tasks such as money transfers, with the goal to make digital customer support as powerful as face-to-face interaction. 
AI and Machine Learning are revolutionizing the way companies access and process data to become smarter and more efficient organizations. And IT and data science teams are gearing up for the immense benefits of AI in their enterprises.

The impact of artificial intelligence on modern culture are hotly contested. Others believe that AI positively impacts people's daily lives because it can perform mundane and even complex activities more efficiently and effectively than humans can. Yet some worry that AI will lead to increased levels of unemployment, invasion of privacy, and racial profiling.
Can AI Replace Human Intelligence?
The eventual takeover of humanity by AIs and our eventual extinction are not an impossibility.
To assume that the current limitations of AIs in reasoning and decision-making are not indicative of their future capabilities.
It's not out of the question that AI computers trained to respond appropriately to new situations would one day cease to need human supervision.
Artificial intelligence has displaced human labour in today's factories and workshops. In the packing sector, for instance, machines have mostly taken over tasks that were once performed by hand.
Artificial intelligence has mostly supplanted human workers in telemarketing and customer support. The constant availability and low barriers to entry of chatbots have made them popular in these sectors.
Impact of AI
Voice-Based Search
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on nearly every area of human existence. One AI technology that benefits from AI's ability to streamline processes for its users is speech recognition. The latest innovation can transcribe your voicemails into text for you. It can also teach your speech to issue commands with your voice. As a result, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc., have given this AI-powered speech recognition technology a lot of attention. Devices and software with built-in voice recognition are already commonplace; examples include Amazon's Echo, Apple's Siri, and Google's Home.
AI In Healthcare
The use of AI in healthcare has only recently begun. Machine learning (ML) offers promise in identifying trends within a population, similar to how computer vision (CV) can diagnose diseases using X-rays and NLP (natural language processing) can in medication safety. All of these advancements for patients will come together once we achieve real information interoperability, which supports the safe interchange of health data.
The Impact of AI on Jobs
Artificial intelligence (AI) will have future repercussions for your company. There is the possibility of a significant effect on how your business functions, yet there is no apparent downside. It calls for an optimistic outlook and an eagerness to try something new.
Many sectors of the economy are experiencing profound shifts due to the advent of AI. When applied to commercial processes, AI's ability to recognise patterns and spot anomalies in massive volumes of digital information ushers new avenues of opportunity. It can perform a wide variety of everyday activities competently if trained.
Employees are freed from mundane, repetitive work so they may focus on higher-level technical difficulties or enhance the quality of customer care made possible by the advent of AI.
Business Intelligence
Data produced by customers, tools, and procedures is overwhelming for businesses. People find that the standard business intelligence tools they've been using still need to cut it. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions will soon replace traditional methods like spreadsheets and dashboards. These instruments can automatically probe the data, learn insights, and make recommendations. These resources will transform how businesses leverage information and make decisions.
Education
An area where AI is expected to have a significant impact on education. AI will significantly assist the education sector and system, which needs a considerable overhaul. All that must be done is pinpoint what needs to change and lay out a plan for implementing that change. One factor that could prove to be a game-changer in this regard is the use of AI easy writer in creating a unique, practical, and practically applicable learning path for any subject or topic.
Retail
Artificial intelligence will have profound effects on the retail sector. Retailers will invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) to provide superior customer service in the following years. Marketers in the retail industry are anticipated to start using AR/VR capabilities. The popularity of interactive, aesthetically pleasing product catalogues, where the final consumer can try out an item before buying it, is predicted to skyrocket.
Final Thoughts
The market for AI is growing steadily with no signs of slowing down. Artificial intelligence (AI) will be used in nearly every industry to streamline operations. Faster data retrieval and decision-making are two ways AI may help businesses expand.
With multiple industry applications and future potential, AI and ML are currently the hottest markets for careers. If you want to jumpstart your career in this field, then we’ve got the perfect course to help you get started.Start your new AI and ML career today!

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the job market has brought forth a myriad of concerns and challenges that cannot be overlooked. While AI undeniably offers benefits, its dark side reveals a host of concerns and problems for businesses and individuals alike. As we delve into the darker implications of AI in the job market, it becomes essential to grasp these challenges and navigate the complex landscape of AI, ultimately working towards effective solutions that mitigate potential negative impacts.


Job displacement and automation
Perhaps the most prevalent concern surrounding AI is the potential for widespread job displacement and automation. AI technologies excel at performing routine and repetitive tasks more efficiently than humans, leading to the automation of jobs across various industries. Positions that involve data entry, customer service, and basic analysis are particularly vulnerable. Chatbots and virtual assistants, for example, can handle customer inquiries and support, reducing the need for human involvement. This displacement creates significant challenges for affected individuals, leading to unemployment and income insecurity.

Unequal impact across industries
The impact of AI in the job market is not evenly distributed across industries. While some sectors may experience significant job displacement, others may see minimal disruption or even job growth. Industries that rely heavily on manual labor or routine tasks are particularly vulnerable to AI automation. This imbalance exacerbates the divide between high-skilled and low-skilled workers, contributing to income inequality. Displaced workers often struggle to find suitable alternative employment, further exacerbating the problem.

PROMOTED
Skill requirements and job polarization
The rise of AI in the job market has resulted in a demand for new skill sets. Jobs requiring advanced technological and analytical skills are growing, while low-skilled positions face the risk of obsolescence. This polarization of jobs exacerbates income inequality and presents challenges for individuals without access to education and training opportunities. The need for upskilling and reskilling programs becomes crucial to equip workers with the skills necessary to adapt to the changing job market. However, the availability and accessibility of such programs are limited, leaving many workers at a disadvantage.

Ethical considerations and bias
AI systems are not immune to biases inherent in the data they are trained on. Concerns about bias and discrimination in AI algorithms have been raised, as these systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing societal biases. This has significant implications for hiring practices, where AI-powered resume screening algorithms may inadvertently discriminate against certain groups. Ensuring ethical and unbiased AI systems requires careful testing, evaluation, and ongoing monitoring. Failure to address these concerns can perpetuate social inequalities and reinforce biases in the job market.

Psychological impact on workers
The introduction of AI in the workplace can have profound psychological effects on workers. The fear of job loss, uncertainty about the future, and diminished human interaction can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and job insecurity. Moreover, the devaluation of certain job roles and the emphasis on AI automation can erode workers' sense of purpose and job satisfaction. The psychological well-being of workers affected by AI implementation must be a priority for businesses and policymakers.

The bottom line
While AI brings promising opportunities, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the concerns and problems it poses in the job market. Job displacement, unequal impact across industries, skill polarization, ethical considerations, and the psychological impact on workers are pressing issues that demand attention. The responsible integration of AI requires proactive measures to minimize negative consequences. Businesses, governments, and educational institutions must collaborate to develop comprehensive strategies that prioritize workers' well-being, provide retraining and support programs, and ensure a fair and inclusive job market in the era of AI. Only by navigating these concerns can we strive towards a balanced and sustainable future of work.

The Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra) is concerned with the use of digital likenesses, particularly after Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the guild’s chief negotiator, said studios proposed to pay background actors for a day’s work to use their images in perpetuity. (The AMPTP has disputed this claim as a “mischaracterization”.)‘Bargaining for our very existence’: why the battle over AI is being fought in HollywoodRead moreAll the while, entertainment companies, or tech conglomerates with entertainment divisions, have continued to expand their human staff tasked with the development, research or management of AI. Last month, Netflix made headlines for a job listing for an AI product manager with an annual salary somewhere between $300,000 and $900,000 (according to Sag-Aftra, 87% of the guild’s actors make less than $26,000 a year). A review of Disney’s job board by the Guardian found at least a dozen roles related to machine learning, several of them within its media & entertainment division. Tech companies such as Amazon and Apple have, of course, numerous open machine learning positions, with some specifically tied to entertainment (a Seattle-based AI role for Prime Video Personalization and Discovery offers, according to the listing, “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape the future of TV for billions of viewers worldwide. We know our future success is inextricably tied to being a center of excellence in machine learning science and we invest in it.”).Hollywood’s quiet AI hiring spree, first reported by the Hollywood Reporter and the Los Angeles Times, is not necessarily tied directly to AI-generated scripts or actors’ likenesses, nor are all the positions related to generative AI, the subject of much ethical debate and concern. But taken together, the push to expand AI employment indicates an industry-wide arms race to build up companies’ machine learning capabilities, cutting across many aspects of the business. “All of the studios see the opportunity,” said Dawn Chmielewski, a US entertainment business correspondent at Reuters and the co-author of Binge Times, a book on Hollywood’s streaming wars.“Obviously, cost is a consideration, but also keeping abreast of the pace of technological change. The studios are not unfamiliar with how Silicon Valley can create a technology that suddenly and dramatically changes their business.”Some of these positions build on existing AI capabilities within entertainment companies, which already use machine learning for recommendations, advertising and dubbing of foreign languages. Disney is hiring for US-based machine learning engineers for its recommendation algorithms at Hulu and Disney+; Netflix seeks an applied machine learning scientist for the globalization team ($150,000 to $700,000) to “develop algorithms that power high quality localization at scale” and “shape the future of localization and global entertainment at Netflix”.Sony has open roles for use of AI in video games and machine learning audio processing for, among other things, post production of music and movies, as well as ethics-related roles such as AI ethics technical program manager and AI privacy and security project manager. (All roles are part of Tokyo-based Sony Group, which includes Sony Pictures Entertainment and opened its own AI ethics office in 2021.)View image in fullscreenA striking actor outside Netflix’s Los Angeles office. Photograph: ShutterstockIt’s difficult to ascertain the scope of each role, and its potential impact on the entertainment business, from the outside (through a spokesman, Netflix declined to comment this article; Disney, Sony and Amazon could not be reached for comment). But the picture of current investment in AI by entertainment companies is slowly coming into view.“Generally speaking, there’s a lot of fear of missing out that’s really sweeping the industry,” said Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. Industry executives “are not necessarily sure about what it is that they want” as “companies are still trying to figure out their AI strategy”.The hiring boom goes beyond entertainment; nationwide, companies are procuring “head of AI” leadership positions with vague mandates in an effort to get ahead of the curve, or out of fear of being left behind; the number of people in AI leadership roles in the US has grown threefold in the past five years, according to data from LinkedIn. “We are all going to be touched by this technology,” said Chmielewski. “And the studios certainly see an imperative to embrace it or risk obsolescence.”For entertainment companies, the AI hiring boom reflects “a combination of trying to find people with the business acumen to understand what the market needs, what they can do with current AI, and how they can best leverage advancements in AI, particularly generative AI”, said Zhao.Disney, in particular, is making a concerted push toward AI, framed as part of the company’s long tradition of embracing new technology or as part of an inevitable march of progress. (Disney Studios in Burbank, for example, has listed a job for a senior machine learning engineer to “shape the next generation of creative and production technology and directly help drive innovation across our cinematic pipelines and theatrical experiences”.)The company recently formed an internal taskforce to study AI and examine how it could be used across divisions, and the chief executive, Bob Iger, has indicated that the company sees AI, including generative AI, as a clear part of its creative future. “Nothing is going to stop technological advancement,” Iger said at a company town hall last November. Generative AI technology, he added, is “something that at some point in the future the company will embrace”.“In fact, we’re already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers,” Iger said during an earnings call this July, as reported by journalist Lee Fang. Asked about the framing of AI as inevitable, Zhao pointed out that “AI is being touted as an efficiency improver. It’s worthwhile to think about the ultimate result of that efficiency” – namely the prospect of lost human jobs.Joan Is Awful: Black Mirror episode is every striking actor’s worst nightmareRead moreGenerative AI is, indeed, already shaping the things we watch. It’s used in visual effects, to help with dubbing for Netflix’s many foreign language shows, or to produce a small version of a real rival soccer coach for games in Apple’s Ted Lasso, or to create a full younger version of Will Smith in Paramount’s 2019 film Gemini Man. Disney-owned Marvel Studios controversially used AI to generate the opening credits for its recent series Secret Invasion.In July, Netflix premiered a new Spanish reality dating series, Deep Fake Love, in which scans of contestants’ faces and bodies are used to create “deepfake” simulations of themselves. The company’s gaming department has used AI to produce narratives and dialogue. In the documentary world, film-makers have used generative AI to recreate the voices of the late Anthony Bourdain and Andy Warhol to bridge archival gaps, and to create “digital veils” – fake faces – to protect interview subjects in Welcome to Chechnya, a documentary on the Russian government’s persecution of LGBTQ+ people.View image in fullscreenAnnie Murphy in Black Mirror. Photograph: NetflixFor now, the major fears of writers and actors – the kind depicted in the Black Mirror episode Joan Is Awful, in which a Netflix stand-in streaming service airs an entirely AI-created show – are not yet realized. But from a capability standpoint, “writers and actors could both be replaced by AI in the near future, along with everyone who works to create a movie using real human actors. We could see entire movies generated by AI without any human involvement,” said David Krueger, a researcher with the University of Cambridge’s Machine Learning Group.“This probably won’t happen in the next few years, but could easily happen within the decade.”This possibility has underscored actors’ and writers’ demands for protections over AI, from what creative material (performances, text) can be used to train models to protections against AI-generated scripts. The AMPTP has released several public statements on the matter of AI, which “raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone” that “requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing” and noting that according to the current agreement with the WGA, AI-generated material would not be eligible for credit as “only a ‘person’ can be considered a writer”.“We are still in the early stages,” said Zhao. “There is so much hype that dominates conversations. And it is very difficult to see facts from the hype” – particularly on the capability and risks of generative AI. It remains unclear what the limits on those will be. But the race for AI in a post-strike Hollywood is already under way.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryNetflixUS actors' strike 2023US writers' strike 2023featuresShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How many HR managers acknowledged Artificial Intelligence Appreciation Day on 16 July? It probably passed unnoticed by most, considering the ever-growing list of tasks demanding the profession’s attention.
Even if they did have a minute to look up from their work and appreciate the power of this fast-developing technology, is there any reason to celebrate something that’s likely to put millions of people out of a job? 
‘Yes’ should be the answer to that question. AI’s ability to automate certain tasks and reduce administrative workloads promises to make the HR practitioner’s role more human. Embracing AI should free professionals in this space to devote more time and energy to identifying talent and nurturing it, which is why most people enter the field in the first place. And, with more and better information at its fingertips, the function could play a more holistic and strategically important role.
But have HR teams become too overloaded with extra work to take this great opportunity? 
How HR’s role has expanded
During the Covid crisis, HR teams were “mostly in survival mode”, says Dr Aaron Taylor, head of Arden University’s School of Human Resource Management. “As well as figuring out how employees could work from home, they needed to provide extra support for their mental and physical wellbeing while adhering to health guidelines.”
Progressive organisations will start to broaden how they use generative AI and it will benefit both employees and HR teams
He points out that, thanks to shifting workforce trends, many HR leaders were involved in C-level decisions to keep companies functioning, as well as to handle restructuring operations and redundancy programmes. 
“The profession’s evolution over the past 25 years – from ‘pay and rations’ to the strategic role it plays today – has, quite possibly, been more radical than that of any other business function,” Taylor argues.
Eric Mosley, co-founder and CEO of HR software firm Workhuman, agrees that HR has gone through “a very hectic, chaotic time. There’s been a complete whiplash, with trends veering from one direction to another.” 
Outlining the chaotic nature of the Covid era, Mosley points to remote working, back-to-office mandates, quiet quitting, loud quitting, the great resignation and, as economic uncertainty prevails, the so-called big stay.
AI’s part in the future of HR
Helen Poitevin is a distinguished vice-president and analyst focusing on HR tech at research giant Gartner. She says that “a debate is raging about the future of work between ‘explorers’, who embrace new tech and ways of working, and ‘restorers’, who believe companies should be using tried and tested methods. AI has emerged as one of the disruptive technologies at the heart of this conversation.”
Poitevin reports that AI is already playing a role in HR operations ranging from policy-making to recruitment. A global survey of HR leaders published by Gartner in July indicates that 5% have implemented generative AI, for instance, while 9% are piloting its use. 
“In the future, progressive organisations will start to broaden how they use generative AI. It will benefit both employees and HR teams,” she predicts. “A quarter of HR leaders are planning to use it to create hyper-personalised career development plans, for instance.”
Poitevin adds that HR professionals can, when equipped with the right tech, “better understand employees and so provide more human advice” that’s better tailored to each person’s needs. 
Taylor agrees that the profession has been placing greater emphasis on understanding employees as people. “There is much more importance on the ‘human’ aspects of HR now, especially when looking at employee experience,” he says. “This is no longer solely about ensuring regulatory compliance. This is about going that extra mile to know what makes employees tick and how that aligns with the company’s overall strategy.”
Skills development and career progression
While it’s never exactly been strong, the quality of communications between HR and the shop floor has worsened in recent years. New research by data science consultancy Profusion indicates that only 24% of employees are “fully comfortable” discussing workplace problems with the HR team, for example. 
Profusion’s CEO, Natalie Cramp, notes that the pandemic-induced shift towards remote working has “severely hampered the relationship between workers and their HR representatives, eroding any sense of trust and understanding”. 
This is about going that extra mile to know what makes employees tick and how that aligns with the company’s overall strategy
A study published in May by Microsoft, which has invested heavily in generative AI, argues that HR practitioners who understand the technology and use it well will become better communicators with the power to improve the employee experience. 
“Human-AI collaboration will be the next transformational work pattern,” the research report predicts, proposing the notion of using AI as a “co-pilot”. 
How would such co-piloting work in practice? Take the use of so-called writer’s block AI to improve communications between HR and the workforce, for instance. This technology uses relevant information about the company and its employees to personalise messages and deliver these in the appropriate tone.
An HR team can work alongside AI to map out possible career paths for people in the organisation. For instance, the technology might spot hidden potential in an employee who’s been flying under the radar and prompt the team to alert that individual to an appealing internal role that would suit their talents and offer them a valuable development opportunity.
AI can enable better employee recognition
AI can also aid employee recognition – a wellbeing-boosting intervention that can be as simple as thanking someone publicly, yet is lacking in many workplaces. LinkedIn has reported achieving a 96% retention rate among employees whose work was acknowledged at least four times a year. With the prompting of AI, HR teams can recognise and celebrate the contributions (or life events) of employees or ask their line managers to do so.
“Recognition is an authentic, honest moment, where someone expresses genuine gratitude for another’s work,” Mosley says. “That connection can build relationships and community.” 
He stresses that recognition has the greatest impact when it is “fulfilled, authentic, embedded in the culture, individualised and equitable”. Again, AI tools can help HR practitioners with all of this, enabling them to convey heartfelt messages of encouragement when it matters to the recipients.
Research by Workhuman suggests that giving recognition is mutually beneficial. Managers who have done so in the past two months are more likely than those who haven’t to love their jobs (75% versus 48%) and identify as highly engaged (89% versus 64%).
Building on this last data point, Gallup’s most recent State of the Global Workplace report pegged employee engagement at about 23% last year. Given that this was the highest recorded percentage since the company started gathering such data in 2009, there is clearly significant room for improvement. 
Now, thanks to AI, HR teams have no excuse not to be more human in the digital era, recognise the good work of others and gain job satisfaction in the process.

Forty percent of data analysis leaders currently use generative artificial intelligence in their work, including to write code, analytics platform company Alteryx found in a report released August 15. Alteryx surveyed 300 data leaders across four countries — Australia, the U.K., the U.S. and Canada — about their use of generative artificial intelligence, qualms around its use and more.

Tech leaders have qualms about generative AI
Organizations are still discovering how generative AI may benefit them

A little over half of businesses have experimented with AI
Surveyed companies using generative AI employed it in content generation (46%), analytics insights summary (43%), analytics insights generation (32%), code development (31%) and process documentation (27%).
Most companies surveyed are curious about AI but don’t use it as part of their everyday process. The majority, 53%, said they are “exploring” or “experimenting” with the technology. Only 13% have AI models in place already and are working on optimizing them. In the middle sits the 34% who are “formalizing,” moving from pilot programs to production on a generative AI solution.
SEE: Gartner found that generative AI will have a transformational benefit (TechRepublic)
Of those who do use generative AI in any capacity, most found a positive impact: 55% reported modest benefits, and 34% reported substantial benefits. The benefits they found included increased market competitiveness (52%), improved security (49%) and enhanced performance or functionality of their products (45%). Another 10% found they didn’t benefit at all, and 1% found it too early to say.

Often, it takes only one business leader to adopt generative AI as their pet project and encourage the rest of the company to adopt it. In 98% of cases, organizations report that a single person in a leadership position drove their generative AI strategy. In most cases, that leader was the CEO (30%), with slightly fewer organizations following the directives of a head of IT (25%) or chief data or analytics officer (22%). Conversely, among companies not using generative AI, 35% said they had “no one to take the lead with implementation.”
Interestingly, there is an element of hobbyist enthusiasm to the business adoption of generative AI. According to the survey, 81% of people who use generative AI at work also use it for personal or recreational purposes outside of work.
Tech leaders have qualms about generative AI
Many companies still have concerns about the security, copyright rules or efficacy of generative AI. Organizations that haven’t implemented generative AI said they didn’t do so because of concerns about data privacy (47%), lack of trust in the results produced by the system (43%), lack of sufficient expertise (39%) and not having anyone on staff to take the lead on implementing generative AI (34%).
Of the organizations already using generative AI in their work, the most pressing concerns were data ownership (29%), data privacy (28%) and IP ownership (28%).
One way to solve some of these concerns is human oversight — 64% said they believe generative AI can be used now as long as a human has veto power over the output. And there is a high degree of trust among workers who already use generative AI; 70% think it can “deliver initial, rapid results that I can review and modify to completion.”

Others — 71% — agreed to the idea that risks around generative AI can be managed by using the technology within frameworks set up by trusted software vendors.
Whether generative AI will replace roles for human workers is complicated. There’s an impression among 77% of surveyed people who already use generative AI that it could replace entire roles.
Other risks include privacy concerns, novel security vulnerabilities and copyright infringement when AI models are trained on original work. One possible solution is working within fair use principles, Asa Whillock, vice president and general manager of machine learning at Alteryx, pointed out in an email to TechRepublic: “Leaders must understand, however, that the trust of AI and LLMs is reliant on the quality of data inputs. Insights that are generated by AI models are only as good as the data they have access to,” Whillock said.
Organizations are still discovering how generative AI may benefit them
“Though the pulse survey indicates that many companies are still in the nascent stages of adoption, there’s a growing awareness of the benefits, and early adopters are already reaping the rewards,” wrote Heather Ferguson, Alteryx editorial manager, in a blog post.
“If implemented strategically, generative AI provides a massive opportunity for data democratization that will positively impact business operations, decisions and outcomes due to the cases for integrating LLMs (large language models) responsibly with low-code/no-code,” said Whillock.

The media frenzy surrounding ChatGPT and other large language model artificial intelligence systems spans a range of themes, from the prosaic – large language models could replace conventional web search – to the concerning – AI will eliminate many jobs – and the overwrought – AI poses an extinction-level threat to humanity. All of these themes have a common denominator: large language models herald artificial intelligence that will supersede humanity.
But large language models, for all their complexity, are actually really dumb. And despite the name “artificial intelligence,” they’re completely dependent on human knowledge and labor. They can’t reliably generate new knowledge, of course, but there’s more to it than that. 
ChatGPT can’t learn, improve or even stay up to date without humans giving it new content and telling it how to interpret that content, not to mention programming the model and building, maintaining and powering its hardware. To understand why, you first have to understand how ChatGPT and similar models work, and the role humans play in making them work.
How ChatGPT works
Large language models like ChatGPT work, broadly, by predicting what characters, words and sentences should follow one another in sequence based on training data sets. In the case of ChatGPT, the training data set contains immense quantities of public text scraped from the internet. 


ChatGPT works by statistics, not by understanding words.

Imagine I trained a language model on the following set of sentences:
Bears are large, furry animals.
Bears have claws.
Bears are secretly robots.
Bears have noses.
Bears are secretly robots.
Bears sometimes eat fish.
Bears are secretly robots.
The model would be more inclined to tell me that bears are secretly robots than anything else, because that sequence of words appears most frequently in its training data set. This is obviously a problem for models trained on fallible and inconsistent data sets – which is all of them, even academic literature. 
People write lots of different things about quantum physics, Joe Biden, healthy eating or the Jan. 6 insurrection, some more valid than others. How is the model supposed to know what to say about something, when people say lots of different things?
The need for feedback
This is where feedback comes in. If you use ChatGPT, you’ll notice that you have the option to rate responses as good or bad. If you rate them as bad, you’ll be asked to provide an example of what a good answer would contain. ChatGPT and other large language models learn what answers, what predicted sequences of text, are good and bad through feedback from users, the development team and contractors hired to label the output.
ChatGPT cannot compare, analyze or evaluate arguments or information on its own. It can only generate sequences of text similar to those that other people have used when comparing, analyzing or evaluating, preferring ones similar to those it has been told are good answers in the past.
Thus, when the model gives you a good answer, it’s drawing on a large amount of human labor that’s already gone into telling it what is and isn’t a good answer. There are many, many human workers hidden behind the screen, and they will always be needed if the model is to continue improving or to expand its content coverage. 
A recent investigation published by journalists in Time magazine revealed that hundreds of Kenyan workers spent thousands of hours reading and labeling racist, sexist and disturbing writing, including graphic descriptions of sexual violence, from the darkest depths of the internet to teach ChatGPT not to copy such content. They were paid no more than US$2 an hour, and many understandably reported experiencing psychological distress due to this work.


Language AIs require humans to tell them what makes a good answer – and what makes toxic content.

What ChatGPT can’t do
The importance of feedback can be seen directly in ChatGPT’s tendency to “hallucinate”; that is, confidently provide inaccurate answers. ChatGPT can’t give good answers on a topic without training, even if good information about that topic is widely available on the internet. You can try this out yourself by asking ChatGPT about more and less obscure things. I’ve found it particularly effective to ask ChatGPT to summarize the plots of different fictional works because, it seems, the model has been more rigorously trained on nonfiction than fiction. 
In my own testing, ChatGPT summarized the plot of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings,” a very famous novel, with only a few mistakes. But its summaries of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Pirates of Penzance” and of Ursula K. Le Guin’s “The Left Hand of Darkness” – both slightly more niche but far from obscure – come close to playing Mad Libs with the character and place names. It doesn’t matter how good these works’ respective Wikipedia pages are. The model needs feedback, not just content.
Because large language models don’t actually understand or evaluate information, they depend on humans to do it for them. They are parasitic on human knowledge and labor. When new sources are added into their training data sets, they need new training on whether and how to build sentences based on those sources. 
They can’t evaluate whether news reports are accurate or not. They can’t assess arguments or weigh trade-offs. They can’t even read an encyclopedia page and only make statements consistent with it, or accurately summarize the plot of a movie. They rely on human beings to do all these things for them. 
Then they paraphrase and remix what humans have said, and rely on yet more human beings to tell them whether they’ve paraphrased and remixed well. If the common wisdom on some topic changes – for example, whether salt is bad for your heart or whether early breast cancer screenings are useful – they will need to be extensively retrained to incorporate the new consensus.
Many people behind the curtain
In short, far from being the harbingers of totally independent AI, large language models illustrate the total dependence of many AI systems, not only on their designers and maintainers but on their users. So if ChatGPT gives you a good or useful answer about something, remember to thank the thousands or millions of hidden people who wrote the words it crunched and who taught it what were good and bad answers. 
Far from being an autonomous superintelligence, ChatGPT is, like all technologies, nothing without us.

Of course we’re going to talk about generative AI at CIO’s Future of Work Summit, a virtual event taking place September 20.
With the promise of generative AI, we’re living through what many believe to be a seismic change in how we work – and who works with and for us.
But that’s not all we’ll talk about. The conference’s theme is Automation and Augmentation: Building a Next-Gen Workforce. We promise to bring insights and examples from multiple industries to help you guide what that future looks like for you.
 
 
 













 
 

Our conference team has updated sessions to reflect new innovations and practices that have developed since we originally began planning the event. And we will continue to adapt our content until we go live on September 20.

Still, common themes have started to emerge. Here are three things to watch out for:
The future is here.
 
 
 













 
 

Companies have already started to adjust their org charts, job descriptions, and titles to adapt to the dawn of the age of AI. Justin Martinez, practice leader in the executive search firm Korn Ferry’s Technology Officers Practice, will share changes in how and what companies are hiring for now.
What’s next? Futurist Samantha Radocchia will make sense of the changes to tell us what’s next in the near term, whether that’s what it will be like for people to collaborate with autonomous colleagues or how to embrace these transformations without being left behind. She will also answer your questions in a live discussion.
It’s not all about generative AI.
 
 
 













 
 

IT leaders are going beyond the chatbot to achieve greater productivity and innovation. Mark Austin, vice president of data science at AT&T, will talk about the company’s highly successful intelligent automation initiatives with CIO Senior Writer Thor Olavsrud.
Don’t sleep on security.
While CISOs and CIOs have had to grapple with shadow IT for years, they now have to contend with shadow AI as employees experiment on their own with ChatGPT and other technologies. Learn from a panel of CIOs and analysts on how to maintain control of these exciting – yet dangerous – tools. (Anyone interested in a deeper dive into security’s role in AI should join us in person at the CSO50 Conference + Awards in October.)

Optimizing human and AI workMercer

Even by the relatively lofty standards of the tech sector, the hype around generative AI may have broken new ground. McKinsey estimate that the technology could add between $2.6tn to $4.4tn of economic value annually across industries ranging from banking to life sciences. Chat GPT, probably the most well known example of generative AI, reached 100 million users 2 months after launch and by most estimates has over 1 billion users currently. The following analysis based on multiple recent studies and a framework for analyzing the impact of automation on work as described in Reinventing Jobs (HBR Press, 2018), illustrates the potentially significant gains possible through the use of RPA and the four generations of AI currently available to us (rule-based systems, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI).

But how exactly will generative AI affect work? Answering this question requires an understanding of the differences between generative AI and the previous generations of AI. The following analysis1 illustrates the most significant differences

While earlier iterations of AI were helpful in predicting specific outcomes, the lack of reasoning that underpins generative AI means that its well documented hallucinations will remain a feature of the technology for the foreseeable future. To understand how best to use it requires us to understand the essential characteristics of work. As described in Reinventing Jobs, there are four distinct potential outcomes associated with any body of work:

Error elimination — think of some of the work of an airline pilot — where the consequences of a mistake are high and there is significant potential for negative value to the organization from any deviation from an acceptable level of performance.
Minimizing variance — such as transaction-processing work — where there is no value in improving performance beyond a target level.
Improving productivity — the work of a salesperson, for example — where an improvement in performance yields a commensurate improvement in value to the organization.
Achieving breakthroughs — think of highly creative work, such as data science — where a small improvement in performance has an exponentially large impact on value.

Established automation like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can be helpful in substituting human endeavor in work where the objective is to reduce variance and there is a greater tolerance for risk. Consider the application of RPA to reduce the variance with which the highly repetitive, rules-based work of analyzing and synthesizing financial data is performed. Previous generations of AI have long been used to augment analytical work where productivity improvement or achieving a breakthrough is the goal. Consider how oncologists have used machine learning, trained on significant volumes of specific data and images, to exponentially increase the accuracy of cancer detection, not by replacing skills but by augmenting capabilities and increasing the premium on experience and expertise. However, when error elimination is the objective function for work, generative AI can be an extremely risk proposition. Its aforementioned hallucinations place an extremely high premium on human competency and care, reducing its value proposition significantly.
It is essential that leaders understand when to rely on — and when not to rely on — various technologies and the specific role they should have in either substituting, augmenting of transforming human work. Generative AI is most useful in democratizing knowledge and creativity through augmentation, lowering the skills premiums traditionally required for a variety of creative tasks where the goal is achieving productivity gains and seeking a breakthrough in domains where there is a high tolerance for risk. It can be a valuable tool for boosting productivity where the tolerance for risk is higher. Compelling use cases have ranged from copywriting to call center operations where it has demonstrated significant value in boosting productivity particularly for the least experienced talent.
Interestingly, this democratization of access could have the benefit of reducing the rising inequality we have experienced over the last 2 industrial revolutions as generative AI increases the productivity of talent with lesser skills, much as the automation of the second-industrial revolution did. As AI continues to lower the premium on creativity and democratizes access, how will you ensure the perpetual reinvention of your business model and workforce to take advantage of it in a thoughtful and nuanced way?

Google has also recently expanded its paid certificates program which can be accessed through Coursera and has made its free courses available in 18 additional languages.2. Microsoft’s “Transform Your Business With AI” courseThis Microsoft learning path is designed, as the tech giant says, to help businesspeople acquire “the knowledge and resources to adopt AI in their organizations”, and explores “planning, strategizing, and scaling AI projects in a responsible way.”Microsoft says the objectives for this course are to become familiar with existing AI tools, understand basic AI terminology and practices, and use prebuilt AI to build intelligent applications.To enroll in this course, which is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, Microsoft says you’ll need a “basic understanding” of IT and business concepts. Modules included in the pathway are:Leverage AI tools and resources for your business (55 mins)Create business value from AI (21 min)Embrace responsible AI principles and practices (48 mins)Scale AI in your organization (36 mins)3. Google’s “Machine Learning Foundational Course”Along with the foundational AI course mentioned above, Google also provides an introductory course on machine learning that’s available for free. You can access the course with your Google Workspace or personal account, and there’s actually a surprising amount of material included, considering it’s free.Included as part of the material is a “crash course” to machine learning, a section on “problem framing” and a course on how to prepare your data for machine learning workflows. Included are freely accessible videos explaining core concepts, provided by machine learning experts. You’ll then be able to “check your understanding” at the end of each section with a quiz.While this course is a little more advanced than the other Google course to make this list – and has a bit more of a business focus – it’s worth checking out if your company is looking for new ways to implement AI/machine learning in the workplace.4. LinkedIn’s “Career Essentials In Generative AI” training courseLinkedIn’s AI Career Essentials Course is made up of five different videos, with a total run time of around four hours. Each video is hosted by a different AI expert, covering a range of core concepts and ethical considerations relating to AI models.One of the videos provides a detailed explanation of how to streamline your work with Microsoft Bing Chat, while another discusses the key differences between search engines and reasoning engines. Although there’s no accreditation or certification, completing this course will earn you a badge of completion from LinkedIn, which can be displayed on your profile.The fifth video in the series, entitled “an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” is an hour and a half long and provides a simplified overview of the best AI tools for businesses, which is handy for those who haven’t taken the plunge yet and implemented a tool in work.5. IBM’s “AI Foundations for Everyone” training courseIBM offers a course entitled “AI Foundations for Everyone” through Coursera, of which over 2,000 people have already signed up for in just February 2024. You can audit the course for free, which will give you access to all of the materials and some of the assignments, but you won’t be graded or get a certificate at the end. For that, you’ll need a Coursera subscription.It’s geared toward beginners and you don’t need prior experience to enroll, and the schedule is flexible so you can learn at your own pace. Along with AI fundamentals, the course will also ensure you’re familiar with IBM’s own AI services, which help businesses integrate artificial intelligence into their existing infrastructure.IBM says that, by the end of the course, participants will have had “hands-on interactions with several AI environments and applications”.The course has three modules: “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence”, “Getting Started with AI using IBM Watson”, and “Building AI-Powered Chatbots Without Programming”. Each module takes between nine and eleven hours to complete.6. Digital Partner’s “The Fundamentals of ChatGPT” training courseDigital Partner’s course entitled “The fundamentals of ChatGPT” is a great option for anyone who wants to take a free, accredited course that covers the basics of Generative AI. As of February 2024, more than 8,000 learners have completed the short course.During the course, you’ll spend time learning about OpenAI’s role in global AI development, and be able to learn about how ChatGPT works, its advantages and limitations. There’s also a variety of examples included within the course that will show you how to leverage ChatGPT for different tasks, and you’ll learn more about the difference between ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus.Modules include “Working With ChatGPT”, “ChatGPT and Its Shortcomings” and “Training a GPT Model”. This free course is available on alison.com, and is published by a digital marketing firm called Digital Partner. The course is CPD accredited and a certificate will be awarded upon completion of a small assessment at the end of the 1.5-3 hour program.7. DeepLearning.AI’s “AI for Everyone” (Coursera)Not to be confused with IBM’s similarly-named online AI training course, DeepLearning.AI’s “AI for Everyone” short course is worth enrolling in just to see what the fuss is all about. 1.2 million people have enrolled in this course and more than 40,000 have reviewed it, with an average score of 4,8/5 in February 2024 – perhaps because it’s run by lecturer Andrew Ng, an instructor with over 40 courses published on the site.This course is split up into four broad modules: What Is AI?, Building AI Projects, Building AI in Your Company, and AI in Society. All four of the modules take less than an hour to complete, so you could feasibly complete the course in a day if you’re prepared to take the quizzes designed to recap each module.Like most Coursera courses, you’ll be able to audit the course and access all the materials for free, although you’ll have to sign up for a paid account if you want the relevant accreditation once you complete the course.8. Phil Ebner’s ChatGPT, Midjourney, Firefly, Bard, DALL-E” AI crash courseWhile some good courses on Udemy will guide you through the ins and outs of MidJourney and other AI generation tools, Phil Ebner covers the most ground, and more than 30,000 students have already enrolled in the course, which has a 4.6/5 rating on Udemy.The course is almost two hours long and also includes content that will help you better use tools like ChatGPT to generate text responses as well as images.The “AI for Visual Creativity” section, however, will show you how to use both MidJourney and Dall-E to create “photorealistic images, illustrations, and digital art in a variety of styles. With OpenAI’s Sora video generator seemingly just around the corner, there’s never been a better time to learn the basic principles of AI video generation and the tools that can do it.On Udemy, you don’t receive certificates of completion for free courses, but if you’re just looking to upskill yourself free of charge, this course is definitely worth a look.

GreatLearning’s “ChatGPT for Beginners” training courseThis is a completely free, two-hour long beginners-focused ChatGPT course. It’s one of the only beginner’s courses on the internet that includes a section on coding prompts, although it also covers quite a bit of other ground, including email prompting.There are no prerequisites needed for this course, and it has an average rating of 4.61/5, with 75% of reviewers giving the course 5 stars. The 6 Best Free College AI Courses and TrainingA number of universities and colleges offer AI-focused courses.Stanford University’s “Machine Learning” Course (Udacity)Vanderbilt University’s “Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT” (Coursera)Georgia Tech’s “Machine Learning” Course (Udacity)The Open University’s “AI Matters” Course (OpenLearn)University of Pennsylvania’s “AI For Business” (Coursera)University of Helsinki’s “Elements of AI” and “Ethics of AI” Course1. Stanford University’s “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course (Udacity)This foundational online program, which takes around 10 months to complete at a rate of 10 hours a week, focuses on fundamental AI concepts and practical machine learning skills but is classified as an intermediate course.The course, which is split into two umbrella sections (“Fundamentals of AI” and “Applications of AI) is completely free if you sign up for Udacity (which also doesn’t cost anything). Unlike Coursera courses, you have access to the full range of materials and teaching, rather than just the ability to audit. It consists of 22 different lessons and a string of interactive quizzes.2. Vanderbilt University’s “Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT” (Coursera)Jules White, Vanderbilt University’s associate dean for strategic learning programs and associate professor of computer science, has launched a free online course available through Coursera focusing on prompt engineering.It goes through the most effective approaches for prompt engineering, covering summarization, simulation, programming, and other useful ways you can harness the power of ChatGPT with your inputs. It’s got one of the highest approval ratings we’ve seen for an AI training course, scoring 4.8/5 with an approval rating of 98% as of February 2024.The course takes around 18 hours to complete and is made up of an introduction to prompts and three separate sessions on prompt patterns, as well as a 2-hour module on examples. You can either audit this course for free, which means you get access to all the materials but no proof you’ve completed it, or pay for a Coursera subscription (roughly $59 per month). However, you won’t have to pay anything on top of that fee for this course.3. Georgia Tech’s “Machine Learning” course (Udacity)In collaboration with Georgia Tech, Udacity has made an intermediate machine-learning course available for free, which takes around 4 months to complete, although the course listing says you can do it at your own pace.The course is offered as part of an online master’s degree at Georiga Tech, but taking this course won’t earn you credit toward this degree. It includes information on Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, which are two different types of machine learning, and covers how they’re used in AI systems.However, having a “strong familiarity with Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, and Statistics” and prior experience with statistics is helpful. Students should also have some experience with programming.4. The Open University’s “AI Matters” course (OpenLearn)The Open University is a UK-based institution that offers a free course through its learning portal OpenLearn entitled “AI Matters”.In the course, you’ll learn about the “historical, social, political and economic issues in AI”, explore the benefits and limitations of the technology, and discuss ethical risks relating to AI.The course is six hours long, and you’ll be eligible for a “statement of completion” from the organization, which has university status in the UK.5. University of Pennsylvania’s “AI For Business” (Coursera)The University of Pennsylvania’s “AI for Business” specialization is made up of four different, free courses:AI Applications in People ManagementAI Fundamentals for Non-Data ScientistsAI Applications in Marketing and FinanceAI Strategy and FinanceIn 2023, the University of Pennsylvania’s website detailed that the course itself costs $39 to complete, and you could enroll in the four individual modules for free. Each module took around two hours a week to complete.However, in 2024, they’ve upped the price to $79. However, we’d recommend accessing it via Coursera – the modules take around 7-9 hours to complete, and if you purchased the 7-day free trial, it could be done in that time. You can also audit the course for free, which means you won’t have proof of completion.6. University of Helsinki’s “Elements of AI” and “Ethics of AI”The University of Helsinki has two, free online courses available. The course entitled “Ethics of AI” is geared towards “anyone who is interested in the ethical aspects of AI”, the university says.The course will familiarize you with common questions that arise in AI ethics and the various ways to approach them.“Elements of AI” is a broader course with 6 chapters, focusing on topics such as “neural networks”, “machine learning” and “AI problem solving”.  All you need to do to access the course materials is sign up. The Benefits of Learning About AIOf course, completing an AI training course can have several benefits. From a personal learning perspective, it’s one of the best ways you can spend your time – AI is here to stay, and getting a better grasp of how it works might just help you out in the near future.Plus, the things you learn about AI will be applicable to a wide variety of job roles in almost every sector of the economy, so it’s arguably a safer bet than completing a course on a niche or industry-specific topic.What’s more, right now, businesses are looking for people who understand how generative AI tools like ChatGPT work, and how to leverage them effectively. Employees that are conscious of the limitations of AI tools and able to generate useful responses using prompts are going to become more sought after than employees without these skills.Completing an AI training course is going to look good on your CV, which will help if you’re applying for a new job. Evidence that you’ve taken the initiative to explore an emerging technology is definitely something an employer will find desirable.Of course, if you don’t have much of a budget – or you’re not entirely sure what AI training course would be the best use of your time – then trying out some free options is a great place to start.The Benefits of Developing Your Soft Skills in an Automated WorldIf you’re looking for AI training courses to enhance your understanding of something that’s going to dominate the business world for years to come, you’re already one step ahead of the crowd.Completing an AI course isn’t the only way to prepare yourself for the seismic changes to the global economy that will occur as AI is harnessed by more businesses.One other thing you can do if you want to upskill yourself is to develop your soft skills. These are the “human” skills that AI tools like ChatGPT don’t have. Businesses are always going to need humans to organize, prioritize, and take responsibility for planning and executing projects.With AI taking control of more and more repetitive administrative tasks, having strong soft skills is going to be increasingly important to stand out in a pool of highly-qualified job applicants or colleagues jostling for promotion.Developing your soft skills can consist of taking an accredited course – but they are more than often improved by taking experiences, especially in the workplace. It’s vital, then, to put yourself forward for opportunities and experiences that will let you expand your communication, organization, and general leadership skills. You can be taught to work a piece of software in a week, but you can’t click your fingers and make someone a proficient public speaker or project manager. FAQs    Is Google's AI certification free?     Yes – Google has a free AI learning path that has ten courses you can complete for free. Each course takes around one day to complete. The modules provide an introduction to generative AI, and although there’s no official qualification, you will get a completion badge which you can add to your resume.       How do I AI proof my job?     AI proofing your job can be done in two ways. Firstly, make sure you’re competent at using the latest generative AI tools like ChatGPT. This is especially vital if many of the tasks you’re completing on a day-to-day basis could, in theory, be completed by AI. Secondly, ensure you’re investing in the development of soft skills that AI tools may never have, such as the ability to effectively and appropriately manage employees.       Can I learn AI on my own?     Yes – you can learn how to harness the powers of AI on your own, through online guides, tutorials, and courses. There are quite a lot of resources out there now that will show you how to get the most out of generative AI tools like ChatGPT. However, if you want to learn how more complex skills, such as programming a large language model, you may need to seek out a paid course       Is Microsoft's AI course free?     Yes – Microsoft has a free training path available that consists of four short modules, which cover how to leverage AI effectively in business settings and how to scale AI projects in a responsible, impactful way.       How does Coursera's pricing work?     Coursera will give users a 7-day free trial of the platform, during which they can sign up to any courses they like and start learning. After that, it’ll cost you $59/month for Coursera plus – but you’ll be able to access the platform’s free courses for as long as you want. Coursera will also let you audit courses for free, which means you’ll get access to the material, but no certificate at the end.

The MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing has awarded seed grants to seven projects that are exploring how artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction can be leveraged to enhance modern work spaces to achieve better management and higher productivity.
Funded by Andrew W. Houston ’05 and Dropbox Inc., the projects are intended to be interdisciplinary and bring together researchers from computing, social sciences, and management.
The seed grants can enable the project teams to conduct research that leads to bigger endeavors in this rapidly evolving area, as well as build community around questions related to AI-augmented management.
The seven selected projects and research leads include:
“LLMex: Implementing Vannevar Bush’s Vision of the Memex Using Large Language Models,” led by Pattie Maes of the Media Lab and David Karger of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). Inspired by Vannevar Bush’s Memex, this project proposes to design, implement, and test the concept of memory prosthetics using large language models (LLMs). The AI-based system will intelligently help an individual keep track of vast amounts of information, accelerate productivity, and reduce errors by automatically recording their work actions and meetings, supporting retrieval based on metadata and vague descriptions, and suggesting relevant, personalized information proactively based on the user’s current focus and context.
“Using AI Agents to Simulate Social Scenarios,” led by John Horton of the MIT Sloan School of Management and Jacob Andreas of EECS and CSAIL. This project imagines the ability to easily simulate policies, organizational arrangements, and communication tools with AI agents before implementation. Tapping into the capabilities of modern LLMs to serve as a computational model of humans makes this vision of social simulation more realistic, and potentially more predictive.
“Human Expertise in the Age of AI: Can We Have Our Cake and Eat it Too?” led by Manish Raghavan of MIT Sloan and EECS, and Devavrat Shah of EECS and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. Progress in machine learning, AI, and in algorithmic decision aids has raised the prospect that algorithms may complement human decision-making in a wide variety of settings. Rather than replacing human professionals, this project sees a future where AI and algorithmic decision aids play a role that is complementary to human expertise.
“Implementing Generative AI in U.S. Hospitals,” led by Julie Shah of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and CSAIL, Retsef Levi of MIT Sloan and the Operations Research Center, Kate Kellog of MIT Sloan, and Ben Armstrong of the Industrial Performance Center. In recent years, studies have linked a rise in burnout from doctors and nurses in the United States with increased administrative burdens associated with electronic health records and other technologies. This project aims to develop a holistic framework to study how generative AI technologies can both increase productivity for organizations and improve job quality for workers in health care settings.
“Generative AI Augmented Software Tools to Democratize Programming,” led by Harold Abelson of EECS and CSAIL, Cynthia Breazeal of the Media Lab, and Eric Klopfer of the Comparative Media Studies/Writing. Progress in generative AI over the past year is fomenting an upheaval in assumptions about future careers in software and deprecating the role of coding. This project will stimulate a similar transformation in computing education for those who have no prior technical training by creating a software tool that could eliminate much of the need for learners to deal with code when creating applications.
“Acquiring Expertise and Societal Productivity in a World of Artificial Intelligence,” led by David Atkin and Martin Beraja of the Department of Economics, and Danielle Li of MIT Sloan. Generative AI is thought to augment the capabilities of workers performing cognitive tasks. This project seeks to better understand how the arrival of AI technologies may impact skill acquisition and productivity, and to explore complementary policy interventions that will allow society to maximize the gains from such technologies.
“AI Augmented Onboarding and Support,” led by Tim Kraska of EECS and CSAIL, and Christoph Paus of the Department of Physics and the Laboratory for Nuclear Science. While LLMs have made enormous leaps forward in recent years and are poised to fundamentally change the way students and professionals learn about new tools and systems, there is often a steep learning curve which people have to climb in order to make full use of the resource. To help mitigate the issue, this project proposes the development of new LLM-powered onboarding and support systems that will positively impact the way support teams operate and improve the user experience.

It was in the computer game Neuromancer, programmed by Troy Miles and based on William Gibson’s cyberpunk novel. Other people may have first encountered HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrik’s 2001: A Space Odyssey or Samantha from Spike Jonze’s Her.AI companies aren’t afraid of regulation – we want it to be international and inclusiveDorothy ChouRead moreImages from pop culture influence people’s impressions of AI, but culture has an even more profound relationship to it. If there’s one thing to take away from this article, it is the idea that AI systems are not objective machines, but instead based in human culture: our values, norms, preferences, and behaviours in society. These aspects of our culture are reflected in how systems are engineered. So instead of trying to decide whether AI systems are objectively good or bad for society, we need to design them to reflect the ethically positive culture we truly want.Here’s an example: Roger Dannenberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, has created an AI system that plays music with people. It accompanies performers based on ideas of pitch, scale, tempo and so on, that could be called facets of western music theory. In contrast, the composer and scholar George E Lewis, coming from a tradition based in the African diaspora – jazz and other traditions, as nurtured by Chicago’s Association for Advancement of Creative Music – has created a system called Voyager that is a “nonhierarchical, interactive musical environment that privileges improvisation”. The outcomes are very different. Dannenberg’s system produces output that is effective at following a conventional performer – it sounds like it hits the expected notes. Lewis’s system, in contrast, generates surprises in dialogue with a performer, sometimes taking a solo, sometimes laying out while the human solos – neither the human nor the machine dominates.Voyager’s sound is somewhere in between that of avant garde jazz great Sun Ra and a Javanese gamelan ensemble. The values of each system are based on the cultures the musicians and programmers draw from: measurable control v improvised collaboration, making for important differences in the output of each system.View image in fullscreen‘Voyager’s sound is somewhere in between that of avant garde jazz great Sun Ra (above) and a Javanese gamelan ensemble.’ Photograph: Andrew Putler/RedfernsNowadays, AI systems have roles in generating text and images, diagnosing disease, and even in autonomous weapons systems. One could make such systems as followers of humans or as creative supports for humans; we can look at the relationship between machine and human as based in command and control – or as based in collaboration, figuring out what people do best and what the computer does best so that they can work fruitfully together. Both approaches have their place – but I feel that currently the latter approach is less well-known and adopted. Creating AI systems based in many different cultures, with proper ethical guidelines, can help to rectify this.People can intentionally design computing systems with the values and worldviews we want. For instance, the MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality, which I founded and direct, has built simulations such as Breakbeat Narratives, a collaboration with Universal Hip Hop Museum and Microsoft. The system utilises our centre’s technologies, characters created with comic book artists Black Kirby, Microsoft conversational AI and music archival content from the TunesMap Educational Foundation to teach hip-hop history according to the user’s musical tastes and interests. For instance, if you like roots music and are interested in female hip-hop artists, you can get a short documentary on the self-representation of women in hip-hop that has a soundtrack of hip-hop songs that sample from country and western and bluegrass.I also had the pleasure of collaborating with war photojournalist and VR artist Karim Ben Khelifa on a project he directed called The Enemy, which enabled viewers to journalistically hear the perspectives of combatants on both sides of conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, El Salvador and Gaza – while customising the experience based on users’ body language as a proxy for their potential biases and attentiveness.We build AI and computing systems for creative expression, learning and the social good by meaningfully customising stories and experiences for the people using them. There is a great opportunity for AI to have a positive social impact through such design – but to do so, the field will need to be more interdisciplinary, valuing the aims and insights of the arts, humanities and social science.I’m not promoting a utopian view of AI. You’ve probably heard about recent approaches such as “deep learning” and “large-language models” – of systems such as Dall·E 2 and GPT-4. People have been using them for many purposes: gamers create characters for Dungeons & Dragons, attorneys craft legal motions.Such systems utilise neural networks and approaches involving deep learning and large language models. It is hard for humans to interpret exactly why they output the particular images or text that they do (the system’s “reasons” are a pattern of finely tuned statistical values and numerical weights). When processes are opaque, and driven by large datasets that also are based on cultural values, it’s possible for unfair biases and other social ills to find their way into the systems.We need to be aware of, and thoughtfully design, the cultural values that AI is based on. With care, we can build systems based on multiple worldviews – and address key ethical issues in design such as transparency and intelligibility. AI does offer extraordinary creative opportunities; but creators need to do social-cultural work that is at least as hard as technically engineering these systems – and perhaps harder. There are times when a command-and-control paradigm is appropriate in computing. However, when looking at AI, there are times when, instead, we need to see more jazz-like opportunities for creative, collaborative improvisation.

Updated with additional commentary

While the Hollywood writer’s strike has reached and passed 100 days, a new report out says almost every entertainment and media company plans to boost generative AI spend. In fact, they are global leaders.


“Companies in the entertainment, technology and consumer products industries are frontrunners in plans to increase generative AI spending,” Lucidworks, a search and insights company that commissioned the report, says.

But the media companies aren’t alone.
Generative AI planned spend by countryLucidworks
PROMOTED
As many as 96% of executives involved in AI decisions are prioritizing generative AI investments, and that means that most companies globally are investing. China leads with 100% of companies saying they are investing in generative AI, while 94% of U.K. and 95% of French companies say the same. In India, 98% of companies are also pouring resources into generative AI, while 92% of U.S. companies say they are as well.
(This data is based on what Lucidworks says is the largest global study of generative AI in business, involving 6,000 survey respondents at companies with more than 100 employees who are involved in decisions on AI investments.)

With numbers like these, virtually every industry is rushing headlong to build, use or buy generative AI technology.
That’s a key concern of Hollywood writers, of course, and Wired says they’re right to fear AI. An OpenAI study on the “labor market impact potential of large language models” published in March says that multiple categories of writers are up to 100% exposed to career and work impact from AI. That does not necessarily mean that AI will take their jobs—though in some cases it could—but it will almost certainly have some impact in how they do their jobs.

Generative AI job impact for writers: fully exposed.John Koetsier

“Generative AI is imposing massive change on global business, presenting unprecedented opportunities and challenges—and at a breakneck speed,” the Lucidworks report says. “This new technology can generate content, images, and even entire virtual environments autonomously, thereby disrupting various industries.”
That massive change at breakneck speed, of course, is what worries most people. AI is improving so quickly—including full video generation from text prompts—that a full movie might be generated from prompts in just a few years. (Note: no comment on the quality of that movie.)
One author has predicted that 90% of Hollywood content might be at least in part AI generated by 2025.
Based on the investment media and entertainment companies are making, that could be possible. According to the report, only consumer products companies, tech companies and construction and real estate companies are investing at similar levels.Generative AI spend by industry, according to Lucidworks.Lucidworks
Even the relative laggards, however, are overwhelmingly planning large and fast generative AI deployments.
“Now is the time to understand the strategy and operational opportunities of generative AI,” Mike Sinoway, the CEO of Lucidworks, said in a statement. “The fundamental shift that is occurring is rapid, global, and highly impactful. This study confirms the emergence of generative AI industry leaders and laggards, and those that move swiftly to orient their practices can move ahead quickly.”
One way that might manifest for the actors of the SAG-AFTRA union who are also on strike alongside the writers is synthetic actors. We’ve been seeing synthetic models and still photography subjects for years now, but deepfakes of existing and past actors are now showing that AI-generated and enhanced “talent” is a real threat.
As entrepreneur, investor and analyst Jeremiah Owyang mentioned in response to this story, synthetic actors don’t strike, don’t ask for pay raises, never take sick days, and never age. Even more intriguing for studios but concerning for actors is that they can also be used in literally millions of very personally targeted ads.

When Evanston, Illinois-based Darren Angle was in talks to join biotech research startup Prism Analytic Technologies in May, “head of AI” wasn’t even a position yet.


“We were trying to come up with a title,” says Angle, a software engineer who previously worked on artificial intelligence at Shopify and now, as the startup’s “head of AI,” builds large language models for pharma companies and scientists. “It was sort of like, ‘let’s figure out what the role is going to be.’”

Now, there are a lot more of those positions, and titles for them are coming into view. According to new data released Tuesday in LinkedIn’s Future of Work report, the share of global English-language job postings on the platform mentioning GPT or ChatGPT has increased 21 times since November 2022, when OpenAI first released its AI chatbot into the world.

“We’re seeing the evolution of jobs now changing faster than it was before,” says LinkedIn chief economist Karin Kimbrough. Newer job titles include chief AI officer, AI engineer, head of AI, AI specialist, AI advisor and AI data scientist. The number of U.S. companies with a head of AI has nearly tripled in the last five years, according to LinkedIn’s report.

Other job sites are also seeing a boom in AI-related jobs. As of August 11, Indeed had 529 listings for generative AI-related jobs per one million postings on the site—its highest yet, up from 104 per million on November 30, 2022.
While hiring has slowed, Indeed economist Cory Stahle says, demand for people with AI skills is still high. “We’ve gone from this really fast boil to a still really warm pot of water here,” he says.
ZipRecruiter saw 1,309 generative AI-related job postings in July—its highest yet—compared to just 21 listings a year prior, the job search engine said.
Whether the jobs AI creates will outweigh the ones it erases won’t be clear for years. LinkedIn’s report follows months of reports predicting how many jobs AI will replace: Goldman Sachs estimates AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs. Employers surveyed by the World Economic Forum in a May report predict AI will eliminate 83 million jobs by 2027, but create 69 million—a net decrease of 14 million jobs.
John Sviokla, cofounder of advisory firm GAI Insights and a long-time AI advisor to companies like PwC, compares the buzz to “when people predicted drivers were going to go away” following the introduction of driverless cars. “That was exactly the wrong answer,” he says.
Other potential job titles predicted to grow: Ethicists and chief trust officers. As companies integrate more AI into their systems, says Sameer Maskey, founder of AI technology and education firm Fusemachines, it will be important for companies to be able to “showcase to their end users that they have done all the things required to make sure the system is not biased.”
The LinkedIn report also found that the platform’s users are rapidly adding AI-oriented skills to their profiles, a likely sign job seekers see AI opportunities increasing. The rate at which LinkedIn users added generative AI-related skills, such as natural language processing, classification or “question answering”—the ability to efficiently respond to questions in a way that best prompts AI models—has nearly doubled. In the seven months leading up to ChatGPT’s launch last November, that rate was 7.7%; in the seven months following it, it increased 13%.

	More than 100 days into the writers strike, fears have kept mounting over the possibility of studios deploying generative artificial intelligence to completely pen scripts. But intellectual property law has long said that copyrights are only granted to works created by humans, and that doesn’t look like it’s changing anytime soon.

	A federal judge on Friday upheld a finding from the U.S. Copyright Office that a piece of art created by AI is not open to protection. The ruling was delivered in an order turning down Stephen Thaler’s bid challenging the government’s position refusing to register works made by AI. Copyright law has “never stretched so far” to “protect works generated by new forms of technology operating absent any guiding human hand,” U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found.

	The push for protection of works created by AI has been spearheaded by Thaler, chief executive of neural network firm Imagination Engines. In 2018, he listed an AI system, the Creativity Machine, as the sole creator of an artwork called A Recent Entrance to Paradise, which was described as “autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine.” The Copyright Office denied the application on the grounds that “the nexus between the human mind and creative expression” is a crucial element of protection.



	Thaler, who listed himself as the owner of the copyright under the work-for-hire doctrine, sued in a lawsuit contesting the denial and the office’s human authorship requirement. He argued that AI should be acknowledged “as an author where it otherwise meets authorship criteria,” with any ownership vesting in the machine’s owner. His complaint argued that the office’s refusal was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which provides for judicial review of agency actions. The question presented in the suit was whether a work generated solely by a computer falls under the protection of copyright law.

	“In the absence of any human involvement in the creation of the work, the clear and straightforward answer is the one given by the Register: No,” Howell wrote.

	U.S. copyright law, she underscored, “protects only works of human creation” and is “designed to adapt with the times.” There’s been a consistent understanding that human creativity is “at the core of copyrightability, even as that human creativity is channeled through new tools or into new media,” the ruling stated.

	










	While cameras generated a mechanical reproduction of a scene, she explained that they do so only after a human develops a “mental conception” of the photo, which is a product of decisions like where the subject stands, arrangements and lighting, among other choices.

	“Human involvement in, and ultimate creative control over, the work at issue was key to the conclusion that the new type of work fell within the bounds of copyright,” Howell wrote.

	Various courts have reached the same conclusion. In one of the leading cases on copyright authorship, Burrow-Giles Lithographic Company v. Sarony, the Supreme Court held that there was “no doubt” that protection can be extended to photographs as long as “they are representative of original intellectual conceptions of the author.” The justices exclusively referred to such authors as human, describing them as a class of “persons” and a copyright as the “right of a man to the production of his own genius or intellect.”

	In another case, the a federal appeals court said that a photo captured by a monkey can’t be granted a copyright since animals don’t qualify for protection, though the suit was decided on other grounds. Howell cited the ruling in her decision. “Plaintiff can point to no case in which a court has recognized copyright in a work originating with a non-human,” the order, which granted summary judgment in favor of the copyright office, stated.

	The judge also explored the purpose of copyright law, which she said is to encourage “human individuals to engage in” creation. Copyrights and patents, she said, were conceived as “forms of property that the government was established to protect, and it was understood that recognizing exclusive rights in that property would further the public good by incentivizing individuals to create and invent.” The ruling continued, “The act of human creation — and how to best encourage human individuals to engage in that creation, and thereby promote science and the useful arts — was thus central to American copyright from its very inception.” Copyright law wasn’t designed to reach nonhuman actors, Howell said.

	










	The order was delivered as courts weigh the legality of AI companies training their systems on copyrighted works. The suits, filed by artists and artists in California federal court, allege copyright infringement and could result in the firms having to destroy their large language models.

	In March, the copyright office affirmed that most works generated by AI aren’t copyrightable but clarified that AI-assisted materials qualify for protection in certain instances. An application for a work created with the help of AI can support a copyright claim if a human “selected or arranged” it in a “sufficiently creative way that the resulting work constitutes an original work of authorship,” it said.

Check out our searchable Books3 database to find specific authors and titles. A deeper analysis of what is in the database is here.One of the most troubling issues around generative AI is simple: It’s being made in secret. To produce humanlike answers to questions, systems such as ChatGPT process huge quantities of written material. But few people outside of companies such as Meta and OpenAI know the full extent of the texts these programs have been trained on.Some training text comes from Wikipedia and other online writing, but high-quality generative AI requires higher-quality input than is usually found on the internet—that is, it requires the kind found in books. In a lawsuit filed in California last month, the writers Sarah Silverman, Richard Kadrey, and Christopher Golden allege that Meta violated copyright laws by using their books to train LLaMA, a large language model similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4—an algorithm that can generate text by mimicking the word patterns it finds in sample texts. But neither the lawsuit itself nor the commentary surrounding it has offered a look under the hood: We have not previously known for certain whether LLaMA was trained on Silverman’s, Kadrey’s, or Golden’s books, or any others, for that matter.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

US judge: Art created solely by artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted

Art generated entirely by artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted because ""human authorship is an essential part of a valid copyright claim,"" a federal judge ruled on Friday.
The US Copyright Office previously rejected plaintiff Stephen Thaler's application for a copyright because the work lacked human authorship, and he challenged the decision in US District Court for the District of Columbia. Thaler and the Copyright Office both moved for summary judgment in motions that ""present the sole issue of whether a work generated entirely by an artificial system absent human involvement should be eligible for copyright,"" Judge Beryl Howell's memorandum opinion issued Friday noted.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

Howell denied Thaler's motion for summary judgment, granted the Copyright Office's motion, and ordered that the case be closed.
Thaler sought a copyright for an image titled, ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise,"" which was produced by a computer program that he developed, the ruling said. In his application for a copyright, he identified the author as the Creativity Machine, the name of his software.
Image “created by a computer algorithm”
Thaler's application ""explained the work had been 'autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine,' but that plaintiff sought to claim the copyright of the 'computer-generated work' himself 'as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine,'"" Howell wrote. ""The Copyright Office denied the application on the basis that the work 'lack[ed] the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim,' noting that copyright law only extends to works created by human beings.""
The denial was in August 2019. Howell petitioned the Copyright Office again, saying that AI should be ""acknowledge[d]... as an author where it otherwise meets authorship criteria, with any copyright ownership vesting in the AI's owner."" The Copyright Office again refused to register the work in 2020 and 2022. Ars VideoHow The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release
""Because copyright law is limited to 'original intellectual conceptions of the author,' the Office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work,"" the second refusal letter in March 2020 said.
Thaler last year lost a different case over whether AI software can be the registered inventor on a patent. US patent law requires inventors to be human, a federal appeals court ruled in the August 2022 ruling against Thaler.
Plaintiff “put cart before the horse”
In the Friday ruling on copyright of an AI-generated image, Judge Howell wrote that Thaler attempted ""to complicate the issues presented by devoting a substantial portion of his briefing to the viability of various legal theories under which a copyright in the computer's work would transfer to him, as the computer's owner; for example, by operation of common law property principles or the work-for-hire doctrine."" But these arguments ""put the cart before the horse"" because they only address ""to whom a valid copyright should have been registered,"" not whether a copyright can be granted for a work generated without human involvement, Howell wrote.
""United States copyright law protects only works of human creation,"" Howell wrote.
Thaler ""correctly observes"" that ""copyright law has proven malleable enough to cover works created with or involving technologies developed long after traditional media of writings memorialized on paper,"" the ruling said. The US Copyright Act of 1976 says that copyright attaches to ""original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed... either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.""
""Underlying that adaptability, however, has been a consistent understanding that human creativity is the sine qua non at the core of copyrightability, even as that human creativity is channeled through new tools or into new media,"" Howell wrote.
Thaler pointed out that the Copyright Act does not define the word ""author."" But Howell wrote that the law's ""'authorship' requirement as presumptively being human rests on centuries of settled understanding.""

Generative AI is spearheading a significant revolution in the realm of work, with profound implications for both the present and the future. This transformative technology is reshaping the fundamental landscape of how tasks are accomplished and setting the stage for an evolution in work dynamics that will shape our upcoming professional landscape. Harnessing its power, PeopleStrong, a comprehensive Human Capital Management SaaS platform, unveiled the integration of Generative AI across its entire employee lifecycle. 
It harnessed advanced intelligence to simplify tasks throughout the employee journey, which included generating OKRs, coaching new joiners with nudges, creating comprehensive reports, and offering recommendations drawn from existing enterprise-wide people data.
Unveiling the advanced capabilities of HR Tech, Sandeep Chaudhary, CEO PeopleStrong said, “Over the course of the next decade, Artificial Intelligence, especially Generative-AI will redefine the role, structure and engagement of HR. PeopleStrong's integration of Generative AI is more than just a technological advancement; it's a strategic move towards a future where HR will transform into an experience led function. It's a future where technology and human insight merge to create a more responsive, intelligent, and human-centric approach to work.

TechnologyMcKinsey launches Lilli: An in-house generative AI tool for its workforceLilli was developed to adhere to McKinsey's exacting technology standards, utilising leading-edge platforms within the industry. 







 

McKinsey and Company, garnered attention earlier this year for its swift adoption of generative AI tools. In June, the company announced that almost half of its 30,000 employees had embraced this technology.

Now, the firm introduced its proprietary generative AI tool named Lilli. Developed by McKinsey's ClienTech team led by CTO Jacky Wright, Lilli is a fresh chat application tailored for the company's employees. Also Read:

This innovative tool offers a spectrum of functionalities, including dispensing information, insights, data, plans, and even suggesting the most suitable internal experts for consulting initiatives. These capabilities are founded on an extensive database of over 100,000 documents and interview transcripts.
“Lilli aggregates our knowledge and capabilities in one place for the first time and will allow us to spend more time with clients activating those insights and recommendations and maximising the value we can create. An engagement team will be able to spend more time on problem-solving, coaching, building capabilities, and helping clients achieve the performance they aspire to achieve” said Erik Roth, a senior partner with McKinsey who leads the firm’s development of Lilli and integrating Gen AI technologies into the way we work.
In honour of Lillian Dombrowski, the initial woman employed by McKinsey in a professional services capacity in 1945, the AI tool has been christened Lilli. Having undergone a beta phase since June 2023, Lilli is scheduled for a full-scale implementation throughout McKinsey this upcoming autumn.
How does Lilli operate? 
When a user inputs a question, Lilli can scan our extensive knowledge database, pinpointing five to seven of the most pertinent pieces of content. It then condenses the essential points, incorporates links, and can even recognize experts in the relevant domains. The platform offers two distinct modes: one for exploring McKinsey's internal knowledge repository and another option for external sources.
Lilli was meticulously crafted in alignment with McKinsey's rigorous technology benchmarks, employing top-tier platforms in the industry. The tool was then put to the test with actual users, including both consultants and internal clients. Phil Hudelson, a McKinsey partner at the helm of technology platform development, highlights that, in a way, the technological aspect was the straightforward aspect of this endeavour. 
The primary challenge lay in maintaining swiftness while engaging the appropriate stakeholders, including legal, cyber security, risk management, and talent development experts. This comprehensive approach was essential to ensure the tool's effectiveness firmwide.

        DEAR READERS: There’s a lot of concern out there about what artificial intelligence is going to do on the employment front, but I’ve heard that job seekers really can use AI to their advantage. Is that true? And how can people looking for a job get help from AI?Marc Cenedella, founder of Leet Resumes, is a good person to ask, considering he has been working in the AI and machine-learning space for three years.“I am confident in saying job applicants can view AI as a friend rather than a foe,” says Cenedella, who recommends that job seekers use “specialized AI platforms to ensure outputs are specifically tailored to their unique needs.”
“AI can be a valuable resource in several ways,” says Amelia Thomas, head of marketing for FlexiPCB.The areas in which AI can enhance results during a job search include:

Job recommendations. According to Thomas, AI-powered platforms can analyze your skills, experience, and preferences to recommend relevant job opportunities that align with your profile.
“This saves time and helps you discover positions you may not have come across otherwise,” she says.And while Cenedella says specialized AI is best for creating resumes, he notes that generic models can be useful in interview planning.
“It’s very helpful to prompt, ‘Give me a 500-word summary of (company name) written for someone applying for a job there.’ This will help you get a good summary of the company’s business,” he explains. “A job seeker can then ask, ‘Based on this pasted job description, what are the likely three top things the company is looking for in this candidate?’”Resume and cover-letter assistance.
“AI tools can help optimize keywords, offer formatting recommendations and enhance the overall effectiveness of your application materials,” Thomas says.Skill development. AI-based learning platforms can recommend personalized training programs and courses based on your desired skills and career goals.

“This can help you enhance your qualifications and stay competitive in the job market,” Thomas notes.Interview preparation. Because AI chatbots and virtual interview platforms can simulate interview scenarios, you can practice and refine responses to typical interview questions.“This helps build confidence, improve communication skills and enhance performance during interviews,” Thomas says.Networking and job-market insights.
“AI-powered platforms can assist you in expanding your professional network by suggesting relevant connections and networking opportunities,” says Thomas, who notes that they can also provide market insights, such as salary ranges and industry trends, to help you make informed career decisions.
As helpful as AI can be in a job search, Thomas adds one caution for anyone about to embark on a job search.“It is essential to complement AI tools with personal networking efforts and traditional job-search strategies for a well-rounded approach,” she stresses.
Cenedella also says it is important to clarify that ChatGPT and similar large language models “aren’t really artificial intelligence.”""They’re more like artificial conventional wisdom,"" he says. ""They simply predict the next word that should appear based on analysis of everything ever written. It produces generic, formulaic responses that won’t help anyone stand out. To leverage these services well, you need a firm understanding of what prompts to input, and that can be a job in itself.”

“Human authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright.” — Judge Beryl Howell, United States Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.

On Friday, Judge Beryl Howell issued an opinion in Dr. Stephen Thaler’s challenge against the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) over the denial of his application for a work generated entirely using generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The opinion supports the USCO’s refusal to register a work in which the claimant disclosed in the application that the image was the result of an AI system, called The Creativity Machine. The case is Stephen Thaler v. Shira Perlmutter and The United States Copyright Office (1:22-cv-01564) (June 2, 2022).
“Human authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright,” writes Judge Howell.
“We disagree with the District Court’s ruling,” Dr. Ryan Abbott shared in a written statement. “The public is the primary beneficiary of copyright law, and the public benefits when systems are in place to promote the generation and dissemination of new works, regardless of how they are created.”
“The Copyright Office believes the court reached the correct result. We are reviewing the decision, and we have no further comment at this time,” said a spokeperson from the Copyright Office.
Abbott serves as a member of the team representing Thaler in a variety of cases aiming to challenge intellectual property laws around the world when it comes to human authorship.
The opinion comes just over a year after the original complaint was filed against the USCO in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. following a series of three different letter opinions issued by the USCO’s Review Board. The lawsuit also named Shira Perlmutter, in her official capacity as Register of Copyrights and Director of the USCO. The image in question is known as “A Recent Entrance to Paradise,” and initially was claimed by Thaler to have been the result of a sentient machine, commonly referred to as the point of singularity.
Thaler filed a motion for summary judgment in January, arguing the only question at issue is: “Can someone register a copyright in a creative work made by an artificial intelligence?” The USCO filed a response in February along with a cross-motion for summary judgment. The motions were filed by reply briefs from Thaler in March and the USCO in April. The USCO argued, “[the USCO’s decision] was a well-reasoned decision based on the text of the Constitution and the Act, as well as Supreme Court and appellate decisions that uniformly support a human authorship requirement.”
 
Summary Judgment and the Administrative Records
In a one-page order, Judge Howell granted the USCO’s request for summary judgment (filed as a cross-motion) while also denying summary judgment to Thaler.
A longer memorandum decision was published simultaneously and highlights the impact the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) had on this particular case, which was limited to a judicial review of the actions taken by the administrative agency, the USCO in case. Additionally, the decision stems from summary judgment actions and is based solely on the question of law, meaning it’s limited to reviewing the administrative record.
The court immediately notes that the administrative record fails to include any of the additional detail Thaler argues in support of “his development, use, ownership, and prompting of the AI generating software”, which means it must ignore Thaler’s attempts at arguing “various legal theories” that jump over the analysis of whether copyright law recognizes non-human creation. 
Instead, Judge Howell writes that the “only question properly presented, then, is whether the Register acted arbitrarily or capriciously or otherwise in violation of the APA in reaching that conclusion.” 
The answer is made abundantly clear: “The Register did not err in denying the copyright registration application presented by plaintiff.”
In reference to sentient machines and AI, a footnote explains it’s “fun conjecture for academics,” quoting Justin Hughes in The Columbia Journal of Law & the Arts, to think about “authors” as anything but referring to humans, despite not being explicitly defined as such in the Copyright Act.
Judge Howell explains that Thaler’s work, despite being the output of an AI system, is “not nearly so complex” as other “new frontiers” the world is facing with copyright law and technological advancements. The main reasoning presented is pulled from the administrative record, pointing to Thaler’s “controlling role” and involvement in configuring The Creativity Machine to be able to output the image in question.
A turning point for this decision appears to be that Thaler never attempted to correct the application record as to his actual involvement in the synthetic output of the software. Therefore, the court reasons that the USCO was correct in denying the application as having no human authorship—again, as Thaler originally claimed— choosing to correctly overlook his later statements of having involvement.
The court concludes that the work never had any valid copyright upon its creation, and therefore it shouldn’t be registered. Also, it notes that there is no valid work-made-for-hire argument since there was no interest in a work to be transferred.
 
An Appeal in the Works
“We believe protection for AI-generated works is entirely consistent with the language of the Copyright Act and plan to appeal,” Abbott also explained.
Earlier this year, Thaler was denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court as part of an attempt to question the definition of “inventor” and whether it is limited to humans. It remains to be seen whether or not a similar outcome is on the horizon for Thaler in regard to copyright law.
The USCO has spent a significant amount of time during the past year simultaneously listening to and educating stakeholders on the subject of generative AI. Judge Howell’s opinion is directly in support of the USCO’s recent efforts.
The USCO currently interprets copyright law in the U.S. to not afford protections to works created by generative AI that have no human involvement. Instead, the spectrum of creativity is dependent upn the application of a de minimis standard and analysis to determine whether there was sufficient human authorship. Practically speaking, this approach requires separating out human and non-human contributions to a work.
Judge Howell’s decision does not come as much of a surprise to followers of these issues. As explained by the court in this decision, we’ve seen numerous times previously where courts consistently uphold a human authorship requirement, and there’s no reason this case should be any different simply because it involves generative AI.
For anything to change in copyright law, it will take congressional action. However for Thaler, it seems the battle was lost, but the war will continue.
