        8 insights boards should know about artificial intelligence

            By David Geer
7 May 2018
People and leadership skillsTechnology and analytics










Many businesses are only beginning to experiment with artificial intelligence (AI). But once fully embraced, the technology — which combines powerful computers, algorithms, and big data — has the potential to quickly transform workplaces.
Early adopters, such as tech giants Google and Amazon, are investing in AI to optimise searches and personalise marketing. Automakers are using AI to develop self-driving vehicles. And the financial services industry is looking to improve customers’ experience with the help of AI.
The more companies use the technology, the more potential for revenue and market share growth they see in it, according to a 2017 survey by consulting company McKinsey. The survey also suggests that successful adoption of AI requires strong leadership support. Add to that changes in how work is being done, and AI becomes a topic boards of directors may want to track, according to PwC.
To keep up with AI developments and their effects on businesses, boards should consider the following:
AI will require organisational retooling. Effective AI systems are driven by multidisciplinary teams whose members come together to solve a problem. Organisational retooling should break down silos that separate data into cartels and employees into isolated units.
Workforce upskilling will support a more collaborative approach to working and teach employees new skills.
AI-savvy employees don’t just need to know how to choose the right algorithm and feed data into a model. They’ll also have to know how to interpret the results. They’ll need to know when to let the algorithm decide and when to step in.
“While AI will provide useful insights for decision-making, employees can’t assume that AI will always be right,” said Alex Lattner, ACMA, CGMA, head of finance at the Deutsche Cyber Sicherheitsorganisation in Berlin, an organisation founded in 2015 to improve cybersecurity in German industry. “Human talent will evaluate and, if needed, overwrite the results of AI for various reasons. The database AI relies on might be biased and lead to unrealistic or unwanted outcomes.”
Boards should likewise take charge of AI. “Boards should regularly challenge AI outcomes to align them with corporate goals, targets, and strategy,” Lattner said.
AI will amplify human potential. More than half of about 500 executives surveyed by PwC last year said AI tools implemented in their businesses have increased productivity.
Tools already available can automate complex processes, identify trends in historical data to create business value, and provide forward-looking intelligence to strengthen human decisions.
“For example, AI might discover relationships like the impact of certain customer groups on total sales,” Lattner said. “Boards need to understand, challenge, and benefit from these insights to increase profitability.”
AI’s most powerful benefits are often indirect, and businesses may need new kinds of metrics to measure returns on investment, such as freeing employees from repetitive tasks or improving human decision-making.
AI will help the business do a lot more with big data. To make use of AI tools that can process data quickly, such as supervised machine learning and deep learning, enormous amounts of data must be standardised, labelled, and cleaned of biases and anomalies.
“Boards should therefore not be tempted to use AI regardless of the market they are in and the size of their business just because it is a major trend and they want to be part of it,” Lattner said. “AI makes no sense if you have, for example, just a handful of customers and act in a niche market.”
Only if the benefits exceed costs should a business move forward, because AI tools will most likely require a business to reform its data architecture and governance.
Functional specialists will guide AI customisation to ensure it supports the business use case. To customise an AI application for a specific business area, the computer scientists creating the application will need functional specialists, such as economists, financial analysts, or traders, to figure out the best design. Once the application is up and running, functional specialists will have to customise and tweak the technology.
The business must apply the sound judgement of the specialists who will use and benefit from AI to ensure it fits the specific use case. The company must first quell specialists’ concerns over potential job loss due to AI to get them on board, Lattner suggested.
“We can’t ignore the fact that these same specialists are afraid of losing their jobs with the introduction of AI-based processes,” he said. “Management must address these fears. Specialists and finance staff must be certain about their careers.”
One way to do that is to provide functional specialists with some basic understanding of AI.
Cyberattacks and cyber defence will leverage AI. The more AI advances, the more its potential for cyberattacks grows.
A US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition, the Cyber Grand Challenge, examined how to program AI systems to safeguard computer networks. Anti-virus companies are looking to AI to detect software anomalies. Hackers who create viruses are looking at how to keep virus scanners from seeing their malicious software, too.
“Boards need to be aware of this evolution and put their organisation in a position where they can protect sensitive data and react accordingly when an attack happens. From a finance position, this also implies the provision of corresponding budgets and headcount,” Lattner said.
To heighten cybersecurity, businesses should augment the data and compute platforms that support advanced analytics with privileged access monitoring, source code reviews, and expanded cybersecurity controls.
People will need to “look under the bonnet” of AI. The algorithms at the core of AI are often very complex or labelled trade secrets. Users who do not understand how AI arrives at a certain decision may not trust the technology.
Regulators will pass along pressure from consumers to companies that create and use AI, and they, in turn, will likely have to share some details of AI’s secret sauce. “This is true on the regulatory side in some parts of the world, where regulations require it,” said Pavan Udayagiri, ACMA, CGMA, manager, corporate finance and internal audit, at Grupo Kaybee, an international trading company, in Singapore.
Most AI algorithms can be understood, but if every step must be documented and explained, the process takes longer and becomes more expensive. A framework to assess business, performance, regulatory, and reputational concerns can balance the trade-off.
Countries will compete for AI market share. World governments are increasingly interested in AI market share and the leverage it will grant their countries and economies. By 2030, AI is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy.
“AI being one of the more powerful tools that humanity is going to experience (in this generation), there will be competition among countries for market share,” Udayagiri said.
World leaders in AI development include the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, and, particularly, China. About one-quarter of AI’s economic contribution is projected to be realised in China.
“China has a huge AI player in [technology company] Baidu. As far as China is concerned, they use AI for surveillance. The combination of AI and totalitarian regimes is concerning,” Lattner said.
There will be pressure to use AI responsibly. As AI affects decisions impacting people’s lives and careers, such as loan decisions, for example, the question of responsible use will become increasingly important, said Lattner. “Europe has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 25, 2018, dealing partly with the implications of AI on people and their right to get more information about their data and how organisations use it.”
Because AI will evolve faster than regulations and public awareness that pertain to AI, companies need to be proactive.
“Regarding AI, their biggest asset is trust,” Lattner said. Customers need to be confident about the quality and results of decisions that emanate from AI insights. In communicating with stakeholders, boards need to strike a balance between maintaining their competitive advantage — that is, keeping the “secret” of AI methods — and satisfying the legitimate interest of stakeholders in understanding the implications of AI use.

When Mark Zuckerberg told Congress Facebook would use artificial intelligence to detect fake news posted on the social media site, he wasn’t particularly specific about what that meant. Given my own work using image and video analytics, I suggest the company should be careful. Despite some basic potential flaws, AI can be a useful tool for spotting online propaganda – but it can also be startlingly good at creating misleading material.


This sure looks like Barack Obama saying some things he probably would never say.

Researchers already know that online fake news spreads much more quickly and more widely than real news. My research has similarly found that online posts with fake medical information get more views, comments and likes than those with accurate medical content. In an online world where viewers have limited attention and are saturated with content choices, it often appears as though fake information is more appealing or engaging to viewers.
The problem is getting worse: By 2022, people in developed economies could be encountering more fake news than real information. This could bring about a phenomenon researchers have dubbed “reality vertigo” – in which computers can generate such convincing content that regular people may have a hard time figuring out what’s true anymore.
Detecting falsehood
Machine learning algorithms, one type of AI, have been successful for decades fighting spam email, by analyzing messages’ text and determining how likely it is that a particular message is a real communication from an actual person – or a mass-distributed solicitation for pharmaceuticals or claim of a long-lost fortune.
Building on this type of text analysis in spam-fighting, AI systems can evaluate how well a post’s text, or a headline, compares with the actual content of an article someone is sharing online. Another method could examine similar articles to see whether other news media have differing facts. Similar systems can identify specific accounts and source websites that spread fake news.
An endless cycle
However, those methods assume the people who spread fake news don’t change their approaches. They often shift tactics, manipulating the content of fake posts in efforts to make them look more authentic. 
Using AI to evaluate information can also expose – and amplify – certain biases in society. This can relate to gender, racial background or neighborhood stereotypes. It can even have political consequences, potentially restricting expression of particular viewpoints. For example, YouTube has cut off advertising from certain types of video channels, costing their creators money.
Context is also key. Words’ meanings can change over time. And the same word can mean different things on liberal sites and conservative ones. For example, a post with the terms “WikiLeaks” and “DNC” on a more liberal site could be more likely to be news, while on a conservative site it could refer to a particular set of conspiracy theories. 
Using AI to make fake news
The biggest challenge, however, of using AI to detect fake news is that it puts technology in an arms race with itself. Machine learning systems are already proving spookily capable at creating what are being called “deepfakes” – photos and videos that realistically replace one person’s face with another, to make it appear that, for example, a celebrity was photographed in a revealing pose or a public figure is saying things he’d never actually say. Even smartphone apps are capable of this sort of substitution – which makes this technology available to just about anyone, even without Hollywood-level video editing skills.
Researchers are already preparing to use AI to identify these AI-created fakes. For example, techniques for video magnification can detect changes in human pulse that would establish whether a person in a video is real or computer-generated. But both fakers and fake-detectors will get better. Some fakes could become so sophisticated that they become very hard to rebut or dismiss – unlike earlier generations of fakes, which used simple language and made easily refuted claims.
Human intelligence is the real key
The best way to combat the spread of fake news may be to depend on people. The societal consequences of fake news – greater political polarization, increased partisanship, and eroded trust in mainstream media and government – are significant. If more people knew the stakes were that high, they might be more wary of information, particularly if it is more emotionally based, because that’s an effective way to get people’s attention.
When someone sees an enraging post, that person would do better to investigate the information, rather than sharing it immediately. The act of sharing also lends credibility to a post: When other people see it, they register that it was shared by someone they know and presumably trust at least a bit, and are less likely to notice whether the original source is questionable.
Social media sites like YouTube and Facebook could voluntarily decide to label their content, showing clearly whether an item purporting to be news is verified by a reputable source. Zuckerberg told Congress he wants to mobilize the “community” of Facebook users to direct his company’s algorithms. Facebook could crowd-source verification efforts. Wikipedia also offers a model, of dedicated volunteers who track and verify information.
Facebook could use its partnerships with news organizations and volunteers to train AI, continually tweaking the system to respond to propagandists’ changes in topics and tactics. This won’t catch every piece of news posted online, but  it would make it easier for large numbers of people to tell fact from fake. That could reduce the chances that fictional and misleading stories would become popular online.
Reassuringly, people who have some exposure to accurate news are better at distinguishing between real and fake information. The key is to make sure that at least some of what people see online is, in fact, true.

Future Tense is a  partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State  University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.
  

What do Suda the elephant and e-David the robot have in common? Both are capable of creating beautiful paintings, free(ish) of human intervention—one uses its trunk to clutch the brush, the other a mechanical arm (though whether Suda is truly “free” when she paints is a matter of serious contention). Each can even sign their work. The quality of their paintings does vary slightly, though of course, beauty is in the visual sensor of the beholder. Suda, who lives in a Thai elephant camp, paints self-portraits, simple outlines of elephants and trees, while e-David, a German robot, paints portraits of others with detailed shading, strokes tailored even down to the choice of brush. Despite their artistic differences, e-David and Suda have another thing in common: dubious rights to legal authorship of the fruits of their labor. Neither is able to hold copyright under current U.S. law.

For Suda, this seems unlikely to change. A long-running legal dispute over the creative ownership of a monkey’s selfie saw a loss for animal-kind last week, with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals on behalf of the animal. The selfie, which Naruto the crested macaque snapped in 2011 with a camera belonging to wildlife photographer David Slater, has been the subject of multiple lawsuits, with PETA recently attempting to claim Naruto is its true author—and therefore entitled to profits. It might be over for “Naruto’s” claim, however. The lawsuit had already been settled in Slater’s favor in a lower court, and it was reconfirmed, with the court ruling that copyright can only be claimed on behalf of humans.

In the time that the monkey selfie case has been ongoing (it even has its own Wikipedia page) the U.S. Copyright Office has re-emphasized the requirement of “human authorship” in intellectual property claims, updating its guidelines to explicitly rule out monkey selfies and elephant murals. According to the Next Web, some experts were looking to this latest court ruling as an important precedent in the non-human rights arena, with PETA lawyers claiming that “any law passed (or not) in Naruto’s favor could reflect the rights of other non-human entities.” Other non-human entities includes robots—because for now, bots don’t have intellectual property rights, either.

We apparently ascribe more value to chips and circuits than to flesh and blood.

But when it comes to A.I., the craftsmanship and creativity of the “non-human entity” is quickly surpassing that of animals (sorry, Suda)—potentially even reaching levels at which copyright consideration may be necessary. As John Frank Weaver once noted in Future Tense, robots are excelling in the creative fields, painting, writing, and composing original work, and they’ve only matured since then, writing novels and even poems. All this raises significant questions for copyright law. Do we want to protect the “intellectual property” of artificial intelligence?

Some have suggested that yes, we do. As Paresh Kathrani points out in the Conversation, intellectual property law is designed to recognize intelligence and incentivize progress—if we don’t give robots IP rights, some argue, we are failing to protect the value we give intelligence, In failing to recognize and appropriately reward complex work, even that done by robots, we dis-incentivize it, potentially slowing down human (?) progress to boot. Many experts, including Weaver, advocate for other forms of robot rights—from the right to free speech to the right to citizenship—especially as they gain sentience.

It’s not clear yet what rights we may eventually ascribe to robots. But it is clear that robots are in with a better shot at these rights than animals. No one outside of PETA is particularly up in arms about the anti-Naruto ruling—in fact, PETA has been portrayed as something of a joke in the coverage and by the courts. Robot rights, meanwhile, are being taken very seriously. While U.S. copyright can currently only be held by “legal persons,” this may not rule out robots for long. The EU is considering creating a specific category of personhood just for bots, meaning they may be eligible even without a change in IP law (though these overlapping jurisdictions are going to be messier than Suda’s handwriting). Others have suggested that if not robots, copyright benefits could instead flow to their owners or creators—copyright by human proxy.

What does it say about us as a species that we are more comfortable conferring privileges to machines than to non-human­–but-still-living beings? We apparently ascribe more value to chips and circuits than to flesh and blood, and we seem we more willing to listen to vested interests than to animal interests. Is it fear of Roko’s Basilisk that keeps us deferring to bots? Perhaps, as Nathan Heller suggests in this New Yorker essay, we feel—irrationally—as uncomfortable with robot cruelty as we do with animal cruelty because robot minds are made in our own image. This makes us better at anthropomorphizing bots than monkeys, despite our shared DNA with the latter. Or perhaps, in this case, it’s economics. Robots are themselves intellectual property. Time, thought, and human intelligence went into A.I., into making it capable of making valuable work—humans still want to reap the benefits of their creation’s creations. An A.I. developer wants in on the profits of a critically acclaimed, robot-penned novel—or maybe he just wants to write the sequel.
If we grant property rights to robots, humans (or at least some humans) win. The rights of the robot are ultimately the rights of the creator. But apparently if we grant rights to animals, humans—like David Slater—lose. And if there’s one thing humans like to do, it’s win.

                  Terrorism
                













There is a general tendency among counterterrorism analysts to understate rather than hyperbolize terrorists’ technological adaptations. In 2011 and 2012, most believed that the “Arab Spring” revolutions would marginalize jihadist movements. But within four years, jihadists had attracted a record number of foreign fighters to the Syrian battlefield, in part by using the same social media mobilization techniques that protesters had employed to challenge dictators like Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Hosni Mubarak, and Muammar Qaddafi.Militant groups later combined easy accessibility to operatives via social media with new advances in encryption to create the “virtual planner” model of terrorism. This model allows online operatives to provide the same offerings that were once the domain of physical networks, including recruitment, coordinating the target and timing of attacks, and even providing technical assistance on topics like bomb-making.» Subscribe to our new, weekly podcast Defense One Radio! Episode 2 begins here.Many analysts—and I fell prey to this error—brushed aside early concerns about the global diffusion of drone technology. The reason? We imagined that terrorists would use drones as we did, and believed that superior American airpower would blast theirs from the sky. But instead of trying to replicate the Predator, the Islamic State and other militant groups cleverly adapted smaller drones to their purposes. In the 2017 battle for Mosul, for example, the Islamic State (ISIS) dispatched small and agile consumer drones armed with grenades to harry the Iraqi forces assembled to retake the city.These uses of social media, encryption, and drones illustrate a key pattern: As a consumer technology becomes widely available, terrorists will look for ways to adapt it. Artificial intelligence will almost certainly end up fitting into this pattern.Like drones, AI will likely become much more widely available in commercial markets at reduced costs, and individuals will be able to modify and repurpose it. AI already enjoys diverse applications, from products like Apple’s Siri, to voice-to-text, to Facebook’s counter-extremism detection systems.

So how might terrorists use AI?Perhaps they will start with social-network mapping. ISIS’s early battlefield victories were enabled, in part, by ex-Baathist intelligence operatives who mapped a city’s key players and power brokers, monitored their pattern of life—and then helped ISIS to arrest or kill them. Similarly, when North African ISIS operatives attacked the Tunisian town of Ben Gardane in March 2016, the available evidence—including the efficient way they assassinated key security officials—suggested that the militants had similarly worked to learn the human terrain in advance. Will social networks built using AI capabilities reduce the intelligence burden on militant groups and make it easier for them to conquer towns and cities?What of the next generation of terror drones? Will they use AI-enabled swarming to become  more powerful and deadlier? Or think bigger: will terrorists use self-driving vehicles for their next car bombs and ramming attacks? How about assassinations?Max Tegmark’s book Life 3.0 notes the concern of UC Berkeley computer scientist Stuart Russell, who worries that the biggest winners from an AI arms race would be “small rogue states and non-state actors such as terrorists” who can access these weapons through the black market. Tegmark writes that after they are “mass-produced, small AI-powered killer drones are likely to cost little more than a smartphone.” Would-be assassins could simply “upload their target’s photo and address into the killer drone: it can then fly to the destination, identify and eliminate the person, and self-destruct to ensure that nobody knows who was responsible.”Thinking beyond trigger-pulling, artificial intelligence could boost a wide range of violent non-state actors’ criminal activities, including extortion and kidnapping, through the automation of social engineering attacks. The militant recruiters of the near-future may boost their online radicalization efforts with chatbots, which played a “small but strategic role” in shaping the Brexit vote.The 9/11 Commission’s report famously devoted an entire section to discussing how the 9/11 attacks’ success in part represented a failure in imagination by authorities. In recent years, we have seen multiple failures in imagination as analysts tried to discern what terrorists will do with emerging technologies. A failure in imagination as artificial intelligence becomes cheaper and more widely available could be even costlier.

Many feel anxious about the impact of new technology on their jobs. This is not new. In fact, it dates back at least to the Luddites movement at the outset of the Industrial Revolution. And it resurfaced during the Great Depression and again in the 1960s, following a period of high productivity growth, and in the 1980s at the outset of the IT revolution.
How can governments help? By investing in peoples’ skills.
A dramatic shift
In the past, technological advances have helped raise incomes for most. But we should not forget that the transitions involved—for workers, firms, sectors, and whole economies—have been difficult for many.
Many observers think the latest wave of technological innovation will be more disruptive than the ones in the past, especially for labor. They point to the timid growth of real wages and the falling labor share in national income in recent decades. New technological advances—in artificial intelligence, automation and robotics—might be even more dramatic. This is because of the presumed ease with which some technologies can substitute for a broad range of human skills.

Better by design
To begin, we need to understand the most recent wave of technology and its potential impact. Not all labor is replaceable, and artificial intelligence might transform jobs more than it will make them obsolete. And technological advances boost productivity, which over time creates new jobs, allows incomes and living standards to rise. In fact, our research indicates that the current slow wage dynamics is related to low productivity growth. But countries need policies  to harness the benefits of technological change, and to address its less-welcome repercussions on wages and inequality.

So, what should countries do?
First, countries need policies to facilitate labor reallocation and shorten periods during which labor remains idle. For example, re-allocating labor could be easier with a stronger, while temporary, unemployment insurance. And social benefits may need to be more portable. Denmark has strong labor market institutions which combine flexible hiring and firing rules with extensive active labor market policies and relatively generous safety nets. The system is generally successful in matching labor supply and demand, and unemployment is low by international comparison.
But this, by itself, may not help those who are less prepared to benefit from change. People need policies that provide them with opportunities. Building human capital is key. This could mean more or more effective public spending on education, making it responsive to market demands and providing opportunities for life-long learning. For example, Singapore offers unconditional grants to all adults for training throughout their working lives.

Redistribution through the tax-benefit system could be another way to spread the gains from technological advances. Some economies have used available fiscal space for redistribution to spread the gains from technological change more equitably. For example, Canada cut the tax rate for middle income earners to strengthen the middle class, and more recently, made income tax benefits more generous, including by expanding eligibility. While redistribution is part of each countries’ social contract, IMF research indicates that addressing inequality may be beneficial for growth, and therefore important for a country’s economy.
Redistribution, however, comes at the cost of efficiency. That said, if governments design policies in the right way, all income groups can still gain.
So what is our bottom line? Technological advances present incredible economic and social opportunities. But they need to be supported by the right policies to ensure that they bring benefits to all.

If AI remains under the control of market forces, it will inexorably result in a super-rich oligopoly of data billionaires who reap the wealth created by robots that displace human labor, leaving massive unemployment in their wake.But China’s socialist market economy could provide a solution to this. If AI rationally allocates resources through big data analysis, and if robust feedback loops can supplant the imperfections of “the invisible hand” while fairly sharing the vast wealth it creates, a planned economy that actually works could at last be achievable.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe more AI advances into a general-purpose technology that permeates every corner of life, the less sense it makes to allow it to remain in private hands that serve the interests of the few instead of the many. More than anything else, the inevitability of mass unemployment and the demand for universal welfare will drive the idea of socializing or nationalizing AI.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextDissenting Republican delegates sign protest of Trump platform At issue is the treatment of abortion in the new document.The “minority report” criticizes the 2024 platform’s lack of a “human life amendment.”

The billionaires of Google and Apple, who have been depositing company profits in offshore havens to avoid taxation, are hardly paragons of social responsibility. The ongoing scandal around Facebook’s business model, which puts profitability above responsible citizenship, is yet another example of how in digital capitalism, private companies only look after their own interests at the expense of the rest of society.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOne can readily see where this is all headed once technological unemployment accelerates. “Our responsibility is to our shareholders,” the robot owners will say. “We are not an employment agency or a charity.”Share this articleShareThese companies have been able to get away with their social irresponsibility because the legal system and its loopholes in the West are geared to protect private property above all else. Of course, in China, we have big privately owned Internet companies like Alibaba and Tencent. But unlike in the West, they are monitored by the state and do not regard themselves as above or beyond social control.It is the very pervasiveness of AI that will spell the end of market dominance. The market may reasonably if unequally function if industry creates employment opportunities for most people. But when industry only produces joblessness, as robots take over more and more, there is no good alternative but for the state to step in. As AI invades economic and social life, all private law-related issues will soon become public ones. More and more, regulation of private companies will become a necessity to maintain some semblance of stability in societies roiled by constant innovation.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementI consider this historical process a step closer to a planned market economy. Laissez-faire capitalism as we have known it can lead nowhere but to a dictatorship of AI oligarchs who gather rents because the intellectual property they own rules over the means of production. On a global scale, it is easy to envision this unleashed digital capitalism leading to a battle between robots for market share that will surely end as disastrously as the imperialist wars did in an earlier era.For the sake of social well-being and security, individuals and private companies should not be allowed to possess any exclusive cutting-edge technology or core AI platforms. Like nuclear and biochemical weapons, as long as they exist, nothing other than a strong and stable state can ensure society’s safety. If we don’t nationalize AI, we could sink into a dystopia reminiscent of the early misery of industrialization, with its satanic mills and street urchins scrounging for a crust of bread.The dream of communism is the elimination of wage labor. If AI is bound to serve society instead of private capitalists, it promises to do so by freeing an overwhelming majority from such drudgery while creating wealth to sustain all.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIf the state controls the market, instead of digital capitalism controlling the state, true communist aspirations will be achievable. And because AI increasingly enables the management of complex systems by processing massive amounts of information through intensive feedback loops, it presents, for the first time, a real alternative to the market signals that have long justified laissez-faire ideology — and all the ills that go with it.Going forward, China’s socialist market economy, which aims to harness the fruits of production for the whole population and not just a sliver of elites operating in their own self-centered interests, can lead the way toward this new stage of human development.If properly regulated in this way, we should celebrate, not fear, the advent of AI. If it is brought under social control, it will finally free workers from peddling their time and sweat only to enrich those at the top.

GeekWire’s Health Tech Podcast goes in-depth with tech innovators bringing new ideas and ingenuity to health and wellness.

In December of 2012, Su-In Lee was working at the University of Washington in Seattle. One day, she got the kind of call everyone fears: Her father, Cheol Lee, was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, a rare and aggressive form of the disease. By the time he was diagnosed, his cancer had already spread to other organs.
“It was a surprise to our family,” Lee said on the newest episode of GeekWire’s Health Tech Podcast. “The next day I just went back to Korea and met his doctor and then found that it’s incurable, especially in that stage.”
Not only was his cancer incurable, there actually isn’t a single drug designed to treat it. So Cheol’s doctors gave him a drug designed for pancreatic cancer, the organ next to the gallbladder. They hoped it would give him a few more weeks with his family.
“While I was taking care of my father, I kept thinking that it would be really great if we can find a drug that works for his cancer,” Lee said. “After three months, he passed away.”
Lee was changed by her father’s passing. She came back to Seattle with a new goal: Find a way to help cancer patients get the best treatment possible, even if that only means giving them a little bit more time with their family.
In the past five years, Lee — a professor of computer science and genome science at the UW — has grown that goal into a precision medicine program called MERGE. MERGE uses machine learning along with a patient’s DNA and other health data to predict which treatments will work best to help them fight the disease.
It’s just one of the growing number of precision medicine projects that are leveraging an expertise in artificial intelligence and a growing understanding of the human body to fight diseases of all shapes and sizes, from deadly cancer to the mysterious Alzheimer’s disease.
Hear Lee’s full story and learn more about precision medicine work in the most recent episode of GeekWire’s Health Tech Podcast. Listen in the player below or search for “Health Tech” to subscribe in your favorite podcast app.

Lee was singularly equipped to meet the challenge she set out for herself. She’s an expert in computational biology, using advanced computer science and biological data to understand the human body.
“So I kept thinking that if we understand the genetic and the molecular profile of my father’s individual cancer, we can potentially find the drug that’s going to work the best for him,” Lee said. “Even if it’s stage four. For patients in that stage, it’s really extending several months of the lifetime — it means a lot, to the patient and to the family.”
Heather Mefford, a pediatric neurologist and the deputy scientific director of Seattle’s Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, said that the approach isn’t just about finding the treatment that will extend the patient’s lifetime. There are many reasons precision medicine could be valuable to a patient.
“To decrease their risk for side effects, for example. To maximize the effect that the therapy that you give them is going to have at either treating or preventing a particular disease,” she said. It’s all about “making healthcare as efficient as possible for the individual.”
The approach is also helping scientists better understand the causes of some diseases, like Alzheimer’s.
 While I was taking care of my father, I kept thinking that it would be really great if we can find a drug that works for his cancer.
But Lee wanted to focus on cancer patients. She teamed up with two Seattle researchers and hematologists: Dr. Pamela Becker and Dr. Tony Blau, whose startup All4Cure was featured on a previous Health Tech episode.
Blau and Becker are hematologists, or blood cancer experts, so they focused on understanding acute myeloid leukemia, AML. It’s one of the most common kinds of leukemia.
To train the MERGE algorithm, Lee and her team extracted genetic profiles from 30 blood samples taken from Blau and Becker’s past patients. Thanks to new technology, we can create genetic profiles like this in just under a day.
But the amount of data it creates is immense. One person’s genetic profile can hold a terabyte of data. If you printed it into the average-sized paperback, that would be three million books, or about 20 percent of the Library of Congress.
That’s where machine learning comes in. Lee and her team used the genetic data from those patients — along with data on the drugs they took and how they responded — to train a machine learning algorithm. They also incorporated publicly available data on AML patients to expand the training set.
As it sorted through the data, the algorithm found patterns and started to make connections between certain genes and drugs. Interestingly enough, it made too many connections — Lee said teaching the algorithm how to tell the difference between important and unimportant connections was actually challenging.

“If this gene does something important in cancer, then that means that this association between that gene and in any drugs should be considered important,” Lee said. Genes that regulate tear ducts, for example, probably aren’t as important.
Today, MERGE is close to accurately predicting responses to some of the most common AML drugs. Lee and her team are continuing their work and even working on a more complex version of the system that can predict responses to multiple drugs at once.
Their work has been built on the data of real patients who were willing to share it anonymously in the name of science. Lee said her work, and the work of others, is dependent on the generosity of anonymous patients all over the world.
“I’ve been on both sides,” Lee said. “Patients really should consider giving their data. It’s like donating money — it can be better than that, actually. … I also got the data from my father’s sample. It wasn’t actually easy, you know — being a patient, I’m a little more emotional than being a scientist.”
She shared the data with the hospital where her father was treated. She wanted them to use it for research, in the hopes that one day it could lead to new treatments or cures for people like her father.
Editor’s note: Researcher Suman Jayadev‘s work is also included in this episode.

Those fundamental building blocks of civilization have led humans toward new kinds of innovation in the form of art, music, architecture and philosophy. These innovations have helped civilizations flourish and amplify human intelligence through various revolutions.
In the progress of human civilization, two major historical revolutions have been consequential: the Agricultural and the Industrial Revolution. The first one is the sole reason behind the creation of societies and the latter one helped enhance the overall productivity of society. But the Industrial Revolution has also changed the economy’s source of productivity from the farm to the factory.
The rise of a data-driven world
The 21st century has seen a new era of the rapid pace of technological changes. The information-technology revolution marked the shift from mechanical and analog electronic technology to digital electronics.
The massive increase in computational power and the rise of Internet-based services made the world more interconnected. It has affected the whole of our lives and almost every sector of modern human activity such as banking, trading, learning, teaching and management.
The Industrial Revolution increased man’s mechanical power, and information technology is extending man’s intellectual power through complex computing and technology. This thrust of intellectual power is leading humanity toward an intelligence explosion through artificial intelligence.
The start of a machine-based world order
“Artificial intelligence” used to refer to fascinating concepts of machines becoming intelligent enough to mimic the life of a human in regards to the decision-making process. But these days such machines have become a reality as well as an integral part of our lives and are actively becoming part of workplaces.

The best example is chatbots, which learn from our conversations and handle any complicated queries. This type of deep learning, which allows a machine to process information and reach a particular meaning without relying on predefined behavioral algorithms, is highly sophisticated.
These prototypes are considered non-sentient artificial intelligence, which performs only one function or task. But recent advances in this field through various technological innovations has proved that AI can perform complex multiple operations in fractions of a second. Recently, Google AlphaGo made history by beating a human opponent and winning a 2,000-year-old board game that is an order of magnitude more complex than chess and cannot be mastered through brute-force tactics.
Although the full potential of AI has not been reached yet, corporations and heavy industries have started incorporating some artificial intelligence in their day-to-day business operations to achieve efficiency gains.
As artificial intelligence goes mainstream, it is becoming part of our day-to-day personal lives through such products as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and the Apple HomePod. This has been seen as a Fourth Industrial Revolution that is reaching into our homes.
But the real question that must bother to humanity is whether this AI-led Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) will help solve the world’s most complex problems and what impacts it can bring to humanity in the near future.
We are already seeing the impacts of 4IR in the form of AI in health care, security and education, which mainly rely on data. Although the human brain is capable of comprehending the most complex data, it has a limitation, that is, the speed with which it processes data. This boundary of the human brain can be overcome by artificial intelligence.
AI can look directly into account variability in genes, environments, and lifestyles before the treatment of a disease. This will allow doctors to have more accurate data that will improve the precision of medical treatment, leading to the patient’s quick recovery.
AI will significantly help increase farm productivity by reducing wastage and implementing new techniques with far more precise agricultural processes.
The biggest potential impact of AI will be on the world of work and the job market. A recent report released by McKinsey & Company indicated that by 2030, more than 800 million workers worldwide would be replaced by AI and robots. The greatest job displacement is expected in the areas of transportation, storage, manufacturing and retail.
Soon, the challenge facing humanity will be regarded as man versus machine in terms of productivity and efficiency
Soon AI will take away the most repetitive and boring work, which will enable individuals to spend some quality time on a creative problem-solving, which will able to boost productivity.

The exponential rise of AI in society will have a massive impact on our lifestyles. There will be automated vehicles, and intelligent robots doing ordinary day-to-day work like answering e-mails and handling data-entry operations. But such a massive level of involvement of automated machines will help increase social unrest as it completely changes the nature of work.
The real danger to humanity is posed by sentient artificial intelligence. “Sentient AI” refers to a machine that is quite aware of itself and its close environment as well as having the ability to process massive amounts of data in real time. These conscious machines will be capable of raising the most basic questions about the legal and ethical problems regarding their own existence as slaves of humans rather than as their partners or even their masters.
What will be the future of humanity as it faces such intelligent machines that have more information, a far more complex structure and diverse laws based on codes? A society that develops around such smart machines will need to go through serious introspection to avoid the risk of becoming irrelevant.
The idea of Homo machinus is likely to be the only option for humanity, where human minds will have a closer merger with artificial intelligence before the advent of singularity. This race will be a product of a combination of biological intelligence with digital intelligence to help them compete with machines. This partnership of humans and machines will bring in a new civilization whose ethics and future cannot be comprehended at this moment.

Now, AI has come full circle and is helping neuroscientists better understand how our own brains work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"



For years, the people developing artificial intelligence drew inspiration from what was known about the human brain, and it has enjoyed a lot of success as a result. Now, AI is starting to return the favor.Although not explicitly designed to do so, certain artificial intelligence systems seem to mimic our brains’ inner workings more closely than previously thought, suggesting that both AI and our minds have converged on the same approach to solving problems. If so, simply watching AI at work could help researchers unlock some of the deepest mysteries of the brain.“There’s a real connection there,” said Daniel Yamins, assistant professor of psychology. Now, Yamins, who is also a faculty scholar of the Stanford Neurosciences Institute and a member of Stanford Bio-X, and his lab are building on that connection to produce better theories of the brain – how it perceives the world, how it shifts efficiently from one task to the next and perhaps, one day, how it thinks.A vision problem for AIArtificial intelligence has been borrowing from the brain since its early days, when computer scientists and psychologists developed algorithms called neural networks that loosely mimicked the brain. Those algorithms were frequently criticized for being biologically implausible – the “neurons” in neural networks were, after all, gross simplifications of the real neurons that make up the brain. But computer scientists didn’t care about biological plausibility. They just wanted systems that worked, so they extended neural network models in whatever way made the algorithm best able to carry out certain tasks, culminating in what is now called deep learning.Then came a surprise. In 2012, AI researchers showed that a deep learning neural network could learn to identify objects in pictures as well as a human being, which got neuroscientists wondering: How did deep learning do it?The same way the brain does, as it turns out. In 2014, Yamins and colleagues showed that a deep learning system that had learned to identify objects in pictures – nearly as well as humans could – did so in a way that closely mimicked the way the brain processes vision. In fact, the computations the deep learning system performed matched activity in the brain’s vision-processing circuits substantially better than any other model of those circuits.Around the same time, other teams made similar observations about parts of the brain’s vision– and movement-processing circuits, suggesting that given the same kind of problem, deep learning and the brain had evolved similar ways of coming up with a solution. More recently, Yamins and colleagues have demonstrated similar observations in the brain’s auditory system.On one hand, that’s not a big surprise. Although the technical details differ, deep learning’s conceptual organization is borrowed directly from what neuroscientists already knew about the organization of neurons in the brain.But the success of Yamins and colleagues’ approach and others like it depends equally as much on another, more subtle choice. Rather than try to get the deep learning system to directly match what the brain does at the level of individual neurons, as many researchers had done, Yamins and colleagues simply gave their deep learning system the same problem: Identify objects in pictures. Only after it had solved that problem did the researchers compare how deep learning and the brain arrived at their solutions – and only then did it become clear that their methods were essentially the same.“The correspondence between the models and the visual system is not entirely a coincidence, because one directly inspired the other,” said Daniel Bear, a postdoctoral researcher in Yamins’ group, “but it’s still remarkable that it’s as good a correspondence as it is.”One likely reason for that, Bear said, is natural selection and evolution. “Basically, object recognition was a very evolutionarily important task” for animals to solve – and solve well, if they wanted to tell the difference between something they could eat and something that could eat them. Perhaps trying to do that as well as humans and other animals do – except with a computer – led researchers to find essentially the same solution.Seek what the brain seeksWhatever the underlying reason, insights gleaned from the 2014 study led to what Yamins calls goal-directed models of the brain: Rather than try to model neural activity in the brain directly, instead train artificial intelligence to solve problems the brain needs to solve, then use the resulting AI system as a model of the brain. Since 2014, Yamins and collaborators have been refining the original goal-directed model of the brain’s vision circuits and extending the work in new directions, including understanding the neural circuits that process inputs from rodents’ whiskers.In perhaps the most ambitious project, Yamins and postdoctoral fellow Nick Haber are investigating how infants learn about the world around them through play. Their infants – actually relatively simple computer simulations – are motivated only by curiosity. They explore their worlds by moving around and interacting with objects, learning as they go to predict what happens when they hit balls or simply turn their heads. At the same time, the model learns to predict what parts of the world it doesn’t understand, then tries to figure those out.While the computer simulation begins life – so to speak – knowing essentially nothing about the world, it eventually figures out how to categorize different objects and even how to smash two or three of them together. Although direct comparisons with babies’ neural activity might be premature, the model could help researchers better understand how infants use play to learn about their environments, Haber said.On the other end of the spectrum, models inspired by artificial intelligence could help solve a puzzle about the physical layout of the brain, said Eshed Margalit, a graduate student in neurosciences. As the vision circuits in infants’ brains develop, they form specific patches – physical clusters of neurons – that respond to different kinds of objects. For example, humans and other primates all form a face patch that is active almost exclusively when they look at faces.Exactly why the brain forms those patches, Margalit said, isn’t clear. The brain doesn’t need a face patch to recognize faces, for example. But by building on AI models like Yamins’ that already solve object recognition tasks, “we can now try to model that spatial structure and ask questions about why the brain is laid out this way and what advantages it might give an organism,” Margalit said.Closing the loopThere are other issues to tackle as well, notably how artificial intelligence systems learn. Right now, AI needs much more training – and much more explicit training – than humans do in order to perform as well on tasks like object recognition, although how humans succeed with so little data remains unclear.A second issue is how to go beyond models of vision and other sensory systems. “Once you have a sensory impression of the world, you want to make decisions based on it,” Yamins said. “We’re trying to make models of decision making, learning to make decisions and how you interface between sensory systems, decision making and memory.” Yamins is starting to address those ideas with Kevin Feigelis, a graduate student in physics, who is building AI models that can learn to solve many different kinds of problems and switch between tasks as needed, something very few AI systems are able to do.In the long run, Yamins and the other members of his group said all of those advances could feed into more capable artificial intelligence systems, just as earlier neuroscience research helped foster the development of deep learning. “I think people in artificial intelligence are realizing there are certain very good next goals for cognitively inspired artificial intelligence,” Haber said, including systems like his that learn by actively exploring their worlds. “People are playing with these ideas.”

                ","For policymakers anywhere, the best way to make decisions is to base them on evidence, however imperfect the available data may be. But what should leaders do when facts are scarce or non-existent? That is the quandary facing those who must grapple with the fallout of &ldquo;advanced predictive algorithms&rdquo; &ndash; the binary building blocks of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). In academic circles, AI-minded scholars are either &ldquo;singularitarians&rdquo; or &ldquo;presentists.&rdquo; Singularitarians generally argue that while AI technologies pose an existential threat to humanity, the benefits outweigh the costs. But although this group includes many tech luminaries and attracts significant funding, its academic output has so far failed to prove their calculus convincingly. On the other side, presentists tend to focus on the fairness, accountability, and transparency of new technologies. They are concerned, for example, with how automation will affect the labour market. But here, too, the research has been unpersuasive. For example, MIT Technology Review recently compared the findings of 19 major studies examining predicted job losses, and found that forecasts for the number of globally &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; jobs vary from 1.8mn to 2bn. Simply put, there is no &ldquo;serviceable truth&rdquo; to either side of this debate. When predictions of AI&rsquo;s impact range from minor job-market disruptions to human extinction, clearly the world needs a new framework to analyse and manage the coming technological disruption. To be sure, incomplete data are a common problem for technology researchers. Even under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conditions, the study of emerging technologies is like solving a puzzle in the dark with a dim flashlight. The assumptions of established theories are not questioned, and securing beneficial outcomes is a matter of quantifying probabilities of adverse events and consequently managing the associated risks. But every so often, a &ldquo;post-normal&rdquo; scientific puzzle emerges, something philosophers Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome Ravetz first defined in 1993 as a problem &ldquo;where facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high, and decisions urgent.&rdquo; For these challenges &ndash; of which AI is one &ndash; policy cannot afford to wait for science to catch up. At the moment, most AI policymaking occurs in the Global North, which deemphasises the concerns of less developed countries and makes it harder to govern dual-use technologies. Worse, policymakers often fail adequately to consider the potential environmental impact, and focus almost exclusively on the anthropogenic effects of automation, robotics, and machines. Even without reliable data, decision-makers must move forward with AI governance. And, as the world waits for scientific certainty (which may never arrive), there is an existing solution that can guide us into the unknown: the &ldquo;precautionary principle.&rdquo; Adopted globally in 1992 as part of the United Nations Rio Convention on sustainable development, and later incorporated into one of the European Union&rsquo;s founding treaties, the precautionary principle states that a lack of certainty cannot be a basis for failing to protect human health or the environment. That seems like a suitable way to address the uncertainty of a tech-driven future. The precautionary principle is not without its detractors. But while its merits have been debated for years, we need to accept that the lack of evidence of harm is not the same thing as evidence of lack of harm. This simple idea has been applied to myriad human development issues &ndash; from public health to infant mortality. There are three good reasons why AI should be next. For starters, applying the precautionary principle to the context of AI would help rebalance the global policy discussion, giving weaker voices more influence in debates that are currently monopolised by corporate interests. Decision-making would also be more inclusive and deliberative, and produce solutions that more closely reflected societal needs. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and The Future Society at Harvard&rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government are already spearheading work in this participatory spirit. Additional professional organisations and research centres should follow suit. Moreover, by applying the precautionary principle, governance bodies could shift the burden of responsibility to the creators of algorithms. A requirement of explainability of algorithmic decision-making can change incentives, prevent blackboxing, help make business decisions more transparent, and allow the public sector to catch up with the private sector in technology development. And, by forcing tech companies and governments to identify and consider multiple options, the precautionary principle would bring to the fore neglected issues, like environmental impact. Rarely is science in a position to help manage an innovation long before the consequences of that innovation are available for study. But, in the context of algorithms, machine learning, and AI, humanity cannot afford to wait. The beauty of the precautionary principle lies not only in its grounding in international public law, but also in its track record as a framework for managing innovation in myriad scientific contexts.

Silicon Valley might not like the idea of war, Lt. Col. Garry Floyd said Tuesday, but it happens. And when it does, the military wants to be sure that America’s forces have the best technology possible — not only to win the fight but also to minimize its footprint.
In delicately delivered comments at this week’s Modular Open Systems Summit, Floyd, who serves as deputy chief of the Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team (also known as Project Maven), spoke about the status of his work, identified key lessons learned and responded to recent criticism from the West Coast.
Project Maven, which is led by Air Force Lt. Gen. John “Jack” Shanahan, is an artificial intelligence and machine learning project that aims to help Air Force analysts make better use of full-motion video surveillance. Instead of having human operators sift through hours and hours of surveillance video, Project Maven deploys an AI algorithm that can aid with some of this grunt work.
The Project Maven team is small, but it has some assistance from industry leaders, including Google. However, not everyone at Google in on board with the idea.

In April, the New York Times reported that “thousands” of Google employees had signed a letter urging the company to cease involvement with Project Maven. “We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,” the letter reads. The individuals who signed the letter are concerned about an increase in drone strikes. Google, meanwhile, has described its involvement as “non-offensive.”
Floyd sees the situation a little differently. In his eyes, the “business of war” is unavoidable. What’s negotiable is the tools one has available while on the battlefield.
“Those of us who are in uniform — we know that the call will come and that we will go down range and we’ll answer the call,” Floyd said. “That will happen. It will happen more often then we want it to happen, but we know it will happen… so we hope that we’ll have the best tools we can possibly have to help us do our jobs.”
“A good decision means you accomplish your mission quicker,” he continued. “A good decision means you minimize things like collateral damage, unintended casualties and all those other things.”
And AI systems like Project Maven, Floyd said, show promise in helping warfighters make good decisions more often.

“I think what you’ll see is there will be those who will partner with us and will help us do the things that we need to do to be successful,” Floyd said. “Because success revolves around accomplishing the mission rapidly so we can all come home safe and so that we keep collateral damage to a minimum.”
While Project Maven is still in “very very early” stages, Floyd said, it has already been deployed to five or six combat locations including the United States Africa Command. There, the team is testing its “prototype warfare” strategy — deploying a capacity that is around “80 percent” there and getting comfortable with the idea of making improvements “on the fly.”
There’s a button right in the Project Maven user interface, Floyd said, that says “train AI.” This allows for the retraining and improvement of the algorithm based on new data, and it’s a key capacity. After deploying Project Maven to AFRICOM in December, Floyd told the crowd, the team updated the algorithm about six times in five days.
“It’s not all that different, if you think about it, than a young airman,” Floyd said. “On their first day of work its going to take them a little while to understand what’s going on, to understand the mission … you see a similar version of that with the AI.”

KEY TAKEAWAYS
As computing power has increased, programming languages have evolved to take advantage of enhanced computing resources.




Programming languages were used even before computers were invented. For example, a player piano scroll, that long roll of encoded paper tape, is considered an early form of programming because it contained the instructions needed to make a piano play a tune.
The first computers were programmed by flipping switches and changing the configuration of the hardware. As a result, early programmers had to be intimately familiar with computer hardware. But we’ve come a long way, and high-level programming languages require little or no knowledge of the underlying hardware.
Let's take a look at how we got this far by covering the five generations of computer programming languages. (Get some background on some of the key figures in the field in The Pioneers of Computer Programming.)
The First Generation – Programming at the Machine Level
First-generation programming languages (1GL) are often known as machine languages or machine code. They operate at the lowest level of abstraction (closest to the hardware) of all languages. First-generation languages deal directly with the binary zeros and ones that are used to store and process information in a computer. Programs in higher-level languages must be compiled or assembled into machine code in order to run.
First-generation languages were used to program first-generation computers such as UNIVAC I and the IBM 701. (To learn more about early programming, see The Women of ENIAC: Programming Pioneers.)
The Second Generation – Some Assembly Required
Second-generation languages (2GL), often known as assembly languages, were developed largely because of the difficulty in programming with first-generation languages. Although still low-level languages, assembly languages introduced the use of symbolic codes (called mnemonics) to represent instructions to the computer. A program in assembly language is translated into machine code by means of a utility known as an assembler.Advertisements




Since they operate at the lowest level of abstraction, second-generation languages offer the benefits of speed and minimum code size. They also enable a programmer to directly manipulate hardware components such as memory locations and registers. At one time, assembly languages were used to program operating systems and applications that required smaller, faster-running code, such as video games. Examples of games written in assembly language include console games for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis platform and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System platform.
Although largely supplanted by higher-level languages, assembly languages are still used in situations where hardware interaction is required or performance must be optimized. Some compilers for higher-level languages compile source code to an assembly language before invoking an assembler to compile to machine code.
The Third Generation – Gentleman’s C and Others
The third generation of programming languages (3GL) includes high-level languages such as C, C++, Fortran, COBOL, BASIC, C# and Java. Third-generation programming languages represent a major improvement in usability over assembly languages.
Unlike assembly languages, third-generation languages are not machine-specific. When programming with a third-generation language, a programmer writes the source code for the program and then uses a compiler to translate it into object code (or machine code), which can be understood by the targeted computer.
The development of programming paradigms such as structured programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) coincided with the development of third-generation languages.
The Fourth Generation – Programmer Enhancement
Fourth-generation programming languages (4GL) were created to enhance programmer productivity in specific domains such as database querying and report generation.
The syntax of a fourth-generation language is generally closer to human language than the syntax from previous generations of programming languages. A single statement in a fourth-generation language can automatically generate the equivalent of a series of instructions in a third-generation language, reducing the time it takes to develop an application.
Examples of fourth-generation languages include Structured Query Language (SQL), Informix-4GL and ColdFusion.
The Fifth Generation – Watson, I Presume
Fifth-generation languages (5GL) are often used in the realm of artificial intelligence.
The traditional unit of computation is the algorithm, which is basically a step-by-step procedure for calculating a solution. Fifth-generation languages attempt to go beyond the algorithm by defining the conditions (or properties) for a solution and allowing the computer to determine the possible solutions that meet the specified conditions.
An example of a fifth-generation language is Prolog, which was one of the languages used to program IBM’s Watson in preparation for its participation on the television quiz show ""Jeopardy!""
Why Should I Care?
There you have it, the generations of programming languages really aren't that hard to understand. A good mental model is the higher up you get, the further abstracted you are from the hardware. This means less control, but also less work to accomplish something through programming.
Why does this matter? While theoretical, it's key to understand where your development fits in. Many developers spend the majority of their day in an integrated development environment for a 3GL language, so understanding that a language is 2GL or 4GL gives you some perspective as to the level of detail required to produce usable code. In general, working with a 2GL language is going to be more complex than a 3GL language. On the other hand, you can accomplish much less with a 4GL language like SQL than with a 3GL like C.
Where to From Here?
Will there be additional generations of programming languages? Some computer professionals consider graphical development environments to be a separate programming language generation. With the advent of apps, it's easier and easier to develop new software. Some people also point to concepts like ""build your own app"" as evidence that even regular users will be developers in certain areas. In any event, it’s likely that future generations of programmers will have new generations of programming languages to assist them.

The winners of California State University, Northridge’s first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) student venture competition — dubbed AI-Jam — were chosen in April at an event that took place at CSUN’s Jack and Florence Ferman Presentation Room in the Delmar T. Oviatt Library.
Each team participated in a showcase and were scored on their project’s use of artificial intelligence, or “AI-ness,” feasibility and quality.
The AI-Jam competition, created by CSUN’s Department of Information Technology, included two tracks: research and innovation.
KLab’s Butterflies, an artificial intelligence project that uses a robot to mimic a child with a behavioral or learning challenge, was awarded first place in the research track. The goal of KLab’s Butterflies is to more effectively train students on how to work with children who express similar reactions as the robot.
The KLab’s Butterflies team is made up of CSUN students Vahe Esmaeili, Ryan Moradpour, Victory Ramirez and Christina Saez. After winning AI-Jam, Saez said that the group plans “on utilizing artificial intelligence to create realistic simulations for practical, individualized training.”
Anyone interested in joining or collaborating with KLab’s Butterflies can visit their website, https://klab-csun.weebly.com.
AI-Adventurers won second place in research at the inaugural AI-Jam competition. The team’s project takes an approach to healthy eating using AI and image recognition to aid in portion control.
Third place in the research track went to Helia Nutrition and Health. The project aims to increase the accuracy of individual food logs by using AI and image recognition to track an individual’s daily food intake.
The innovation track had nine participating teams, including Agora, Fetch Bot, AI-Amigos, Deaf Connect and AI-Caramba.
The first-place winners in the innovation track were AI-Amigos, whose project goal was to help students excel in their careers by using a chatbot on Facebook to ask the CSUN Career Center questions that students have about the center’s services.
CSUN students and Career Center student assistants Diego Cobian, Marilyn Hightower, Natalia Moscoso, Lorena Roque and Jemma Tiongson joined forces to make up AI-Amigos. They said that winning first place was a surprise and an honor.

“We were super excited and happy, of course!” Tiongson said. “We’re glad we all work at a place like the Career Center, where we are supervised by Ana Penaranda. She really pushes us to achieve new personal heights in technology.”

Second and third place in innovation went to Deaf Connect and AI-Caramba, respectively. Deaf Connect is a project that uses machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence to help the Deaf community access more resources, such as speech-to-text translation.
AI-Caramba uses natural language processing to recognize voice commands through Alexa by Amazon, to help students find information about the Career Center in a more intuitive and friendly manner.

What, in other words, would the art world look like with a few more Ian Chengs around?Cheng has been working with AI since 2015, inspired as much by Sims 3 creator Richard Evans as by conventional artists. His first foray into this medium, called Emissaries, is currently on show at London’s Serpentine Gallery. Cheng describes the works as “computer games that play themselves.”The three worlds/games – The Squat of Gods, Forks at Perfection and Sunsets the Self, in chronological order – flicker through improvised narrative loops on giant screens in three separate rooms at the gallery. In the first, loosely rendered figures wander from task to place to interaction, like a Sims game left unattended. In the second, clearly defined dogs gambol amongst fast-moving clumps of animated grass. In the final room, the action takes place on a blasted heath with curious expanding lakes of yellow goo breaking into smaller pieces, pursued by shambling creatures that try to burn them or tear them apart.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIThe stories are set millennia apart in the same place, a landscape that evolves from volcano to lake to atoll. Each world is peopled by sentient AI agents. Using skills gained studying cognitive science at Berkeley and working at visual-effects company Industrial Light & Magic as well as a team of coders, Cheng has bestowed each agent three “mini brains”.“There’s the ‘threat brain’, fight or flight, then there’s the ‘limbic brain’ for desires and meanings – both influenced by the Sims AI where each Sim tried to meet its needs,” Cheng explains. “If these slow burning needs aren’t met, the agents become hungry and angry. When they are all satisfied, the ‘narrative brain’ cuts in and they start on their way to achieving goals.”In each game, one agent – the Emissary – has a more sophisticated purpose. In The Squat of Gods, this is a small girl who knows the volcano her tribe are living on is set to blow and tries to get everyone to leave. In Forks at Perfection, the AI is a curious combination of a dog and a long, thin, golden collar-and-lead called Sheba. The lead is the driving agent - the dog just a vehicle, abandoned by the lead when its usefulness expires. Together they’re searching for a perfect version of life and a way to understand humanity in a world of intelligent plants and the reanimated corpse of a 21st century celebrity. Finally, in Sunsets the Self, the Emissary is a sentient yellow puddle trying to achieve life by animating a Wormleaf anemone – racing against the semi-human Oomen, who want to burn each Wormleaf as it rises.

It’s hard not to impose your own storylines on the figures as they wander from task to task and interaction to interaction with unfathomable purpose. Cheng’s AIs have been coded with basic goals and try to achieve them. The methods they use are up to them. Once started, they follow their own paths, in ways the artist hadn’t imagined.Advertisement“It was hard to do at first,” Cheng explains. “All the artists I know are hyper control freaks creating art that’s perfected and left in a gallery. That feels like the evidence of energy expended – the debris left over from the act of creation. But in a world where everything is changing, our culture should reflect work that’s changing so I wanted to create something that feels alive, and would… misbehave…”Cheng’s lessons from Emissaries lead to BOB, his most audacious wrestling of an AI consciousness into an interactive art work. Created for the Serpentine Gallery, where it played in April, BOB is an animated body based on slime mould with an AI mind that grows, moves, reacts, plays and explores in a persistent, irreversible, ageing life.“Every 10-15 seconds BOB is sampling its environment and storing 25 different parameters, from its metabolism to how many heads it currently has, which it snapshots and stores - creating what I call a memory,” says Cheng. “Later, when it searches in its memory, it compares previous moments and measures if things are better or worse, happier or sadder, hungry or upset by food…”There are six separate BOBs – short for “Bag Of Beliefs”. When spawned, they resemble stripped red tadpoles with a cluster of eyes on their head. As they grow, new bodies branch off and new mini heads – Cheng calls them babyheads – sprout. Sometimes they work together. Sometimes they literally tear themselves apart, leaving decaying green corpse fragments dotted across the screen.During BOB’s stay at the Serpentine, visitors could interact with them by effectively Skyping in to one of the babyheads. “They’d normally try to take control of BOB and move towards an arch at the back of the screen,” explains Kay Watson, the gallery’s digital curator. “Sometimes BOB would get fed up and kick people out, which upset a surprising number of visitors - we’re not used to art that rejects us. One BOB simply refused to interact or grow and just sits in the middle of screen. We can’t work out if it’s desperately unhappy or supremely content.”She takes Wired into the control room at the heart of the gallery, built in the most impressive room usually reserved for spectacular works. For Cheng’s stay, it’s a hidden media lab controlling the Emissaries and still hosting the BOBs, which writhe and wriggle at varying speeds with what appears to be urgent purpose.“With BOB I’m trying to integrate different models of AI,” explains Cheng. “I wanted to create an interface to discuss how we think and talk about AI whilst forgetting the actual AI is there. I’d like us to see them as artificial lifeforms rather than spend so much time talking and arguing about the tech. The least interesting thing about Shakespeare is the guys who created papyrus in ancient Egypt. It’s the difference between creating paper and using paper to explore what it is to be human.”What has all this taught Cheng about being human? He pauses, then offers a practical rather than philosophical response. “I learned that the body matters,” he explains. “The body the AI is stuck in determines how it evolves and how it feels. It made me appreciate that the state of my body completely affects my brain – so I’m going to the gym a whole lot more these days.”Ian Cheng's Emissaries is on show at the Serpentine Galleries until May 28.This article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Created for the Serpentine Gallery, where it played in April, BOB is an animated body based on slime mould with an AI mind that grows, moves, reacts, plays and explores in a persistent, irreversible, ageing life.
“Every 10-15 seconds BOB is sampling its environment and storing 25 different parameters, from its metabolism to how many heads it currently has, which it snapshots and stores - creating what I call a memory,” says Cheng. “Later, when it searches in its memory, it compares previous moments and measures if things are better or worse, happier or sadder, hungry or upset by food…”
There are six separate BOBs – short for “Bag Of Beliefs”. When spawned, they resemble stripped red tadpoles with a cluster of eyes on their head. As they grow, new bodies branch off and new mini heads – Cheng calls them babyheads – sprout. Sometimes they work together. Sometimes they literally tear themselves apart, leaving decaying green corpse fragments dotted across the screen.
During BOB’s stay at the Serpentine, visitors could interact with them by effectively Skyping in to one of the babyheads. “They’d normally try to take control of BOB and move towards an arch at the back of the screen,” explains Kay Watson, the gallery’s digital curator. “Sometimes BOB would get fed up and kick people out, which upset a surprising number of visitors - we’re not used to art that rejects us. One BOB simply refused to interact or grow and just sits in the middle of screen. We can’t work out if it’s desperately unhappy or supremely content.”
She takes Wired into the control room at the heart of the gallery, built in the most impressive room usually reserved for spectacular works. For Cheng’s stay, it’s a hidden media lab controlling the Emissaries and still hosting the BOBs, which writhe and wriggle at varying speeds with what appears to be urgent purpose.
“With BOB I’m trying to integrate different models of AI,” explains Cheng. “I wanted to create an interface to discuss how we think and talk about AI whilst forgetting the actual AI is there. I’d like us to see them as artificial lifeforms rather than spend so much time talking and arguing about the tech. The least interesting thing about Shakespeare is the guys who created papyrus in ancient Egypt. It’s the difference between creating paper and using paper to explore what it is to be human.”
What has all this taught Cheng about being human? He pauses, then offers a practical rather than philosophical response. “I learned that the body matters,” he explains. “The body the AI is stuck in determines how it evolves and how it feels. It made me appreciate that the state of my body completely affects my brain – so I’m going to the gym a whole lot more these days.”
Ian Cheng's Emissaries is on show at the Serpentine Galleries until May 28.

For Michael Schmitz, working at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) is arguably the best of all worlds.
Schmitz, who is a director of engineering at the Seattle-based organization, loves being able to marshal teams of engineers to tackle a problem, compared to the more limited resources and individual projects common in academic research. He gets to work on multiple projects at once. AI2’s goal is to make a positive difference in the world by creating tools for AI researchers, a mission that resonates with Schmitz. And it all takes place in the mossy Northwest, not far from family and his hometown of Everett.
“We’re an organization funded by (Microsoft co-founder) Paul Allen, who is an engineer at heart, and he was open to a company that had a strong financial investment and a good balance between researchers and engineers,” Schmitz said.
Schmitz joined AI2 soon after it launched in 2013. As a computer science undergraduate at the University of Washington, Schmitz had worked as a research programmer for Oren Etzioni, AI2’s CEO.
“As an early employee at the company, I’ve worn many hats,” Schmitz said. “I bootstrapped the engineering team when our company started, designed the early architecture of project Aristo, and led the engineering team on Semantic Scholar.”
Aristo is an AI system that can read, learn and ultimately reason about scientific information. Semantic Scholar — which earlier this week hired former Amazon Alexa engineer Doug Raymond — is a tool for academic literature research.
Schmitz’s current projects include managing AI2’s infrastructure team, which is focused on strategic investments, and the Beaker team, which is building a product for researchers to run and organize experiments in the cloud. Most of his time is spent on AllenNLP, an open-source research library that will allow academics and others in deep learning to more easily share their work.
“What I think is really motivating about working for the company is we’re very collaborative. We’re not competing with people internally, or even really with people externally,” Schmitz said. “People are passionate and that is contagious and makes it a great place to work.”
 People are passionate and that is contagious and makes it a great place to work.
Keep reading for more from our latest Working Geek: Michael Schmitz.
Current location: “My office is in Seattle near Gasworks Park on Lake Union”
Computer types: “A MacBook Air because I walk with my laptop a lot”
Mobile devices: “Google Pixel”
Favorite apps, cloud services and software tools: “GitHub. We started using it five years ago when the company began, and nobody has ever considered changing. We have pretty divergent technology stacks on different projects at AI2, but everyone uses GitHub. It has completely transformed how software engineers collaborate in the industry.”

Describe your workspace. Why does it work for you? “I have a desk that’s right on Lake Union so it gets plenty of natural light, which keeps me energized throughout the day. Beyond that, my workplace is just a mess of paper that is periodically recycled in batch and I have a laptop, monitor, phone charger, headphones, wooden bowl and spoon, and a ceramic mug.”
Your best advice for managing everyday work and life? “Keep a list of what you need to get done each day, stick with a task until you’re blocked or it’s done, and don’t push off to tomorrow what you can get done today.”
Your preferred social network? How do you use it for business/work? “I use Instagram a bit, but not for work. We use Twitter for company and project announcements, such as publications that win awards or new releases of our open-source software.”

Current number of unanswered emails in your inbox? “I currently have 1,363 unread emails, although that’s more because I have an unorthodox (bad) organization strategy for emails, not because I don’t read them. I have around 10 or so emails presently that I need to respond to.”
Number of appointments/meetings on your calendar this week? “16 so far.”
How do you run meetings? “I send out an email laying out the motivation for the meeting and the agenda, as well as clearly communicating the action items at the end.”
Everyday work uniform? “If it’s cold out, a plaid shirt and jeans. If it’s hot, maybe a short-sleeve button down and casual slacks.”
How do you make time for family? “I just do it.”
Best stress reliever? How do you unplug? “Turning wooden bowls on a reciprocating foot-powered lathe.”
 I develop most of my ideas slowly. I start by discussing problems with a diverse set of colleagues and then mulling over them in the back of my mind. Then, if I’m lucky, I get a great idea the first thing in the morning after waking up.
What are you listening to? “CBC Music radio (Rich Terfry), funk on 90.7 FM KSER (Saturday), and the roadhouse on 90.3 FM KEXP (Wednesday).”
Daily reads? Favorite sites and newsletters? “Y Combinator”
Book on your nightstand (or e-reader)? “I’m reading ‘The Collector,’ a biography of the Northwest botanist David Douglas, for whom the region’s Douglas fir is named.”
Night owl or early riser? “Early to bed, early to rise. I feel great in the morning, especially after a cup of tea. It’s not unusual for me to wake up and tell my wife ‘it’s a brand new day!’ She likes to sleep in.”
Where do you get your best ideas? “I develop most of my ideas slowly. I start by discussing problems with a diverse set of colleagues and then mulling over them in the back of my mind. Then, if I’m lucky, I get a great idea the first thing in the morning after waking up.”

10 Jobs most likely to be replaced by Artificial intelligence (AI) technology 
May 1, 2018 by Darshim Saxena 





Robots equipped with artificial intelligence are taking on the world. They are more popular than ever before. The functions that are performed by robots these days were hard to imagine 20 years back. Structural unemployment is prevalent in any growing economy. Thus, many of us are going to lose jobs to robots. Robots are much better than humans in specific areas and are said to boost sales.
A landmark study in 2013 classified the jobs that humans will soon lose to AI by 2024. The list, derived from the level of routine a position has, and the specialized training and social intelligence needed to do justice to it. Is indeed credible as it also inspired  “Will Robots Take My Job?”.

Jobs those likely to be replaced by robots artificial Intelligence

 Telemarketers
The people employed in this sector have the highest likelihood of losing their job to AI, the likelihood being 99%. You already receive calls throughout the day from various companies and organizations and half of them are indeed robot-calls. Think about it, what is the level of social or emotional intelligence required to be successful as a telemarketer? Even when we think about their profit for companies, the conversion rates for direct phone calls are even less than 10%. This job offers ripe opportunities for AI and the career growth in this sector is prospected to decline by 3% by 2024.
 
 Bookkeeping
Cheap alternatives as compared to a person’s salary are already available. QuickBooks, FreshBooks and Microsoft Office have already taken a toll on the employment in this sector. There is 98% likelihood that the career growth it offers will decline further. It might drop by up to 8% by 2024.
 
 Compensation and Benefits Managers
Ironically, this sector is expected to grow by 7% by 2024. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the humans employed here have managed to shield their livelihood from AI. In future, multinational companies are bound to grow multifold. There will be more workload than ever. A human pen and paper system will not only be more time-taking but also more expensive as compared to AI and companies will try to save the maximum % of their profits. AI will ensure that number of employees gain in less amount of time. Have a look at the growth of companies like UltiPro and WorkDay and all your curiosities regarding this suggestion will be satisfied.
 
 Receptionists
This suggestion didn’t need much validation after Pam declared it way back in “The Office’. Modern technology companies and multinational corporations are increasingly doing away with office-wide telephone systems. This practice itself has taken the likelihood of automation to 96%.
 
 Couriers
This suggestion should no longer shock you for most of the couriers, and robots have already replaced delivery persons. Just like the sector of Compensations and Benefits Managers, this job will also ironically see a growth of 5%. Though the change in this sector will happen slowly, there is 94% likelihood that AI will soon take over altogether.

 Proofreaders
Nobody updated contents online nowadays without consulting proofreading software. They are everywhere nowadays. Ranging from Microsoft’s simple spelling check to Grammarly’s premium services, the services offered by software in this field are indispensable. There is already software that helps us with this task on an everyday basis. Thus, there is 84% likelihood that humans will lose out more jobs to robots in this sector too.
 
 Computer Support Specialists
The 12% likelihood of growth in this sector complements 65% likelihood of automation in the same. The internet has a lot of contents on various computer parts. Right from the hacks to the how-tos, there is now an answer to everything on the world wide web.  Many companies are going to do away with the humans employed for this job and are instead going to utilize AI to solve all related queries of the employees as well as the customers.

 Market Research Analysts
If you need a contemporary example of market research analysis taken over by a robot, let me introduce you to GrowthBot. Bestowed with brilliant AI, it can conduct market research on nearby businesses and competitors as quick as “1-2-3”. No doubt market research does play a crucial role in messaging, content and strategy but such successful examples of AI, companies will surely look for alternatives to human effort.
Automated AI and surveys compile all this information and make their collection much more manageable.
 
 Advertising Salespeople
There is a projected 3% decline in this industry. With the growth of the online worlds, advertising is moving further away from print and TV witch each passing day. There is no longer a need for companies to appoint salespeople to deal with the sales of the spaces for ads. The purchase of spaces for ads on social media can be easily made with the help of APIs and self-serve ad marketplaces. This is a much faster and easier mode of making money. This ease is reflected in 54% likelihood of the people employed in this industry to lose their bread and butter to robots.

 Retail Salespeople
Buyers these days are much more tech-savvy. Not only do they prefer to purchase stuff online, in the event of visiting a mall, but they are also very comfortable with self-checkouts. Moreover, salespersons have lost the power to influence people as they come to the mall already equipped with all the necessary information about the choices available to them and the product they want to buy. Amazon Go stores are an example of that.
If you thought AI restricts to assembly lines, think again. AI has taken over the world of sales and marketing by storm. Though many of the workers employed in the fields like editing and HR will retain their jobs because of the essential nature of their work, many of us might have robots taking over our offices for good.

How artificial intelligence is reimagining work

Why It Matters		



Artificial intelligence isn’t advancing work processes. It’s completely reimagining them. These shifts will require new executives, new jobs, and new responsibilities.

Paul Daugherty, chief technology and innovation officer at Accenture, sees three myths surrounding artificial intelligence: Robots are coming for us, machines will take our jobs, and current approaches to business processes will still apply.
The three myths represent “conventional changes to linear processes,” he said. The reality is more transformative. An example: Newark, New Jersey-based AeroFarms grows seeds indoors without soil or sunlight. Seeds are harvested in less than three weeks and the process requires 95 percent less water than conventional farming methods.
AI plays a key role, Daugherty said. AeroFarms’ scientists monitor 130,000 data points, analyzing everything from light sensitivity to nutrient absorption.
“How do we get the conventional mindset [of AI] from  beating Go to reimagining business?” he said. “That’s what we like to think about.”
Along with H. James Wilson, who leads Accenture’s information technology and business research, Daugherty co-wrote the book “Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI.” The pair spoke May 9 in Simon Johnson and Jonathan Ruane’s Global Business of AI and Robotics class at MIT Sloan.
Here’s what will be new as artificial intelligence helps us reimagine work.
New executive, management roles
The increased use of AI for day-to-day business operations will force enterprises to create new executive and management roles, the authors said.
First and foremost is a chief AI officer, Daugherty said. This person will understand and manage an organization’s data and ensure that AI is used responsibly. The role will merge the skill sets of the chief information officer and the human resources manager, requiring a leader who is comfortable introducing people into a process that is heavily dependent on technology.
Meanwhile, new management roles will focus on the use of data, though they will not necessarily be traditional STEM — science, technology, engineering, and math — roles, Wilson said. A data compliance officer will help a company make ethical decisions about how data is used, he said, while an algorithm forensic analyst will explain the data models to internal and external stakeholders.
However, as with previous technology trends — client/server, internet, cloud, mobile, cybersecurity, and so on — AI will be so firmly integrated into the business that it will be a priority for all executives. “What we learned from digital transformation is that it requires CEO and board-level sponsorship,” Daugherty said.
New concerns about responsibility
Executives managing AI must ensure the validity of the data sets that AI systems use, the authors said. The MIT Media Lab’s Algorithmic Justice League has  demonstrated that biased data sets can lead to biased results, whether companies realize it or not.
“You need data custodians and stewards, algorithm evaluators, to make sure they don’t amplify biases that were inherent in the data,” Daugherty said.
In addition, executives must apply their own intuition when an AI system recommends a course of action. Uber is under investigation in Massachusetts for  keeping surge pricing in place during a state of emergency in March 2018. An algorithm may say that is a good idea, but a machine is not accountable for a company’s business decisions, Daugherty said.
“I tell executives, it’s going to be you in front of Congress if you don’t pay attention to these types of issues,” he said.
New approach to work
Reimagining work is more than automating processes that humans currently do, the authors said. Even Elon Musk recently admitted that there is such as a thing as  too much automation. Instead, Daugherty said, companies should develop a type of “collaborative intelligence” where humans help machines just as much as machines help humans.
Five characteristics define a process that can be reimagined, Wilson said: Flexibility, speed, scale, decision making, and personalization.
After realizing that even a multinational firm does not have enough recruiters, Unilever  has automated the first two rounds of its interview process, he said. AI can do the initial vetting and sorting of candidates, which shortens the timeline and also allows Unilever to draw candidates from a larger, more diverse pool.
“This frees up recruiters to focus on the more important, later rounds of interviews, where the recruiters’ social acumen and feel for whether a candidate is a good fit is so important,” Wilson said.
New front-line skills
Unilever’s recruiters are just one set of workers who will have  redefined roles as enterprises adopt AI. Accenture automated the process of loan and mortgage claims verification, then transitioned the operations staff that had previously verified claims into a role where they analyzed claims, Daugherty said.
The authors take this issue of “mid-career re-skilling” seriously. Royalties from sales of “Human + Machine” will be donated to organizations such as Skillful that help train workers for jobs in a digital economy. One key focus is  developing soft skills such as problem solving and analysis, which allow workers to do more than basic data entry.
“There’s a lot of human labor that goes into making algorithms work effectively,” Wilson said. “How can we upskill them to do more sophisticated AI tasks, making their jobs more interesting, so it’s not a hidden form of global labor?”

Artificial Intelligence, International Competition, and the Balance of Power



Artificial Intelligence
May 15, 2018



Michael C. Horowitz



World leaders, CEOs, and academics have suggested that a revolution in artificial intelligence is upon us. Are they right, and what will advances in artificial intelligence mean for international competition and the balance of power? This article evaluates how developments in artificial intelligence (AI) — advanced, narrow applications in particular — are poised to influence military power and international politics. It describes how AI more closely resembles “enabling” technologies such as the combustion engine or electricity than a specific weapon. AI’s still-emerging developments make it harder to assess than many technological changes, especially since many of the organizational decisions about the adoption and uses of new technology that generally shape the impact of that technology are in their infancy. The article then explores the possibility that key drivers of AI development in the private sector could cause the rapid diffusion of military applications of AI, limiting first-mover advantages for innovators. Alternatively, given uncertainty about the technological trajectory of AI, it is also possible that military uses of AI will be harder to develop based on private-sector AI technologies than many expect, generating more potential first-mover advantages for existing powers such as China and the United States, as well as larger consequences for relative power if a country fails to adapt. Finally, the article discusses the extent to which U.S. military rhetoric about the importance of AI matches the reality of U.S. investments.

In early September 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin brought artificial intelligence from the labs of Silicon Valley, academia, and the basement of the Pentagon to the forefront of international politics. “Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,” he said. “It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.”1
Putin’s remarks reflect a belief, growing in sectors and regions across the world, that advances in artificial intelligence will be critical for the future — in areas as varied as work, society, and military power. Artificial intelligence is a critical element of what Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum, calls the Fourth Industrial Revolution.2 Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, argues that artificial intelligence is so important to the future of power that the United States needs a national strategy on artificial intelligence, just as it had one for the development of space technology during the Cold War.3 Elon Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX, has even said that growth in artificial intelligence technology, left unchecked, could risk sparking World War III.4 These statements suggest that artificial intelligence will have a large and potentially deterministic influence on global politics and the balance of power.5
Whether artificial intelligence has revolutionary consequences or merely incremental effects, it is critical to grasp how and why it could matter in the national security arena. Despite a wave of articles about artificial intelligence in the popular press and trade journals, there has been less in the way of systematic academic work on the national security consequences of such developments. This article attempts to fill that gap by examining the effects on national security of narrow artificial intelligence, or systems designed to do deliberately constrained tasks, such as the Jeopardy-playing version of IBM’s Watson or AlphaGo, designed to play the board game Go. Specifically, it assesses the issues AI stands to raise for the balance of power and international competition through the lens of academic research on military innovation, technological change, and international politics.
Popular writing on AI tends to focus almost exclusively on technology development. Technology has played a vital role in shaping global politics throughout history.6 Hundreds of years ago, technologies such as the printing press allowed the written word to flourish. These set the stage for new forms of political protest and activity.7 In the 20th century, nuclear weapons significantly increased the destructive capabilities of numerous countries.8
Yet the relative impact of technological change often depends as much or more on how people, organizations, and societies adopt and utilize technologies as it does on the raw characteristics of the technology.9 Consider the aircraft carrier, which the British Navy invented in 1918. As the best in the world at using battleships, the Royal Navy initially imagined the utility of aircraft carriers as providing airplanes to serve as spotters for the battleship. The Japanese and U.S. navies, however, innovated by using the aircraft carrier as a mobile airfield, fundamentally transforming naval warfare in the 20th century.10 Or, consider the printing press again: Its role in accelerating nationalist political movements depended on the incentives that originally motivated those movements and the movements’ ability to take advantage of the new technology’s capability to spread information.11
What role will artificial intelligence play? In many ways it is too soon to tell, given uncertainty about the development of the technology. But AI seems much more akin to the internal combustion engine or electricity than a weapon. It is an enabler, a general-purpose technology with a multitude of applications. That makes AI different from, and broader than, a missile, a submarine, or a tank.
Advances in narrow AI could create challenges as well as opportunities for governments and military organizations. For example, narrow AI applications such as image recognition would help those militaries that are already wealthy and powerful and that can afford to keep up. It is harder to predict how AI applications could affect the heart of military organizations, influencing planning as well as questions of recruiting, retention, and force structure. What happens as militaries increasingly need soldiers who have training in coding and who understand how algorithms work? Or if swarming, uninhabited systems make large conventional military platforms seem costly and obsolete? Leading militaries often struggle in the face of organizationally disruptive innovations because it is hard to make the bureaucratic case for change when a military perceives itself as already leading.
What countries benefit from AI will depend in part on where militarily-relevant innovations come from. Non-military institutions, such as private companies and academic departments, are pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of artificial intelligence. While some AI and robotics companies, such as Boston Dynamics, receive military research and development funding, others, such as DeepMind, do not, and actively reject engaging with military organizations.12 Unlike stealth technology, which has a fundamentally military purpose, artificial intelligence has uses as varied as shopping, agriculture, and stock trading.
If commercially-driven AI continues to fuel innovation, and the types of algorithms militaries might one day use are closely related to civilian applications, advances in AI are likely to diffuse more rapidly to militaries around the world. AI competition could feature actors across the globe developing AI capabilities, much like late-19th-century competition in steel and chemicals. The potential for diffusion would make it more difficult to maintain “first-mover advantages” in applications of narrow AI. This could change the balance of power, narrowing the gap in military capabilities not only between  the United States and China but between others as well.
Experts disagree about the potential trajectory of the technology, however, which means that forecasts of the consequences of AI developments for the international security environment are necessarily tentative.13 While the basic science underlying AI is applicable to both civilian and military purposes, it is plausible that the most important specific military uses of AI will not be dual use. Technological advances that are more exclusively based in military research are generally harder to mimic. It follows that military applications of AI based more exclusively in defense research will then generate larger first-mover advantages for early adopters. Moreover, if the computational power necessary to generate new, powerful algorithms prices out all but the wealthiest companies and countries, higher-end AI capabilities could help the rich get richer from a balance-of-power perspective. On the other hand, if leading militaries fail to effectively incorporate AI, the potential for disruption would also be larger.

AI seems much more akin to the internal combustion engine or electricity than a weapon. 
This article defines artificial intelligence and examines what kind of technology AI is. It then turns to key questions and assumptions about the trajectory of narrow AI development that will influence potential adoption requirements for military applications of AI, a factor critical to shaping AI’s influence on the balance of power. The paper then assesses how narrow artificial intelligence will affect the balance of power in a world where dual-use AI has great military relevance and diffuses rapidly as well as a scenario in which military AI developments are more “excludable,” limiting diffusion and generating more first-mover advantages.
How all this will play out over the next decade or more is unclear. Already, China, Russia, and others are investing significantly in AI to increase their relative military capabilities with an eye toward reshaping the balance of power. As the field of AI matures, and more implementations become plausible in arenas such as logistics, personnel, and even deployable units, countries will need to figure out how to use AI in practical ways that improve their ability to generate military power. The risk for the United States in terms of balance of power thus lies in taking its military superiority for granted and ending up like Great Britain’s Royal Navy with the aircraft carrier in the mid-20th century — a technological innovator that is surpassed when it comes to organizational adoption and use of the technology.
What Is Artificial Intelligence?
What is artificial intelligence? There is no broad consensus on the specific meanings of terms such as artificial intelligence, autonomy, and automation. For the purposes of this article, artificial intelligence refers to the use of computers to simulate the behavior of humans that requires intelligence.14 Put another way, AI can be thought of as the ability of an artificial agent to achieve goals in a “wide range of environments.”15 A system with artificial intelligence is distinct from a robot or robotic system, which can be remotely piloted or autonomous.16 For example, the Boston Dynamics SpotMini, which can open a door, is remotely piloted by a human operator so would not qualify as AI.17 Automatic systems, such as a toaster in the civilian world or, to use a military example, an explosive triggered by a tripwire, respond mechanistically to environmental inputs.18 Automated systems, by contrast, operate based on multiple pre-programmed logic steps as opposed to the simplicity of a tripwire.19 Autonomous systems have more latitude and are programmed, within constraints, to achieve goals, optimizing along a set of parameters.20
There are two main approaches to AI, broadly conceived. The first is symbolic artificial intelligence — the creation of expert systems and production rules to allow a machine to deduce behavioral pathways. IBM’s Deep Blue, which defeated Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, used a symbolic approach.21 Computational, or connectionist, approaches to artificial intelligence, in contrast, typically attempt to allow for problem recognition and action by machines through calculations rather than symbolic representation.22 Machine learning represents a key computational approach to artificial intelligence. Multiple computational techniques are used to create machine-learning algorithms, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and deep learning. Deep learning, now popularly associated with artificial intelligence, is a technique that harnesses neural networks to train algorithms to do specified tasks, such as image recognition.23 Some researchers are pursuing hybrid approaches that integrate both symbolic and computational approaches to AI. The hope behind hybrid approaches is that creating common languages will enable algorithms that can employ multiple pathways to learn how to do particular tasks, making them more effective.24
For the purposes of this article, the specific methods of AI that generate particular capabilities are less critical than understanding the general trajectory of the technology. In many cases, it is too soon to tell which methods will generate which capabilities.
AI Is an Enabler, Not a Weapon
The impact of the invention of a new technology depends, in part, on its potential basic uses.25 Some communication technologies, such as the telegraph or telephone, were designed to more rapidly connect people in different locations. Munition technologies, such as missiles and bullets, are designed to inflict damage on a target. Railroads are a transportation technology, as is a bicycle. These broad categories of technologies have subcomponents that draw on various technologies themselves. For example, more than 300,000 parts go into an F-35.26 Another category might then be called “enabling technologies,” which are designed not specifically for a single purpose like the examples above but, instead, are general-purpose, with broad applications across many other types of technologies. Electricity is an enabling technology.
So what kind of technology is artificial intelligence? While the rhetoric of the “Third Offset”27 and other discussions in the defense community sometimes make artificial intelligence seem like a munition, AI is actually the ultimate enabler. AI can be part of many specific technologies, analogous to the internal combustion engine as well as electricity.28 Andrew Ng of Stanford University argues that, like the invention of electricity, AI could enable specific technologies in fields as diverse as agriculture, manufacturing, and health care.29
Artificial intelligence can operate in several dimensions. First, it can be used to direct physical objects, such as robotic systems, to act without human supervision. Whether in tanks, planes, or ships, AI can help reduce the need to use humans, even remotely, or as part of human-machine teams.30 Swarm techniques, for example, generally involve the creation of supervised algorithms that direct platforms such as drones. Second, artificial intelligence can assist in processing and interpreting information. Image-recognition algorithms can be used for tagging vacation photos and identifying products in stores as well as in Project Maven, a U.S. military program that seeks to develop algorithms to automate the process of analyzing video feeds captured by drones.31 While the applications in each case are different, the underlying algorithmic task — rapid image identification and tagging — is consistent. Third, overlapping narrow AI systems could be used for new forms of command and control — operational systems, including battle management, that analyze large sets of data and make forecasts to direct human action — or action by algorithms.32
What Type of Artificial Intelligence?
It is useful to think about the degree of artificial intelligence as a continuum. On one end are narrow AI applications such as AlphaGo, able to beat the best human Go players in the world. These are machine-learning algorithms designed to do one specific task, with no prospect of doing anything beyond that task. One can imagine narrow AI as relatively advanced forms of autonomous systems, or machines that, once activated, are designed to complete specific tasks or functions.33
On the other end of the spectrum is a “super-intelligent” artificial general intelligence. This kind of AI would consist of an algorithm, or series of algorithms, that could do not only narrow tasks but also could functionally think for itself and design solutions to a broader class of problems. Describing an extreme version of this, Nick Bostrom writes about the risk of a superintelligent AI that could plausibly take over the world and perhaps even decide to eliminate humans as an inadvertent consequence of its programming.34 In the middle of this spectrum, though perhaps leaning toward artificial general intelligence, is “transformative AI,” or AI that can go beyond a narrow task such as playing a video game but falls short of achieving superintelligence.35
This article focuses on the potential effect that narrow applications of artificial intelligence could have on the balance of power and international competition. Among current AI technologies and advances, narrow applications are most likely to affect militaries — and with them the balance of power — over the next two decades. Moreover, even experts disagree about whether artificial general intelligence of the type that could outpace human capabilities will emerge in the short to medium term or whether it is still hundreds of years away. AI experts also disagree about the overall trajectory of advances in AI.36 Surveys have found that only 50 percent of AI researchers believe that an AI system will be capable of writing a best-selling book by 2049. About 75 percent of AI researchers thought it could be 2090 before an AI system could write a best-selling book. That even highly trained experts disagree about these development issues illustrates a high degree of uncertainty in the field.
Given these questions about which AI technologies will be developed, this article focuses on the capabilities that are most likely to emerge in the next generation.
Technology and the Balance of Power
Emerging technologies primarily shape the balance of power through military and economic means.37 Technologies can directly influence countries’ abilities to fight and win wars. They can also indirectly affect the balance of power by impacting a country’s economic power. After all, countries cannot maintain military superiority over the medium to long term without an underlying economic basis for that power.38 Recall the decline of the Ottoman Empire or Imperial China.
However, it is not yet clear how the invention of specific AI applications will translate into military power. Despite continuing investment, efforts to integrate AI technologies into militaries have been limited.39 Project Maven is the first activity of an “Algorithmic Warfare” initiative in the U.S. military designed to harness the potential of AI and translate it into usable military capabilities. Still, many investments in the United States and elsewhere are in early stages. As Missy L. Cummings writes:
Autonomous ground vehicles such as tanks and transport vehicles are in development worldwide, as are autonomous underwater vehicles. In almost all cases, however, the agencies developing these technologies are struggling to make the leap from development to operational implementation.40

Emerging technologies primarily shape the balance of power through military and economic means. 
It is important to distinguish these potential technological innovations from military innovations. While military innovations are often linked to changes in technology,41 it is not always the case. Military innovations are significant changes in organizational behavior and ways that a military fights that are designed to increase its ability to effectively translate capabilities into power.42 The use of aircraft carriers as mobile airfields by the United States and Japan is a prototypical example. While AI could potentially enable a number of military innovations, it is not a military innovation itself, and no applications of AI have been used in ways that would count as a military innovation at this point.
Because AI research and technology are still in their early stages, usage of AI in warfare is not even yet analogous to the first use of the tank in World War I, let alone effective use of combined arms warfare by the Germans in World War II (the military innovation now known as blitzkrieg). This limits analyses about how narrow AI might one day affect the balance of power and international politics. Most research on technology and international politics focuses on specific, mature technologies, such as nuclear weapons, or on military innovations.43 Since AI is at an early stage, examining it requires adapting existing theories about military technology and military innovation.44
My adoption capacity theory provides insight into how developments in AI will affect the balance of power.45 This theory argues that the relative financial and organizational requirements for adopting a military innovation influence the rate of diffusion of that innovation and its impact on the balance of power. Financial considerations include calculating the unit costs of the hardware involved and determining whether the underlying capability is based on commercial or militarily-exclusive technology. Other considerations include assessing the extent to which adopting the innovation requires disrupting the critical task of the military (i.e., what an organization views itself as attempting to achieve) or the status of key organizational elites (for example, fighter pilots in an air force). Given that adoption capacity theory focuses on major military innovations, however, it requires adaptation to be applied to artificial intelligence at present.
To determine how technological changes will shape the balance of power, adoption capacity theory suggests that three questions must be answered. First, while technology itself is rarely, if ever, determinative, how might use of a technology influence the character of warfare? Consider the machine gun. When deployed asymmetrically, it proved useful for the offense. But in combination with barbed wire, when possessed symmetrically, this technological advance helped create the trench-warfare stalemate of World War I.46 More broadly, the Industrial Revolution and the shift in manufacturing to factories and mass production were behind the rifle’s evolution from a niche, craft weapon possessed by a small number of forces to a widely available capability. This change influenced the relative lethality of battles as well as how militaries organized themselves and developed tactics.47
Second, how might different actors implement a given technology or be bureaucratically constrained from implementation, and what possibilities for military innovation will that generate? This question is particularly relevant because the challenges of organizational adoption and implementation of a technological innovation are closely linked with effectiveness. Those challenges are critical to determining how an innovation will impact international politics.
Decades of research demonstrates that the impact of technological change on global politics — whether it is change in economics, society at large, diplomacy, or military power — depends much more on how governments and organizations make choices about the adoption and use of new capabilities than on the technologies themselves.48 Scholarship on military innovation by Barry Posen, Stephen P. Rosen, and others shows that technological innovation alone rarely shapes the balance of power.49 Instead, it is how militaries use a technology that makes a difference.50 A military’s ability to employ a technology depends in part on the complexity of the technology, how difficult it is to use, and whether it operates in predictable and explainable ways. These factors influence the trust that senior military leaders have in the technology and whether they use it.51 Additionally, the more bureaucratically disruptive it is to adopt a technology, the more challenging it can be for older, more established organizations to do so — particularly if the organization is underinvested in research and development designed to integrate new technologies and ideas.52
Consider that every country in Europe in the mid-19th century had access to railroads, rifles, and the telegraph around the same time. But it was the Prussian military that first figured out how to exploit these technologies, in combination, to rapidly project power. After that, other militaries adapted their organizations to take similar advantage.53
The example of the British Navy and the aircraft carrier further illustrates how organizational processes determine the impact of technology on military power.54 As referenced above, despite having invented the aircraft carrier, the Royal Navy’s institutional commitment to the battleship meant that it initially saw the value of this new technology almost exclusively in its ability to facilitate the use of airplanes to act as “spotters” for battleships. The United States and Japan, as rising naval powers with less invested in the importance of the battleship, thought more creatively about this innovation and realized that the aircraft carrier’s real value lay in the independent striking power it offered.55 Since battleships — and admirals with experience and comfort operating them — dominated the navies of many countries, thinking about the aircraft carrier as a mobile airfield required a difficult conceptual shift.56
Even after it became clear that the optimal use of aircraft carriers was as a mobile airfield, adopting carrier warfare proved challenging. The Chinese navy has been working on carrier operations for two decades and is only just starting to build real competency. The Soviet Union attempted to adopt carrier warfare for decades and failed. Simply put, the systems integration tasks required to operate the ship, launch and recover airplanes from the ship, and coordinate with other naval assets are very difficult to execute.57 The larger the change within the organization required for a military to effectively utilize new technologies, the greater the bureaucratic challenges and, with them, the likelihood that powerful countries will not have the organizational capability to adopt. This is a key mechanism through which the balance of power can change.
Third, how will a new technology spread? The answer to this question will help determine relative first-mover advantages gained from adopting the technology.58 While Kenneth Waltz initially suggested that emulation of military technologies happens quickly, subsequent research demonstrates that it is far more complicated.59 The rate of diffusion matters: In the case of technologies that diffuse slowly, the country that first implements will have a sustainable edge over its competitors. But when other countries can rapidly adopt a new technology, the relative advantages of being first diminish.60
The diffusion of military technology occurs through multiple mechanisms, just like the diffusion of technologies in general.61 Adoption capacity theory suggests a few factors that will be key in influencing the diffusion of narrow AI. The first is the unit cost of creating AI systems. The greater the hardware and compute costs associated with creating militarily-relevant algorithms, the higher the barrier to entry will be. Alternatively, once the algorithms have been created, they become software and can more easily diffuse.
Moreover, technologies that have only military purposes tend to spread more slowly than technologies where commercial incentives drive their development. If a technology has only military uses — such as stealth technology — and it has a high unit cost and level of complexity, the number of actors who can emulate or mimic that technology are minimized.62
On the other hand, technologies with commercial incentives for development generally spread much faster. In the 19th century, the railroad, used as a “military technology,” enabled rapid power projection and the massing of military forces to a greater degree than had previously been possible. Yet it was the commercial incentives for the fast shipping of goods that helped speed the construction of dense railroad networks around the world, making it difficult for countries to gain sustainable advantages in railroad capabilities.63
The Impact of AI on the Balance of Power
If Eric Schmidt, Vladimir Putin, Elon Musk, and others are correct that AI is a competitive battleground, what will be the character of that competition?64 The United States and China seem to be furthest ahead in the development of AI. As the two most powerful countries in the world, the competition for global leadership in AI technology evokes, for many, 20th-century competitions such as the space race. Retired Marine Corps Gen. John Allen and SparkCognition CEO Amir Husain have argued that the United States therefore needs to do more to get and stay ahead.65
Global investments in artificial intelligence for economic and national security purposes are increasingly described as an arms race.66 China published a national strategy on artificial intelligence in 2017 that said AI represents a “major strategic opportunity” and proposed a coordinated strategy to “build China’s first mover advantage” and lead the world in AI technology.67 Russia is investing heavily as well, especially in the military domain. Reports suggest that the Russian military is designing autonomous vehicles to guard its ballistic missile bases as well as an autonomous submarine that could carry nuclear weapons. In robotics, Russia is deploying remotely piloted tanks, such as the Uran-9 and Vehar, on the battlefield.68
China and Russia are not the only actors outside the United States interested in national security applications of AI. The character of AI technology, like robotics, makes many countries well-positioned to design and deploy it for military purposes.69 Commercial incentives for AI developments and the dual-use character of many AI applications mean that countries with advanced information economies are poised to be leaders in AI or at least fast followers.70 In Southeast Asia, Singapore is on the cutting edge of AI investments (both military and non-military). Other Southeast Asian nations are making advances in AI research as well.71 In the military domain, South Korea has developed the SGR-A1, a semi-autonomous weapon system designed to protect the demilitarized zone from attack by North Korea.72

The character of AI technology, like robotics, makes many countries well-positioned to design and deploy it for military purposes. 
AI also provides opportunities for capital-rich countries, which creates incentives to develop the technology. Wealthy, advanced economies that have high levels of capital but also have high labor costs or small populations — middle powers such as Australia, Canada, and many European countries — often face challenges in military recruiting. For these countries, technologies that allow them to substitute capital for labor are highly attractive. Indeed, Gen. Mick Ryan, commander of Australia’s Defence College, argues that countries can take advantage of the intersection of AI and robotics to overcome the problems caused by a small population.73 France’s 2017 defense strategy review points to the development and incorporation of artificial intelligence as critical to the French military’s ability to maintain “operational superiority.”74 Israel, a classic example of an advanced economy with more capital than labor, also funds military AI investments that would predict rocket launches and analyze video footage.75 Lt. Col. Nurit Cohen Inger, who heads the unit of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in charge of assessing the military relevance of AI, said in 2017 that, for the IDF, AI “can influence every step and small decision in a conflict, and the entire conflict itself.”76
Given these investments, how might developments in AI affect military organizations and the character of war, and how might they diffuse?
AI and the Character of War
The “character of warfare” in a period can be defined as the dominant way to fight and win conflicts given existing technologies, organizations, and polities. The character of warfare changes in concert with the tools that become available and how they influence the ways militaries organize themselves to fight wars.77 The shift to mass mobilization in the Napoleonic era exemplifies a non-technological development that changed the character of warfare.
Applications of AI have the potential to shape how countries fight in several macro ways. On the broadest level, autonomous systems, or narrow AI systems, have the potential to increase the speed with which countries can fight, yet another similarity between AI and the combustion engine. Even if humans are still making final decisions about the use of lethal force, fighting at machine speed can dramatically increase the pace of operations.78
There are several military applications of AI currently in development or under discussion that can be considered, though many are at early stages. For example, some research shows that the way that neural networks can utilize imagery databases and classify particular scenes (such as a mountain), allows for a more accurate assessment of specific locations.79 Additionally, the processing power that is possible with narrow AI systems has the potential to increase the speed of data analysis, as Project Maven in the United States aims to do. Investments in image recognition offer the hope of achieving faster, more accurate results than humans can achieve today, and is a likely avenue for continued investment and application (setting aside the questions of accidents, hacking, and other ways that systems could go awry80).
Successful implementation of AI beyond areas such as image recognition might lead to new concepts of operation that could influence force structure and force employment, or how militaries organize themselves and plan operations. One possibility is the use of large numbers of smaller platforms, known as swarms, for military operations. Algorithms and control systems designed to enable “swarming” already exist in the private sector and in academia.81 Military-grade algorithms would require coordination with other military systems, including early-warning aircraft, inhabited aircraft, satellites, and other sensors. Deployed swarms in a combat environment would have to be capable of real-time adaptation to optimize operations if some elements of the swarm were shot down — a challenge that commercial applications would not necessarily face. Methods for developing swarming algorithms could include behavior trees or deep learning.82
Another potential application for narrow AI that could shape the character of war is coordination through layers of algorithms that work together to help manage complex operations. These algorithms could be expert systems that generate decision trees. Or they could involve algorithms developed through generative adversarial networks. In this approach, algorithms compete against each other to teach each other how to do various tasks. Some algorithms will need to be trained to assist in coordinating multiple military assets, both human and machine. In that case, adversarial learning could help compensate for the unique character of decision-making in individual battles and the problem of learning to adapt beyond the available training data.83
The ability to operate faster through algorithms that assist human commanders in optimizing battle plans, including real-time operations, could shift force employment and force structure, especially in the air and at sea. Since World War II, modern militaries have been engaged in a  shift from quantity to quality in military systems. The thinking is that smaller numbers of expensive, high-quality systems are more likely to lead to victory in battles. AI could accelerate trends that challenge these long-running force-structure imperatives, such as the need to defeat adversaries with advanced anti-access, area-denial (A2/AD) networks with tolerable costs.
If algorithms and coordination at machine speed become critical to success on the battlefield, expensive, high-quality platforms could become vulnerable to swarms of sensors and lower-cost weapons platforms that are effectively networked together. AI could thus help bring quantity back into the equation in the form of large numbers of robotic systems. In the near to mid-term, however, optimal use of AI may lie in leveraging machine learning to improve the performance of existing platforms.
Incentives exist for nearly all types of political regimes to develop AI applications for military purposes. For democracies, AI can decrease the relative burden of warfare on the population and reduce the risk to soldiers, even more so than with remotely piloted systems, by reducing the use of personnel. For autocracies, which do not trust their people in the first place, the ability to outsource some elements of military decision-making to algorithms, reducing reliance on humans to fight wars, is inherently attractive.84
Organizational Politics and Artificial Intelligence
Despite uncertainty about specific military applications of AI, the examples of how AI can be used in a military context described above reveal that these capabilities have the potential to significantly disrupt organizational structures. Take the example of battle management coordination (whether in human-machine teams or not): Successfully operating even semi-autonomous battle management systems is likely to require new occupational specialties and shifts in recruiting, training, and promotion to empower individuals who understand both military operations and how particular AI systems function. Rosen shows that altering the promotion of military personnel to empower those with expertise in new areas is critical to adopting military innovations in general. AI should be no exception.85
As described above, the use of AI systems at the operational level could generate options for how militaries organize and plan to use force, due to the potential to use larger numbers of networked systems operating at machine speed instead of relying exclusively on small numbers of high-quality inhabited aircraft. Implementing such concepts, however, could require disruptive organizational shifts that could threaten to change which military occupations provide the highest status and are gateways to leadership roles. Already, this can be seen with the Air Force, dominated by fighter pilots, which has been relatively hesitant when it comes to investments in uninhabited aerial vehicles. It would also challenge entrenched bureaucratic notions about how to weigh quantity versus quality. Adopting narrow AI in the most optimal way could prove challenging for leading militaries, which will need trained personnel who can do quality and reliability assurance for AI applications to ensure their appropriate and effective use.
Other applications, such as Project Maven in the U.S. Department of Defense, are easier to implement because they are sustaining technologies from the perspective of literature on organizational innovation.86 Autonomous systems that can rapidly and accurately process drone footage do not disrupt high-status military occupational specialties, nor do they disrupt how military services operate as a whole. It is when optimal uses of narrow AI would require large shifts to force structure that the adoption requirements, and bureaucratic anti-bodies, ramp up. One example of bureaucratic resistance preventing the production of a new technology that could have proved disruptive is the U.S. military’s failure to fund the X-47B drone, a next-generation system that could take off from and land on aircraft carriers autonomously. This illustrates the way bureaucratic politics and organizational competition can hinder the adoption of innovative technologies.87

Incentives exist for nearly all types of political regimes to develop AI applications for military purposes. 
The strategic or organizational culture of a military or society can also indicate which will be best positioned to exploit potential advances in AI,88 specifically, how open those cultures are to innovation. There is a risk of tautology, of course, in cultural arguments at times since it can be hard to measure whether an organization is capable of adopting a technology until it has tried to do so or done it. However, Emily Goldman’s work on the Ottoman Empire suggests the value of developing metrics of cultural openness when it comes to predicting willingness to experiment and adopt AI systems.89
Interestingly, norms regarding force structure could also play a role in inhibiting the use of AI for certain military tasks. As Theo Farrell’s research on the Irish Army after independence shows, militaries often mimic the functional form of more powerful actors even when doing so is not in their interest. Applying his insight in the case of artificial intelligence, some militaries may be less likely to use AI in ways that are organizationally disruptive, especially if doing so would involve shifts in visible force structure, such as a move from small numbers of advanced inhabited aircraft to swarming concepts that use cheaper, more disposable aircraft.90
Arguments about organizational and strategic culture are generally consistent with adoption capacity theory, since both focus on the challenges that innovations present when they disrupt the identity of an organization.91 After all, militaries that already spend a lot on research and development, that are younger, and that have broad conceptions of their critical task are more likely to be culturally “open” and able to adopt new technologies or full innovations further down the development line.
The Diffusion of Militarily-Relevant AI: Two Scenarios
There is a fundamental question about the extent to which militarily-relevant uses of narrow AI will diffuse easily. Answering this question is necessary for predicting the first-mover advantages associated with a technological innovation, which in turn helps to determine its relative impact on the balance of power and warfare. To determine how easily a new technology will diffuse, adoption capacity theory suggests looking at the unit cost of the technology, especially the physical hardware.
Designing AI capabilities requires both software and hardware. This influences how to think about the “unit cost” of AI. Military capabilities based in hardware often spread more slowly than those based in software, generating more sustainable advantage for the first adopter of a given capability, especially when the unit costs of that capability are relatively high. The high unit cost of flattop aircraft carriers, for example, means that only wealthy and powerful countries adopt them.92
When it comes to platforms, algorithms are software rather than hardware. Take the example of the MQ-9 Reaper, a current-generation U.S. military armed drone. The MQ-9 is remotely piloted, meaning that a pilot at another location directs the airframe and makes decisions about firing weapons against potential targets. The difference between this and an autonomous version that is piloted and operated by an algorithm is software. From the outside, the platform would look the same.
But, if narrow AI is software from the perspective of military technology, it is software that requires substantial hardware for its creation. The associated hardware costs — especially for advanced narrow AI applications — are potentially significant.93 The more complex the algorithm, the more up-front computational hardware is required to “train” that algorithm.94 Thus, corporate and academic AI research leaders have to invest in teraflops of computing power. This is a different kind of hardware than a tank or a cruise missile, but it is hardware all the same. Rapid advances in AI through deep learning and neural networks over the last decade have thus required advances in computing hardware. Joel Emer, an electrical engineering and computer science professor at MIT, states it plainly: “Many AI accomplishments were made possible because of advances in hardware.”95 After an algorithm has been trained, however, it can be applied without access to that computing environment, and the power necessary to run completed algorithms is dramatically reduced.
How rapidly AI capabilities will diffuse via simultaneous invention or mimicry will depend, in part, on the availability of computing power. If the cost of computing power continues to decline as chips become more efficient, then countries that are already home to advanced technology companies will have more access to AI capabilities faster than other countries without those kinds of technology companies.
If, on the other hand, the hardware costs of developing complex algorithms remain beyond the capacity of companies in most countries, diffusion will happen only deliberately, such as through trade or bilateral agreements at the nation-state level, or via espionage (i.e., hacking). This would likely slow the diffusion of most AI advances, increasing the advantages for innovators.
Determining the extent to which militarily-relevant applications of AI are based on commercial technology versus exclusively military research is also a critical question raised by adoption capacity theory. While it is hard to know the answer at present, examining both scenarios will illustrate how that answer might shape the way AI affects the balance of power and the structure of international competition.
Dual-Use AI
Research on the future of work suggests that strong commercial drivers are incentivizing the development of AI around the world. A 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report found a midpoint estimate of 400 million people, or 15 percent of the workforce, that are likely to be disrupted by automation before 2030.96 Widely cited research by Carl B. Frey and Michael A. Osborne estimates that 47 percent of jobs in the United States are at risk of being replaced by automation. That includes lawyers, stock traders, and accountants, not just blue-collar jobs.97 Companies across the economy have incentives to develop and use algorithms.
Commercial interest in AI is so high that some argue it — and the finite number of talented AI engineers — is holding back military developments.98 What’s more, the higher salaries and benefits that commercial companies can offer mean that militaries may have to turn to civilian companies to develop advanced AI capabilities. Google’s decision to partner with the U.S. Defense Department on Project Maven illustrates how the same talent and knowledge that will drive commercial innovation in AI may also be necessary for military technology innovation.99
When technology advances derive primarily from the civilian sector, rapid adoption of new technologies around the world becomes more likely. Commercial companies may spread the technology themselves, and the profit motive incentivizes rapid mimicry by related companies in different countries.100 Companies in Brazil, Germany, Japan, and Singapore could become AI leaders or at least fast followers.
A commitment to open-source development by many of the major players in AI could also increase the rate of diffusion. In 2015, for example, Google opened up TensorFlow, its artificial intelligence engine, to the public.101 Elsewhere, researchers committed to the open development of AI to help reduce the safety risk of algorithms that “break” in high-leverage situations publish their findings in ways that advance their cause — and make it easier for their algorithms to be copied.102
Even though advanced applications of commercial AI would require significant hardware and expertise, adoption capacity theory suggests that as the underlying basis of a technology gets more commercially oriented, it spreads relatively faster, as explained above. Companies like DeepMind have an edge today. But in such a scenario, there would be more companies around the world with relevant technological capacity. It is also easier for governments to leverage private-sector companies when those private-sector actors have non-governmental market incentives for developing or copying technology.
So how would dual-use AI being critical to military applications of AI shape global power? As noted above, the period in which a technological innovator enjoys a market advantage shrinks when countries and companies can acquire or copy others’ advances relatively easily. This makes it hard to stay ahead qualitatively.103 In the AI and robotics realms, it is possible that this will create yet another incentive for countries to focus on quantity in military systems. If leads in AI development prove difficult to sustain, advanced militaries are likely to have systems of approximately the same quality level, presuming they all reach the same conclusion about the general potential of integrating AI into military operations. In that case, countries may be more likely to try to gain advantage by emphasizing quantity again — this is in addition to the inherent incentives for mass that narrow AI might create.
If dual-use AI is critical to military applications of AI, the ability to design forces, training, and operational plans to take advantage of those dual-use applications will be a differentiating factor for leadership in AI among the great powers. The 1940 Battle of France illustrates what could ultimately be at stake in the most extreme case. Both the Germans on one side and the British and French on the other had tanks, trucks, radios, and airplanes that they could, in theory, have used for close air support. What gave the Germans such a large edge was blitzkrieg — a new concept of operations that could overwhelm even another advanced adversary.104
Let’s return to the comparison between AI and the space race. If AI technology diffuses more rapidly because it has both commercial and military purposes, making first-mover advantages more difficult to sustain, comparisons to the space race may be limited. The space race was a bilateral challenge between the United States and the Soviet Union designed to put a person on the moon, which included both developments in rockets and technologies designed to keep humans alive in space, land on the moon, and return safely. The rocket development itself was also part of the creation of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). And critical economic spillovers from the space race included development of the satellites that led to GPS and other key enablers of the Information Age. Yet overall, the race to the moon was run by two governments for national purposes — not primarily for dual-use economic gain.
The commercial drivers of AI technology, and the speed with which new algorithms diffuse, would make competition much broader than it was during the bilateral space race. Competition is much more likely to be multilateral, featuring countries and companies around the world. A better analogy might be to the competition surrounding the development of Second Industrial Revolution technologies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. France, Germany, Britain, Japan, the United States, and others vied for supremacy in steel production, chemicals, petroleum, electricity, and other areas.
For military applications of AI where the underlying technology is driven by commercial developments, the impact of a country getting ahead in AI technology, over time, would have unclear implications for relative power if a rival country was close enough to be a fast follower. Advances in commercially driven AI technology are about building new industries, changing the character of existing industries, and ensuring that the leading corporations in the global economy that emerges are based in one’s own country.
Militarily-Exclusive AI
The alternative to military applications of AI that are based in commercial developments is a world where military applications of AI are driven instead by research that is applicable only to militaries. Copying technological innovations of “excludable” technologies — those not based on widely available commercial technology — requires espionage to steal the technology (as the Soviets did with the atomic bomb) or mimicry based on observable principles of the technology.105 There are several reasons, however, to think that many military applications of narrow AI will be unique in ways that will make them more difficult to copy.
First, the complexity of advanced military systems can make emulation costly and difficult. This is especially true when a number of components are not available on the commercial market and the ability to build them depends, in part, on classified information.106 The same can also be said for some advanced commercial technology, of course, but this is not the norm. The inability to adapt commercial algorithms for some military purposes could limit the capacity of most states to produce relevant AI-based military capabilities, even if they have advanced commercial AI sectors. It could also mean that systems integration challenges for using militarily-relevant algorithms are large enough to deter many militaries from investing heavily.107

When technology advances derive primarily from the civilian sector, rapid adoption of new technologies around the world becomes more likely. 
Whatever the uncertainty about how specific AI advances will translate into military capabilities, some of the most important military applications of narrow AI — those with a potentially substantial impact on larger-scale military operations — may not have obvious civilian counterparts. Battle management algorithms that coordinate a military operation at machine speed do not necessarily have commercial analogues — even if supervised by a human with command authority — excluding the development of a narrow AI designed, say, to run a factory or operational system from top to bottom. In these arenas, military-grade algorithms may require conceptual breakthroughs that other countries may find hard to rapidly mimic.
Second, some military AI applications, such as image recognition, do have obvious commercial counterparts. Even in those cases, however, the cybersecurity concerns and reliability associated with military-grade technology can differ from those for civilian applications. Military AI systems deployed in the field may require hardening for electronic warfare and extra protections from spoofing and hacking that would be of relatively less concern in the civilian world. In military environments, adversaries’ efforts to hack and spoof increase the need for security.
The potential for countries to have strong commercial AI research sectors may mean that even narrow AI developments with applications geared toward military use may be easier to mimic than, say, stealth technology has been over the last generation. But stealth is an outlier: It has proven uniquely difficult to copy relative to other military technologies over the past few hundred years.
For AI developments that do not have clear commercial analogues, there could be substantial first-mover advantages for militaries that swiftly adopt AI technologies, particularly if they can achieve compute-driven breakthroughs that are difficult to copy. What would this mean for AI competition? As described above, China’s AI strategy highlights the way many countries increasingly view AI as a global competition that involves nation-states, rather than as a market in which companies can invest.108 As Elsa Kania writes, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
is funding a wide range of projects involving AI, and the Chinese defense industry and PLA research institutes are pursuing extensive research and development, in some cases partnering with private enterprises.109
Adopting militarily-exclusive AI technologies could also generate significant organizational pressure on militaries. Even if it would be hard for most countries to be fast followers, or mimic the advances of other militaries, great-power competition in AI would generate risk for those powers that are unable to adapt in order to organizationally exploit advances in AI, even if they are able to make technical advances. Traditionally, this risk is highest for the world’s leading military power, in this case the United States. Leading military powers often struggle to envision how to use new technologies in ways that are organizationally disruptive. They can also be blind to that fact, believing they are in the lead right up to the point when their failure of creativity matters.110
From a balance-of-power perspective, this scenario would be more likely to feature disruption among emerging and great powers but not a broader leveling of the military playing field. The ability to exclude many countries from advances in AI would concentrate military competition among current leading militaries, such as the United States, China, and Russia. There could be significant disruption within those categories, though. A Chinese military that more rapidly developed critical algorithms for broader battle management, or that was more willing to use them than the United States, might gain advantages that shifted power in the Asia-Pacific. This assumes that these algorithms operate as they are designed to operate. All militarily-useful AI will have to be hardened against hacking and spoofing. Operators will use narrow AI applications only if they are as or more effective or reliable as existing inhabited or remotely-piloted options.111
While this discussion has focused on narrow AI applications, the notion of bilateral competition in AI may be most pressing when thinking about artificial general intelligence.112 Although artificial general intelligence is beyond the scope of this paper, it would matter as a discrete competitive point only if there is a clear reward to being first, as opposed to being a fast follower. For example, developing artificial general intelligence first could lock in economic or military leadership. Then others would not have the ability to adopt it themselves, or their adoptions would be somehow less relevant, and that could be a discrete “end point” to competition. It seems unlikely, however, that such development would be that discrete or that one country would get a lead in this technology that is so large that it can consolidate the impact of being a first mover before others catch up.
Conclusion
Technological innovations, whether the machine gun, the railroad, or the longbow, can influence the balance of power and international conflict. Yet their impact is generally determined by how people and organizations use the technology rather than by the technology itself.113 It is too early to tell what the impact of narrow AI will be, but technology development suggests it will have at least some effect.
As an “enabling” technology that is more like electricity or the combustion engine than a weapon system, narrow AI is likely to have an impact that extends beyond specific questions of military superiority to influence economic power and societies around the world. This article demonstrates that technological innovation in AI could have large-scale consequences for the global balance of power. Whatever the mix of dual-use AI or militarily-exclusive AI that ends up shaping modern militaries over the next few decades, the organizational adoption requirements are likely to be significant. Militaries around the world will have to grapple with how to change recruiting and promotion policies to empower soldiers who understand algorithms and coding, as well as potential shifts in force structure to take advantage of AI-based coordination on the battlefield.
Military and economic history suggests that the effect of narrow AI could be quite large, even if suggestions of AI triggering a new industrial revolution are overstated. Adoption capacity theory shows that changes in relative military power become more likely in cases of military innovations that require large organizational changes and the adoption of new operational concepts. Even if the United States, China, and Russia were to end up with similar levels of basic AI capacity over the next decade, the history of military innovations from the phalanx to blitzkrieg suggests it is how they and others use AI that will matter most for the future of military power.
Whether AI capabilities diffuse relatively slowly or quickly, major military powers will likely face security dilemmas having to do with AI development and deployment. In a slow diffusion scenario, if countries fear that adversaries could get ahead in ways that are hard to rapidly mimic — and small differences in capabilities will matter on the battlefield — that will foster incentives for quick development and deployment. In a rapid diffusion scenario, competitive incentives will also exist, as countries feel like they have to race just to keep up.114 Moreover, it will be inherently difficult to measure competitors’ progress with AI (unlike, say, observing the construction of an aircraft carrier), causing countries to assume the worst of their potential rivals.
Competition in developing AI is underway. Countries around the world are investing heavily in AI, though the United States and China seem to be ahead. Yet even if the space-race analogy is not precise, understanding AI as a competition can still be useful. Such frameworks help people and organizations understand the world around them, from how to evaluate international threats to the potential trajectory of wars.115 If likening competition in AI to the space race clarifies the stakes in ways that generate incentives for bureaucratic action at the government level, and raises corporate and public awareness, the analogy stands to have utility for the United States.
From a research perspective, one limitation of this article is its focus on the balance of power and international competition, as opposed to specific uses of AI. Future research could investigate particular implementations of AI for military purposes or other critical questions. Specific implementations could include the use of autonomous weapon systems able to select and engage targets on their own. These systems could raise ethical and moral questions about human control,116 as well as practical issues surrounding war that is fought at “machine speed.”117 The integration of AI into early-warning systems and its ability to aid in rapid targeting could also affect crisis stability and nuclear weapons.118 In the broader security realm, AI will affect human security missions.119 By laying out an initial framework for how military applications of narrow AI could structure international competition and the balance of power, this article lays the groundwork for thinking through these questions in the future.

China is spending much more than the United States on AI research, and Chinese AI researchers are producing more papers on topics such as deep learning than U.S. researchers. 
This article also raises a series of policy questions. When thinking about AI as an arena for international competition, one question is whether, in response to China’s AI strategy, the United States should launch its own comprehensive AI strategy. In 2016, the Obama White House released an AI policy road map. It acknowledged the importance of U.S. leadership in AI but focused mostly on regulatory policy questions.120 The transition from Barack Obama to Donald Trump led to a pause in these efforts, though the White House recently announced the creation of a new committee of AI experts to advise it on policy choices.121
Some might argue that it is necessary for the United States to develop and announce a formal AI strategy similar to China’s.122 While there are plenty of private-sector incentives for the development of AI technology, only the government can coordinate AI investments and ensure the development of particular implementations that it considers critical for AI leadership.123
On the other hand, it is the free market in the United States, and its connections to the global economy, that have made the United States an engine of global innovation. More centrally planned economies have often struggled with innovation. During the Cold War, the Soviet defense industrial base and military proved effective at perfecting existing technologies or adopting technologies. The centralized Soviet system, however, made true innovation more difficult.124
China is spending much more than the United States on AI research, and Chinese AI researchers are producing more papers on topics such as deep learning than U.S. researchers.125 How that translates into tangible advances in AI technology is unclear. From a balance-of-power perspective, one could argue that the optimal approach would involve a mixed strategy between market and government development of AI. In the economic arena, central planning can stifle innovation, meaning the role of government should be to fund basic research and then let market incentives do the rest.
The defense sector may be different, however. For the United States, it will be up to the Department of Defense to clearly outline what types of AI technologies are most useful and to seed research and development to turn those technologies into a reality. For any strategy, for both the United States and China, a principal challenge will be translating basic research in programs of record into actual capabilities. As Cummings writes about government agencies working on AI systems around the world, “[T]he agencies developing these technologies are struggling to make the leap from development to operational implementation.”126
More broadly, if investing in and appropriately utilizing AI is critical to military power in the 21st century, the U.S. approach is a mixed bag. Optimists can point to investments in connecting cutting-edge research to U.S. military forces through institutions such as the Defense Innovation Unit – Experimental (DIUx), the Strategic Capabilities Office, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). From discussions of the “Third Offset” to “Multi-Domain Battle,” senior military and civilian leaders are also taking the challenge of AI seriously.127
Meanwhile, a great deal of bottom-up innovation is happening in the U.S. military, both in terms of developing technologies and experimenting with novel concepts of operation. It is possible that the research and smaller, experimental programs that the United States is funding will become part of mainstream U.S. military programs, enabling the United States to stay ahead and sustain its military superiority. If narrow AI continues to develop, adopting the technology will require sustained attention by senior leaders.
Pessimists, however, can point to a gap between rhetoric and unit-level experimentation on the one hand and budgetary realities on the other.128 There is a lot of discussion about the importance of artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as a clear desire among senior uniformed leadership to make the U.S. military more networked, distributed, and lethal by taking advantage of AI, among other technologies.129 This rhetoric has not yet caught up to reality in terms of U.S. military spending on AI. When faced with a choice of investing in a next-generation drone, for example, the U.S. Navy used its available programmatic dollars for the MQ-25 air-to-air refueling platform, which will support inhabited aircraft such as the F-35. The MQ-25 program was chosen over an advanced armed system — based on the X-47B demonstrator — with stealthy potential that could operate in dangerous conflict environments.130 The MQ-25 decision may be seen as the canary in the coal mine if the U.S. military falls behind in the coming decades — especially if a failure to appropriately adopt advances in AI and robotics turns out to be a key reason for that relative military decline.
At the end of the day, however, AI’s effect on international politics will depend on much more than choices about one particular military program. The challenge for the United States will be in calibrating, based on trends in AI developments, how fast to move in incorporating narrow AI applications. This will be true whether those applications are dual-use or based in exclusively-military research. And that challenge to leadership in AI in general, as well as in military power, is complicated by the movements of China and other competitors, all of which seem interested in leveraging AI to challenge U.S. military superiority.

77 One could also argue AI has the potential to go beyond shaping the character of war and change the nature of war itself. From a Clausewitzian perspective, that war is human fundamentally defines its nature. Carl von Clausewitz, On War, trans. Michael Howard and Peter Paret (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989). Thus, the nature of war is unchanging. In theory, could AI alter the nature of war itself because wars will be fought by robotic systems, not people, and because of AI’s potential to engage in planning and decision-making that were previously human endeavors? U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis speculated in February 2018 that AI is “fundamentally different” in ways that raise questions about the nature of war. See ""Press Gaggle by Secretary Mattis En Route to Washington, D.C.,"" Department of Defense, Feb. 17, 2018, https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1444921/press-gaggle-by-secretary-mattis-en-route-to-washington-dc/.

GENEVA

On the sidelines of an AI for Good conference in Geneva, where humans and robots mingled and discussed how machine learning could help global development, IRIN rolled up its data science sleeves and deployed a bot on an important new challenge: making up names of aid agencies and aid job titles.
It’s a new take on some of the jargon and repetitiveness that can be found in the relief and development sector, and hopefully gives a taste of the rudiments of machine learning.
*Update 31 May: Following suggestions from readers, we applied the machine learning code to 4,500 project titles from the International Aid Transparency Initiative dataset to generate some surreal but somehow familiar new project ideas. Scroll down for a taste... 
First we downloaded a list of over 9,000 aid organisations from the UN’s Financial Tracking Service (FTS) database. The A-Z list goes from “A Call to Serve International” to “Zwanan Development Organization”. Then we fed them into a machine learning system running open-source code in the Python language.
The aid organisation names were processed by a recurrent neural network built on the TensorFlow system. We won’t (also, can’t) explain how the maths works in detail. However, it functions like any machine learning process – the foundation of the current explosion in “AI” across a range of sectors – it analyses the patterns of letters and words and then attempts to generate new examples using the rules it has deduced from the original data.
(Our idea to explore the jargon and nomenclature in aidspeak owes much to Janelle Shane, who feeds machine learning algorithms with unlikely lists, such as the names of craft beers or the names of pet guinea pigs).
Here are some of our favourites, generated entirely by code.
Update: Aid project titles produced by AI



Here are 12 favourites generated from studying a dataset of 4,500 IATI project titles:

Support to South Savable Girls
Emergency Womens Affected Host Technocons 
Support to complication against agriculture in The Rehabilitation
Tender Support to State Final Emergency II​
Emergency WASH project for Visibility
Develop Award Girls in Good Di Minion
Bossing Support​
Emergency WASH Election Response in South Sudan​
Mid-term Education Most Hard African States in Kosovo
Support to the GBV Livestock Strategy of Integrated Host Communities in IDPs in Laba​
Support to the poops in Emergency​
Transit come response for the improved EU Development of the Sudanian State​

Aid agency names produced by AI
Some sound quite plausible – if you do set one up, please let us know and send the logo.
Support International Aid Foundation
Community Aid Association for Development
Association des Femmes de l'Environnement
Medicultural Community Foundation
Some a little pompous: 
International Council of Society
Internationalist Fund for Rehabilitation
Save Foundation
Others, possibly creative and/or radical:
Sure Vision for Red Cross
Africa Relief and Empower Swedish Family
People Trust of South ye Community Humanitarian Family
Water World Sudan

AI-generated NGO: People Trust of South ye Community Humanitarian Family

Sometimes our bot seemed to get a little lost and confused:
Alliance for Development and Development
Miseration Mission for Comment of Africa
Alliance Save the Development International
Gy Alliance Conflicted Now Women International
El Organisation des Futures
And, some are just plain weird (sorry not sorry):
ACF and Development Porn
Scam for National Aid
Bin Welfare Relief and Training
Association Premirerianista
Next, we moved onto humanitarian job titles. We fed the bot more than 2,000 vacancies on the UN’s ReliefWeb jobs pages. And these are some of the best new jobs titles it came up with. Perhaps some of these fit your current role? Or make you wish you could apply?

AI-generated job title: Regional Regionalization of International Programme for Head of Party

Once a computer scientist’s pipe dream, artificial intelligence and machine learning are now part of our daily lives in the form of voice recognition systems, product recommendation platforms and navigation tools. All of these rely on computer algorithms that process information and solve problems in a way similar to – and sometimes superior to – the human mind.Yet artificial intelligence is doing more than just recommending new restaurants and the best routes to them. It is also changing the way scientists across diverse disciplines are studying the world. Aided by the close proximity of medical researchers, computer scientists, psychologists and more, Stanford researchers are deploying artificial intelligence to map poverty in Africa, find safer alternatives to conventional rechargeable batteries and perhaps even understand our own minds.

EFE/ Michael Reynolds
While Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify before the Senate, 100 cardboard cutouts of the Facebook founder and CEO stand outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Tuesday, April 10, 2018.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies—and the data driven business models underpinning them—are disrupting how we live, interact, work, do business, and govern. The economic, social and environmental benefits could be significant, for example in the realms of medical research, urban design, fair employment practices, political participation, public service delivery. But evidence is mounting about the potential negative consequences for society and individuals. These include the erosion of privacy, online hate speech, and the distortion of political engagement. They also include amplifying socially embedded discrimination where algorithms based on bias training data are used in criminal sentencing or job advertising and recruitment. Further, certain vulnerable groups will require special attention. For example, UNICEF has recently published a series of papers on Child Rights and Business in a Digital World elaborating on risks and opportunities children face in the areas of access to education and information, freedom of expression, privacy, digital marketing, and online safety.
All of this means we urgently need a robust view of what responsible conduct looks like, and a vision for how markets and governance mechanisms can guide the right behaviors while also encouraging innovation. We believe that the business and human rights field, in particular the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), offers a compelling way forward that perfectly fits the challenge ahead.
In a recent US Senate hearing, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg returned again and again to a sentiment that the company did not take a “broad enough view” of their responsibility. This perfectly captures the state of affairs, not just for Silicon Valley, but for the entire global business community in the midst of developing their digital strategy for the so-called fourth industrial revolution. Zuckerberg spoke of a “broader philosophical shift in how we approach our responsibility as a company” and that “we have to go through all of our relationships with people and make sure that we’re taking a broad enough view of our responsibility”. He said it was a mistake to “view our responsibility as just building tools” and when questioned about the company’s early move fast and break things mantra, admitted: “I do think we made mistakes because of that”.
In a recent US Senate hearing, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg returned again and again to a sentiment that the company did not take a “broad enough view” of their responsibility. 
Yet beyond noting several different legislative proposals (for example around data privacy, online child protection, consent, and campaign advertising) none of the 50 Senators probed for a clear articulation of what “broader responsibility” might mean in practice. We are left with a hopeful sentiment and no clear sense of what society should expect (or require) of organizations and companies developing, selling, buying, and using data-driven and AI technology solutions. Having no framework of responsibility—nor an understanding of how stakeholders can check that responsibility—is not a good result for anyone. Law makers and corporations will endure a tug-of-war between the false choice of libertarianism and government intervention. Civil society and affected people will seek accountability when harms occur but likely lack the technical know-how or resources to achieve their desired results. And entrepreneurs, engineers, technologists, data scientists, sales teams, and business leaders will have no compass to guide their practices. All the while, innovation will continue and more harm to people (especially vulnerable groups) will likely occur. Lots of noise, but no change.
For these reasons, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) could meet the challenge ahead by moving steadily forward to fix what is not working for rights-holders. Several recent developments point in that direction. Initiatives such as the Partnership on AI, the Ethics and Governance of AI Fund, AI Now, and the work of Data & Society are exploring the social, ethical, and human rights implications of AI. Governments are moving forward too. The Australian Human Rights Commission, for example, has launched a project which seeks to ensure human rights are prioritized in the design and regulation of new technologies. And numerous organizations, such as the Information Technology Industry Council, the Software and Information Industry Association, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, have published principles for ethics and AI—some explicitly referring to the UN Guiding Principles.
We see three key questions as critical to this debate and will be writing papers that address them in coming months:

In what ways can the business and human rights field address the potentially negative consequences of disruptive technologies? For example, how can society’s governance of adverse impacts on the most vulnerable (such as children, those living in poverty, and ethnic minorities) keep pace with change? Companies should know and show that they respect all human rights in the course of doing business, and there is a global need to provide swift and meaningful remedy when harms occur. Those working in this area need to reflect on the limits of current frameworks, tools and practices, and identify where innovation is needed—such as methods that address human rights opportunities, as well as human rights risks.
	 
Who needs to be part of realizing a broader practice of responsibility? Large technology firms have a key leadership role to play. But we believe that the human rights issues associated with big data and AI are now a concern for all industries, not just technology companies. The potential impacts on human rights of deploying AI solutions in certain core business activities (such as in sales, marketing, and the workplace) and in diverse industries (such as financial services, retail, healthcare, and transport and logistics) are significant. However, the question of “who” has other important dimensions. Who within large companies should be involved in ensuring respect for human rights (such as technology officers, engineers, data scientists, and lawyers)? What is the role of university research centers, app developers, entrepreneurs, professional bodies, and venture capitalists? How should civil society and rights-holders be involved in defining good corporate practice?
	 
What tools, methodologies or guidance will operationalize business respect for human rights in the context of disruptive technologies? How can analysts and activists map the needs of business leaders while integrating respect for human rights into company decision making? In this aspect of the debate, it is critical to highlight cases of good or emerging practices, whether related to embedding respect for human rights into policies and processes, or related to specific impacts and dilemmas. Polices, guidance, and tools that could help integrate respect for human rights into decision making about disruptive technologies are also of utmost importance. These might include: tools designed to assess the human rights impacts of products, services, and technologies; key human rights-related questions to address in due diligence when developing or procuring technological solutions; guidance on how to ensure rights-holder perspectives inform technology design; or principles for how to address informed consent and remedy in the context of digital complexity.

It is time to define responsibility in real terms and time to figure out how to embed dignity for all and respect for human rights into the fourth industrial revolution. As this debate in OGR develops, we welcome your responses to these questions, and we look forward to testing and refining our ideas with leaders in business, civil society and government.

Milo Medin, a Google vice president, turned the conversation to using artificial intelligence in war games. Eric Schmidt, Google’s former boss, proposed using that tactic to map out strategies for standoffs with China over the next 20 years.A few months later, the Defense Department hired Google’s cloud division to work on Project Maven, a sweeping effort to enhance its surveillance drones with technology that helps machines think and see.Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

How many times have you helped a client buy or sell a property and then never spoken to them again? It’s a pretty common scenario. The truth is, humans tend to be lazy and are often easily distracted, according to Greg Cypes, chief technology officer at Contactually, a customer relationship management software company. You have business meetings, soccer games, and other family obligations, so staying in touch with past clients is often put on the back burner. “We don’t do a great job at prioritizing relationships, nor do we understand how to form relationships because we don’t always know what to say or how to say it,” Cypes said.
But artificial intelligence might be able to help this conundrum. During the Emerging Business Issues & Technology Forum at the REALTORS® Legislative Meetings & Trade Expo in Washington, D.C. on May 17, presenters discussed the value and benefits of budding AI technology and how it may help real estate pros develop more authentic relationships with clients, prospects, and colleagues.
“AI isn’t robots; we’re many years away from that,” Cypes said. And we’re not living in a science-fiction thriller where an imperial army of robot soldiers is on the verge of taking over the world. Instead, AI is about augmenting the technology we already use and helping people work more effectively. And it’s already happening. Think about all the times you visit a website and it’s personalized for you, or how Apple helps organize your personal photos based on facial recognition.
In the future, brokers could use AI to propagate their personality and business culture across multiple offices. Automated messages, such as those a broker might send congratulating an agent on a completed deal, could mimic their management style without the need to record a video greeting, for example. Agents could also use this type of technology to form stronger bonds with clients.
Aleksander Velkoski, a data scientist with NAR, showed a video of a Google Duplex(link is external) phone call that debuted during the Google I/O 2018 conference last week, which demonstrates how the AI assistant can make a hair salon appointment while sounding almost indistinguishable from a human. “One of the things that’s exciting about Duplex is that it’s capable of being thrown curve balls and addressing those curve balls,” Velkoski said. For instance, the assistant can call a restaurant to make reservations and handle a scenario where the restaurant doesn’t take reservations. The sophistication of technology depends on training related to real-life scenarios that programmers provide to the AI, he added.

When it comes to your real estate business, AI can already help in numerous ways. The technology is evolving in its ability to understand and process the nuances of language, including active or passive voice, pleasant or unpleasant tones, and its understanding of text in articles, tweets, and documents, Velkoski said. Through computer vision, AI is now able to identify and extract objects from images, such as pieces of furniture in a photo of a living room. This results in more advanced virtual staging software and platforms such as augmented reality apps that can visualize room concepts for marketing vacant properties. AI tools like Insightpool and Sprout can also help with social media monitoring and listening. And when it comes to the everyday operations of your business, AI can help with customer service and support, IT service monitoring, security and fraud prevention, and electronic commerce help.
Velkoski suggested that agents and broker-owners considering how AI can help their businesses begin by following the trends in emerging technology, and test products out whenever possible. He also advised they set realistic goals and start with small AI initiatives. Finally, business leaders should ensure their team members and agents have access to the education and information they need to use the technology.

Tianjin, a northeastern port city outside Beijing, said it will establish a 100 billion yuan（(US$15.7 billion)）fund to speed up development of new generation AI technologies, according to a document posted on the city government’s official website on Wednesday.
The money will be raised from financial organisations in China and abroad as well as from private enterprises and other market players, it said. The AI industrial fund is part of Tianjin government’s grand plan to “speed up the development of the smart technology industry”, which includes a 10 billion yuan smart manufacturing fund financed by the municipal government and a string of talent incentives – up to 2 million yuan cash reward per person – to attract high-end tech talent.
China’s AI dream is well on its way to becoming a reality
The planned fund comes as competition heats up between China and the United States in dominance of AI technologies, which are vital to enable an array of emerging applications from talking robots to self-driving cars. Tianjin’s fund amount also dwarfs funding announced last month by the European Union Commission, which said it would boost investment in AI by 70 per cent to €1.5 billion (US$1.78 billion) between 2018 and 2020. The investment is expected to boost total private and public European investment in AI to at least €20 billion by 2020.
China’s goal is to develop itself into a key global AI innovation centre and build an AI industry valued at more than 1 trillion yuan by 2030, according to three-step development road map released by the State Council in 2017. The Trump administration vowed last week to maintain the US’s leading position in AI technology through greater funding and other initiatives.
Local governments in China have been investing money and devising policies to spur AI development ever since the central government made AI a national priority.
In January China’s capital Beijing announced a plan to build a 13.8 billion yuan AI development park, aiming to house up to 400 enterprises with an estimated annual output of 50 billion yuan.
At the end of last year Shanghai announced a plan to build a globally competitive AI industry with an output of 100 billion yuan by 2020.

 Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent months, combined with increasing volumes of data and falling technology costs, are radically transforming the world of business. A survey conducted by EY with Forbes Insights shows 66 per cent of global companies are investing upwards of £4 million in analytics software and 78 per cent agree that analytics are changing the nature of competitive advantage. Leading companies reported a significant shift in their ability to meet competitive challenges by using data.
The impact of AI on finance functions is well documented, but its ability to unlock value in today’s tax function less so. Nevertheless, its impacts can be just as dramatic. Machine-learning software, a form of AI, can read thousands of lines of business transactions and instantly assess whether an item of expenditure is tax deductible. Where once armies of tax accountants trawled through corporate accounts to work out tax liabilities, a single machine can do this work in seconds with improved accuracy and consistency.
Notwithstanding the impressive results of putting AI to work in tax, the businesses in our survey said they encourage data analysis to be carried out by someone who knows the organisation and is familiar with the business objectives. This highlights the importance of human oversight of AI processes and data analytics.
As a result, the introduction of AI is triggering a rethink of the responsibilities of the tax function and, by extension, those of finance departments in businesses. It is also fundamentally changing the role of the tax professional, freeing them from repetitive tasks to concentrate on higher-end strategic business partnering.
“Accounting and compliance work will be changed irrevocably by adopting these technologies,” says Charles Brayne, chief tax innovation officer at EY. “In common with other global organisations, we are going through a process of looking at our business and asking how we can apply machine-learning and AI in different areas. I foresee accounting compliance and diligence work, risk management and tax review being almost entirely automated, data driven or machine driven.”
As an example, tax compliance (be that corporate tax, VAT or employment taxes) for a business involves going through lists of hundreds of thousands of items of expenditure, from marketing costs to travel expenses, then deciding which items to tax effect. This is a huge volume of work for tax professionals to carry out. It requires deep knowledge of tax law and the ability to make informed judgments. The process is open to error given the sheer complexity and repetitive nature of the work.
Search tools and rule-based systems can speed up the process. If a description of a transaction contains a certain keyword, for example, it is automatically assigned to a tax category. However, it is impossible to capture the full complexities of tax law by simply setting up such a system.
This is where machine-learning approaches, such as text classification, are reshaping tax practice and is the basis of a new tool we have created at EY called the Automated Ledger Review Tool, or ALeRT. It is a machine-learning system that infers tax rules from data with which it is presented rather than being explicitly taught them.

ALeRT offers great opportunities for directing tax professionals to where their judgement is most needed

ALeRT is first shown “training data” from which it learns how the descriptions of transactions relate to tax treatment. It is language and alphabet agnostic, but it is data that has already been labelled or categorised by a human. For example, it could be a previous year’s accounts, where each transaction, such as an item of marketing expenditure or a travel expense, is marked up as being tax deductible or not. The machine figures out which features or words in the description help it to discriminate between the different categories. When it has observed certain patterns of words many times and in each case the answer was always “deductible”, it learns that whenever it sees a similar combination of words and letters, the answer should again be “tax deductible”.
Training is a vital stage in creating a machine-learning system. Before letting ALeRT loose on live corporate data, its accuracy, along with other key performance metrics, are validated against other training data. This is another essential feature of ALeRT; it states the confidence it has in every one of its conclusions and whether or not it is confused. Scrutinising these outputs is where the human mind and the tax professional’s craft are brought back into the process, and where true business advantage lies.
ALeRT offers great opportunities for directing tax professionals to where their judgment is most needed,  as there may be just 200 out of 10,000 that merit a human review. Our experience of using ALeRT suggests that to create value from big data, you need to analyse, review and act on data findings intelligently, not apply them blindly.

A further benefit of AI and machine-learning lies in its accuracy. The machine is deterministic, so when it sees a description and gives a category, it replicates this exactly for each example. Humans are not so consistent, so there is a greatly improved consistency of output. The risk associated with transaction analysis therefore goes down as a result of using this technology. This can save businesses money as they often err on the side of caution and miss out on full tax reliefs due to their complexity.
According to Harvey Lewis, chief data scientist for tax, technology and transformation at EY, the growing use of AI and machine-learning means tax professionals will require a broader set of skills. “They will need their tax training and expertise, but they will also need other skills. They’ll have to understand how the software works and they will need to develop the art of storytelling and giving insights to clients about the data. The upshot of AI is that their skillsets will start to expand rather than contract. Businesses are realising that success in AI depends on a strong focus on people,” says Dr Lewis.
EY is looking at greater use of AI in future, for instance it is prototyping a chatbot that can answer questions about taxation from clients. Tax accounting will undergo huge changes over coming years with the application of AI. This will bring broad benefits to clients, to consultancies and to the accountants themselves.

And lawyers and the legal profession are no exception. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform the legal profession in many ways, but in most cases it augments what humans do and frees them up to take on higher-level tasks such as advising to clients, negotiating deals and appearing in court.

What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence mimics certain operations of the human mind and is the term used when machines are able to complete tasks that typically require human intelligence. The term machine learning is when computers use rules (algorithms) to analyze data and learn patterns and glean insights from the data. Artificial intelligence is a large factor shifting the way legal work is done.
Review documents and legal research
AI-powered software improves the efficiency of document analysis for legal use and machines can review documents and flag them as relevant to a particular case. Once a certain type of document is denoted as relevant, machine learning algorithms can get to work to find other documents that are similarly relevant. Machines are much faster at sorting through documents than humans and can produce output and results that can be statistically validated. They can help reduce the load on the human workforce by forwarding on only documents that are questionable rather than requiring humans to review all documents. It’s important that legal research is done in a timely and comprehensive manner, even though it’s monotonous. AI systems such as the one offered by ROSS Intelligence leverages natural language processing to help analyze documents.
PROMOTED
Help perform due diligence
In law offices around the world, legal support professionals are kept busy conducting due diligence to uncover background information on behalf of their clients. This works includes confirming facts and figures and thoroughly evaluating the decisions on prior cases to effectively provide counsel to their clients. Artificial intelligence tools can help these legal support professionals to conduct their due diligence more efficiently and with more accuracy since this work is often tedious for humans.

Contract review and management
A big portion of work law firms do on behalf of clients is to review contracts to identify risks and issues with how contracts are written that could have negative impacts for their clients. They redline items, edit contracts and counsel clients if they should sign or not or help them negotiate better terms. AI can help analyze contracts in bulk as well as individual contracts. There are several software companies who created AI tools specifically for contract review such as Kira Systems, LawGeex and eBrevia that help sort contracts quicker and with fewer errors than humans.
Predict legal outcomes
AI has the capability of analyzing data to help it make predictions about the outcomes of legal proceedings better than humans. Clients are often asking their legal counsel to predict the future with questions such as “If we go to trial, how likely will it be that I win?” or “Should I settle?” With the use of AI that has access to years of trial data, lawyers are able to better answer such questions.

Automating divorce
A typical divorce settlement can take a year or more and can cost $27,000 on average in the United States. With a goal of “making every divorce amicable,” Wevorce provides couples a self-guided online divorce solution for a fraction of the cost. Couples can define their “optimal outcomes” and the AI-powered machine walks them through five modules and all the critical decisions that need to be made for their particular circumstances. There are also legal experts available to step in to provide guidance when needed.
How will AI impact the legal profession?
According to Deloitte, 100,000 legal roles will be automated by 2036. They report that by 2020 law firms will be faced with a “tipping point” for a new talent strategy.  Now is the time for all law firms to commit to becoming AI-ready by embracing a growth mindset, set aside the fear of failure and begin to develop internal AI practices. There are many who believe innovation is the key to transforming the legal profession. That’s precisely what NextLaw Labs, “the first legal technology venture created by a law firm,” plans to do.
It’s clear that AI and machine learning are already transforming law firms and the legal sector.

Grantees of Microsoft’s AI for Earth, a program aimed at helping groups address complex environmental problems, met at Microsoft headquarters recently to learn new ways to apply artificial intelligence and cloud computing to their respective projects.The program awards grants of access to and training in the company’s cloud-based data storage, management, and analysis to address challenges in four thematic areas: addressing climate change, protecting biodiversity, improving agricultural yields, and lessening water scarcity.Grant recipients include teams working on game theory to predict poaching patterns; mining social media photos to determine distributions of particular species; and using machine learning and animals’ acoustic activity to determine effectiveness of conservation interventions. New technologies are generating far more information than ever before to help scientists assess and predict the health and behavior of species and ecosystems, as well as the threats they face.
These include cryptic cameras, acoustic sensors, satellite imagery and citizen science apps. Now, researchers and conservation practitioners analyzing large data sets are exploring artificial intelligence, or AI—the ability of a machine or a computer program to think and learn—to help them process, analyze and interpret data to monitor ecosystems and predict results.
Computer systems already exist that can host huge amounts of data, use AI with increasingly “smart” algorithms to classify data from the various types of sensors used by scientists, apply modeling results to create reproducible code, and create user interfaces to allow people to monitor natural systems and make predictions with high accuracy.
By training computer algorithms with a subset of available data, machines can now learn what they should do for a given challenge—such as classify photos by the species found in them, identify areas of a satellite image containing water or intact forest, or translate speech from one language to another­—based on human feedback and data collected from previous experience.

The applications for AI in conservation science are myriad: Fei Fang, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania, leads a group applying game theory and machine learning to optimize patrol routes to catch poachers. At Wild Me, a nonprofit based in Portland, Oregon, director Jason Holmberg’s team applies AI-infused computer vision to identify individual animals of endangered species while reducing fieldwork and image processing time, under the Wildbook open-source project. And at Santa Cruz, California-based  Conservation Metrics, chief executive Matthew McKown and his team are using AI and remote-sensing to automate wildlife surveys and machine learning to classify animals’ acoustic activity.
Cloud-based machine learning
A panel moderated by Mongabay founder Rhett Butler at the AI for Earth meeting at Microsoft headquarters in Seattle, Washington highlighted the work of Fang, Holmberg and McKown. The meeting, from May 16 to 18, gathered some 40 researchers, engineers and conservation professionals from over 25 institutions to network and improve their capacity to apply AI tools to specific conservation challenges.
The participants were all recipients of seed grants from Microsoft’s AI for Earth program. The grants provide between $5,000 and $15,000 worth of access to various resources on Microsoft’s Azure cloud-based computing platform. These include data, data storage, and tools for modeling, predictive analytics, machine learning, spatial analysis, and visualization, as well as training on using the various tools.

Over the two-day meeting, the grantees attended classroom sessions to learn about cloud-based machine learning tools on the Azure platform. Topics included modeling with AI, cognitive services (e.g. vision or speech), deep learning, project management, and data visualization.  The meeting also introduced the Microsoft R Workflows tool that combines AI and the R statistical analysis tool, and the GeoAI tool that integrates AI with a geographic information system (GIS) to perform and automate spatial analyses, conduct predictive analytics, and integrate statistical and location information.
The AI for Earth grantee projects aim to classify images to map the distribution of species, vegetation types or spread of disease; predict extreme weather events, snow pack or crop cover; and assess risks or impact from climate change, geophysical hazards or wildlife poachers in a given area.
‘You know the problem you’re trying to solve’
Since its launch in December 2017, the AI for Earth program has provided assistance to more than 110 individuals and organizations in 27 countries working to address complex environmental and conservation challenges. Grantees include students, universities, private nonprofit organizations, government agencies, land trusts, and other groups.
It continues to accept applicants on a rolling basis, reviewing applications from around the world several times each year.
These collaborations earn Microsoft both positive publicity and new customers in the environmental sector, and grantees welcome the potential gains that AI-related technologies can bring to conservation science.
Fang and her students at Carnegie Mellon, for instance, expect that machine learning tools and game theory will help them more accurately and efficiently predict where wildlife poaching will happen next. Holmberg wants to speed up the Wildbook project’s processing of images, where AI can automate the scanning of social media sites for photographs of a particular species. Algorithms help identify each individual animal, together with where and how often it’s photographed, and suggest new ways to produce global population estimates for endangered species.
Although albatrosses, like this Laysan albatross, spend most of their time at sea, they nest on open, grassy or sandy expanses of islands. Rats, cats, dogs, and other introduced predators kill nesting birds and chicks, so scientists are analyzing acoustic data with AI to study how populations of these birds respond to eradication of these invasive species.

At Conservation Metrics, McKown wants to understand impacts of conservation actions, such as excluding domestic animals from islands, on seabirds and grassland nesting habitat. He and his team are beginning to use AI to help analyze acoustic activity data see if such actions actually help restore wild animal populations.
AI for Earth awards grants in four broad thematic areas: addressing climate change, protecting biodiversity, improving agricultural yields, and lessening water scarcity. It particularly seeks projects focusing on a question that lends itself to an AI answer.
“At this stage in our program, we’re trying to cast a very broad net,” said Josh Henretig, senior director and co-lead of AI for Earth. “There are a range of different technology solutions out there.”
AI for Earth can be most helpful to groups that have defined the problem they want to solve and have validated the problem with research or a target community to identify, and ideally gather, the data they need to solve it, Henretig said.
“Ultimately,” he said, “through our grant program … we’re starting with the premise that you’ve done that background work, you know the problem that you’re trying to solve, so let’s start with an initial investment in Azure infrastructure that you can begin to shape some part of the project that you’re trying to drive forward.”

Grantees at last week’s meeting were familiar with AI or machine learning but had a range of experience with the Azure platform. Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s chief environmental scientist and AI for Earth’s other co-lead, said the initial grants of access to cloud infrastructure, AI software, and services in the Azure cloud were intended “to get people up and running to address issues with machine learning.”
“We do have fairly introductory-level content for people,” Henretig said, “like how to access and set up your Azure account, how to organize resources on that Azure account, [so] you know how to get started.”
Researchers can apply for AI for Earth support online here. Grant applications should include a proposal that describes the environmental problem or challenge being addressed, the datasets used for analysis, proposed methods to solve the problem, and the expected impact the project will have on the issue. Henretig said his team had a particular interest in supporting innovative water and agriculture projects, though they welcome proposals for projects in all four thematic categories.

When pundits talk about the impact that artificial intelligence (AI) will have on the labor market, the outlook is usually bleak, with the loss of many jobs to machines as the dominant theme. But that’s just part of the story — a probable outcome for companies that use AI only to increase efficiency. As it turns out, companies using AI to also drive innovation are more likely to increase head count than reduce it.
That’s what my colleagues and I recently learned through the McKinsey Global Institute’s broad-based research initiative aimed at understanding the spread of AI in economies, sectors, and companies.1 We polled 20,000 AI-aware C-level executives in 10 countries to compile a sample of more than 3,000 companies (mostly large), identified distinct clusters within that pool, and ran a variety of scenarios on those clusters to project the effects of AI on employment, revenue, and profitability.
This research and analysis suggest that although AI will probably lead to less overall full-time-equivalent employment by 2030, it won’t inevitably lead to massive unemployment. One major reason for this prediction is because early, innovation-focused adopters are positioning themselves for growth, which tends to stimulate employment. (See “How AI-Based Innovations Drive Employment.”)



How AI-Based Innovations Drive Employment
Growth is a key part of the equation between the performance and employment shifts we’ll see from now through 2030 for five types of companies.









Here’s how we expect things to play out in the five clusters of companies we examined.
Enthusiastic innovators, or pioneering companies that make early investments in AI and embrace the disruption it can create in the quest for advantage, adopt a full range of AI technologies and use them to bolster innovation and efficiency. These companies are analogous to what sociologist and communication theorist Everett Rogers called “early adopters” back when he coined the term — they’re intrinsically motivated to use new technology to shape and open markets.2 While this approach is potentially complex in the short term, our analysis shows that by 2030, the profitability of enthusiastic innovators will grow 8% faster than that of the average company on an annual basis, their revenue will grow 4% faster, and their head count will rise 2.2% faster.

From the May 2018 Issue.
One of the hot areas of emerging technology is Artificial Intelligence or AI. You know a topic is hot when products use the terminology in their name or in their marketing materials. We’ve see this done with “ease of use”, Cloud Computing, and Blockchain. Artificial Intelligence is so hot of a topic among the development community that the marketing teams are saying products have AI when in fact, they do not. Because of this, I’ve been using the approach of calling this “artificial” Artificial Intelligence or “Fake” AI. Facts matter, and many products that claim to have AI simply do not. It is truly buyer beware right now in this area.
As a computer scientist by training, I admire products that have developed solutions that leverage AI. Program development in this area is not easy, and the products are just starting to work and do meaningful tasks. Some of the goals of AI are quite lofty, and the promises and risks of AI in computing are quite large. Consider the following:


On the positive side:

Machines mimic cognitive functions associated with human minds such as learning and problem solving.
As AI becomes more capable, tasks that were considered AI are considered solved, for example, OCR.
Today, AI developments include human speech, autonomous cars, interpreting complex data like images and video.
Algorithms can learn from data and provide insight and actionable items with minimal human intervention.

On the down side:

For difficult problems, algorithms require enormous computation.
“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.” Stephen Hawking. Other critics include: Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Peter Thiel.
Devaluation of humanity.
Decrease in demand for human labor.
Artificial moral agents.
Machine ethics.
Malevolent and friendly AI.
Machine consciousness.
Robot rights.
Superintelligence.

AI has been under development for a long time, starting at Dartmouth in 1956. I was using LISP in 1975 and this tool was broadly used until 1987, when it was replaced by SmallTalk/Medley. AI is routinely divided into sub-fields such as robotics (a future topic of this why and how series of columns) or machine learning (third in the series) although we are treating these emerging technologies separately in the why and how series of articles. Traditional goals include: reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and explainability. Tools include versions of search and mathematical optimization, neural networks and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. Stuart Shapiro divides AI research into three traditions, which he calls computational psychology, computational philosophy, and computer science. Together the human-like behavior, mind and actions make up AI.
We’ve seen the results of AI with public relations stunts when:

Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov on May 11, 1997.
In a February 2011 Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM‘s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.
At the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.

Why?
AI is a broad collection of topics and approaches. Because there are so many topics to cover, there are broad fields of study that each have a lot of depth. However, purists are after the last bullet in the list below, General Intelligence. This is not around the corner, as computer scientists of the 1950’s believed, but a decade or more into the future, even with the rapid progress being made today. There are a number of problems AI is trying to solve:

Reasoning – AI has progressed using “sub-symbolic” problem solving statistical approaches to AI mimic the human ability to guess faster and more accurately.
Knowledge representation – a representation of “what exists” is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.
Planning – intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them, modifying inputs as needed.
Learning – the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
Natural language processing – the ability to read and understand human language.
Perception – the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, tactile sensors, sonar and others) to deduce aspects of the world – think digital exhaust and IOT.
Motion and manipulation – robots need to handle tasks such as object manipulation and navigation, with sub-problems such as localization, mapping, and motion planning.
Social intelligence – affective computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects (=emotions), needed for two reasons:

o   being able to predict the actions of others, such as in self-driving vehicles.
o   facilitate human–computer interaction by showing emotions.

Creativity – theoretical and/or practical generation of novel and useful outputs including music and art.
General intelligence – researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence, while a few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project.

So how do Artificial Intelligence approaches work? They use:

Cybernetics and brain stimulation – connection to neurology .
Traditional symbolic AI – John Haugeland named these approaches to AI “good old fashioned AI” or “GOFAI“ exploring the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.
Cognitive simulation – Economist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills from psychological experiments resulting in the Soar architecture in the 1980’s.
Logic-based – John McCarthy in his laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) used formal logic and led to the Prolog language and the science of logic programming.
Anti-logic or scruffy – Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad-hoc solutions.
Knowledge-based – led to the development in the 1970’s of expert systems, introduced by Edward Feigenbaum of Stanford.
Sub-symbolic – when traditional symbolic AI stalled in the 1980’s unable to solve problems in perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, researchers tried to not encode knowledge.
Embodied intelligence – Researchers of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, reintroduced the use of control theory and embodied mind.
Computational intelligence – neural networks and “connectionism” was revived by David Rumelhart leading to soft computing approaches including fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation and statistical tools.
Statistical methods – sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems that are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable.
Intelligent agent – a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.

With input from the customer and collaboration between artificial intelligence (AI) and human stylists, the online styling subscription service eliminates the need for their customers to go out and shop for clothing or even browse online, because they deliver personalized recommendations right to their door on a regular schedule. The customers can keep all of the products or return what they don’t like or need. That feedback gets input into the company’s data vaults to make the algorithms even better at determining the preferred style for each person and even identify trends.

In 2017, the company had $1 billion in revenue and 2.2 million active customers, but competitors such as Amazon and Trunk Club are lining up to mimic its style of retail. Here are just a few of the most intriguing ways Stitch Fix uses artificial intelligence in combination with human stylists to propel its business.
Personalization of clothing and accessories
Stitch Fix has combined the expertise of personal stylists with the insight and efficiency of artificial intelligence to analyze data on style trends, body measurements, customer feedback and preferences to arm the human stylists with a culled down version of possible recommendations. This helps the company provide its customers with personalized style recommendations that fit their lifestyle and budgets.

Improve satisfaction rate and lower return rate

The better the Stitch Fix stylists—human and machines—are at providing their customers with products they will love, the better their business runs. As they invest in merchandise they know their customers will love, the less they waste on warehouse space, return costs and donating items that weren’t sold. As Eric Colson, chief algorithm officer at Stitch Fix, said, “Our business is getting relevant things into the hands of our customers.”
Develop new styles
Back in 2012, Stitch Fix had one machine learning algorithm, today they have hundreds. Using the data it collects, the company is designing its own styles known as Hybrid Designs. They think of each style as a collection of attributes such as color, arm length and neckline. Then, they look at the feedback that’s available for each of these attributes. By recombining attributes and even mutating them slightly, Stitch Fix is able to create new designs to share with its human designers to vet the final styles that make it into their inventory. Then, the styling algorithm will get the new products into the hands of customers and when they share their feedback, the cycle of evolution continues.

Know the client
Stitch Fix not only asks customers to fill out a style profile to determine style, size and prize preferences but records every touch point it has with clients and considers the “state” of each customer at any given time (starting a new job, have a special event, going through a life transition such as divorce). As the algorithms identify a shift in “state,” it can help deliver the most relevant items and ultimately provide info to inform system level impacts.
Streamline operations
Artificial intelligence is at work through all aspects of the warehouse and delivery system of Stitch Fix. When a shipment is requested, an algorithm determines and assigns it to a warehouse based on the location of the client and the inventory of the warehouse and its match to a customer’s style among other considerations. Once items are selected for shipment, algorithms optimize the pick route to fill the box and look at possible combinations that would allow shipments to be picked at the same time.
Inventory management
Stitch Fix is just as concerned with inventory management as traditional brick-and-mortar stores. As clients receive and keep merchandise, they need to restock their inventory to give stylists a large enough inventory to meet demand. They need to figure out how many of each style to purchase so that it meets demand, but there’s no extras they can’t sell. The company uses algorithms to help optimize these and other complex inventory management issues.
While it may have been easier to outline the ways algorithms aren’t used by Stitch Fix, one thing is certain, the company has shown how collaboration between AI machines and humans with both doing what they do best is good business. Even with AI involved, humans are essential in the process, but when they work together the results are supercharged productivity and effectiveness.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,Enterprise & Cloud,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/25/stitch-fix-the-amazing-use-case-of-using-artificial-intelligence-in-fashion-retail/,,False,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,Stitch Fix: The Amazing Use Case Of Using Artificial Intelligence In Fashion Retail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field of Artificial Intelligence powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning has gone through some phenomenal changes over the last decade. Starting off as just a pure academic and research-oriented domain, we have seen widespread industry adoption across diverse domains including retail, technology, healthcare, science and many more. Rather than just running lab experiments to publish a research paper, the key objective of data science and machine learning in the 21st century has changed to tackling and solving real-world problems, automating complex tasks and making our life easier and better. More than often, the standard toolbox of machine learning, statistical or deep learning models remain the same. New models do come into existence like Capsule Networks, but industry adoption of the same usually takes several years. Hence, in the industry, the main focus of data science or machine learning is more ‘applied’ rather than theoretical and effective application of these models on the right data to solve complex real-world problems is of paramount importance.A machine learning model by itself consists of an algorithm which tries to learn latent patterns and relationships from data without hard-coding fixed rules. Hence, explaining how a model works to the business always poses its own set of challenges. There are some domains in the industry especially in the world of finance like insurance or banking where data scientists often end up having to use more traditional machine learning models (linear or tree-based). The reason being that model interpretability is very important for the business to explain each and every decision being taken by the model. However, this often leads to a sacrifice in performance. This is where complex models like ensembles and neural networks typically give us better and more accurate performance (since true relationships are rarely linear in nature). We, however, end up being unable to have proper interpretations for model decisions. To address and talk about these gaps, I will be writing a series of articles where we will explore some of these challenges in-depth about explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and human interpretable machine learning.Outline for this SeriesSome of the major areas we will be covering in this series of articles include the following.Part 1: The Importance of Human Interpretable Machine LearningUnderstanding Machine Learning Model InterpretationImportance of Machine Learning Model InterpretationCriteria for Model Interpretation MethodsScope of Model InterpretationPart 2: Model Interpretation StrategiesTraditional Techniques for Model InterpretationChallenges and Limitations of Traditional TechniquesThe Accuracy vs. Interpretability trade-offModel Interpretation TechniquesPart 3: Hands-on Model Interpretation — A comprehensive GuideHands-on guides on using the latest state-of-the-art model interpretation frameworksFeatures, concepts and examples of using frameworks like ELI5, Skater and SHAPExplore concepts and see them in action — Feature importances, partial dependence plots, surrogate models, interpretation and explanations with LIME, SHAP valuesHands-on Machine Learning Model Interpretation on a supervised learning examplePart 4: Hands-on Advanced Model InterpretationHands-on Model Interpretation on Unstructured DatasetsAdvanced Model Interpretation on Deep Learning ModelsThis content will be covered across several articles in this series as highlighted above to keep things concise and interesting, so that everyone can get some key takeaways from every article.MotivationWorking as a Data Scientist in the industry and mentoring people in the field, I have seen that data science is still often perceived as a black box capable of performing magic or alchemy to give people what they want. However, the harsh reality is that without a reasonable understanding of how machine learning models or the data science pipeline works, real-world projects rarely succeed. Considering any data science project in the real world, you will typically have a business aspect and the technical or solution aspect. Now, data scientists typically work to build models and provide solutions for the business. However, the business may not know the intricate details of how a model might work. But since this very model will be making a lot of decisions for them in the end, they do have a right to pose the question, “How can I trust your model?” or “How does your model really make its decisions?” Answering these questions is something data science practitioners and researchers have been trying over several years now.Data Science practitioners will know that there exists a typical model interpretability vs. model performance trade-off. A point to remember here is that model performance is not the run-time or execution performance, but how accurate the model can be in making decisions. There are several models including simple linear models or even tree-based models, which can easily explain the decisions taken by the model to arrive at a particular insight or prediction, but you might need to sacrifice model performance since they always do not yield the best results due to inherent problems of high bias (linear models) or high variance, leading to overfitting (fully grown tree models). More complex models like ensemble models and the more recent deep learning family of models often yield better performance, but are perceived as black-box models, because it is extremely difficult to explain how the model might be really making its decisions under the hood.While some might argue that if something is working well (for the time being), why question how it works? However, being humans, logic and reasoning is something we adhere to for most of our decisions. Hence, the paradigm shift towards artificial intelligence (AI) making decisions will no doubt be questioned. There are a lot of real-world scenarios where biased models might have really adverse effects. This includes predicting potential criminals, judicial sentencing risk scores, credit scoring, fraud detection, health assessment, loan lending, self-driving and many more where model understanding and interpretation is of utmost importance. The same is highlighted by renowned Data Scientist and Author Cathy O’ Neil in her acclaimed book, ‘Weapons of Math Destruction’.MainWeapons of Math Destruction has been Longlisted for the National Book Award! Book description: A former Wall Street…weaponsofmathdestructionbook.comRenowned researcher and author, Kate Crawford, talked about these very aspects of the implications of bias in machine learning and it’s effects on society in the NIPS 2017 Keynote, ‘The Trouble with Bias’.Interested readers should also definitely check out her famous article on the NY Times, ‘Artificial Intelligence’s White Guy Problem’ where she shows us examples of machine learning applications including image categorization, criminal risk predictions, delivery service availability and many more were biased and yielded unfavorable outcomes for the black community. All these real-world scenarios are implications of how important model interpretation should be, and if we want to leverage machine learning to solve these problems.Opinion | Artificial Intelligence's White Guy ProblemACCORDING to some prominent voices in the tech world, artificial intelligence presents a looming existential threat to…www.nytimes.comIn the past year, I have seen the need for model interpretation while solving problems in the industry and also when I was writing my recent book ‘Practical Machine Learning with Python’. During this time, I have had the chance to interact with the wonderful folks at DataScience.com who are very much aware of the need and importance of human interpretability in machine learning models. They have been actively working on a solution and have open-sourced the popular python framework, Skater. We will be taking a deep-dive into Skater and also do some hands-on model interpretation in this series of articles. Besides this we will also do a comprehensive coverage of other model interpretation frameworks like ELI5 and SHAP!Understanding Machine Learning Model InterpretationMachine Learning has seen widespread industry adoption only in the last couple of years. Hence, model interpretation as a concept is still mostly theoretical and subjective.Any machine learning model at its heart has a response function which tries to map and explain relationships and patterns between the independent (input) variables and the dependent (target or response) variable(s).When a model predicts or finds our insights, it takes certain decisions and choices. Model interpretation tries to understand and explain these decisions taken by the response function i.e., the what, why and how. The key to model interpretation is transparency, the ability to question, and the ease of understanding model decisions by humans. The three most important aspects of model interpretation are explained as follows.What drives model predictions? We should have the ability to query our model and find out latent feature interactions to get an idea of which features might be important in the decision-making policies of the model. This ensures fairness of the model.Why did the model take a certain decision? We should also be able to validate and justify why certain key features were responsible in driving certain decisions taken by a model during predictions. This ensures accountability and reliability of the model.How can we trust model predictions? We should be able to evaluate and validate any data point and how a model takes decisions on it. This should be demonstrable and easy to understand for key stakeholders that the model works as expected. This ensures transparency of the model.Interpretability also popularly known as human-interpretable interpretations (HII) of a machine learning model is the extent to which a human (including non-experts in machine learning) can understand the choices taken by models in their decision-making process (the how, why and what).When comparing models, besides model performance, a model is said to have a better interpretability than another model if its decisions are easier to understand by a human than the decisions from the other model.The Importance of Machine Learning Model InterpretationWhen tackling machine learning problems, data scientists often have a tendency to fixate on model performance metrics like accuracy, precision and recall and so on (This is important no doubt!). This is also prevalent in most online competitions around data science and machine learning. However, metrics only tell a part of the story of a model’s predictive decisions. Over time, the performance might change due to model concept drift caused by various factors in the environment. Hence, it is of paramount importance to understand what drives a model to take certain decisions.Some of us might argue if a model is working great why bother digging deeper? Always remember that when solving data science problems in the real-world, for the business to trust your model predictions and decisions, they will keep asking the question, “Why should I trust your model?” and this makes perfect sense. Would you be satisfied with a model just predicting and taking decisions (the what) like if a person has cancer or diabetes, if a person might be a risk to society or even if a customer will churn? Maybe not, we might prefer it more if we could know more about the model’s decision process (the why and how). This gives us more transparency into why the model makes certain decisions, what might go wrong in certain scenarios and over time it helps us build a certain amount of trust on these machine learning models.The key takeaway from this section is that it is high time we stop seeing machine learning models as black boxes and try and analyze not just data, but how models make decisions. In-fact, some of the key steps towards this path was started by the famous paper, “Why Should I Trust You?” Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier by M. T. Ribeiro, S. Singh and C. Guestrin, SIGKDD 2016, where they introduce the concept of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) which we will be covering in the next article in detail.They mention some key points in their paper which are worth remembering.Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model.Whether humans are directly using machine learning classifiers as tools, or are deploying models within other products, a vital concern remains: if the users do not trust a model or a prediction, they will not use it.Interested people should also check out their talk in the KDD conference around their paper in model interpretation.This is something we have discussed several times in this article and is one of the key differentiators which determines the success of data science projects in the industry. This drives the urgency around the need and importance of model interpretation.Criteria for Machine Learning Model Interpretation MethodsThere are specific criteria which can be used for categorizing model interpretation methods. An excellent guide to this is mentioned in “Interpretable Machine Learning, A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable” by Christoph Molnar, 2018Intrinsic or post hoc? Intrinsic interpretability is all about leveraging a machine learning model which is intrinsically interpretable in nature (like linear models, parametric models or tree based models). Post hoc interpretability means selecting and training a black box model (ensemble methods or neural networks) and applying interpretability methods after the training (feature importance, partial dependency plots). We will focus more on post hoc model interpretable methods in our series of articles.Model-specific or model-agnostic? Model-specific interpretation tools are very specific to intrinsic model interpretation methods which depend purely on the capabilities and features on a per-model basis. This can be coefficients, p-values, AIC scores pertaining to a regression model, rules from a decision tree and so on. Model-agnostic tools are more relevant to post hoc methods and can be used on any machine learning model. These agnostic methods usually operate by analyzing (and perturbations of inputs) feature input and output pairs. By definition, these methods do not have access to any model internals like weights, constraints or assumptions.Local or global? This classification of interpretation talks about if the interpretation method explains a single prediction or the entire model behavior? Or if the scope is somewhere in between? We will talk more about global and local interpretations soon.This is not an exhaustive set of criteria for classifying interpretable methods since this is still an emerging field, but this can be a good yardstick to compare and contrast across multiple methods.Scope of Machine Learning Model InterpretationHow do we define the scope and boundaries of interpretability? Some useful aspects can be the transparency, fairness and accountability of a model. Global and Local model interpretations are clear ways to define the scope of model interpretation.Summarizing Global and Local Interpretation (Source: DataScience.com)Global InterpretationsThis is all about trying to understand “How does the model make predictions?” and “How do subsets of the model influence model decisions?”. To comprehend and interpret the whole model at once, we need global interpretability. Global interpretability is all about being able to explain and understand model decisions based on conditional interactions between the dependent (response) variable(s) and the independent (predictor) features on the complete dataset. Trying to understand feature interactions and importances is always a good step towards understanding global interpretation. Of course, visualizing features after more than two or three dimensions becomes quite difficult when trying to analyze interactions. Hence, often looking at modular parts and subsets of features, which might influence model predictions on a global knowledge, helps. Complete knowledge of the model structure, assumptions and constraints are needed for a global interpretation.Local InterpretationsThis is all about trying to understand “Why did the model make specific decisions for a single instance?” and “Why did the model make specific decisions for a group of instances?”. For local interpretability, we do not care about the inherent structure or assumptions of a model and we treat it as a black box. For understanding prediction decisions for a single datapoint, we focus specifically on that datapoint and look at a local subregion in our feature space around that point, and try to understand model decisions for that point based on this local region. Local data distributions and feature spaces might behave completely different and give more accurate explanations as opposed to global interpretations. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) framework is an excellent method which can be used for model-agnostic local interpretation. We can use a combination of global and local interpretations to explain model decisions for a group of instances.Model TransparencyThis is all about trying to understand “How was a model created from algorithms and features?”. We know that typically a machine learning model is all about leveraging an algorithm on top of data features to build a representation which maps inputs to potential outputs(responses). Transparency of a model can be trying to understand more technical details of how models are built and what might influence its decisions. This can be weights of a neural network, weights of a CNN filter, linear model coefficients, the nodes and splits of a decision tree. However, since the business may not be very well-versed in these technical details, trying to explain model decisions with agnostic local and global interpretation methods helps in showcasing model transparency.ConclusionModel Interpretation is something which can make or break a real-world machine learning project in the industry and helps us come one step closer to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Let’s try and work towards human-interpretable machine learning and XAI to demystify machine learning for everyone and help increase the trust in model decisions.What’s next?In Part 2 of this series, we will be covering the following aspects of explainable artificial intelligence with regard to machine learning model interpretation.Traditional Techniques for Model InterpretationChallenges and Limitations of Traditional TechniquesThe Accuracy vs. Interpretability trade-offModel Interpretation TechniquesThanks to Matthew Mayo for editing and featuring this article on KDNuggets.Thanks to all the wonderful folks at DataScience.com and especially Pramit Choudhary for building an amazing model interpretation framework, Skater, and helping me out with some excellent content for this series.I cover a lot of examples of machine learning model interpretation in my book, “Practical Machine Learning with Python”.

Companies that aren’t investing in artificial intelligence (AI) risk falling behind their competitors. Yet because AI is an umbrella term for several different technologies that each have distinct uses, it is often challenging to know which solution is right for a particular work process.
The most well-known subsets of AI are robotic process automation for automating repetitive tasks, machine-learning to give computer systems the ability to “learn” and improve work processes, and natural language processing (NLP), which enables machines to analyse and understand humans’ imperfect way of writing or talking.
A lesser-known AI technology, however, is natural language generation (NLG). At its simplest, an NLG platform is a computer process that can generate natural language text and speech from pre-defined data. At its most advanced, it powers the responses given by AI assistants, such as Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa, when asked a question.
Though currently relatively nascent, the technology has huge potential for many industries, including journalism, finance, business service and healthcare, for both customer-facing and internal work processes.

Using Natural Language Generation to translate data
A booming use case for NLG is as a tool to translate the hordes of data businesses now collect into intelligent, understandable and actionable insights. A platform can be given a set of rules and parameters to work within, and then fed structured data to output reports, paragraphs and emails that appear as though written by a human.
Automated Insights’ NLG platform, called Wordsmith, was originally built to generate sports post-match recaps and player notes, but the company is now seeing an upswing in demand from firms wanting to generate business intelligence reports.
These include marketing analysis and coherent narratives derived from data straight into company dashboards, so complex statistics can be easily understood by everyone in an organisation without being verbally explained by analysts.
“This automates their expertise in a way everyone can understand to alleviate some of the manual work. Every company is collecting data and people want to know what it means immediately; NLG translates it into something anyone can read and understand,” explains the company’s marketing manager Laura Pressman.
NLG: turning numbers to narratives
This is a huge time saver for businesses. Associated Press, for example, produces 4,400 quarterly business recaps using Wordsmith. Every quarter, when a public company publishes its corporate earnings, instead of a journalist sifting through the information, the technology automatically scans and derives insights from each release, and translates it into written, plain language narrative.
In a similar vein, Emmanuel Walckenaer, chief executive of Yseop, an NLG software platform used by Moody’s, Zachs and Societe Général, says the technology can provide financial advisers with a coherently collated written summary of a client’s transaction history that offers recommendations on where they might like to invest next and why or whether they are risk adverse or not.
Typically, these insights will only be one or two paragraphs in length. Creating longer, more in-depth reports is possible, but requires more rules, protocols and system-training, and several weeks to build, which can be a barrier to adoption.
However, in this capacity the technology has great potential for any situation where data needs to be understood quickly, including complex compliance laws or investigating fraudulent data.
Mr Walckenaer says NLG is currently being used in a “simplistic” way, but disruption will come when it can generate intelligent, informal dialogue for customer interaction management through chatbots or AI assistants.
Helpful conversations - from gaming to customer service
In April, Call of Duty announced a beta release of the Alexa Skill for Call of Duty: WWII, which enables players to ask Amazon’s Alexa how they performed in their last computer game.
Through the home assistant, the gamer will get a response in a character’s tone of voice, giving them analysis of their performance comprising more than 20 factors. It also offers gaming tips and answers to 2,500 questions about the game and an individual player’s performance.
This is a cutting-edge technology that also requires NLP for the machine to understand the question and NLG to reply.
Apoorv Saxena, product manager for cloud AI and AI research at Google, says customer and machine-voice interaction is “the next level of technological difficulty” for NGL, but will eventually improve productivity and economies of scale.
“Businesses have a lot of inquiries they are not able to answer because someone can’t take the call, but if you have a chatbot to do it that helps scale small to medium-sized business and improve productivity,” he says.
The technology has great potential for any situation where data needs to be understood quickly
Like other AI technologies, NLG has advanced considerably over the last ten years, but there is still a lot of work to do around customisation and conversation. Furthermore, even for the more simple use-cases, such as generating reports, it can still take a few weeks to adopt.
Mr Saxena says the technology will evolve “but we don’t know how yet”, adding that Google is investing significantly in developing NLG.
Further down the line, perhaps there will be NLG voice systems that recognise when a customer is upset and adjust their tone accordingly or give basic financial advice over the phone based on a person’s financial statistics, freeing up staff for more complex tasks.

Artificial intelligence to help Dutch police solve cold cases: report




The Dutch police are using new artificial intelligence software to breathe new life into cold cases. The new software is specifically used to help hunt down still at large murderers and sex offenders, the Telegraaf reports.
The artificial intelligence will look at cold cases and identify which of them contain promising clues and trace evidence, so that they can be picked up again and reassessed with new forensic techniques. ""At the current rate, we would be working for decades to map out the traces in all cold cases"", Roel Wolfert of the Oost-Nederland police's Q-team said to the newspaper. The Q-team therefore teamed up with an external ICT partner to find a way to speed things up. ""We built a system that has been taught to read digitized files and to automatically map out the forensic traces.""
The Dutch police force is the first one in the world to start using this technology. ""We are proud of this innovative way of detecting"", Wolfert said to the newspaper. ""We are on the verge of a new technological development.""
Cold case teams across the Netherlands are delighted by this new technology. ""This saves us an unspeakable amount of work"", forensic detective Carina van Leeuwen said to the Telegraaf. ""There are at least fifteen hundred cold case investigations in the Netherlands. Examining all of them manually is not feasible. Promising files remain on the shelf and that is unacceptable. For us, but certainly also for the surviving relatives.""
According to Van Leeuwen, many old files contain information about forensic trace evidence that can lead directly to a perpetrator with today's technology. The artificial intelligence software will help them find these promising cases quickly. ""The search system is no substitute for detectives"", she said. ""A murder investigation always remains human work. But with this help we can avoid a lot of ineffective work and immediately start looking for offenders. In this way, an analysis only takes one day instead of weeks.""

Honor








 The Honor 10 is the thinking person's phone; the ultimate mix of affordability without compromising design or features. Available in a stunning Phantom Blue two-tone reflective finish, its beauty isn't just skin deep: for this phone's AI Camera means it can, in essence, think for itself when it comes to photography. 






 This push forward in artificial intelligence - which is supported by the phone's Kirin 970 processor with Neural Processing Unit (NPU) - means the Honor 10 can auto-identify scene types, adjust its settings accordingly, then make dynamic exposure and colour adjustments as applicable for the best-looking images possible. 

Honor 10: With flagship specs at a mid-range price, it's the affordable phone to own  

 The Honor 10 also features dual cameras: there's a black-and-white one for capturing the ultimate in monochrome clarity, paired with a colour one for more traditional shooting. Intelligence comes to the fore again here, however, as the colour can be mapped over the better detail of the mono capture for the utmost in quality at 24 megapixels, while Portrait and Aperture modes use depth data for pro-looking blurred background shots. 






 Combined, the Honor 10 packs in stacks of features that make it the best mid-price phone camera. Here we break-down some of its top features and how they work. 

 AI Camera 
 Machine learning for auto scene recognition  Brings out best colour by intelligently adjusting settings based on the subject  

 The Honor 10's premier feature is clearly marked by the ""AI Camera"" white text that's printed upon its rear. The real beauty of this artificial intelligence camera is that it takes on the hard work, so you don't have to. If you're not a pro when it comes to pictures, then this can help immensely by ensuring the best exposure, colour, saturation, dynamic range and contrast. 

 The system can function thanks to the top-end flagship chipset at the heart of the Honor 10. It features a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) that can decode and make decisions far quicker than a traditional processing unit. As the Honor 10 benefits from machine learning, the camera's ""brain"" has already sampled millions of images to help quickly and automatically recognise what is in a scene. Then the camera auto-selects the most applicable scene. 





 Pocket-lint   

 You don't need to worry about the scene: you'll see a little symbol pop-up in the Camera app to represent what's been selected. Whether it's Text for shooting writing; Food when capturing your trendy dinner for Instagram; Panda when shooting the lovely fluffy black and white bears (no, really, this is a distinct mode); or any number of landscape, portrait and pet modes - the Honor 10 has your back. 

 It's possible to see a before-vs-after of what AI does to an image, too. Simply click on the multi-coloured circular AI emblem to the top of the Camera app to disengage the mode. Do this in the Gallery when looking at a captured shot and you'll be able to see the difference between with and without. As you can see from our sample images, the AI Camera does a good job of enhancing colours based on the scene, while pulling extra detail out of shadow areas in particular. 





 Aperture mode 
 Dual cameras with f/1.8 apertures  f/0.95 to f/16 available via software  Adjust background blur after shooting  

 While both of the Honor 10's cameras have fast apertures (each on the rear is f/1.8) which help to capture a lot of light and make light work of low-light shooting, the benefit of having two lenses is that depth data can be derived to perform some clever software trickery. That pro-looking blurred background effect that professionals like to use so much? That's called bokeh - and the Honor 10 can mimic this type of imagery too in its Aperture mode thanks to intelligent software processing. 

 Pocket-lint   






 Within Aperture mode you'll see a small circular symbol with a number beneath, ranging from 0.95 to 16. The smaller that number the more pronounced the background blur will appear to be. Simply click on a subject to focus, select the sliding aperture scale, drag it to the position you desire - you might want a little background sense, or total blurring, it's up to your creative style - and that's it, job done. 

 As the Honor 10's two lenses are always capturing this depth data, any shot taken in Aperture mode can be adjusted after shooting. Maybe f/0.95 was a bit too much, so you make adjustments to f/4.0 instead. It's even possible to change the focus point - so if the background is in focus by accident, you can drag the focus area to the main subject instead. Clever stuff. 

 Portrait mode 
 Bokeh, Beauty and Lighting control for ultimate portraits  Phase-detection autofocus for quick focus  






 When shooting people, the Honor 10 has a whole box of tricks to call upon. Not only does the AI Camera mean faces are automatically recognised, but both Bokeh  control, Beauty mode, and 3D Lighting formats can also be deployed when using Portrait mode. 

  

 That might sound a little complex, but it's easy to use: the camera focuses on the subject's face quickly thanks to phase-detection autofocus; blurred background Bokeh can be enabled or disengaged by the click of a button (as can Beauty mode, which blurs facial blemishes out of view); while the Lighting options (sift, butterfly, split, stage, classic) can add positional lighting or spotlights to give an even more stand-out effect. 

 You can even automatically take a photo when the subject smiles, using the Capture Smiles feature within the settings. 

 Monochrome mode 
 True black and white sensor for crisp B&W results  Also offers Portrait and Aperture modes  






 One feature the Honor 10 has that no other camera phones in the UK (except Huawei) can offer is a true monochrome format. Now, you might be thinking ""but why shoot black and white, when I can convert it from colour anyway?"" 

  

 The reason is a more technical one: because a monochrome sensor has no filter over the top to discern the colour to apply to each pixel of the image, it can receive a cleaner signal, which gives sharper results and a wider dynamic range for great tonal separation between true black and true white. 

 If you fancy dabbling in 24-megapixel monochrome shooting then the mode is available in the More section of the Camera app. It's also possible to select Aperture and Portrait additions within Monochrome, should you wish to apply the intelligence of such modes too. 

 Pro shooting for when you need it 
 Metering, ISO sensitivity, shutter speed, exposure compensation, focus type and white balance controls  






 All of this automation, artificial intelligence and wide feature set is great to have for ease of use. But the Honor 10 doesn't back down when it comes to more experienced snappers: there's a Pro mode that provides full manual control. 

 Pocket-lint   

 Some of that can be exceptionally useful. Set the shutter speed to 30 seconds and the ISO to 50, for example, and a perfectly stable camera shot of a night scene will bring out details and blurry subject movement (like light trails or smoothed running water) that wouldn't be possible in a point-and-shoot format. 

 Great video, too 
 4K UHD capture at 30fps  Slow-Mo at 120fps  

 Affordable phones don't mean cutting corners when it comes to features. In addition to the top-rate photography features, the Honor 10 also squeezes in Ultra-HD 4K video capture. 





 Settings include Object Tracking to keep focus on the subject at hand, while Stabiliser softens out the worst hand-shake for smoother, steadier results. 

 That's not all. Slow-Mo is also available, which captures at 120 frames per second for quarter-time slow-motion in super smooth quality.

Using artificial intelligence to measure the heart

MEDICAL 





Artificial intelligence can now help clinicians by automatically measuring the heart in ultrasound images. This can save time and may in the future enable inexperienced users to perform accurate measurements of the heart.
When performing ultrasound examinations of the heart, several measurements are done in order to determine how healthy the heart is. One of these measurements is left ventricular ejection fraction, which measures the pumping efficiency of the heart.
In order to calculate the ejection fraction, we need to calculate the volume of the heart chamber. To do this, clinicians have to acquire images from two perpendicular angles, also knownn as views, of the heart, and then manually draw the heart chamber wall on the images. This can be time-consuming, and is also subject to large interobserver variability, meaning that two different doctors may draw the heart chamber wall quite differently, thereby resulting in different volume measurements.
An inexperienced user may not even know were to draw the heart wall, an automatic tool may in the future enable these users to perform necessary measurements. At the Centre for Innovative Ultrasound Solutions (CIUS), we are working on completely automating ultrasound heart measurements using deep learning.

Learning by example
Deep learning is a type of machine learning which are algorithms that learn to solve a task by looking at a large amount of examples. Most machine learning methods today use what is called deep neural networks, which are inspired by the way human brains work. For instance, to create a neural network which can detect whether an image contains a dog or not, you collect a large set of images with and without dogs. You then train the neural network with these images, and for every image the system has to say whether the image contains dogs or not. If the result is incorrect, the neural network has to adjust itself, so that it will not make the same mistake again. By doing this many enough times and with enough variation in the input images, the system will learn what a dog
looks like automatically!
In order to automate the ejection fraction measurements, the neural networks have to learn several tasks such as:

View classification: Learns to identify which images are of the different angles/views of the heart.
Left ventricle segmentation: Learns to draw the heart chamber wall.

To learn these tasks, ultrasound images from several hundred patients were collected in cooperation with CREATIS in France and manually annotated by human experts. The neural networks are quite big, having several million parameters which have to be
adjusted during training.
The neural network result of finding the heart walls, identifying the different views, and when the chamber is largest and smallest.
Does it work in real-life?
The artificial intelligence methods were implemented in a high performance computing framework called FAST. This enables us to stream ultrasound data directly from a scanner and calculate the measurements in real-time while the operator is scanning as shown in this
video:
Together with clinician Ivar Mjåland Salte at the Sørlandet Hospital in Kristiansand, we performed a study to see how well our methods can do these measurements automatically compared to manually drawing the heart wall contour. Ultrasound recordings of 72 patients was collected and manually annotated. The neural network was able to automatically and quite accurately calculate ejection fraction for all patients, even for patients with low image quality ultrasound images.
Ejection fraction is only one of many clinical measurements of the heart, we are currently working on extending the neural networks to learn several other measurements, such as MAPSE, LV mass and strain.
An inexperienced user may not know where to place and how to angle the ultrasound probe correctly. This is necessary to get valid measurements of the heart. At CIUS, we are also developing an artificial intelligent assistant which can guide inexperienced users to acquire correct ultrasound images of the heart.

With 90 million transactions a week in 25,000 stores worldwide the coffee giant is in many ways on the cutting edge of using big data and artificial intelligence to help direct marketing, sales and business decisions.

Starbucks Rewards and Mobile App
When Starbucks launched its rewards program and mobile app, they dramatically increased the data they collected and could use to get to know their customers and extract info about purchasing habits. The mobile app has more than 17 million and the reward program has 13 million active users. These users alone create an overwhelming amount of data about what, where and when they buy coffee and complementary products that can be overlaid on other data including weather, holidays and special promotions. Here are just some of the ways that Starbucks uses the data it collects.
Personalizing the Starbucks experience
Members of the rewards program and mobile app authorize Starbucks to gather a lot of info about their coffee-buying habits from their preferred drinks to what time of day they’re usually ordering. So, even when people visit a “new” Starbucks location, that store’s point-of-sale system is able to identify the customer through their smartphone and give the barista their preferred order. In addition, based on ordering preferences, the app will suggest new products (and treats) customers might be interested in trying. This intel is driven by the company’s digital flywheel program, a cloud-based artificial intelligence engine that’s able to recommend food and drink items to customers who didn’t even know, yet, they wanted to try something new. It’s so sophisticated that the recommendations will change based on what makes the most sense according to the day’s weather, if it’s a holiday or a weekday, and what location you’re at.
PROMOTED
Targeted and personalized marketing
The same intel that helps Starbucks suggest new products for to try also helps the company send personalized offers and discounts that go far beyond a special birthday discount. Additionally, a customized email goes out to any customer who hasn’t visited a Starbucks recently with enticing offers—built from that individual’s purchase history—to re-engage them.

Virtual barista
My Starbucks Barista through the Starbucks mobile app, allows you to place an order through voice command or messaging to a virtual barista using artificial intelligence algorithms behind the scenes. Since there are so many nuances to an individual order, it’s quite an accomplishment for an artificial intelligence engine to provide a seamless customer experience.
Determine new store locations
It’s common knowledge that the right location is essential to succeed in retail. The Starbucks market planning team doesn’t rely on their gut feelings to determine where stores should be located, but taps into the power of data intelligence through Atlas, a mapping and business intelligence tool developed by Esri. This tool evaluates massive amounts of data, such as proximity to other Starbucks locations, demographics, traffic patterns and more, before recommending a new store location. This system even predicts impact to other Starbucks locations in the area if a new store were to open. Even though it feels like there’s a Starbucks on every corner (and some so close to each other you might imagine that they would cannibalize sales from one another) rest assured the data told them to build it.

Expansion of products into grocery stores
When the company decided to expand and offer Starbucks products customers could purchase at grocery stores and enjoy at home, they turned to data to determine what products they should offer. It combined data it had from its stores about how customers ordered their beverages and combined that intelligence with other industry reports about at-home consumption to create their grocery store product lines. From pumpkin spice caffe latte K-cups to iced coffee without milk or added flavors, Starbucks’ data-driven approach to production expansion is smart business.
Menu updates
Some Starbucks locations serve alcohol, but the company decided which ones would offer “Starbucks Evenings” based on areas the data was signaling would have the highest alcohol consumption to support success of the menu update. Data also drives special limited-offering menu items based on what’s happening at the time. In one example, when Memphis, Tennessee was enduring a heatwave, Starbucks launched a local Frappucino promotion to entice people to beat the heat! And, although there are 87,000 drink combinations available at Starbucks they continue to monitor what drinks sell the best to continue to make menu modifications.

Michael Chui does not believe there will be mass unemployment due to machines — but is sure work will be reinvented.          Restructuring instead of redundancies      “What does it mean for our work?” — a question Michael Chui often hears when talk turns to his research into artificial intelligence in business life. One of his answers is, “There’s almost no part of the economy which potentially couldn’t be disrupted by AI. We are all going to have to change what we do. And so, the biggest challenge we have is not really mass unemployment.” It is going to be far more important to rethink work and restructure it.          “49 per cent of the things we do in the workplace can be automated.”   Michael Chui      Share on X/Twitter            Chui, partner of the consultancy’s research department, has taken a close look at almost 900 different jobs and approximately 2,000 processes. His findings: Almost half the tasks for which people are remunerated can be automated. Not only that, everything can be done using only existing technology, from the processing of large amounts of data to a routine tax reform.          What can human beings do better than machines?      The fear that millions of jobs will disappear as a result is something Chui feels is unfounded as fewer than five per cent of the jobs are so defined that they can be completely automated. The focus is however shifting in many tasks. “Some of the things that machines find harder to do, are interacting with other people and exhibiting creativity,” says Chui. “These are some of the things that we would expect people to spend more time doing.” A lawyer will still be called a lawyer, his work however will be different – he will for example develop systems that advise instead of he himself advising people.          „Fewer than five per cent of all jobs can be completely taken over by machines.”   Michael Chui      Share on X/Twitter                               According to Chui, there are three kinds of activities that have the strongest propensity for automation. “One of them is physical activity and predictable environments. We’ve seen it in manufacturing, we’ll see it in agriculture, we’ll see it in healthcare.” The other two kinds are: “Collecting data and processing data.” Processes involved in the collection and processing of data in particular can all be automated. Such tasks are also performed by highly-qualified employees, which shows that machines can be of assistance at every hierarchical level.           Up to 375 million  People worldwide that will have to change their field of activity due to artificial intelligence in the future (source: McKinsey)         Chui sees enormous potential in artificial intelligence. “It increases the chances for every business as performance can be boosted in almost every sector.” However, according to an Adobe survey, to date only 15 per cent of the companies questioned in North America, Asia and Europe are using artificial intelligence. “Businesses first have to learn to apply the new technologies,” says Chui.

Michael Chui is a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, the research department at the consultancy, in San Francisco. He is in charge of research into the influence of new technologies and innovations in business and society.            Summary Almost half of the work processes can be automated. However, only a small fraction of the jobs is suited to being taken over by machines. The human workers of the future will be able to concentrate on creative processes and the controlling of the artificial intelligence.

Smart marketers are developing, partnering to build, or integrating AI into their tech stacks to get better at what they do. To get started leveraging AI in your marketing efforts, it’s important to first confirm your policies regarding the handling of consumer data, transparency, and control. Consumers should be able to interact with connected devices — from web browsers to mobile phones to voice assistants — knowing that their data is being used in transparent ways, in a manner consistent with their preferences and expectations. Then, make sure that your data is actionable, for example by using a unique, common identifier for individual consumers across all of your company’s various channels and touchpoints. Finally, be sure to choose the right AI partner. Be sure to choose a partner that has true AI, not simply rules-based decisioning, which is impossible to scale for the volume of data and combinations of interactions that marketers are managing today. In addition, be sure to choose partners with real experience addressing your particular use cases and working with your existing technology partners. Finally, as with any vendor relationship, be sure to check on your partner’s ethical and philopshical approach to AI, as this is still an emerging technology that demands thoughtful guardrails to produce effective results in a responsible manner.",,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for making marketing more intelligent, efficient, consumer-friendly, and, ultimately, more effective.

Device FlopAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow a Pentagon Contract Became an Identity Crisis for GoogleShare full article218Read in appCredit...Minh Uong/The New York TimesBy Scott Shane, Cade Metz and Daisuke WakabayashiMay 30, 2018WASHINGTON — Fei-Fei Li is among the brightest stars in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, somehow managing to hold down two demanding jobs simultaneously: head of Stanford University’s A.I. lab and chief scientist for A.I. at Google Cloud, one of the search giant’s most promising enterprises.Yet last September, when nervous company officials discussed how to speak publicly about Google’s first major A.I. contract with the Pentagon, Dr. Li strongly advised shunning those two potent letters.“Avoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,” she wrote in an email to colleagues reviewed by The New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google.”Dr. Li’s concern about the implications of military contracts for Google has proved prescient. The company’s relationship with the Defense Department since it won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes, has touched off an existential crisis, according to emails and documents reviewed by The Times as well as interviews with about a dozen current and former Google employees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt has fractured Google’s work force, fueled heated staff meetings and internal exchanges, and prompted some employees to resign. The dispute has caused grief for some senior Google officials, including Dr. Li, as they try to straddle the gap between scientists with deep moral objections and salespeople salivating over defense contracts.The advertising model behind Google’s spectacular growth has provoked criticism that it invades web users’ privacy and supports dubious websites, including those peddling false news. Now the company’s path to future growth, via cloud-computing services, has divided the company over its stand on weaponry. To proceed with big defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; to reject such work would deprive it of a potentially huge business.The internal debate over Maven, viewed by both supporters and opponents as opening the door to much bigger defense contracts, generated a petition signed by about 4,000 employees who demanded “a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.”Executives at DeepMind, an A.I. pioneer based in London that Google acquired in 2014, have said they are completely opposed to military and surveillance work, and employees at the lab have protested the contract. The acquisition agreement between the two companies said DeepMind technology would never be used for military or surveillance purposes.About a dozen Google employees have resigned over the issue, which was first reported by Gizmodo. One departing engineer petitioned to rename a conference room after Clara Immerwahr, a German chemist who killed herself in 1915 after protesting the use of science in warfare. And “Do the Right Thing” stickers have appeared in Google’s New York City offices, according to company emails viewed by The Times.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThose emails and other internal documents, shared by an employee who opposes Pentagon contracts, show that at least some Google executives anticipated the dissent and negative publicity. But other employees, noting that rivals like Microsoft and Amazon were enthusiastically pursuing lucrative Pentagon work, concluded that such projects were crucial to the company’s growth and nothing to be ashamed of.Many tech companies have sought military business without roiling their work forces. But Google’s roots and self-image are different.“We have kind of a mantra of ‘don’t be evil,’ which is to do the best things that we know how for our users, for our customers and for everyone,” Larry Page told Peter Jennings in 2004, when ABC News named Mr. Page and his Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, “People of the Year.”The clash inside Google was sparked by the possibility that the Maven work might be used for lethal drone targeting. And the discussion is made more urgent by the fact that artificial intelligence, one of Google’s strengths, is expected to play an increasingly central role in warfare.Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, made a much-publicized visit to Google in August — shortly after stopping in at Amazon — and called for closer cooperation with tech companies.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I see many of the greatest advances out here on the West Coast in private industry,” he said.Dr. Li’s comments were part of an email exchange started by Scott Frohman, Google’s head of defense and intelligence sales. Under the header “Communications/PR Request — URGENT,” Mr. Frohman noted that the Maven contract award was imminent and asked for direction on the “burning question” of how to present it to the public.A number of colleagues weighed in, but generally they deferred to Dr. Li, who was born in China, immigrated to New Jersey with her parents as a 16-year-old who spoke no English and has climbed to the top of the tech world.Dr. Li said in the email that the final decision would be made by her boss, Diane Greene, the chief executive of Google Cloud. But Dr. Li thought the company should publicize its share of the Maven contract as “a big win for GCP,” Google Cloud Platform.She also advised being “super careful” in framing the project, noting that she had been speaking publicly on the theme of “Humanistic A.I.,” a topic she would address in a March op-ed for The Times.“I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry,” she wrote in the email.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAsked about her September email, Dr. Li issued a statement: “I believe in human-centered AI to benefit people in positive and benevolent ways. It is deeply against my principles to work on any project that I think is to weaponize AI.”As it turned out, the company did not publicize Maven. The company’s work as a subcontractor came to public attention only when employees opposed to it began protesting on Google’s robust internal communications platforms.The company promised employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the ethical minefield of defense and intelligence contracting. Google told The Times on Tuesday that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice.At a companywide meeting last Thursday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Google wanted to come up with guidelines that “stood the test of time,” employees said. Employees say they expect the principles to be announced inside Google in the next few weeks.The polarized debate about Google and the military may leave out some nuances. Better analysis of drone imagery could reduce civilian casualties by improving operators’ ability to find and recognize terrorists. The Defense Department will hardly abandon its advance into artificial intelligence if Google bows out. And military experts say China and other developed countries are already investing heavily in A.I. for defense.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut skilled technologists who chose Google for its embrace of benign and altruistic goals are appalled that their employer could eventually be associated with more efficient ways to kill.Google’s unusual culture is reflected in its company message boards and internal social media platforms, which encourage employees to speak out on everything from Google’s cafeteria food to its diversity initiatives. But even within this free-expression workplace, longtime employees said, the Maven project has roiled Google beyond anything in recent memory.When news of the deal leaked out internally, Ms. Greene spoke at the weekly companywide T.G.I.F. meeting. She explained that the system was not for lethal purposes and that it was a relatively small deal worth “only” $9 million, according to two people familiar with the meeting.That did little to tamp down the anger, and Google, according to the invitation email, decided to hold a discussion on April 11 representing a “spectrum of viewpoints” involving Ms. Greene; Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who is a leader in the anti-Maven movement; and Vint Cerf, a Google vice president who is considered one of the fathers of the internet for his pioneering technology work at the Defense Department.Because there was so much interest, the group debated the topic three times over one day for Google employees watching on video in different regions around the world.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAccording to employees who watched the discussion, Ms. Greene held firm that Maven was not using A.I. for offensive purposes, while Ms. Whittaker argued that it was hard to draw a line on how the technology would be used.Last Thursday, Mr. Brin, the company’s co-founder, responded to a question at a companywide meeting about Google’s work on Maven. According to two Google employees, Mr. Brin said he understood the controversy and had discussed the matter extensively with Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai. However, he said he thought that it was better for peace if the world’s militaries were intertwined with international organizations like Google rather than working solely with nationalistic defense contractors.Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ many of the world’s top artificial intelligence researchers. Some researchers work inside an A.I. lab called Google Brain in Mountain View, Calif., and others are spread across separate groups, including the cloud computing business overseen by Ms. Greene, who is also an Alphabet board member.Many of these researchers have recently arrived from the world of academia, and some retain professorships. They include Geoff Hinton, a Briton who helps oversee the Brain lab in Toronto and has been open about his reluctance to work for the United States government. In the late 1980s, Mr. Hinton left the United States for Canada in part because he was reluctant to take funding from the Department of Defense.Jeff Dean, one of Google’s longest-serving and most revered employees, who now oversees all A.I. work at the company, said at a conference for developers this month that he had signed a letter opposing the use of so-called machine learning for autonomous weapons, which would identify targets and fire without a human pulling the trigger.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDeepMind, the London A.I. lab, is widely considered to be the most important collection of A.I. talent in the world. It now operates as a separate Alphabet company, though the lines between Google and DeepMind are blurred.DeepMind’s founders have long warned about the dangers of A.I. systems. At least one of the lab’s founders, Mustafa Suleyman, has been involved in policy discussions involving Project Maven with the Google leadership, including Mr. Pichai, according to a person familiar with the discussions.Certainly, any chance that Google could move quietly into defense work with no public attention is gone. Nor has Dr. Li’s hope to keep A.I. out of the debate proved realistic.“We can steer the conversation about cloud,” Aileen Black, a Google executive in Washington, cautioned Dr. Li in the September exchange, “but this is an AI specific award.” She added, “I think we need to get ahead of this before it gets framed for us.”Follow Scott Shane, Cade Metz and Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @ScottShaneNYT, @Cade Metz and @daiwaka.Scott Shane reported from Washington, Cade Metz from London, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

Scientists from the Institut Pasteur have developed a method for increasing the spatio-temporal resolution in optical microscopy. This method, called ANNA-PALM, is based on recent developments in artificial intelligence and, more specifically, in much-talked-about deep learning. This article explores the method.
""Traditional optical microscopes can be used to distinguish structures in the range of 200 to 300 nm but not smaller. Tinier objects are seen as specks of light under the microscope and their internal structure is not visible. This is the case, for example, with the conical-shaped AIDS virus capsid, or octagonal nuclear pores. In both cases, we can only see blurred spots with a traditional microscope"", explains Christophe Zimmer, head of the Imaging and Modeling Unit at the Institut Pasteur. To overcome this resolution issue, ""super-resolution"" microscopy methods were developed, such as the PALM and STORM techniques, which appeared in 2006 and are based on single-molecule localization. These methods can resolve structures down to the 20 nm range but are extremely slow. ""The speed of super-resolution microscopy methods based on single-molecule localization is limited, because several thousand low-resolution images need to be recorded, each of which showing only a small number of molecules"". In practice, this makes it difficult to use high-resolution imaging for more than a dozen cells or to observe dynamic structures in living cells.
To speed up super-resolution microscopy, scientists from the Institut Pasteur have developed a new method called ANNA-PALM. This technique uses artificial neural networks (see Christophe Zimmer interview) to reconstruct super-resolution images from rapidly acquired low-resolution images. ""Our simulations and experiments on microtubules, nuclear pores and mitochondria show that super-resolution images can be reconstructed from data acquired in significantly shorter time, and without compromising spatial resolution"", continues the scientist.
Under the right conditions, ANNA-PALM can speed up super-resolution microscopy by a factor of 10 to 100. Thanks to this increase in speed, ""ANNA-PALM can be used to obtain super-resolution images of thousands of cells in a few hours, which used to be practically impossible."" A film demonstrating this, and providing the software tools developed, can be seen here: annapalm.pasteur.fr.
Thanks to the drastic reduction in acquisition time and laser irradiation, ANNA-PALM should greatly facilitate super-resolution imaging of living cells. This method also opens up other possibilities, for instance high-throughput screening of chemical molecules for therapeutic purposes.
NB : The Institut Pasteur provides computing resources including GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) that allowed the team of Christophe Zimmer to carry out this study. The Inception program funded a GPU Farm, used by the authors for this work, and the project also benefited from GPUs made available by the Information Systems Department (DSI) of Institut Pasteur.

Many say it is very difficult or impossible to go through the large volumes of data to pick out what is clinically relevant or actionable. It is easy for things to fall through the cracks or for things to be lost to patient follow-up. This issue is further compounded when you add factors like increasing patient volumes, lower reimbursements, bundled payments and the conversion from fee-for-service to a fee-for-value reimbursement system.
This is where artificial intelligence comes in, and will play a key role in the next two years. AI will not be diagnosing patients and replacing doctors — it will be augmenting their ability to find the key, relevant data they need to care for a patient and present it in a concise, easily digestible format.
Regardless of how artificial intelligence is applied, the underlying intelligence is undeniably artificial. That fundamental truth has been enough to make some fearful that artificially intelligent machines might one day replace humans. Vendors in radiology have sought to quiet those fears by positioning their AI creations as intelligent assistants that help people do their jobs faster and better. The patient ultimately will benefit from this technology, however, through better and more convenient health care. 
This supplement, written by industry consultant Greg Freiherr, will take a close look at three key components of AI:
How To Make Artificial Intelligence Work For Radiology
What AI Will Look Like In Medical Imaging
How To Keep AI From Failing — Again
And as Greg states, “It’s hard to find a more compelling reason for the use of AI now or in the future than helping physicians make better decisions faster.”

In Artificial Intelligence, Young Ethiopians Eye a Fertile Future

“I don’t think Homo sapiens-type people will exist in 10 or 20 years’ time,” Getnet Assefa, 31, speculates as he gazes into the reconstructed eye sockets of Lucy, one of the oldest and most famous hominid skeletons known, at the National Museum of Ethiopia. “Slowly the biological species will disappear and then we will become a fully synthetic species,” Assefa says. 
  “Perception, memory, emotion, intelligence, dreams — everything that we value now — will not be there,” he adds.


  Assefa is a computer scientist, a futurist, and a utopian — but a pragmatic one at that. He is founder and chief executive of iCog, the first artificial intelligence (AI) lab in Ethiopia, and a stone’s throw from the home of Lucy. iCog Labs launched in 2013 with $50,000 and just four programmers. Today, halfway up an unassuming tower block, dozens of software developers type in silence. Their desks are cluttered with electronic components and dismembered robot body parts, from a soccer-playing bot called Abebe to a miniature robo-Einstein. An earlier prototype of Sophia, a widely recognized humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics (she appeared with late-night talk show host Jimmy Fallon last year) is here too. Arguably the world’s most famous robot of her kind, Sophia’s software was partly developed here in Ethiopia’s capital.


  In stark contrast to the famine-stricken images that linger in the minds of many Westerners, Addis Ababa has, in recent years, become a hub for international business and diplomacy. Glitzy new office blocks and hotels continue to rise across the sprawling capital, and while Ethiopia is still ranked among the world’s poorest countries in terms of GDP per capita, it is also among the fastest growing.

  Assefa hopes to place artificial intelligence at the heart of Ethiopia’s rapid development, but he receives little backing from the government, which has been encouraging investment in the manufacturing sector. “They think that advanced technologies are a luxury,” he sighs, as we sit in the Lucy-themed restaurant next door to the museum. “It’s not a luxury, it is crucial.”


  His logic might not seem immediately obvious in a country like Ethiopia, which is once again facing a food crisis. Throughout history, development has tended to follow a well-trodden path, with employment moving from farm to factory, and then from factory to the office. Such was the trajectory for the rapidly developing economies of East Asia — South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia — in the 1970s and 80s.


  But this path to development may make less sense in an age of digital ubiquity — in part due to what futurist Ray Kurzweil has called the Law of Accelerating Returns, which holds that as technology advances at an exponential rate, so does its impact on society. “One can argue that information technologies are far more disruptive than industrial technologies were,” explains J.P. Singh, a professor of culture and political economy at the University of Edinburgh. “It took a long time for industrial technologies to diffuse all over the world, and in some places it still hasn’t happened — but mobile telephony is almost ubiquitous.” 






                                        Getnet Assefa works at iCog Labs with a ‘Robo-Einstein’ at his side. He’s hoping Ethiopia can use expertise in artificial intelligence as a springboard to development. 
                                                                                    Visual: Thomas Lewton for Undark 




  Artificial intelligence is the latest technology sweeping the world, and consultancy firm McKinsey predicts that up to 30 percent of the global workforce could be displaced by 2030 because of advances in AI, robotics, and digitization. And that’s why Assefa and other stakeholders think Ethiopia would do better to skip the manufacturing stage of development and invest instead in a high-tech workforce — including one that at the cutting edge of AI. This, he argues, would help Ethiopians find a new path to development by riding the wave of technological disruption.


  “We should not start from steam and railways, or the old technologies — that is already done,” Assefa argues.


  That makes sense to academics like Singh — though he also cautions that political forces are often slow to see the bigger picture. There is definitely an opportunity for developing countries, he says. “But any time we have a technological revolution, the political institutions have to catch up.”



A 2017 report by the World Wide Web Foundation suggested that Ethiopian “intelligence services are using machine intelligence techniques to break encryption and find patterns in social media posts that can be used to identify dissidents.” And while mobile phone and internet penetration in Ethiopia is comparatively poor — a situation made worst amid widespread anti-government protests, which prompted an internet crackdown in February — the report added that government surveillance and oppression could increase as the use of smartphones expands. 
  But where some people see artificial intelligence as a threat, Assefa sees it as an opportunity. He grew up playing with household appliances, learning first-hand how they solve problems  and wondering why technology was not more evenly distributed: “I was curious about robots and automation: Why are people farming? Why don’t they just use machines and other inventions?” By teaching Ethiopians how to use AI technologies he hopes to equip them to find their own path to development.


  Solve IT is a nationwide program launched by iCog this year that teaches young Ethiopians the essentials of computer coding, hardware, and entrepreneurship — challenging them to find technology-based solutions to community problems. “We used to hear about the invention of artificial intelligence, how it would be useful for people, but there aren’t many products made with that here in Africa,” says 20-year-old Yonathan Amaniel, a student at Mekelle University in the far north of Ethiopia. “In developed countries they make home assistants. We don’t need products to make our lives more comfortable, we need products to survive,” he tells us by a dusty roadside on the outskirts of the city. Under his arm is an early prototype for a self-driving tractor that he and his classmates have been working on.
  Team member Bisrat Seyoum comes from a family of subsistence farmers. “My father told me that ploughing using just human power and ox power is so difficult. It uses so much energy and it’s still not enough to make a profit from,” he says. The students hope their self-driving tractor will one day ease the struggle of many Ethiopian farmers. He and other students envision tractors outfitted with advanced sensors that avoid obstacles, plan farming, and detect soil moisture.


  The benefits could go beyond economics in Ethiopia — a communal culture where traditionally people spend several hours a day drinking coffee together. “If work is given to robots, we can really experience what being human is,” suggests Betelhem Dessie, one of Solve IT’s project coordinators. “We are social animals, we’re dependent on others, but we’re not really doing that currently.”

  But the team’s futuristic tractor is ambitious, and they are clearly a long way from its realization. Like Seyoum’s family, most farmers in Ethiopia have no access to a tractor, let alone one outfitted with AI. More broadly though, as the price of computing power continues to plummet artificial intelligence is becoming accessible to Ethiopians. “If you have a laptop and a brain you can do AI,” says Assefa. “Oh, and an internet connection.”
  Watching over the young AI-enthusiasts is software engineering student Eman Asfaw, who at 22 is barely older than the group she is training. Though she shares their youthful enthusiasm and energy — laughing with the rest as the tractor prototype awkwardly stops and starts — she is clearly wise beyond her years. Like most Ethiopians, Asfaw is proud of her country’s anti-colonial history and distinct, ancient culture. This includes the Amharic language.


  “One of the coolest things I can imagine is Amharic natural language processing (NLP) built and integrated with Sophia the Robot!” she exclaims. “I believe it can inspire the Ethiopian youth to actually get really engaged in AI and feel like it’s their thing.”


  “I want to see more youth getting inspired by NLP,” to create “sophisticated software that would help the average Ethiopian,” she adds.



But Asfaw’s aspirations do face a new sort of colonialism. Silicon Valley’s tech giants have near monopoly control over the world’s data — information that is often used as the foundation for machine learning and the development of artificial intelligence applications.

“Digital colonialism is the new deployment of a quasi-imperial power over a vast number of people, without their explicit consent,” explains Renata Avila of the World Wide Web Foundation. For Avila, “going local” is the logical way to subvert this: from decentralized social media to AI programmed in indigenous languages, by indigenous people — without the learned racial or gender biases observed in existing AI systems.


  “Instead of one-size-fits-all AI,” Avila says, “we could be placing the developments closer to the people and empowering local communities to both participate in its design, benefit from the data they generate and increase the accountability of the systems serving them.”


  That’s at the heart of another of Assefa’s projects, called YaNetu. It is a virtual, open-source,  Amharic-speaking AI teacher based on the same software as Sophia the robot. Assefa hopes that YaNetu will one day disrupt education systems in the world’s developing countries. 
  “For the kid in Africa, the cost of a tablet will become the same as a book; one kilogram of silicon will be equal to one kilogram of paper,” Assefa explains. And instead of rote-learning and one-size-fits-all syllabi, those tablets could be outfitted with a localized, linguistically appropriate version of YaNetu, which would be capable not just of teaching, but of learning the child’s interests, abilities, and learning style— adapting her teaching approach  accordingly.


  In only five years, the team working to develop YaNetu has multiplied 20-fold, and they already boast clients like Huawei, Hershey Foods, and even Hanson Robotics — the creators of Sophia.


  But without government support and additional investment, Assefa worries that the embryonic high-tech and AI movement he’s attempting to foster in Ethiopia will remain a mere shadow of those in Silicon Valley and East Asia.  “Google is investing [in AI], Facebook is investing, the Russian government is investing, the Chinese Communist Party is investing,” Assefa says.


  “Not a hundred thousand dollars like us,” he adds with a smile, “but a million billion dollars.”

Following the revelation in March that Google had secretly signed an agreement with the Pentagon to provide cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology for drone warfare, the company faced an internal revolt. About a dozen Google employees have resigned in protest and thousands have signed a petition calling for an end to the contract. The endeavor, code-named Project Maven by the military, is designed to help drone operators recognize images captured on the battlefield.
Google has sought to quash the internal dissent in conversations with employees. Diane Greene, the chief executive of Google’s cloud business unit, speaking at a company town hall meeting following the revelations, claimed that the contract was “only” for $9 million, according to the New York Times, a relatively minor project for such a large company.
Internal company emails obtained by The Intercept tell a different story. The September emails show that Google’s business development arm expected the military drone artificial intelligence revenue to ramp up from an initial $15 million to an eventual $250 million per year.
In fact, one month after news of the contract broke, the Pentagon allocated an additional $100 million to Project Maven.



The internal Google email chain also notes that several big tech players competed to win the Project Maven contract. Other tech firms such as Amazon were in the running, one Google executive involved in negotiations wrote. (Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.) Rather than serving solely as a minor experiment for the military, Google executives on the thread stated that Project Maven was “directly related” to a major cloud computing contract worth billions of dollars that other Silicon Valley firms are competing to win.
The emails further note that Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon, “has some work loads” related to Project Maven.
Jane Hynes, a spokesperson for Google Cloud, emailed The Intercept to say that the company stands by the statement given to the New York Times this week that “the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry.” Hynes declined to comment further on the emails obtained by The Intercept. 
The September email chain discussing the recently inked deal included Scott Frohman and Aileen Black, two members of Google’s defense sales team, along with Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the head scientist at Google Cloud, as well as members of the communications team.
Black provided a summary of the Project Maven deal, which she described as a “5-month long race among AI heavyweights” in the tech industry. “Total deal $25-$30M, $15M to Google over the next 18 months,” she wrote. “As the program grows expect spend is budgeted at 250 M per year. This program is directly related to the Sept 13 memo about moving DOD aggressively to the cloud I sent last week.”
“I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.”
The September 13 memo sent by Black was not included in the emails obtained by The Intercept. It appears to be a reference to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, a contract worth $10 billion over 10 years, a project that Google has expressed an interest in obtaining. The JEDI program was announced on September 12.
The project had finally come together and was moving along rapidly, Black wrote. The Pentagon was “really fast tracking” Google’s cloud security certification, a development she called “priceless.”
The Google executives discussed the potential for a public relations fiasco from the Project Maven contract. Whether or not to reveal the deal was a point of concern.

“This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google. You probably heard Elon Musk and his comment about AI causing WW3,” wrote Fei-Fei.
“I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry,” she continued. “Google Cloud has been building our theme on Democratizing AI in 2017, and Diane and I have been talking about Humanistic AI for enterprise. I’d be super careful to protect these very positive images.”
The Google team noted that it has no press plan for the rollout of the contract and agreed that the company should work to set the “narrative” as quickly as possible. The “buzz” generated by the contract could be a positive, Black suggested.
The government sales team noted that Project Maven had been concealed through a contract awarded to ECS Federal, an arrangement first reported by The Intercept.
“The contract is not direct with Google but through a partner (ECS) and we have terms that prevent press releases from happening without our mutual consent,” wrote Black. The Defense Department “will not say anything about Google without our approval.”
Despite the secrecy, Black cautioned that news will eventually leak and that information about the contracting process could be obtained by the public through the Freedom of Information Act. Google’s involvement with Project Maven “will eventually get out,” Black warned. “Wouldn’t it be best to have it released on our terms?”
The project, however, was never announced publicly until news broke in March 2018.
An internal work timeline about Project Maven, also obtained by The Intercept, provides a window into the quick progression of the contract.
On October 27, 2017, a team from Google Cloud visited Beale Air Force Base — a major hub for drone pilots — to “meet operational users (Air Force data analysts) who will be the end users of our technology, and primary testers starting June 2018.”
The previous week, Lt. Gen. John N.T. “Jack” Shanahan, who helped spearhead Project Maven, visited Google’s Advanced Solutions Lab to meet with 50 members of the team working on the project. Shanahan declared that “nothing in DoD should ever be fielded going forward without a built-in AI capability,” according to the timeline.
The timeline describes how Google engineers were continually working with the military to improve the product, including the user interface. “While the initial core technology focus will remain detection, classification, and (limited) tracking of certain classes of objects, we are considering how to address customers’ concern regarding more challenging use-cases that solve user’s real problems,” the document notes.

These hierarchical, self-contained assemblies of labour, capital and know-how have been with us for so long that by now they seem almost ‘natural’. But apart from what they make or do or sell, the very structure of the company has a history. The clearest rationale for corporations comes from the Nobel prizewinning economist Ronald Coase and his 1937 theory of the firm. Imagine you want to make money by selling widgets. What’s the best strategy: sign up talent individually and on a needs-only basis, or hire staff to do the various jobs in-house? Coase showed that it made more economic sense to incorporate as a company, because it allowed you to minimise three very important costs. The first reduction would come from resourcing: it’s less expensive to find and recruit people with the right skills and knowledge from inside the company than to look for them externally every time you want something done. The second line-item is transacting, or managing processes and resources: it’s less of an administrative burden to have teams in-house than to keep an eye on multiple external contractors. And finally there’s contracting: every time work takes place within a company, the rules and conditions are implied in the employment contract, not negotiated afresh each time. By reducing these three costs, Coase claimed, corporations are the optimal structures for increasing economic activity. But what if the nature of the economic puzzles that corporations evolved to solve have shifted? Thanks to software, the internet and artificial intelligence, the expenses that Coase identified can now be reduced just as well with tools from outside the company as they can from within it. Finding freelance workers via online marketplaces can be less costly, less risky and quicker than recruiting full-time employees. Collaboration tools are opening up space for manager-free forms of work. And contracting costs are likely to fall markedly thanks to the advent of blockchain protocols – algorithms that replace trusted third parties, and instead automatically verify transactions using a huge digital ledger, spread across multiple computers. As a result of these innovations, a new way of working is emerging: a series of interactions that are open, skills-based and software-optimised. Where once we had the ‘corporation’, instead we are witnessing the ascendancy of the ‘platform’. The question is: should we see this as a promise, or a threat? In their book Platform Revolution (2016), Geoffrey Parker, Marshall Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary argue that businesses used to be ‘pipes’ (linear models) and are becoming ‘platforms’ (networked models). Before the digital revolution, firms created goods and services, which they pushed out and sold to customers. The flow was from point A to point B – like pipes connecting deep-sea oil wells to the person who fills up the tank of their car with refined petrol. Unlike pipes, however, platforms disrupt the clear-cut demarcation between producer and consumer, because they enable users to create as well as to consume value. Platforms need a different, non-pipe-like infrastructure. The major business challenge is to attract creators and consumers in the right proportions for transactions to occur. Platforms are in fact very similar to marketplaces: both create economic value by fostering exchanges between two (or more) groups. Now, though, this value can be generated within a company, not just outside it. Uber is the classic case: for consumers to be interested, there have to be enough drivers on the platform to make it easy to order a ride. But for drivers to be interested, there have to be enough consumers to guarantee a basic income. Finding this equilibrium requires significant capital upfront – essentially, you have to spend money or give an incentive for suppliers to jump onboard while consumers are still virtually absent, until a critical mass is reached on both sides. But at a certain point, if all goes well, so-called ‘network effects’ kick in. The platform suddenly becomes very attractive to many more suppliers and consumers, which can lead to transactions increasing exponentially. Now the owners of the platform can make money by charging ‘rent’, which entails taking a percentage from every transaction. Rents continue to grow with the network, and are siphoned off to whoever owns it. This is what makes those platforms economically valuable. No one prevents workers from moving across subcircles: no managers stand in the way But not all platforms are created equal. In the 1990s and early 2000s, you’d ‘browse the web’ and encounter an anarchic, open space of chat rooms and internet forums, where everyone had reasonably equal standing in competing for interest and attention. In the second phase of the internet, though, these spaces were replaced by closed, proprietary services administered by the big four tech companies: Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Users migrated towards those platforms for reasons of efficiency and convenience, which created the tech oligopolies we see today. But those businesses are centralised and owned by a precious few, and the implications are profound. Consumers’ data can be unscrupulously exploited for profit and influence. Developers must abide by rules set by the corporate bosses – and those rules can change at any time, unpredictably, to suit the special interests of a few. In other words, the competitive field of the internet is no longer level but profoundly skewed towards the tycoons that own the digital platforms where we conduct much of our daily lives. Platforms don’t only reinvent how companies engage with their users, but also how work is done. As digital technologies deconstruct jobs into tasks executed by a mix of humans and algorithms, anxiety is growing about the ‘gig economy’ – where work is temporary, skills-based, and on-demand. Whether you are a driver for Uber, a financial analyst contracted via Upwork, or a software developer micro-tasking in Google’s or Amazon’s development framework, your livelihood depends on cyclical fluctuations of demand for your skills, your rating, and your ability to market yourself effectively against the competition. Moreover, residual profits go back to the owners of the platform, who are no longer obliged to provide participants with the protections associated with employment. Add in the threat of automation and artificial intelligence, and the outcome is a survival-of-the-fittest scenario, where only the most ruthless and capable stand a chance. Even the ‘platforming’ of companies with ‘proper’ employees can clash with human nature. Zappos, the digital shoe and clothing shop currently owned by Amazon, employs around 1,500 people and sells an estimated $3 billion worth of products every year. In 2013 it began implementing a system known as ‘holacracy’, a self-organisation method invented by a software engineer. Instead of pyramidal hierarchies, holacracies are organised around ‘circles’; each circle can encompass a traditional function (such as marketing) as well as other ‘subcircles’ that focus on specific projects or tasks. No one prevents workers from freely moving across subcircles in order to achieve their goals, because there are no managers to stand in the way. Instead, software enables collaboration and the performance of individuals and teams, while ‘tactical meetings’ allow for employees to provide feedback about how things are working, in a tightly circumscribed format. Yet despite the flexibility and efficiency that holacracy promises, participants and observers have criticised the system for failing to accommodate the emotional needs of workers, and reducing humans to ‘programs’ that run on the operating system of digital capitalism. Similarly, Uber drivers report feeling less like humans and more like robots, manipulated by the app, telling them exactly what to do. By deconstructing jobs into tasks, and automating their allocation, the human workers of today risk being transplanted by actual software programs tomorrow. Is there a way to escape such a dystopian future? A world where the working people can only hope, at best, to make ends meet as second-rate serfs to our digital overlords is not a certainty – especially if workers take control of the platforms for themselves. This kind of bottom-up, self-organised business network is what Trebor Scholz, a professor at the New School in New York, calls ‘platform cooperativism’. Take Uber, currently valued in the tens of billions of dollars. There’s no reason why a group of drivers couldn’t build a similar platform for themselves; the software tools to develop it are open-source and readily available, and development and design talent can be given incentives to participate. As it happens, such an initiative is already out there, in the form of a ride-sharing, blockchain-based platform called La’Zooz. Currently anyone can join and begin to earn Zooz tokens – the currency you use to buy a ride, and also a store of value that represents your share of ownership of the business. You earn tokens each time you drive more than 20km with the app, or by contributing code to the design, or by getting others to join. The dual purpose of Zooz tokens at once democratises the ownership of a platform and allows users to benefit from the value their presence is creating. Recall that in closed platforms, as network effects increase, rents are subtracted and channelled to the shareholders or capital owners. But the users are not partaking in the spoils of their own participation. By contrast, in a tokenised platform, the value created by users’ transactions boosts the value of the tokens they own. Users can extract the maximum gain from their participation via token appreciation, rather than having the economic value of network effects skimmed off by remote shareholders. Funding decisions are decided by vote; profits and losses are distributed to the token owners Another example of a democratised structure is the ‘decentralised autonomous organisation’ (DAO), launched in May 2016 on a blockchain-based platform known as Ethereum. Its goal is to become a leaderless venture capital fund. It had no management structure, no board of directors and no employees. Instead, it spreads ownership to more than 18,000 ‘stakeholders’ who own DAO tokens, which also gives them voting rights. Every funding decision is decided by vote and automatically executed following the result, after which profits and losses are distributed to the token owners. Participants have a direct say about decisions ‘on chain’, as it’s called, via the rules that secure transactions on a majority-voting basis. They also have a say ‘off-chain’ via social structures such as discussion groups. The DAO has no need of a trusted investment manager; instead, its cycles of operation are embedded in ‘smart contracts’ – agreements written in software code that contain rules regarding their execution. Although the DAO has had serious teething issues, including a major hack, at least it demonstrates in principle how a new type of self-governing organisation might be created. After the free-for-all of the 1990s, and the consolidation of the 2000s, a new, third era of internet evolution is being ushered in by ‘cryptonetworks’. Such platforms are decentralised by nature. Participants purchase and consume tokens (or ‘crypto-coins’) for their transactions on the network, which reaches a settled consensus or record-book of those transactions without the need for a central authority. These two factors – tokens and consensus – result in a democratic and communitarian governance model that was previously impossible without the presence of a trusted third party. And significantly, participants have a right to exit the network whenever they wish by simply selling their tokens, or coins, or – in extreme cases – by ‘hard-forking’ the blockchain, adopting new rules for how to settle the ledger while leaving the old version unchanged. Cryptonetworks show that it’s feasible for workers to self-organise and build their own platforms – where they are the bosses, income is distributed equitably, and profits and losses are shared. In this collectivist scenario, workers might decide that their mission is to safeguard jobs, offer health insurance or pension funds, and improve employees’ quality of life. The dynamics of tokens make the interests of the participants align around common aspirations and goals, since the appreciation of their tokens comes through the growth of the network. We’re in the early days of cryptonetworks. They’re still plagued by serious technical shortcomings, notably scalability and performance. Blockchains cannot, at present, process the huge number of transactions that centralised software systems can; and for technical reasons, the amount of energy it takes to secure a transaction on the blockchain increases over time. So why be optimistic that cryptonetworks might be the platforms of the future? A network of cells expunges hierarchies and collaborates for the common good One reason is that centralised platforms are becoming stifling for developers. With a blinkered focus on how to monetise user data through machine learning, apps from the big tech companies are becoming less and less imaginative. Software developers have grown frustrated with the App Store and Google Play, which require approval in order to publish an application. The economics of platform collectivism offer much greater freedom and reward than the winner-takes-all approach of platform capitalism. In the future, one can imagine an interconnected ecosystem of collectivist groups that provide services and produce goods. Where once there was a corporation, instead we find a network of cells that have expunged hierarchies and collaborate for the common good – ride-sharing services linked up to peer-to-peer lending and medical and health providers. The traditional structure of the firm might have reached its use-by date. But if societies can embrace the economics of the platform while shifting its ownership to workers, a more equitable, resilient and democratic society could well be in store.

Technology professionals from all experience levels are going in for reskilling driven by digitisation, the need to stay relevant and for job security.AI and IoT are, therefore, the hottest skills to acquire for 2018, as well as the fastest growing, according to research shared exclusively with TOI by Edureka, an online learning company that offers over 100 courses in trending technologies. Even hiring data suggests new technology trends such as AI, blockchain and cyber-security will sweep the market off conventional skills. AI, which seems to be becoming a mainstay in almost every form of technology, is going to pop up in all new platforms, devices or apps more and more through 2018, with over 50% firms implementing AI in their products, says a survey by Nasscom. 64346228 In an analysis of responses from a learner base of 17,000 across geographies, Edureka witnessed an increase of over 100% (in learners) for AI course in the last six months, while IoT showed an astronomical spurt of 200%. Though introduced in April, Edureka had earlier perceived a strong demand for the course’s videos on its YouTube channel. HR experts have emphasised the need for reskilling in 2018-19, but few IT employers have invested in upskilling their existing talent. However, professionals from all industries and experience levels want to stay ahead of the curve and are opting for it. Though mid-management professionals form the biggest chunk across technology categories, senior executives and CXOs are also opting to embellish their skills.More than 50% of learners have over 10 years of experience, while the IT-software industry has the biggest chunk of professionals upskilling with AI (77%) at the top. Surprisingly, banking and financial services sector is at second place (8.6%), with all other industries trailing behind, the survey said.“The way of doing everything is dramatically changing. India is right in the middle of this storm because it has the largest pool of an aspiring young force, which is trying to stay current with the change. Its mid-management is trying to reskill so that they are not left on the roadside when this change becomes a tsunami. It also has the largest consumer population, which people want to analyse, understand and target. Thus, organisations are seeking professionals who can help them get ahead of the curve,” says Vineet Nayar, former CEO of HCL Technologies.Learners look for courses that will prepare them for a career track and future-proof their career while giving them flexibility, plenty of hands-on experience and access to technology upgrades. Vineet Chaturvedi, co-founder of Edureka, which has trained over 6,00,000 learners in the last six years, says, “A combination of skills is recommended for tech professionals looking to fast-track their career growth. A core skill, which is in demand, also needs to be augmented with upgrades and upcoming skills and this is the learning trend we have observed too.”A similar trend has been witnessed across other learning platforms too. Kashyap Dalal, co-founder and chief business officer of Simplilearn, says, “Organisations are seeking employees armed with specialised tech skills in these domains (AI and machine learning) and it’s great to see IT professionals building careers where the growth is. At Simplilearn, AI and machine learning have become one of the fastest growing categories and we’ve witnessed a 300% spike each in our learner base over the last year.”Bengaluru leads in the global demand for reskilling, followed by Hyderabad and Chennai, which is also reflective of location of industries the learners belong to.",,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-64349694,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-90739,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tech-execs-pick-iot-ai-most-to-upskill/articleshow/64346229.cms,,,,,,,,,"Tech executives pick IoT, artificial intelligence most to upskill",,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/64346229'}",,,,

Fears that advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and robots will gut the labor force are overblown, according to the leader of a science and technology policy think tank.
Robert Atkinson, economist and founder of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, spoke at AAAS headquarters on May 2 about the future of AI and other technologies and their effects on the labor force. The presentation was co-hosted by the AAAS Colloquium Series, a monthly program that explores timely topics relevant to science and society, and the AAAS STEM Volunteer Program, which deploys scientists and engineers as volunteers in K-12 classrooms in the Washington, D.C., area.
Atkinson started by reassuring the audience and dismissing famous doomsayers. “You can ignore Elon Musk,” said Atkinson. “He certainly doesn’t understand AI when he says that we’re ‘summoning a demon,’” quoting the Tesla CEO’s 2014 remarks.
Even the predictions of academics – one widely cited 2013 study from Oxford University researchers estimated that 47% of jobs in the U.S. are at risk of being automated in the next 20 years – are wrong, Atkinson said.
Why are such studies off-base? Atkinson said their formulas take into account occupations with characteristics that might make automation promising without considering other practical factors. Take, for instance, an occupation that some studies predict may soon be obsolete: school bus driver. Despite the rise of self-driving vehicle technology, Atkinson argued that studies ignore a key factor. “Any of you who work with kids think that you would let your students or your kid ride on a school bus with no adults?” Atkinson asked, getting laughs from the audience.

Many occupations are hard to automate in an effective – and cost-efficient – manner, he said. Even a reasonably priced robotic grip hand, for example, is still more than 15 years away, he said. “The idea that fully intelligent machines are going to be here is like saying that just because we invented the internal combustion engine, warp drive is around the corner,” Atkinson said, paraphrasing roboticist Rodney Brooks.
We have been panicking about the effects of automation on people and the labor force for decades now, but technology-driven job change trends are nothing new, Atkinson said, citing the effects of technology on locomotive engineers – the fastest growing occupation in the United States in the 1850s, he noted – and auto mechanics. The effect of AI on the labor force is “not going to be as disruptive as some people think,” he said.
Atkinson predicts that the most important AI will have greater effects on quality of life than on the labor market. For instance, a doctor, rather than being replaced by a robot, might use AI tools for diagnostics or treatment to improve medical care, he said.
Atkinson’s predictions were not completely optimistic, however. Jobs will be eliminated, but “you won’t have a problem if you’re a lawyer,” he said. Instead, people in low-wage, low-skill jobs will be hardest hit. And even though AI technology will create new jobs, the numbers will be insufficient to replace all eliminated positions.
Some leaders in tech – including Elon Musk and Bill Gates – have suggested implementing “robot taxes” to stem the potential displacement of workers by automation, but Atkinson argued such taxes would simply slow the rate of innovation. Instead, we should have a “pro-technology” outlook that will enable us to improve productivity. “We’re going to need every ounce of productivity growth we can get out of the economy,” he said.
Atkinson offered several educational options for ensuring that workers are well-equipped to participate in a labor force that is enhanced, not replaced, by AI, including better on-the-job training for workers and exposing students early on to fields like statistics and computer science.
Reviewing the employment landscape, Atkinson noted that this era of innovation “will provide all sorts of new opportunities as we go forward.”

It’s long been the stuff of sci fi, but increasingly, the practical side of artificial intelligence (AI) is very real. On the consumer side, personal assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana help automate the simplest of tasks. Meanwhile, AI adoption is also accelerating within the workspace. 
According to a recent Spiceworks survey of more than 500 IT professionals, nearly a quarter of large companies have already implemented digital assistants and another 40% expect to follow suit by 2019. For small and medium businesses, that number is closer to 25%.
It’s virtually indisputable that AI (in the form of natural-language processing, machine learning, and deep learning) has tremendous potential to reduce  costs and increase productivity for the enterprise.But its true impact comes to life when combined with human ingenuity.
Just ask David Gutelius, partner and co-founder of the Data Guild, a San Francisco-based venture studio focused on AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Gutelius experienced an AI epiphany in 2006, while part of the DARPA Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes (CALO) at SRI International’s Artificial Intelligence Center in Menlo Park, CA.
DARPA’s goal was to help Army officers save time by automating some of the menial, work-related tasks that filled their day. What Gutelius and his colleagues discovered was the exponential power of AI and humans working together.
“The project really opened my eyes to what’s possible with the right mix of machines and humans,” Gutelius says. “You can do some pretty amazing things—and it’s not just about helping office workers get more done. It’s about helping individuals and teams be more effective.”
One CALO product that was especially formative used machine learning to monitor communications patterns within a community of officers. Called iLink, it “learned” who had expertise on a given subject, how that person’s expertise changed over time, and who trusted whom on a given topic. Using that information, iLink recommended who should be in a virtual room together when new issues or requests arose. It also improved the existing model of communications, which relied heavily on web-based search, redundant broadcast requests for help, and the happenstance of hallway conversations. 
That vision for the ultimate potential of AI has stuck with Gutelius and is still a key theme of much of his current work. But creating the perfect blend of human and machine power doesn’t happen by chance. Read on for a few examples of how some organizations are using AI for real benefit. 
Look for the Right Opportunities 
Healthcare IT start-up Evid Science developed a solution that uses machine learning and natural language processing to pore over hundreds of peer-reviewed articles about drugs in the trial phase. Then it pulls out the essential data points of a drug’s effectiveness, and generates “landscape” reports that compare the efficacy of different treatments. Doctors take it from there, using the AI outputs to inform care decisions. Since medical professionals are often hard pressed to read medical literature on their own time, reports like this provide critical knowledge and automatically serve up different treatment options for their patients.
Evid Science’s solution is particularly effective because it uses AI’s core strengths: performing repetitive tasks flawlessly and having a keen eye for the details. 
The real-life implications of applied AI are significant: It would take a doctor up to a year to finish reading a report that Evid Science can complete 500 times faster, without the interruptions. Having access to that intelligence could be revolutionary in providing patients with more effective, evidence-based care.
Solve, Measure, and Expand
AI has also proven useful in HR, as companies look for ways to streamline their screening and hiring, and develop more effective methods of attracting and retaining talent. 
For example, ADP DataCloud provides HR professionals with insights and predictive analytics about the performance of individual teams and their company overall. Using customer and third-party data, ADP generates and disseminates reports, and flags concerns such as a team experiencing particularly high turnover, or a star employee whose pay rate is lower than the market rate. ADP DataCloud also calls out reports that other HR professionals have found useful and, over time, learns each customer’s preferences and adjusts accordingly.
ADP DataCloud demonstrates AI’s ability to learn, adjust,and optimize, which is key in amplifying the intelligence and effectiveness of individuals and teams.   
In summing up the effectiveness of ADP DataCloud, ADP Chief Data Scientist Marc Rind says the “insights it generates can provide HR professionals with a better sense of what conversations need to take place, and with whom. It makes them better managers, and better humans.”
Accessible AI to Speed up Operations 
AI has clearly become more accessible to organizations: low-cost tools, for example, can help implement AI directly into workflows to speed up operations. Other tools can help automate business processes—taking orders, applying sales discounts, soliciting feedback, managing procurement, tracking content approvals, and more—without a single line of code, complex formulas, or help from IT.
Companies like Disney and Whole Foods, for example, are building and implementing intelligent chatbots into their workflows to streamline repetitive, manual tasks that can increase time savings and productivity. 
Whether you’re planning to go big, or just test the AI waters, Gutelius offers this parting advice:“Start with defining and deconstructing the problem, and develop a culture of experimentation and measurement so that you can learn what works and what doesn’t.“
For another example how businesses are using next-gen tools to speed up operations, read how Colliers International used automation to reduce a key business process from 6 months to a week.

There is no question some jobs will be lost. But others will be created, and still others will morph into something different — bot designer, bot supervisor, soother of the most irate customers. In some cases, AI will just take on extra work nobody wants to do.   In one example of the latter, First National Bank of Wynne in Arkansas has been using robotic process automation, the lowest-IQ form of AI, to help with acquisitions.“When you acquire a bank, one of the biggest cost expenses is the core conversion piece,” explained Bart Green, senior vice president.  All customer and account information, including for cards, internet banking and cash management, has to be migrated to the acquiring bank’s core system. It is time-consuming. A consultant told them about RPA software from EnableSoft called Foxtrot. Other providers of RPA software include Blue Prism, UiPath and WorkFusion.

   RPA software can be set up to perform tasks the way a human would — it can log into software by entering a username and password, it can click on a client record, then log into another piece of software, locate a data field and copy and paste that data into the first page. It can be set up so you can watch it on a desktop, and it looks as if a ghost were operating the computer. “You could teach it, just like you would teach an employee, how to input information into systems, and it can do it efficiently and quickly,” Green said. It’s better at reporting errors and validating data. Using the software has saved the bank 70% in conversion costs, he said.Now the bank is beginning to find other uses for the software. “It’s a matter of thinking of what kinds of manual, time-consuming processes do we have today and how can we automate them?” Green said. For instance, the bank recently had to mass reissue debit cards due to a breach. That could be done by bots. The RPA software has not affected jobs so far at the bank because it is being used for one-off, time-consuming projects like mergers, Green said. “I’ve yet to put it in place to replace a daily duty,” he said. “I can see that occurring. I’m just beginning to start peeling away the layers of that possibility.”He could also see hiring someone in IT who has experience with RPA software to help figure out new uses for it. “It may end up canceling out jobs — you’re creating a job that does this task to remove the task required by another employee,” Green noted. What jobs will be lost, gained?Some bankers and observers have suggested that only the boring parts of jobs, drudgery like data entry and filling out forms, will disappear so the humans will be able to focus on more interesting tasks, and that no actual jobs will be lost. Bank employees themselves seem to think this. In an Accenture survey released last week of 1,300 nonexecutive bank employees, 67% said they believe AI will improve their work-life balance, and 57% expect it will expand their career prospects.     But Autonomous Research also issued a report last week that estimated that in the U.S. alone, 2.5 million financial services employees will be “exposed” to AI technologies in the front, middle and back office — 1.2 million working in banking and lending, 460,000 in investment management, and 865,000 in insurance.“These functions will see 20-40% productivity gains, or unemployment, depending on your vantage point,” the report stated. About $1 trillion in costs will be exposed to AI transformation in financial services sectors by 2030, according to the report; $450 million of this would in banking.In banking, 70% of front-office jobs will be dislocated by AI, the researchers say: 485,000 tellers, 219,000 customer service representatives, and 174,000 loan interviewers and clerks. They will be replaced by chatbots, voice assistants and automated authentication and biometric technology. And 96,000 financial managers and 13,000 compliance officers will be laid off as AI-based anti-money-laundering, anti-fraud, compliance and monitoring software fills in. Another 250,000 loan officers will lose their jobs to AI-based credit underwriting and smart contracts technology.However, Accenture’s study last week of AI’s impact on jobs in financial services presented a rosier job picture. It concluded that there will be a net gain in jobs among companies that deploy AI wisely, of 14%; they will also increase revenues by 34% by 2022.One source of new revenue will be automated advice that helps people do things like save more or invest more lucratively, the way Netflix and Amazon recommend movies and products. This could lead to wallet consolidation and cross-sales.“There will be roles that AI will eliminate,” said Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture and head of the company’s banking practice. “But we do think that deployed properly it will create opportunities as well.”For instance, banks that use AI software to generate suspicious activity reports will most likely create new jobs around explaining AI to regulators.“The regulators are not going to be big advocates of black box decision-making that is not easily explained,” McIntyre noted. Where will entry-level jobs exist?As teller, AML, and other jobs become automated by RPA and AI, where will people right out of school or people with disabilities find entry-level jobs?“It’s a difficult question,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous. “This is a question that has to go to the heart of every CEO of a large financial firm that hires AI software to replace human jobs, and it goes on the shoulders of the founders and developers that are building the software. If you have created real structural unemployment by building out successful software, you have to think about your employees as stakeholders in the project.” McIntyre suggested the entry-level jobs will now be in technology.“One can see the way digital-native companies are hiring people out of college with programming capability,” he said. “I do think the idea of starting as a teller and working your way to CEO is troubled.”What about people who are not good at math, science and programming? “There still will be roles where human empathy and the ability to connect are important,” McIntyre said. If someone has $100,000 to invest, for instance, an app might be able to suggest an asset allocation. But if it is an inheritance from a parent who just died, the interaction will take some sympathy.“Those types of conversations will require people to have a high [emotional quotient], to be able to read and react to people and guide the conversation,” McIntyre said. Which has a higher EQ — human or bot?Not everyone believes that humans are better at emotional work, like dealing with a sad or irate customer. Sokolin argued that AI systems are good at emotional labor. He pointed to the debt-collection fintech TrueAccord, whose AI engine handles collections work for banks and card issuers. “All they do is emotional labor, and they’re much better at it than people who call you during dinner,” he said. Ohad Samet, CEO of TrueAccord, said technology is good at avoiding tense situations in a way that humans are not.“People in the collections industry like to say that people collect from people, but the reality is that collectors are human and subject to human biases: they get angry, they get tired,"" he said. ""If the person in debt is abusive on the phone, which is not uncommon, they have an emotional response. The software is not subject to that,"" Samet said. ""It uses the best channel, the best content, the best offer at the right time, and it doesn’t get offended or misbehave if somebody yells at it or writes something nasty back, which happens.” And the software does have some empathy built in. Though using AI requires fewer human collectors, Samet pointed out that such jobs are little fun and pay badly. And customers do not want to talk to human collections agents anyway. “The world is changing,” he said. “We’re not the ones making that change. The preferences of consumers are changing the collections industry.”TrueAccord is an example of some of the new jobs being created by AI. It has a growing customer engagement team, who help people who call in or email. Some employees write the content the chatbots present. Others are data scientists who work to tune the experience to the needs of consumers.Chatbot backlashA few banks have introduced chatbots to do work that might otherwise be done by customer service people. Bank of America’s erica is one example. USAA’s Alexa skill is another.There has also been some chatbot controversy and backlash. There was Microsoft’s Tay, which spewed racist nonsense to customers. The fintech startup Digit, which offers automated saving and credit card debt paydown, no longer makes a chatbot the primary means of interacting with its app. For the simple tasks Digit customers do, it did not seem to be the right approach.Sokolin noted that different tools make sense for different purposes. To obtain an account balance, a simple login and tap is logical. Opening Facebook Messenger and asking it is not. Like many bankers, Green has hesitated to deploy a customer-facing chatbot, comparing this to replacing a front-desk receptionist with an electronic menu that has to be navigated.“You may still get the results you need, but the question will be, how well will AI differentiate the party on the other line’s emotional feelings on their problem?” he said. “If the customer is upset, happy, or excited, how will AI be able to accommodate that situation? It’s impressive to see Amazon Echo understand different dialects, but will it be able to understand emotional aspects of that conversation?”Green said there is also reputational risk. “If a person makes a mistake, you can fire them,” he said. “If the AI keeps making mistakes, you have a huge reputational risk that’s hard to overcome. Are you going to fire your AI?”Partly for these reasons, some banks are making chatbot technology available to their employees, to help them be more efficient. For instance, Morgan Stanley has equipped its financial advisers with AI software that sifts through client data and records to help suggest recommendations. Retraining the workforceAccenture’s survey of bankers found that only 3% are investing in retraining their workers to prepare them for the AI-riddled workplace. McIntyre said this is because the technology is still new and banks are just testing the use of AI in areas like trading, lending, and customer service; they are not yet looking at the bigger picture. Banks need to help employees make the transition to AI, Sokolin said. They might implement software that enables blue-collar workers to be programmers with the use of visual tools, for instance.Colleges may need to do more to prepare people for AI. Royal Bank of Canada has called for a national review of college programs to ensure they place more of a focus on “human skills” like active listening, critical thinking and social perceptiveness.The bank’s research has found these skills will help position future workers to complement increasingly pervasive technologies like robots and machines, rather than compete with them.Sokolin is less worried about the younger generation than the older generation that might have a harder time shifting to AI-assisted work and who have more at stake with high debt and low savings. “It becomes a fairly anxious picture,” he said. “That is the responsibility of the employer. People have to raise their hand and say we’ll do something to fix or soften it.” Executives safe for nowBank executives’ jobs appear to be safe from AI for now. Vendors are not suggesting their software can do C-suite work. And AI is bad at context switching, according to Sokolin. “Today AI is very narrow,” he said. “You pick a direction you want it to hammer. You teach it the outcome you want, and it can generally create that outcome.”An executive might use a spreadsheet for a little while, then manage a relationship, then run a business development meeting, then deal with an upset client whose LLC is going bankrupt.“All these things require a lot of different skill sets,” Sokolin said. “In today’s institutions at the senior management levels, there’s a lot of that type of context switching.”But as AI gets more broadly adopted, managing people will take different skill sets at the senior level. And an interesting question may become: If you’re managing fewer people and more bots, what does that do to your power base in an organization?Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback at penny.crosman@sourcemedia.com.

      Unfortunately for the intrepid astronauts in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001, a Space Odyssey, the HAL 9000 computer knows how to read lips.

Almost everyone knows the story of HAL 9000, the killer supercomputer in Stanley Kubrick’s landmark film 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose 50th anniversary will be celebrated on May 12, 2018 at the 71st Cannes Film Festival. In an intriguing scheduling coincidence, IBM, Kubrick’s partner during the filming of A Space Odyssey, and Airbus have just unveiled the CIMON (Crew Interactive Mobile Companion) project, an “intelligent, mobile and interactive astronaut assistance system” that will join the International Space Station.
These two events propel us into a debate over the risks created by the development of superintelligence that could eliminate jobs on a massive scale or, even worse, wipe the human species off the face of the planet – and raise the question of how to assess such a threat.
To date, we have no experience of accidents or disasters due to faulty or malicious AI. However, the imaginations of artists and scientists are a treasure trove of material that tells the story of superintelligence freed from any human control.



A story of AI going wrong
2001: A Space Odyssey is a forerunner of contemporary controversies. It tells the story of the struggle and eventual conquest of a human being, the only survivor of a methodical programme of extermination led by a sentient supercomputer.
Aboard the spaceship Discovery One, only the supercomputer HAL 9000 has been informed by its creators of the purpose of the mission: to reach Jupiter and search for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence. Although considered to be infallible, HAL makes an error. The machine refuses to admit this, and, caught out, it claims that the mistake is due to “human error”. In principle the humans are the computer’s designers but, if it is to be believed, could it in fact be the computer itself? Adopting this line of reasoning, the machine gives itself a status that crew members could not imagine – that of a living, sentient and thinking being.
For the crew, HAL’s error is unacceptable. There is no room for forgiveness or charity: error may be human, but it is not machine. There is no appeal: HAL must be taken out of service. The supercomputer, omnipresent and omniscient, immediately discovers the project designed to end its life. To survive and complete its mission, it decides to eliminate the crew. Only one human survives, Astronaut David Bowman, and he resumes, with even more determination, the digital homicide mission.
Bowman succeeds in penetrating the core of the unit and then mechanically, emotionlessly and almost ceremoniously disconnects, one by one, the machine’s memory circuits from their housing. Like a child caught with its hand in the cookie jar, the computer tries, by talking about itself, to derail the lobotomy. In a final attempt, it sings a song it learned in its first hours of “life”, but nothing works, and finally its voice fades away.



AI that can talk about itself
Much more than the story of a fight to the death, one of the treasures of the film is that is considers the narrative dimension of AI. It’s able not only to make up stories about itself, but also can fail due to circumstances and its own errors. Thus, the elimination of the crew is not the result of HAL 9000 becoming autonomous, but from a “bad story” that the machine tells itself, that of believing that the crew could compromise the mission.
Kubrick’s work thus makes it possible to conceive the risks caused by superintelligence not in terms of technical domination, but as the construction of an imperfect narrative identity. Although reality is still far from catching up with fiction, some initial findings in this area are worth thinking about.

In 2016, a novel titled The Day a Computer Writes a Novel… Almost won a Japanese literary prize, the Nikkei Hoshi Shinichi. It was prewritten by an AI research team from the University of Hakodate, whose work initially consisted of selecting words and sentences, then defining parameters that allowed a program to “write” the novel. Of more than 1,450 submissions for the prize, 11 had been written, at least in part, by a non-human. Of course, the jury knew nothing about the “authors”.
The following year, in the same spirit but without a digital co-author, Zack Thoutt, a fan of the TV series Game of Thrones, used a neural network fed with over 5,000 pages of text from the books on which it was based to predict what might happen next in the story. The result is far from equal to the work of author George R. Martin, but the text is, for the most part, understandable and the predictions are similar to some of the theories that are popular with fans of the series.
More recently, a program designed by MIT’s Media Lab – baptised “Shelley” after Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus – created terrifying tales, designed to scare. The first stage was to train the program with stories written by humans taken from a database of over 140,000 references. In the second stage, the computer generated its own works that it improved by collaborating with humans who responded to its messages via Twitter.
And in the domain of reading and understanding stories, Google has just launched its “Talk to book” service that allows users to converse in natural language with an automatic learning algorithm that is supposed to help them in their future reading choices.

Stories that evoke the risks of AI
If, like HAL 9000, AI computers try to write stories, they are still far from reaching the standards set by human authors. Although no one can predict with certainty what artificial superintelligence might look like, it remains possible to imagine it by producing stories that stimulate our thinking.
The historian Yuval Noah Harari undertook the task, imagining a future where the automation of machines would cause the disappearance of the majority of jobs. He argued that humans risk losing their economic value because intelligence will be decoupled from consciousness. While intelligence is necessary to drive a car or diagnose a disease, consciousness and subjective human experiences are not mandatory.
Even more alarmist, the philosopher Nick Bostrom puts forward the idea that humans will probably not have the opportunity to experience this disastrous revolution because it is likely they will be exterminated as soon as artificial superintelligence appears.



Both Harari and Bostrom base their conclusions on a reduction of action to its functional dimension, judged solely in terms of effectiveness. But such a vision neglects whole areas of human existence. To remedy this, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio argues that life represents a complex act in which feelings are the expression of a permanent struggle to achieve a balance that underpins human existence. For Damasio, without subjectivity there is no creativity, and without the emotions that are manifest in the relationships between the body and the brain to perceive reality, there is no humanity.
Accepting this relegates Kubrick to the rank of a genius whose prophecy, albeit poetic, is unrealistic. It also means admitting that an AI computer will never be able to redefine its own mission at the expense of its creators. And finally, we must take very seriously the idea that the main risk to humanity is a cyberwar initiated by humans themselves – a conflict populated by drones and killer robots supported by swarms of computer viruses that all smarter than the others…

H&M is good at making amazing frocks for the Met ball, but it’s less good at making money: The company’s profits for the first quarter of this year were down 69 percent, and it effectively ran out of cash in 2017. Cue the “pivot” headlines!
The latest pitch from the fast-fashion retailer, covered as a “pivot” in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, uses lots of trendy buzzwords like A.I. and big data. The general idea is that by “using algorithms to analyze store receipts, returns and loyalty-card data,” H&M will be able to “tailor merchandise in each store to local tastes, rather than take a cookie-cutter approach.”

What the algorithms need to do is curate a store, and that is something they are not good at.

Stripped of its techno buzzwords, this is the old idea of localization, as laid out in a 2006 Harvard Business Review article by Vijay Vishwanath and Darrell K. Rigby. “The era of standardization is ending,” they wrote. “Smart retailers and consumer goods companies are starting to customize their offerings,” as part of a broader move “from standardization to localization.”

This is a formula that can work. Look at Waterstones, in the U.K., a bookseller that faces just as much competition from Amazon as Barnes & Noble does in the U.S. But while B&N is struggling, Waterstones is thriving. The difference: B&N is trying to compete by offering wine and big windows; Waterstones, by contrast, brought in a dusty old-fashioned book guy, James Daunt, whose first order of business was to empower store managers and give them almost total freedom in terms of which books they displayed where. No two stores would look or feel the same; all of them would reflect local tastes and mores. In 2017, its profits soared 80 percent from the year before.

Unfortunately for H&M, this sort of localization is very, very hard to automate. Computers are good at maximizing things: They can order more of what your customers want and less of what they don’t want. But you don’t need sophisticated A.I. algorithms for that. Any old point-of-sale software can tell you what’s selling. What the algos need to do is curate a store, and that is something they are not good at.

Daphne Howland, a contributing editor at Retail Dive, uses the example of a shopper who buys two jars of imported French honey every year—honey almost no one else wants. If she’s an important customer, or if the fact you stock that honey makes her love your store and keeps her coming back even when she isn’t buying it, then it makes sense to keep on carrying that honey. That’s the kind of decision that humans can make easily but that A.I. still finds very difficult.

Localization is a real thing and has been for as long as there have been shops: Shopkeepers know their customers and stock what those customers want. The difficulty comes when it’s attempted by global chains like H&M that rely on huge economies of scale and the ability to distribute identical goods to thousands of stores around the world. The bigger that a chain becomes, the more its sales are going to be a function of its global brand, rather than its idiosyncratic local stock keeping decisions. A.I. is not going to change that.
In the long run, local retail, imbued with deep local knowledge, is actually very well placed to thrive in a connected digital economy. Despite the rise of Amazon, most shopping is local and always will be. And for all of big data’s power, there’s something deeply inefficient about companies like Amazon or Unilever shipping razor blades hundreds of miles to my door, when they’re easily available at the drugstore across the street. This is why I’m reasonably confident that in the not-too-distant future, we will all have apps to which we can just say “deliver me some ice,” or “shit, we’re out of toothpaste,” or even “there’s no way I’m walking out the door in my same clothes from last night”—and the nearest, most convenient source of whatever you’re looking for will be able to get it delivered to you quickly.
In other words, local retail has the ability to disrupt Amazon more than Amazon has the ability to disrupt local retail. The “retail apocalypse” is not a function of Amazon, it’s a function of America having built vastly more retail square footage per person than any other country in the world. In shopping malls, a lot of that retail is doomed. But in neighborhoods, retail will always be profitable at a reasonable rent. Which means that big chains like H&M—or Sears, or Best Buy—probably don’t have too many pivots left in them.

A prominent researcher of machine learning and artificial intelligence is arguing that his field has strayed out of the bounds of science and engineering and into ""alchemy."" And he's offering a route back.Ali Rahimi, who works on AI for Google, said he thinks his field has made amazing progress, but suggested there's something rotten in the way it's developed. In machine learning, a computer ""learns"" via a process of trial and error. The problem in a talk presented at an A.I. conference is that researchers who work in the field — when a computer ""learns"" due to a process of trial and error — not only don't understand exactly how their algorithms learn, but they don't understand how the techniques they're using to build those algorithms work either, Rahimi suggested in a talk presented at an AI conference covered recently by Matthew Hutson for Science magazine.Back in 2017, Rahimi sounded the alarm on the mystical side of artificial intelligence: ""We produce stunningly impressive results,"" he wrote in a blog. ""Self-driving cars seem to be around the corner; artificial intelligence tags faces in photos, transcribes voicemails, translates documents and feeds us ads. Billion-dollar companies are built on machine learning. In many ways, we're in a better spot than we were 10 years ago. In some ways, we're in a worse spot."" [Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures]Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksApple Recommends Blinkist, The Best App For Intellectuals Around The WorldBlinkist MagazineUndoRahimi, as Hutson reported, showed that many machine-learning algorithms contain tacked-on features that are essentially useless, and that many algorithms work better when those features are stripped away. Other algorithms are fundamentally broken and work only because of a thick crust of ad-hoc fixes piled on top of the original program.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceThis is, at least in part, the result of a field that's gotten used to a kind of random, trial-and-error methodology, Rahimi argued in that blog. Under this process, researchers don't understand at all why one attempt at solving a problem worked and another failed. People implement and share techniques that they don't remotely understand.Here's the complete painting. (Image credit: Public Domain)Folks who follow AI might be reminded of the ""black box"" problem, Hutson noted in his article — the tendency of AI programs to solve problems in ways that their human creators don't understand. But the current issue is different: Researchers not only don't understand their AI programs' problem-solving techniques, Rahimi said, but they don't understand the techniques they used to build those programs in the first place either. In other words, the field is more like alchemy than a modern system of research, he said.""There's a place for alchemy.

Among them: evaluating new algorithms in terms of their constituent parts, deleting parts of them one at a time and testing if the overall programs still work, and performing basic ""sanity tests"" on the results that the algorithms produce.That's all because AI, Rahimi argued in his 2017 blog, has become too important in society to be developed in such a slapdash fashion.""If you're building photo-sharing services, alchemy is fine,"" he wrote.

Watch out China — the Trump administration has its own plans to dominate development of artificial intelligence.
As the latest indication of this, the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence during an organized AI summit of industry and academic partners Thursday.
“As artificial intelligence transforms everything from agriculture to manufacturing to transportation, the potential for AI remains breathtaking,” Michael Kratsios, deputy CTO at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in his remarks at the event. “But we cannot be passive. To realize the full potential of AI for the American people, it will require the combined efforts of industry, academia, and government.”
The new committee, likewise, holds a mission “to improve the coordination of Federal efforts related to AI to ensure continued U.S. leadership in this field.” It will operate within the technology committee at the National Science and Technology Council, and will be made up of “the most senior R&D officials” from across the federal government.

According to the charter of the committee, these include the undersecretary of commerce for standards and technology from the Department of Commerce, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering at the Department of Defense, the director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the undersecretary of energy for science within the Department of Energy, the director of the National Science Foundation, and the director of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency. The committee will be chaired by OSTP and will also include representatives from the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council.
The select committee will work toward its mission of enabling U.S. leadership in the development of AI in a number of ways, including by helping to define interagency AI research and development goals, coordinate agency R&D plans and encourage further agency initiatives (including in partnership with industry and academia).
During his wide-ranging speech Thursday, Kratsios spoke about the administration’s commitment to investing in AI as a key component of Trump’s R&D budget request for 2019. He mentioned how the President’s Management Agenda calls for the increased use of automation software within the federal government. And he addressed the evergreen concern that accompanies conversations about AI — job loss.
“To a certain degree job displacement is inevitable,” Kratsios said. “But we can’t sit idle, hoping eventually the market will sort it out. We must do what Americans have always done: adapt.”
The Trump administration’s commitment to science and technology education, he said, is part of its plan to adapt. OSTP, Kratsios added, will release a five-year strategic plan on STEM education efforts later this year. The creation of that plan is being led by the office’s assistant
director for STEM education, Dr. Jeff Weld.

“Our continued leadership in the field that American researchers pioneered is not just a request; it is an imperative,” Kratsios said. “It is an imperative because of the potential benefits to American industry, to the American worker, and to the American people.”

2016 marked the year that the enterprise world began to wake up to the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). Just two years ago, AI software programs were writing full movie screenplays, predicting the Kentucky Derby and beating video game world champions – and the technological breakthroughs did not stop there. Since then businesses, including many Fortune 500 companies, have started to grapple with what AI can do for their business and operations.
As they experiment, a clear pattern is emerging: anything which is a repeatable process can and will be taken over by AI and machine learning (ML). If you decide to extrapolate these technologies, then all normal processes will be automated, and the job of humans will be relegated to handling the complex exceptions. For example, a recent Harvard Business Review article highlighted how Stitch Fix, an online clothing subscription service, uses a machine learning engine to help make personalized recommendations for customers. Automating data collection and routine processes for employees increases productivity, helps to handle complex requests and allows greater focus on connecting with clients – which ultimately lets businesses better allocate their resources and boost profitability.
At this point neither the technology nor the details of its implementation are standing in the way of leveraging AI and ML. Instead, there are five factors that you should keep in mind while using new technology to scale the growth of an organization: the ability to imagine, the willingness to change, the rethinking of product design, the mastering of the art of partnering and, finally, the ability to view AI as a paradigm for business change.











 
 
 
1. Unleash the imagination of your workforce
The challenges of utilizing AI and ML do not lie within the technology, but rather in determining the most effective use cases. How do we enable each person in the organization to think big and imagine what the future will be like – and place him/herself in this picture? What is blocking this imagination? One of the culprits is hierarchical organizational structures that inadvertently shape the mindsets of employees and narrow their thinking. The creation and nurturing of communities within will enable talent and creativity to cross silos and break down barriers.

2. Overcome the willingness to change
It is counterproductive to push intelligent technologies upon an entire organization all at once. Instead, work with your employees to find the balance between investment in AI and ML technologies and maintaining the existing business. Employees are far more willing to master new technologies when they understand that these technologies won’t be taking their job. There is a misconception that AI and ML technologies will replace people. Rather, intelligent technologies are implemented to handle the routine processes with precision and allow employees to focus on the more complex, human aspects of their jobs.
Redesign business processes from end to end, instead of using a piecemeal approach. Doing this will highlight the importance of the human factor in context with AI/ML and will unleash a new set of human talents that machines are currently unable to match – creativity, interpersonal communication and empathy. In turn, this will lead to the creation of new value, new jobs and higher-level responsibilities.











 
 
 
3. Rethink existing product design and architecture patterns
Technologists have been designing deterministic systems for decades. Software products and systems are designed based on clarity of inputs and outputs, and systems can now ascertain how to deal with data through self-learning algorithms. The art no longer lies in how to build systems with clear rules and logic, rather new skills will be required to build systems that constantly learn as more data is thrown at them. This will fundamentally reboot software development paradigms – like requirement analysis design and testing – regardless if it’s done agile or waterfall.
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are also changing. Data architectures will come to the forefront, as customizing packaged software to model the processes of an organization will no longer be required. AI, combined with the rapid creation of apps, will relegate ERP systems into operating engines. Companies shifting their business processes to take advantage of new business models and emerging markets will seek out intelligent technologies to ensure a smooth ERP transition.
4. Master the art of scouting & partnering
Working with providers and technology platforms will undergo a significant change as we leave the realm of deterministic systems. Organizations will have to learn to rely on their providers now that part of the AI solutions are embedded in their offerings. The discussion will move away from which partner delivers the best quality to whether a partner can be trusted to run AI ethically and competently within a business process. AI startups have sprung up like mushrooms – each having a narrow focus, lack of real investment capital and access to the enterprise market. This is a huge matchmaking opportunity for procurement departments to sharpen their axes in the skill of creating partnerships. It will be important for enterprises to understand that partnering involves contracting for co-creation, joint success and sharing of the joint intellectual property created, so that they do not fall behind at the enterprise level.











 
 
 
5. View AI as a paradigm for business design
As the use cases of AI explode, organizations cannot afford to wait for the industry to show what is possible and the days of aiming to be the fast follower are over. Yet, the pressure to act will depend heavily on the competitiveness of the industry segment and the merging of industry segments. Manufacturing companies are tracking finance and retail companies using marketing AI tools and insurance companies are adopting manufacturing paradigms, like Digital Twins, to predict the risk of the assets they insure. AI should be seen not only as the means to improve operations, but rather to fundamentally change the way that an organization makes its revenue. AI and ML have the power to redefine value chains globally. Market leaders should look at AI as a means of defending their market position, while others should use AI to reposition themselves during the disintegration of the value chain. Employee talent, adoption of the technology, business design and potential partnerships will further drive the acceptance of AI. These factors, along with ultimately viewing AI as a core part of your business strategy will be a crucial in deciding when and how to implement intelligent technologies.
This will not be an easy task. Intelligent technology expectations and returns remain unclear and will require the extrapolation of data and algorithms to solidify product ideas and investments. The complexity of the technology and its implementation should not be considered a critical factor that stands in the way of leveraging AI and ML. Keep in mind the five tips detailed above, and you will better find success while using the new technologies to grow your organization.

And when scientists measured where a rat was located when grid cells fired, those spots — called ""firing fields"" — formed a hexagonal pattern.This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.They don't work alone; grid cells operate with other brain cells to help us keep our bearings.For instance, ""place cells"" activate when a mammal occupies a specific location, and ""head direction cells"" — unsurprisingly — fire when its head points in a specific direction.This internal navigation system evolved in mammals over tens of millions of years. Could an artificial system be trained to do the same?From mammal to machineTo find out, the DeepMind team started with a neural network: a series of algorithms inspired by the brain, said University of Queensland computational neuroscientist Geoffrey Goodhill, who was not involved in the study.What are neural networks?Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligenceThey comprise computing systems inspired by the way the brain processes informationInformation moves through a series of connected layers of algorithms called nodesThe more layers, the ""deeper"" the networkNeural networks are trained by feeding them many examples of the task we want them to learnThe network adjusts the strength of the connections between the nodes until it learns to extract important informationEventually, the neural network becomes adept at that particular task""We know the brain learns by changing strengths of connections between neurons,"" Professor Goodhill said.""These algorithms are based on the idea of changing connection strengths.""Over the past few years, DeepMind has unveiled headline-grabbing computer programs which rely on neural networks.AlphaGo played the board game Go so well it trounced professional players. It was blitzed by its successor, AlphaGo Zero, which won 100 games to zero.But even AlphaGo Zero was no match for what came next — AlphaZero. With less than a day of training, AlphaZero beat world-champion programs in chess, the Japanese game of shogi and Go.While DeepMind states that brain research can benefit from artificial intelligence, ""up to now, its work hasn't really fed back into helping understand neuroscience,"" Professor Goodhill said.""But that's what this paper starts to do.""The DeepMind team trained a neural network to navigate a virtual 2.2 by 2.2-metre environment with what's called ""path integration"", which adds distance and direction to track location.Mammals commonly use path integration. It doesn't rely on landmarks, so it's a great way to get around in the dark — like navigating the path from bed to the toilet in the middle of the night.After being trained, the DeepMind neural network developed ""grid units"", which fired in a hexagonal pattern — just like grid cells found in our brain.They weren't deliberately programmed to arise.The DeepMind team retrained their network 100 times. Grid cells emerged each time.Grid cells help calculate shortcutsSo, DeepMind had a network with grid cells. Could they use it to create a program that could navigate unfamiliar environments and calculate a direct route from A to B?To test this, they incorporated the grid-cell network into a larger system designed to navigate virtual environments.Their ""artificial agent"" received velocity information and images of its surrounds, like a real animal.When the artificial agent was let loose in a virtual environment, it was able to adjust its route to take a shortcut, even in unfamiliar regions.This skill is called ""vector-based navigation"".This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.Remove the grid cells from the neural network, and the artificial agent struggled to get around efficiently.The work supports the idea that grid cells in the brain are important to plan and calculate a path, even if you've not been there before.""We have found evidence that the function of grid cells may extend far beyond solely giving us a GPS-like localisation signal,"" said Dharshan Kumaran, DeepMind researcher and study co-author.""Grid cells might also constitute a core component of the navigational guidance system [like satnav] that the brain relies upon, to calculate the shortest path between A and B.""More AI insights to comeFinding brain-like features in a trained neural network isn't new, Professor Goodhill said.""You often find in these networks that there will be internal representations similar to the internal representations you find in the brain,"" he said.One example is neural networks that process and categorise images.""In the visual part of the brain, you have cells which respond to oriented edges,"" Professor Goodhill said.""You also find these in artificial networks trained in image processing.""What's new here is it's the first time people have done it with grid cells.""And according to Professor Goodhill, it's just the start of artificial intelligence providing new insights into the workings of the human brain.""More things will emerge about our own biology. I think there's a lot of potential there,"" he said.""It's exciting to see this integration between artificial [intelligence] and neuroscience.""Posted 9 May 20189 May 2018Wed 9 May 2018 at 3:29pm, updated 9 May 20189 May 2018Wed 9 May 2018 at 3:42pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesHow Google's new AI can teach itself to beat you at the most complex gamesGoogle buys AI company after big robotics, home devices acquisitionsWhat is artificial intelligence?More on:Academic ResearchBrain and Nervous SystemComputer ScienceEngineeringNeuroscienceRoboticsScience and TechnologyTop StoriesHow politics, engagement bait and money opened up a firehose of falsehoods after Trump's shootingJudge tosses Trump documents case, ruling prosecutor unlawfully appointedWe came for the spectacle of a Trump rally.

Today that has changed. While natural language processing (NLP) and recognition is far from perfect, thanks to machine learning algorithms it’s getting increasingly closer to a point where it will be harder to tell whether we are talking to a human or a computer.
Business has capitalized on this, with increasing numbers of chatbots deployed, usually in customer service functions but increasingly in internal processes and to assist in training.
At ICLR 2018 in Vancouver, Salesforce’s chief scientist, Richard Socher, presented seven breakthrough pieces of research covering practical advances in NLP including summarization, machine translation and question answering.
PROMOTED
He told me “NLP is going to be incredibly important for business – it is going to fundamentally change how we provide services, how we understand sales processes and how we do marketing.

“Particularly on social media, you need NLP to understand the sentiment around your marketing messages and how people perceive your brand.”
Of course, this raises some issues, and one of the most glaring is, do people really want to talk to machines? From a business point of view it makes sense – it’s incalculably cheaper to carry on 1,000 simultaneous customer service conversations with a machine than with the giant human call center which would be needed to do the same job.
But from a customer point of view, are they gaining anything? Unless the service they receive is faster, more efficient and more useful, then they probably aren’t.
“I can’t speak for all chatbot deployments in the world – there are some that aren’t done very well,” says Socher.

“But in our case we’ve heard very positive feedback because when a bot correctly answers questions or fills your requirements it does it very, very fast.”
“In the end, users just want a quick answer, and originally people thought they wanted to talk to a person because the alternative was to go through a ten minute menu or to listen to ten options and then have to press a button – that’s not fun and its not fast and efficient.”
Key to achieving this efficient use of NLP technology are the concepts of aggregation and augmentation. Rather than thinking of a conversation exclusively taking place between one human and one machine, AI and chatbots can be used to monitor and draw insights from every conversation and learn from them how to perform better in the next one.
And augmentation means that the machine doesn’t have to conduct the entire conversation. Chatbots can “step in” for routine tasks such as answering straightforward questions from an organization’s knowledge base, or taking payment details.
In other situations, the speed of real-time analytics available today means that bots can raise an alert when they detect, for example, a customer becoming irate – thanks to sentiment analytics - prompting a human operator to take over the chat or call.
Summarization is another highly useful function of NLP, and one which is likely to be increasingly rolled out to chatbots. Internally, bots will be able to quickly digest, process and report business data when it is needed, and new recruits can quickly bring themselves up to speed. For customer-facing functions, customers can receive summarized answers to questions involving product and service lines, or technical support issues.
Chatbots are a form of the ‘intelligent assistant’ technology which powers Siri or Google Assistant on your phone, or Cortana on your desktop. Generally though they are focused on one specific task within an organization.
One study found that 40% of large businesses have implemented this technology in some form, or will have done so by the end of 2019.
Among those, 46% said that NLP is used for voice to text dictation, 14% for customer services and 10% for other data analytics work.
Chatbots are also increasingly ubiquitous in collaborative working environments such as Slack, where they can monitor conversations between teams and provide relevant facts or statistics at pertinent points in the conversation.
In the future, chatbots will probably be able to take things even further and propose strategy and tactics for overcoming business problems.
Socher tells me “They will probably be able to help us craft marketing messages, based on understanding of the language of all the things that have been successful in the past.”
Another example could be customer service bots which can allocate resources to dealing with customer cases based on the classification and sentiment analysis of the conversations they are having.
As with all AI, development of NLP is far from a finished process and level of conversation we are able to have today will undoubtedly seem archaically stilted and unnatural in just a couple of years’ time.
But today, organizations are clearly becoming more comfortable with the idea of integrating chatbots and intelligent assistants into their processes, and confident that it will lead to improvements in efficiency and customer satisfaction.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

In tomorrow’s workplace, many routine jobs now performed by workers will increasingly be assumed by machines, leaving more complicated tasks to humans who see the big picture and possess interpersonal skills, a Stanford scholar says.

Artificial intelligence and other advancing technologies promise advances in health, safety and productivity, but large-scale economic disruptions are inevitable, said James Timbie, an Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He trained at Stanford as a physicist, served as a senior advisor at the State Department from 1983 to 2016 where he played a key role in arms control and disarmament, and now studies the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.Timbie discussed what the future may hold for workers in a chapter in the new book, Beyond Disruption: Technology’s Challenge to Governance, which he co-edited with Hoover’s George P. Shultz and Jim Hoagland. He was recently interviewed on the subject. How will the emergence of artificial intelligence affect individual workers in the future?Artificial intelligence combined with other advancing technologies – such as robotics and 3D printing – will lead to more efficient production of goods and services. Machines can be trained to perform a wide range of non-routine cognitive tasks, and advanced robotics can increasingly perform manual tasks. Society as a whole will benefit from increased productivity and lower costs, but many individual workers will be adversely affected. Research indicates that on the order of half of today’s workers are in industries vulnerable to disruption in the near term.  In some cases – truck drivers – machines will replace workers. In other fields – education and medicine – work will be transformed, with machines assuming some tasks in close coordination with skilled humans performing other tasks. Will well-paying “cognitive” jobs be lost to automation?Many well-paying “cognitive” jobs are vulnerable to disruption, perhaps more over time than the well-paying factory jobs that were lost to globalization. A wide range of vulnerable occupations traditionally filled by well-educated, well-paid workers includes tax preparers, radiologists, paralegals, loan underwriters, insurance adjusters, financial analysts, translators, and even some journalists and software engineers. How can humans and machines work together for greater efficiency and productivity?One example is medical diagnosis. A diagnosis is a determination of how information on a patient fits into a pattern characteristic of a disease. This is something machines do well. Machines trained with the digital records and outcomes of millions of previous patients can produce a diagnosis for a sick patient, along with recommendations for treatment and perhaps further tests. Machines can take into account far more data and keep up with the latest research better than any doctor. The doctor’s primary role would be to convey the outcome to the patient, and help the patient understand and accept it, so the patient follows through with the treatment plan.Research indicates that in many fields, the best results will come from humans supported by intelligent machines – a combination of a doctor and a machine, a teacher and a machine, etc. In the workplace of the near future, machines would continue to do the computational work they do well, while leaving other tasks to humans who see the big picture and have interpersonal skills. How is the artificial intelligence revolution different from 20th–century labor and tech disruptions?One big difference is the rate of change. The transition from manual labor to steam power, and the subsequent transition from steam to electricity, played out over decades. The mechanization of agriculture took a generation, so it was sufficient to educate the children of farmers with the new skills necessary for new occupations. Today the changes are coming so fast that many workers themselves will need to learn new skills for new jobs.Another problem concerns inequality. Advancing technology increases national wealth and income, and the GDP grows. But these benefits are distributed unevenly. This growing inequality is a continuation of a long-term trend. According to Census Bureau data, median household income is about what it was in 1999, while GDP is up 38 percent. Most of the gains have gone to the upper end. The spread of automation contributes to this growing inequality in wealth and income.Consider tax preparation software. A lot of people benefit because it is cheap and easy and they can do their taxes themselves. But many people who earned their living as tax preparers now find their jobs and income threatened. How can society best protect workers and prepare them for this new future?The challenge is to facilitate transitions to new occupations with new skills.In addition, new jobs will be created even as traditional jobs disappear.  Over the 200 years since the Luddite rebellion, a movement led by workers in 19th-century England who opposed the introduction of weaving technology, gains in productivity through advancing technology have led over time to new industries and new jobs. That could continue, or this time could be different.In addition, there are more than 6 million job openings unfilled today, according to the Department of Labor. Employers cannot find qualified candidates for many well-paying jobs, which means there are potential opportunities for displaced workers with appropriate training.These new jobs will not necessarily be in nearby locations, nor are they likely to pay as well, at least initially. New jobs require new skills.Some advocate a guaranteed basic income. My view is that there is no shortage of work that needs to be done. Money is not the only thing; a sense of self-worth and standing in the community are also important. So, rather than pay people not to work, better to support transitions to new jobs.The existing adjustment assistance program did not do much to counter the impact of job losses attributed to globalization; it could be expanded to provide income and assistance for training and relocation for layoffs due to automation as well as foreign competition.Finally, the rapid pace of change reinforces the benefit of a habit of life-long education. Community colleges and internet courses provide low-cost education and training on a wide variety of subjects.

And no one is in a better place to figure out how than Kriti Sharma, Vice President of AI at SAGE, and one of Forbes' 30 Under 30.""When I was 15, I got some exposure to a government research facility where a scientist could use his voice to make a computer do something,"" Sharma tells Bustle. ""That was magical for me. How awesome would it be if I had my own personal machine that could understand my voice?"" Fourteen years later, interconnected smart homes powered by AI are becoming an increasingly mainstream use of technology. But for those who haven't adopted AI's ubiquity, the technology can still be a scary thing. And that is an unfounded bias Sharma hopes to address in her work. ""Either we get too scared and don't really embrace the benefits, or we start to become sensible and get past the hype.""To start this process, Sharma thinks we need to change the way we think about and design AI. For one, we need to understand that it isn't there to replace humans. It's there to make life easier — but often it's gone in different directions. ""Take Slack,"" she tells Bustle. ""It's supposed to raise productivity by reducing the amount of time we spend on email; but it turns out we are spending more time on Slack than we were on email. We’re realizing that we’ve got to think about humans in the design process, not about products."" Courtesy of Kriti Sharma & SAGEBut it's not just about how AI is used; it's about how it's created. Sharma is a prominent advocate for ethical AI and diversity in artificial intelligence in general, because what we put into AI shapes what we get out of it, and if it learns prejudice — even unintentionally — it's going to replicate that in the world. Most artificial intelligence at the moment, from basic chatbots and autocorrect to bigger projects like IBM's Watson, is based on a process called machine learning, where systems learn and develop based on all the new information they encounter. Think about how Google search fills in your searches, or Alexa gets to know your preferences. The problem? Machine learning without boundaries isn't necessarily a good thing.""Just like you would teach children values, AI needs to be given a set of values, too,"" Sharma tells Bustle. ""It’s important because AI learns on its own."" If not, you can see the same kind of regressive bias that humans are prone to in AI — which has happened across different platforms, from chatbots that learned racist behavior from its interactions, to photo-tagging systems that weren't trained to recognize non-caucasian skin tones.But, Sharma says, ""it’s not just the data; it’s also the design."" She cites the fact that most personalized AI assistants, like Siri or Alexa, are designed to sound female. Male-coded AIs, by contrast, tend to be business-focused, like IBM's Watson. ""Children are growing up in houses that are powered by smart assistants and learning that it’s OK to bark orders at a female voice without having to say 'sorry', 'thank you', or 'please'."" In a world where AI is becoming more and more powerful, these ingrained biases can be potentially damaging.Alex Wong/Getty Images News/Getty ImagesSo how do we fix it? Design it ethically from the beginning, says Sharma. ""One of the biggest reasons we have these problems,"" she tells Bustle, ""is that when you don’t have diversity it’s hard to build diverse products."" More women and minority at the table from the beginning, Sharma believes, will make better products — and more inclusive data sets for AIs to learn from. The future of AI, according to this vision, doesn't necessarily involve robots taking over human jobs. ""It’s not about replacing the human advisor; it’s about giving them help,"" she says. But she does believe that everybody should get the chance to get involved with AI, from the ground up. ""There are so many opportunities for people, from freelancers to small business owners, who can benefit from it,"" says Sharma. ""I want to give everybody the power to benefit from this technology and also design it in a very diverse way."" Whether you're a blogger or part of a big company, expect AI to be coming to help out soon.

In the 1980s he led efforts that allowed machines to reason probabilistically. Now he’s one of the field’s sharpest critics. In his latest book, The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect, he argues that artificial intelligence has been handicapped by an incomplete understanding of what intelligence really is.Three decades ago, a prime challenge in artificial-intelligence research was to program machines to associate a potential cause to a set of observable conditions. Pearl figured out how to do that using a scheme called Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks made it practical for machines to say that, given a patient who returned from Africa with a fever and body aches, the most likely explanation was malaria. In 2011 Pearl won the Turing Award, computer science’s highest honor, in large part for this work.But as Pearl sees it, the field of AI got mired in probabilistic associations. These days, headlines tout the latest breakthroughs in machine learning and neural networks. We read about computers that can master ancient games and drive cars. Pearl is underwhelmed. As he sees it, the state of the art in artificial intelligence today is merely a souped-up version of what machines could already do a generation ago: find hidden regularities in a large set of data. “All the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting,” he said recently.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

The ongoing, and sometimes loud, debate about how many and what kinds of jobs smart machines will leave for humans to do in the future is missing a salient point: Just as the automation of human work in the past allowed people and machines to do many things that couldn’t be done before, groups of people and computers working together will be able to do many things in the future that neither can do alone now.
To think about how this will happen, it’s useful to contemplate an obvious but not widely appreciated fact. Virtually all human achievements — from developing written language to making a turkey sandwich — require the work of groups of people, not just lone individuals. Even the breakthroughs of individual geniuses like Albert Einstein aren’t conjured out of thin air; they are erected on vast amounts of prior work by others.
The human groups that accomplish all these things can be described as superminds. I define a supermind as a group of individuals acting together in ways that seem intelligent.
Superminds take many forms. They include the hierarchies in most businesses and other organizations; the markets that help create and exchange many kinds of goods and services; the communities that use norms and reputations to guide behavior in many professional, social, and geographical groups; and the democracies that are common in governments and some other organizations.
All superminds have a kind of collective intelligence, an ability to do things that the individuals in the groups couldn’t have done alone. What’s new is that machines can increasingly participate in the intellectual, as well as the physical, activities of these groups. That means we will be able to combine people and machines to create superminds that are smarter than any groups or individuals our planet has ever known.
To do that, we need to understand how people and computers can work together more effectively on tasks that require intelligence. And for that, we need to define intelligence.

What Is Intelligence?
The concept of intelligence is notoriously slippery, and different people have defined it in different ways. For our purposes, let’s say that intelligence involves the ability to achieve goals. And since we don’t always know what goals an individual or group is trying to achieve, let’s say that whether an entity “seems” intelligent depends on what goals an observer attributes to it.
Based on these assumptions, we can define two kinds of intelligence. The first is specialized intelligence, which is the ability to achieve specific goals effectively in a given environment. This means that an intelligent entity will do whatever is most likely to help it achieve its goals, based on everything it knows. Stated even more simply, specialized intelligence is “effectiveness” at achieving specific goals. In this sense, then, specialized collective intelligence is “group effectiveness,” and a supermind is an effective group.
The second kind of intelligence is more broadly useful and often more interesting. It is general intelligence, which is the ability to achieve a wide range of different goals effectively in different environments. This means that an intelligent actor needs not only to be good at a specific kind of task but also to be good at learning how to do a wide range of tasks. In short, this definition of intelligence means roughly the same thing as “versatility” or “adaptability.” In this sense, then, general collective intelligence means “group versatility” or “group adaptability,” and a supermind is a versatile or adaptable group.
What Kind of Intelligence Do Computers Have?
The distinction between specialized intelligence and general intelligence helps clarify the difference between the abilities of today’s computers and human abilities. Some artificially intelligent computers are far smarter than people in terms of certain kinds of specialized intelligence. But one of the most important things most people don’t realize about AI today is that it is all very specialized.1
Google’s search engine is great at retrieving news articles about baseball games, for example, but it can’t write an article about your son’s Little League game. IBM’s Watson beats humans at Jeopardy!, but the program that played Jeopardy! can’t play tic-tac-toe, much less chess.2 Teslas can (sort of) drive themselves, but they can’t pick up a box from a warehouse shelf.
Of course, there are computer systems that can do these other things. But the point is that they are all different, specialized programs, not a single general AI that can figure out what to do in each specific situation. Humans, with their general intelligence, must write programs that contain rules for solving different specific problems, and humans must decide which programs to run in a given situation.
In fact, none of today’s computers are anywhere close to having the level of general intelligence of any normal human 5-year-old. No single computer today can converse sensibly about the vast number of topics an ordinary 5-year-old can, not to mention the fact that the child can also walk, pick up weirdly shaped objects, and recognize when people are happy, sad, or angry.
How soon, if ever, will this change? Progress in the field of artificial intelligence has been notoriously difficult to predict ever since its early days in the 1950s. When researchers Stuart Armstrong and Kaj Sotala analyzed 95 predictions made between 1950 and 2012 about when general AI would be achieved, they found a strong tendency for both experts and nonexperts to predict that it would be achieved between 15 and 25 years in the future — regardless of when the predictions were made.3 In other words, general AI has seemed about 20 years away for the last 60 years.
More recent surveys and interviews tend to be consistent with this long-term pattern: People still predict that general AI will be here in about 15 to 25 years.4 So while we certainly don’t know for sure, there is good reason to be skeptical of confident predictions that general AI will appear in the next couple of decades. My own view is that, barring some major societal disasters, it is very likely that general AI will appear someday, but probably not until quite a few decades in the future.
All uses of computers will need to involve humans in some way until then. In many cases today, people are doing parts of a task that machines can’t do. But even when a computer can do a complete task by itself, people are always involved in developing the software and usually modifying it over time. They also decide when to use different programs in different situations and what to do when things go wrong.
How Can People and Computers Work Together?
One of the most intriguing possibilities for how people and computers can work together comes from an analogy with how the human brain is structured. There are many different parts of the brain that specialize in different kinds of processing, and these parts somehow work together to produce the overall behavior we call intelligence. For instance, one part of the brain is heavily involved in producing language, another in understanding language, and still another in processing visual information. Marvin Minsky, one of the fathers of AI, called this architecture a “society of mind.”5
Minsky was primarily interested in how human brains worked and how artificial intelligence programs might be developed, but his analogy also suggests a surprisingly important idea for how superminds consisting of both people and computers might work: Long before we have general AI, we can create more and more collectively intelligent systems by building societies of mind that include both humans and machines, each doing part of the overall task.
In other words, instead of having computers try to solve a whole problem by themselves, we can create cyber-human systems where multiple people and machines work together on the same problem. In some cases, the people may not even know — or care — whether they are interacting with another human or a machine. People can supply the general intelligence and other skills that machines don’t have. The machines can supply the knowledge and other capabilities that people don’t have. And, together, these systems can act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has done before.
How is this different from current thinking about AI? Many people today assume that computers will eventually do most things by themselves and that we should put “humans in the loop” in situations where people are still needed.6 But it’s probably more useful to realize that most things now are done by groups of people, and we should put computers into these groups in situations where that is helpful. In other words, we should move away from thinking about putting humans in the loop to putting computers in the group.
What Roles Will Computers Play Relative to Humans?
If you want to use computers as part of human groups in your business or other organization, what roles should computers play in those groups? Thinking about the roles that people and machines play today, there are four obvious possibilities. People have the most control when machines act only as tools; and machines have successively more control as their roles expand to assistants, peers, and, finally, managers.
Tools
A physical tool, like a hammer or a lawn mower, provides some capability that a human doesn’t have alone — but the human user is directly in control at all times, guiding its actions and monitoring its progress. Information tools are similar. When you use a spreadsheet, the program is doing what you tell it to do, which often increases your specialized intelligence for a task like financial analysis.
But many of the most important uses of automated tools in the future won’t be to increase individual users’ specialized intelligence, but to increase a group’s collective intelligence by helping people communicate more effectively with one another. Even today, computers are largely used as tools to enhance human communication. With email, mobile applications, the web in general, and sites such as Facebook, Google, Wikipedia, Netflix, YouTube, and Twitter, we’ve created the most massively connected groups the world has ever known. In all these cases, computers are not doing much “intelligent” processing; they are primarily transferring information created by humans to other humans.
While we often overestimate the potential of AI, I think we often underestimate the potential power of this kind of hyperconnectivity among the 7 billion or so amazingly powerful information processors called human brains that are already on our planet.









Assistants
A human assistant can work without direct attention and often takes initiative in trying to achieve the general goals someone else has specified. Automated assistants are similar, but the boundary between tools and assistants is not always a sharp one. Text-message platforms, for instance, are mostly tools, but they sometimes take the initiative and autocorrect your spelling (occasionally with hilarious results).
Another example of an automated assistant is the software used by the online clothing retailer Stitch Fix Inc., based in San Francisco, California, to help its human stylists recommend items to customers.7 Stitch Fix customers fill out detailed questionnaires about their style, size, and price preferences, which are digested by machine-learning algorithms that select promising items of clothing.
The algorithmic assistant in this partnership is able to take into account far more information than human stylists can. For instance, jeans are often notoriously hard to fit, but the algorithms are able to select for each customer a variety of jeans that other customers with similar measurements decided to keep.
And it is the stylists who make the final selection of five items to send to the customer in each shipment. The human stylists are able to take into account information the Stitch Fix assistant hasn’t yet learned to deal with — such as whether the customer wants an outfit for a baby shower or a business meeting. And, of course, they can relate to customers in a more personal way than the assistant does. Together, the combination of people and computers provides better service than either could alone.
Peers
Some of the most intriguing uses of computers involve roles in which they operate as human peers more than assistants or tools, even in cases where there isn’t much actual artificial intelligence being used. For example, if you are a stock trader, you may already be transacting with an automated program trading system without knowing it.
And if your job is dealing with claims for Lemonade Insurance Agency LLC, based in New York City, you already have an automated peer named AI Jim.8 AI Jim is a chatbot, and Lemonade’s customers file claims by exchanging text messages with it. If the claim meets certain parameters, AI Jim pays it automatically and almost instantly. If not, AI Jim refers the claim to one of its human peers, who completes the job.
Managers
Human managers delegate tasks, give directions, evaluate work, and coordinate others’ efforts. Machines can do all these things, too, and when they do, they are performing as automated managers. Even though some people find the idea of a machine as a manager threatening, we already live with mechanical managers every day: A traffic light directs drivers; an automated call router delivers work to call center employees. Most people don’t find either situation threatening or problematic.
It’s likely that there will be many more examples of machines playing the role of managers in the future. For instance, the CrowdForge system crowdsources complex tasks such as writing documents. In one experiment, the system used online workers (recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk online marketplace) to write encyclopedia articles.9 For each article, the system first asked an online worker to come up with an outline for the article. Then it asked other workers to find relevant facts for each section in the outline. Next it asked still other workers to write coherent paragraphs using those facts. Finally, it assembled the paragraphs into a complete article. Interestingly, independent readers judged the articles written in this manner to be better than articles written by a single person.

How Can Computers Help Superminds Be Smarter?
If you want to design a supermind (like a company or a team) that can act intelligently, it needs to have some or all of the five cognitive processes that intelligent entities have — whether they are individuals or groups. Your supermind will need to create possibilities for action, decide which actions to take, sense the external world, remember the past, and learn from experience. (See “The Basic Cognitive Processes Needed by Any Intelligent Entity.”)



The Basic Cognitive Processes Needed by Any Intelligent Entity
Entities that act intelligently (such as people, computers, and groups) need to do these things:




Computers can help do all these things in new ways that often — but, of course, not always — make the superminds smarter. To see how, let’s consider how a large corporation like Procter & Gamble could develop a new strategic plan. The possibilities we’ll discuss are just that: possibilities. I have no reason to believe that P&G is doing these things at present. But I think that P&G and many other companies are likely to do things like this in the future.
Today, corporate strategic planning in large companies usually involves a relatively small group of people, mostly senior executives, their staff, and perhaps some outside consultants. But what if we could use technology to involve far more people and let machines do some of the thinking?
Create
As we saw above, one of the most important roles for computers is as a communication tool that allows much larger groups of people to think together productively. A promising approach for doing that within the strategic planning process is to use a family of related online contests, called a contest web.10 There could be separate online contests for strategies at different levels of the organization. For example, if P&G used this approach, the company might have separate contests for each brand, such as Pantene shampoo, Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Tide laundry detergent. It could also have separate contests for how to combine the strategies of the brands in each business unit, such as hair care and fabric care. And the company could have another contest aimed at combining the business unit strategies into an overall corporate strategy.
Each contest could be open to many company employees, perhaps all of them. Anyone in the contest could propose a strategic option, and others could comment on or help develop the idea. Eventually there would be one winning strategy chosen in each challenge, but during the planning process, it would be important to consider a number of different options.
Opening this process to lots of people could allow surprising new options to arise. For instance, a group of young, tech-savvy employees, who would never have been included in a traditional corporate strategic-planning process, might propose a new cosmetics concept involving skin and eye makeup specially formulated for individual customers who upload selfies to the website.
Decide
One benefit of involving more people in generating strategic possibilities is that you get far more possibilities. But deciding which possibilities are most promising requires evaluating them all, and new technologies also make it easier to involve far more people and more kinds of expertise in evaluating. For instance, P&G might want its manufacturing engineers to evaluate whether it is technically feasible to make a product, its operations managers to estimate manufacturing cost, and perhaps outside market researchers to predict the demand for the product at different price points.
In some cases, it may be worth combining many people’s opinions about some of these questions. For instance, P&G might use online prediction markets to estimate the demand for products. Such markets have already been used to successfully predict movie box-office receipts, winners of U.S. presidential elections, and many other things. Somewhat like futures markets, prediction markets let people buy and sell “shares” of predictions about future events. For instance, if you believe that global sales for Pantene shampoo will be between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion per year, you could buy a share of this prediction. If the prediction is right, then you will get, say, $1 for each share you own of that prediction. But if your predictions are wrong, you will get nothing.11 That means the resulting price in the prediction market is essentially an estimate of the probability that sales will be in this range.12
Sense
A key necessity for developing good strategic plans is the ability to effectively sense what is going on in the external world: What do customers want now? What are our competitors doing? What new technologies might change our industry? By far the most visible means for improving sensing today are big data and data analytics.
For example, P&G might analyze the positive and negative comments about its products in online social networks to gauge how customer sentiment about the products is changing. It might conduct online experiments at different prices for the products. And it might be able to obtain early warnings about sales changes by installing video and touch-sensitive floors in retail stores to analyze how much time customers spend looking at P&G’s products versus competitors’ products.
P&G might even be able to do something Amazon.com Inc. has already done: use vast amounts of data to develop detailed models of many parts of its business, such as customers’ responses to prices, ads, and recommendations, and sort out how supply-chain costs vary with inventory policies, delivery methods, and warehouse locations.13 With tools like these, computers can take over much of the quantitative work of strategic planning by running the numbers, and people can use their general intelligence to do more qualitative analysis.
Remember
Another way technology can help superminds create better strategic plans is by helping them remember good ideas that others have had in similar situations. For example, software assistants embedded in an application for generating strategy proposals could automatically suggest generic strategies, such as the following:

Integrating forward by taking on some of the tasks done by your customers, or integrating backward by taking on some of the tasks done by your suppliers;
Outsourcing more of the things you do internally to freelancers or specialized providers;
Moving into related market segments, nearby geographical regions, or other markets frequented by your customers.
When you pick one of these options, the system could then automatically provide a template including the kinds of details necessary for that type of strategy.

By remembering good strategies from other settings, software assistants could help generate new strategies for your setting. For instance, if the strategy of using selfies to customize cosmetics were successful, a software assistant could suggest similar strategies that let customers use smartphones to customize P&G’s other products: shampoos, toothpastes, laundry detergents, potato chips, and others. Of course, many of these combinations would be silly or impractical and could be very quickly eliminated, but some might be surprisingly useful. And even silly options sometimes give rise to good ideas.
For instance, in the early 2000s, P&G developed a process for printing entertaining pictures and words on Pringles potato chips.14 An approach like this might have led to another promising idea: using this technology to let customers buy Pringles that are preprinted with images that customers specify themselves.
Learn
If a system is used over time, it can help a supermind learn from its own experience to become more and more effective. For example, it might help recognize strategic ideas that most people wouldn’t recognize in their early stages. In the 1970s, when Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were first playing around with what we now call personal computers, most people had no idea that these strange, awkward devices would turn out to be among the most innovative and influential products of the next several decades.
It’s certainly not easy to rapidly filter ideas without missing these diamonds in the rough. But perhaps it’s possible to identify the unusual people who do have this skill by systematically tracking over time how accurately, and how early, people predict technological advances and other kinds of breakthroughs. Then we could ask these people to take a second look at some of the “crazy” ideas that we might otherwise reject.
Another intriguing possibility is to use “learning loops” that begin with human experts evaluating strategies manually and then gradually automate more and more of the work as the machines get better at predicting what human experts would do.
In a company like P&G that generally tries to compete on quality rather than price, experts evaluating product strategies usually reject those that emphasize competing on low price. But instead of programmers writing programs that explicitly filter out low-price strategies, a machine-learning program might recognize that experts often reject these types of strategies and start suggesting this action. If the experts agree with the suggestion enough times, then the program might stop asking and just do the filtering automatically.
A Cyber-Human Strategy Machine
You might call the kind of strategic planning process I’ve described above a cyber-human strategy machine.15 Given how complex such a system could be and how generic much of the work would be, it seems unlikely that companies would develop proprietary systems for this purpose. Instead, today’s consulting firms, or their future competitors, might provide much of this functionality as a service. Such a strategy-machine company, for instance, could have a stable of people at many levels of expertise on call who could rapidly generate and evaluate various strategic possibilities, along with software to automate some parts of the process and help manage the rest.
In the long run, such a strategy machine might use a supermind of people and computers to generate and evaluate millions of possible strategies for a single company. Computers would do more and more of the work over time, but people would still be involved in parts of the process. The result would be a handful of the most promising strategic options that the human managers of the company would choose among.
The examples we’ve just discussed are focused on strategic decision-making, but what we’ve really seen is an architecture for general purpose, problem-solving superminds: Computers use their specialized intelligence to solve parts of the problem, people use their general intelligence to do the rest, and computers help engage and coordinate far larger groups of people than has ever been possible.
As new technologies make this easier, we are likely to see many more examples of human-computer superminds being used to solve all kinds of business and societal problems — not just corporate strategic plans, but also designs for new houses, smartphones, factories, cities, educational systems, antiterrorism approaches, and medical treatment plans. The possibilities are virtually unlimited.

These days you can’t throw a rock without hitting some pundit prognosticating on the millions of jobs that will be lost from AI. One oft-cited Oxford University study predicted 47% of jobs are in jeopardy.

But while AI conjures up robots and dystopian science fiction movies, it isn’t magic. Today’s AI consists of algorithms developed with “training data” that improve over time, otherwise known as machine learning. The result is better pattern recognition, as when Google seems to predict what you’re searching for after typing a few letters. What it ultimately means is automation of the information economy in the same way that the industrial revolution changed manufacturing. Any job that involves processing or manipulating information in a repeatable or even predictable way is a job that probably will be automated by AI and its kissing cousin robotic process automation (“RPA”).
Colleges and universities have lots of jobs like this. Not in the classroom, mind you; teaching and learning have a relatively low level of repeatability. But keep in mind that only $0.21 out of every tuition dollar is actually spent on instruction. That leaves a lot of repeatable processes that AI will automate. Nevertheless, what we’re seeing so far suggests predictions of massive job losses in higher education are overblown.
PROMOTED
An article last month in the Chronicle of Higher Education focused on how UT Austin is utilizing AI to monitor and adjust landscape sprinkler systems. The entirely uncontroversial result is not job cuts, but rather a huge improvement in water conservation and concomitant cost savings. Then there’s admissions. Reviewing college applications is a highly repeatable process, particularly at the top of the admissions funnel. University of Arizona’s Dean of Undergraduate Admissions has commented that AI won’t be used to “count anybody out automatically,” but will rather “help to enhance” the admissions staff make good matches. No mention of any plans to reduce admissions staff.

When it comes to interacting with students, we’re seeing a similar pattern: AI isn’t displacing workers, but rather enhancing student experience by filling current gaps in the service offering. In the enrollment and financial aid processes, the Chronicle profiled Georgia State’s use of AI chatbot AdmitHub (a University Ventures portfolio company) to respond to enrollment and financial aid questions. Tim Renick, GSU’s dynamic VP for Enrollment Management and Student Success, says that in the run-up to the start of each semester, his team can receive as many as 2,000 calls a day. That’s volume GSU cannot handle: “We’re not American Express. We don’t have a call center with 200 people.” AdmitHub’s chatbot allows students to ask any question at all hours. The technology takes a statistical approach to responding to questions. If it’s less than 95% certain of the answer, it connects the student to a human staff member. As you might expect, AdmitHub gets smarter with each question. In its first summer at GSU, AdmitHub answered 200,000 questions and successfully reduced summer melt by 20%.
In addition, AdmitHub founder Drew Magliozzi points out that by addressing simple questions, AI technology integrated into college systems can trigger a staff member to reach out for a human-to-human conversation: “The death of a parent, financial struggles, depression, and many other challenges require time and care. These conversations are the reason most got into the field in the first place. And thanks to the AI, they can talk to a student for an hour without worrying their inbox will be overflowing when they’re done.”

Another area of great promise is the online discussion board. Anyone who’s been in an online discussion for a large lecture course will tell you they’re unproductive and tedious at the best of times. Neither faculty nor teaching assistants are incentivized or able to provide the requisite level of structure, guidance, and feedback to keep every thread moving towards a productive educational outcome. That’s where Packback Questions comes in. Packback (a University Ventures portfolio company) is an AI-powered tool that picks up where the humanoids leave off. Its algorithms coach students to improve responses and to ask more thought-provoking questions, sparking better discussion and critical thinking. Packback also provides recommendations to faculty on how to further improve student engagement.

It seems likely that students will find themselves engaging with more bots. Georgia State has now enrolled students who are wondering “Where did the chatbot go? I still want to ask it questions.” Across town at Georgia Tech, one faculty member has already utilized a bot (“Jill Watson”) as a teaching assistant without telling students. Said the faculty member, “I don’t intend to put myself out of business. I think of this as improving teaching quality… [not] decreasing teaching quantity.”
While higher education may not see major job losses, there’s little question that entire job categories in other sectors of the economy (e.g., data entry, tax preparation) will go the way of bowling alley pin setters. However, for most of us in the labor market, AI won’t result in job loss, but rather significant changes in what we do every day. McKinsey has estimated that AI will automate 30% of tasks in about 60% of jobs. This means most of us will need to use AI technology in the same way as we currently use non-AI software and SaaS platforms to do our jobs. As configuring and managing AI software – and interpreting data output – will be more complex than using Word or Salesforce, this means upskilling will be required for most jobs, primarily a higher level of cognitive and technical skills.
And so while AI should allow colleges and universities to become more efficient and effective in supplying higher education, it will also shift the demand curve for postsecondary education to the right. With greater demand for cognitive and technical skills, colleges and universities will have a golden opportunity to reassert their preeminence in human capital development.
But just as the impact on the broader economy will be uneven, AI will result in some dislocation in higher education. Specifically, it will be a harder road for disciplines that cannot seriously and credibly claim to further skills in managing software. That’s what employers will expect. And as the drumbeat of AI gets louder and louder over the next decade, these requirements will become gospel to guidance counselors, parents, and applicants alike. Carnegie Mellon’s new bachelor’s degree in AI (the first of its kind) is an obvious early winner. But any program or pathway that builds skills at or close to the human-machine interface central to the coming AI revolution will thrive. Adding software + data to work yields a multidisciplinarity that will resonate across every profession and every area of study. Those who opt to remain on the periphery – regardless of how much they claim to foster core cognitive or creative skills – are likely to wither.
A Northeastern-Gallup survey released in January showed that only 22% of current workers with bachelor’s degrees or higher think their own education has prepared them to work with AI. Meanwhile, only 43% are confident they can obtain the education they’ll need. Some of that is undoubtedly concern about affordability, but it probably also reflects worries about availability. The response from America’s colleges and universities can’t be “more of the same.”
The reason there’s often a fine line between hero and villain is that some heroes are disruptive. And for the sector charged with cultivating natural intelligence, artificial intelligence will be a hero, albeit a very disruptive one.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Ryan CraigFollowingFollowAuthor of Apprentice Nation: How the ""Earn and Learn"" Alternative to Higher Education Will Create a Stronger and Fairer America.

An Information Communication Technology (ICT) expert, Mr Adede Williams, says the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will ease the difficulty involved in doing businesses in the country.
Williams, who is President of Association of Telecommunications Professionals of Nigeria (APTN), stated this in an interview with on Thursday in Abuja.      
He spoke at the backdrop of the 2018 World Telecommunication and Information Society Day, with “Enabling the Positive Use of Artificial Intelligence for All’’ as theme.
Artificial Intelligence is an aspect of Computer Science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react, like humans.
Williams said that the theme for the year was apt and carefully selected by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), adding that the positive use of AI was a powerful message to the public.
He said that AI could be used in all sectors of the economy as it made the job easier and effective.      
“When you look at what is happening these days, artificial intelligence is what is actually taking care of a lot of things.
“For instance, you can use AI in the marine, oil sector and a lot of other things as there are some places that human intelligence cannot reach, but artificial intelligence would do that.
“So everything is boiling down to AI and that is why the United Nation (UN) says it is important for us to develop more on artificial intelligence as it makes the job easier, ‘’ he said.  
Williams debunked the claim that a lot of people would lose their jobs with the introduction of AI, saying instead, it would make jobs easier and effective.
