'Crowdworking' provides the humans who train artificial intelligence

                                        by Melissa Hellmann

Eager to make extra money on the side, Washington, D.C., resident Paula Alves Silva turned to a gig emblematic of the digital age: She recorded sentences read aloud in the comfort of her home to help train artificial intelligence (AI) software.





Silva completed the tasks in her native Portuguese tongue for Seattle-based startup DefinedCrowd, which develops machine learning algorithms that power products for businesses including heavyweights MasterCard and BMW. Such recordings could be used in voice recognition products introduced in new countries, or to train existing systems to recognize non-native speakers or regional accents, the company says.
Silva earned $20—from 8 to 33 cents per sentence—and considered that satisfactory given the short amount of time it took to complete the tasks. The knowledge that her task would contribute to a new artificial intelligence system was a bonus, she said.
When voice-activated software such as Amazon's Alexa responds to the simple command of calling Mom, thousands of global workers have helped train the software to ensure that, say, Tom from work isn't dialed instead. The workers transcribe and annotate recordings that are fed back into the software to improve Alexa's human speech recognition (sometimes using recordings from unaware consumers, according to Bloomberg).
The rise of AI in the age of the gig economy has ushered in an invisible workforce in which ordinary people, like Silva, train technology to be smarter.
Created in 2015 by CEO and founder Daniela Braga, DefinedCrowd is one of many companies that use so-called crowdworking to teach tech devices how to follow commands. Others including Amazon Mechanical Turk, and Figure Eight, formerly known as CrowdFlower, were established over a decade ago.






In the past two years, DefinedCrowd has grown from 20 employees in 2017 to 110 globally. That's not counting the 130,000 people across 60 countries that DefinedCrowd says have worked on its tasks. It calls them the Neevo community and says they can work in 50 different languages.
Not all their tasks involve speech: For instance, if the makers of an autonomous vacuum want their machines to clean a living room without running into objects, crowdworkers would annotate the different objects in images of living rooms. Those annotated images would then be used as training data to teach the machines precision, said DefinedCrowd spokeswoman Catarina Salteiro.
""You can think of us as the gasoline of a car,"" said Salteiro. ""You'll put good gas in there to make sure that it's working properly.""
To complete tasks for DefinedCrowd, workers register with their email or social media account on the company's web platform or the recently launched app. After passing a test based on a skill set such as native French fluency, the worker is sent email notifications of available tasks and paid through Paypal at the end of a gig.
Another DefinedCrowd crowdworker, Rakesh Kumar of Delhi, India, said in an email that the recordings he makes in English and Hindi provide a necessary extra income of nearly $10 per month for about six hours of work altogether. It's helpful, although he noted the payment ""is quite less than other freelance work I do.""
A user gets paid only if their work is high quality and matches the requirements. Several members of the Neevo community tweeted at DefinedCrowd that they hadn't gotten paid yet, nor received notifications of new tasks in a while. ""You guys have not paid many completed tasks and the site seems to be down,"" wrote one user in December.
The availability of jobs and the skills required for tasks are dependent upon the projects that clients develop, said Salteiro. Certain languages are in a higher demand for tasks than others. ""As we grow our client base, the offer of work on our Neevo platform will increase and more tasks will become available for different languages and at a higher frequency,"" she said.
A 2018 International Labour Organization report found that crowdworkers who complete tasks for sites such as Amazon Mechanical Turk are paid low wages. Based on two surveys of 3,500 crowdworkers in 75 countries, the report found a third of them relied on the tasks as their main source of income. The report concluded that across five online global platforms—Amazon Mechanical Turk, Microworkers, CrowdFlower, Prolific and Clickworker—the average pay per hour amounted to U.S. $4.43 for work considered payable. When accounting for work that was rejected, pay that wasn't received, or the amount of time it took to search for tasks, respondents averaged $3.31 per hour. Similar to Kumar, nearly 90% of the surveys' respondents said they wanted more work than was available, with workers averaging about 25 hours of crowdwork per week.






Labor law professor Charlotte Garden of Seattle University's School of Law considers crowdworking a form of outsourcing work that was once done by company employees. Such arrangements ""can make workers more vulnerable"" by preventing them from advancing into higher roles or enjoying the labor protections that regular employees have, said Garden.
Given the absence of clear guidelines on the treatment of crowdworkers, last week the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) issued a set of ethical recommendations to AI companies on proper pay, privacy and transparency for crowdworkers. In a blog post, it said U.S. crowdworker companies should pay at least the U.S. average minimum wage of $8.50 per hour. Minimum hourly wage in developing countries should be around $4, given the lower prevailing incomes, AI2 recommended. Companies that employ crowdworkers also should be transparent about how long a task will likely take and conditions that may lead to the rejection of work, AI2 urged.
DefinedCrowd is already following the guideline of calculating payment based on the minimum hourly rate of the country where the job is aimed and the estimated time it will take to complete a task, said Salteiro. She wouldn't be more specific about the pay ranges.
The lack of governance mechanisms in crowdworking has St. Louis University employment law professor Miriam Cherry wondering about the end goal in relying on temporary workers to train AI data systems. ""Is it just efficiency for the sake of efficiency ... or is it something that really could help people?""
One answer to Cherry's question could be found in DefinedCrowd's work with Portugal's biggest electricity company, EDP, according to company spokesperson Jorge Simões. Last year, DefinedCrowd's crowdworkers helped the company determine which electricity poles need to be repaired, a once expensive and time-consuming process that required specialists to survey the poles from a helicopter. DefinedCrowd instead devised a machine-learning algorithm to detect defects in poles from images captured by drones and from helicopters.
To create it, crowdworkers identified the type of damage in 900 images of electric poles that were then used to train and test a damage-detection AI system that monitors the state of poles.
EDP was so satisfied with the work that it became an investor in DefinedCrowd last year. The company is now working with DefinedCrowd to create a voice transcription algorithm that works in industrial environments with loud background noise and the use of technical language by service technicians.
To Simões, the work demonstrated that the most difficult tasks could be ""successfully automated, optimizing the final result of the inspection by minimizing human error and visual limitations,"" even if it took human intelligence to get there.

While it's not unimportant, a lot of the groundwork when developing a new fragrance is done by evaluating data, and that's something artificial intelligence is highly qualified to do.

Meet Philyra

Philyra became the artificial intelligence (AI) apprentice IBM created that perfumer David Apel worked alongside to create two new fragrances for Brazilian cosmetics company O Boticário in time for the country's Valentine's Day holiday this year. They were specifically looking for a fragrance to sell to Generation Z and millennials who they knew would be intrigued by a fragrance created by AI. This collaboration officially launched AI into the fragrance industry.

How does Philyra work?

There are 1,300 scent building blocks (synthetic fragrances and extracts from flowers, mosses, spices, and fruits) that are available to a perfumer. Symrise has a database of 1.7 million formulas made from various combinations of these substances, and this database was shared with Philyra. Philyra was also given information about what fragrances sold well among different genders, age groups, and countries. After analyzing the data with a deep-learning algorithm, the AI system (that’s unencumbered with cultural bias, personal preference, knowledge, experience or comfort with a substance) found possibilities that hadn’t been explored previously. From the data, Philyra output perfume formulas that should perform well for a target group. The perfumer stepped in to refine the AI-generated formulas. It’s important to understand that Philyra’s deep-learning algorithm allows it to learn how various ingredients can be combined and is not just acting based on what a human programmed it to do.
PROMOTED
The beauty of the AI analyzing the data and suggesting formulas is it results in formulas that humans had never considered before for whatever reason. Turns out the sense of smell isn't the most critical aspect of creating a new fragrance; it's understanding the perfume's composition. 
AI algorithms can learn and suggest:
·    Novelty of a fragrance by comparing it to commercially available fragrances
·    Raw material substitutes and complements to be used in formulas
·    Dosing of raw material

·    Predict the human response
Philyra, with the help of perfumer David Apel, created three different versions for O Boticário’s Valentine's Day launch—one created entirely by AI, a second where the perfumer made some adjustments and a third where the AI output was used merely as a suggestion, but the final product was the perfumer's own formula. All three were tested, and the “overwhelming majority opted for the 100% AI-generated perfume.”
Egeo ON Me and Egeo ON You, AI fragrances
Philyra’s and Apel’s creations for O Boticário, Egeo ON Me and Egeo ON You, were released this year in time for Brazil’s Valentine’s Day on June 12.
Egeo ON Me is the feminine fragrance, and ON You is the fragrance more typically masculine, however, the company wants each individual, no matter what gender, to select whatever fragrance resonates with them the most. The fragrances combine notes of fruits, flowers, woods, caramel, and even condensed milk.
Machines augmenting the process
As was the case when artificial intelligence was first used in other industries, there are questions in the fragrance industry about the future of human perfumers. Abel, for one, sees artificial intelligence as a collaboration between humans and machines rather than a threat. Free from bias, machines can help humans overcome barriers to creativity and provide novel ideas. In addition, it typically takes six months to four years to develop a new fragrance; using AI, the timeline is dramatically shortened.
The innovation of IBM Research and Symrise may have been the first fragrance house to use AI to develop new combinations, but it certainly won’t be the last. This year, flavor and fragrance company Givaudan unveiled CARTO, a system designed to use the Odors Value Map to maximize olfactory performance in final formulas of flavors and fragrances.
Turns out creating fragrances is an art and a science. Master perfumers still have the emotional advantage over AI, so until that changes, AI will augment human expertise in fragrance development.

The idea of robots taking our jobs is not radically new. 
But artificial intelligence (AI) is now completely reorganising the global economy. Some estimates of productivity-driven economic growth conclude that AI will contribute approximately $US16 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

      When AI meets your shopping experience it knows what you buy – and what you ought to buy




Unfortunately – compared to the European Union, Japan, United States and United Kingdom – Australia has been relatively late in turning to address the challenges of AI, and creating the right policies to deal with its many implications (good and bad).  
For our economy to thrive, what we need now is the right mix of governance, regulation, civil society participation, industry support and business compliance – as well as the development and deepening of digital literacy throughout Australian communities. 
So how can we make that happen? A report launched today is designed to help. 
Euphoria versus cataclysm
New developments in AI are very different from previous forms of automation. Technologies today are mobile, situationally aware, adaptive and in real-time communication with other intelligent machines.  
Machine learning has been especially important in speeding up the spread and efficacy of AI. Machine learning encompasses smart algorithms that improve their performance unsupervised, often through sorting and classifying big data sets. Applications include weather prediction, medical diagnostics and personalised marketing (such as ads through Facebook). 
Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, said the AI revolution is “unlike anything humankind has experienced before”. 
The consequences of our increasingly automated global world involve a shattering of political orthodoxies. We have to be much more agile and prepared to change fast. Our policies and approaches should allow us to cope with the unexpected, unanticipated shifts coming from the digital revolution.

I have been pondering these massive global changes over the last nine months while working as a member of the Australian Council of Learned Academies Expert Working Group on Artificial Intelligence in Australia. The ACOLA Report, launched today in Canberra, considers the full spectrum of issues arising from AI. 
One big challenge we faced was to distinguish between euphoric and cataclysmic visions of AI. Another big task was to chart the public policy “sea change” arising from AI. Neither challenge was easy to confront.
Leveraging AI for Australia
The ACOLA Report lays out how we can improve Australia’s economic, societal and environmental well-being while taking into account the ethical, legal and social issues linked with AI. 
It highlights the importance of finding a balance between innovation and risk, and how we can weigh up the promise of unprecedented technological transformation of manufacturing, infrastructure and the economy on the one side, and the growing risks of technological unemployment and autonomous weapons (“killer robots”) on the other.

The plan outlined in the report focuses on education, business operations, governance and regulation, social implications, research and skills.
In terms of education, for example, increased automation of routine tasks means people will be freed up in the workplace. This means there’s likely to be an increased demand for employees with strong interpersonal skills and critical thinking. 
The social sciences, humanities and creative arts have a big role to play in promoting ethical AI. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics are vital in advancing the next generation of AI researchers. 
AI will demand new skills and capabilities, and adaptability, in our workforce. Micro-credentialing (a form of education in which “mini-degrees” are achieved in specific subject areas) is likely to become useful for certifying basic education and digital literacy in AI.  
Schools, the vocational education and training (VET) sector and universities should encourage broad-based training and lifelong learning in AI development. 
The ACOLA report also addresses the need for new policy relating to data harvesting and invasions of privacy (for example, involving tech giants Facebook and Google) and geopolitical concerns, especially where the spread of fake news has been powerfully weaponised by Russia and other countries.

Everything to play for
Getting the balance right between opportunity and risk arising from the AI revolution will be essential to the future fabric of Australia. However the ACOLA report is only the start of the process of public engagement – much more needs to be done.  
What is now urgently needed, I think, is a national summit on AI – involving politicians, policymakers, business leaders and industry representatives and people from the broader community. This can help us consider how Australia might best fashion a common framework for the ethical development of AI, both in our country and internationally.
Australia has come to this global policy debate somewhat later than some, but in terms of the AI revolution there’s everything still to play for.

Research suggests kids growing up on Alexa and Google Home think that these devices are smarter than them. But a new kind of summer camp wants kids to know that artificial intelligence (AI) is far from perfect. Welcome to AI Ethics camp. In a classroom on the second floor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, two dozen middle school-aged kids wearing neon green t-shirts sat in clusters around tables. Standing at the front of the room was MIT researcher Blakeley H. Payne, who’s devoted her graduate studies in the Media Lab to the ethics of artificial intelligence. “How many of you use YouTube?” Payne asked.The answer: just about everyone in this class. Some 81% of all parents with children age 11 or younger let their child watch videos on YouTube, with 34% indicating that they allow their child to do this regularly, according to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center. The more you watch, the more YouTube is able to target all kinds of content, including advertising. “Do you ever think about the algorithm behind the ‘Who’s trending’ page?” Payne asked. Most of the kids shook their heads no.This was the first time local STEM organization Empow Studios hosted AI Ethics camp, after partnering with Payne. Empow Studios and Payne want to offer the camp at an affordable cost, so they set it at $150 a week. Payne thinks all kids should not only understand how AI works, but approach its design through an ethical lens. And what better way to introduce that idea than with a favorite sandwich?""At the very beginning, we talk about how algorithms can have different goals and purposes,"" Payne said. ""They make an algorithm to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and then we talk about what is the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich algorithm? And they all have different ideas. Is it the algorithm that makes the tastiest sandwich? Is it the prettiest sandwich, the quickest and easiest to make, the easiest to clean up? And we moved from there into the technical curriculum, so as they're building their machine learning models, they can think, 'Oh wait, what is the goal of my machine learning system?'""The point is that artificial intelligence is a human creation, prone to flaws and biases. A 2018 study by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the Media Lab, found that the facial recognition software of tech giants IBM, Microsoft and Google struggled in detecting the faces of black women. The study suggested that when biased data sets are fed into machine-learning algorithms, they perpetuate inequalities in various pipelines where artificial intelligence is being used, from job recruitment to prison sentences.Read more: Addressing Gender And Racial Bias In Facial Recognition Technology Three days into the camp, 10-year-old Abhinav had already learned that artificial intelligence is not an independent entity.“I thought AI would be, like, a robot that thinks freely on its own. That's what I thought before I came here,"" he said. ""Now I know it's not just something that thinks really on its own, but it's actually something that can recognize things that can help people.” The capstone project for the week is redesigning YouTube. It may sound like a heady undertaking, but Payne says these digital natives are already sharp media consumers.“They have such an ability from a young age to empathize with different stakeholders, to put themselves in other people's shoes,"" she said. ""If you ask them about YouTube, they can exactly explain to you who the recommender algorithm benefits, who it harms and why.”Just ask Saisha, a rising seventh-grader who has already given this issue some thought. She suggests that YouTube implement more rigorous filters to protect kids from inappropriate content.“What I would change is that there would be a heavier filter on content,"" Saisha said. ""They would look not just for what the title says, but the program would run through and if it has any certain negative vocabulary maybe programmed into it, then it could just filter it out.” Payne thinks the way to influence the next generation of programmers and consumers is to teach AI ethics more broadly, in schools across the country.“Because what I don't want to happen is, I don't want the ethics piece to go to an elite few. And then you're just perpetuating these systems of inequality over and over again,” she said. “I love to think about a future where the students in this workshop make up the majority of the people who work in Silicon Valley or the majority of the people who work on Wall Street.”Correction: An earlier version of this story spelled Blakeley H. Payne's first name incorrectly.

 You could be forgiven for thinking that AI will soon replace human physicians based on headlines such as “The AI Doctor Will See You Now,” “Your Future Doctor May Not Be Human,” and “This AI Just Beat Human Doctors on a Clinical Exam.” But experts say the reality is more of a collaboration than an ousting: Patients could soon find their lives partly in the hands of AI services working alongside human clinicians.

  There is no shortage of optimism about AI in the medical community. But many also caution the hype surrounding AI has yet to be realized in real clinical settings. There are also different visions for how AI services could make the biggest impact. And it’s still unclear whether AI will improve the lives of patients or just the bottom line for Silicon Valley companies, health care organizations, and insurers.


  “I think that all our patients should actually want AI technologies to be brought to bear on weaknesses in the health care system, but we need to do it in a non-Silicon Valley hype way,” says Isaac Kohane, a biomedical informatics researcher at Harvard Medical School.


  If AI works as promised, it could democratize health care by boosting access for underserved communities and lowering costs — a boon in the United States, which ranks poorly on many health measures despite an average annual health care cost of $10,739 per person. AI systems could free overworked doctors and reduce the risk of medical errors that may kill tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of U.S. patients each year. And in many countries with national physician shortages, such as China where overcrowded urban hospitals’ outpatient departments may see up to 10,000 people per day, such technologies don’t need perfect accuracy to prove helpful.


  But critics point out that all that promise could vanish if the rush to implement AI tramples patient privacy rights, overlooks biases and limitations, or fails to deploy services in a way that improves health outcomes for most people.


  “In the same way that technologies can close disparities, they can exacerbate disparities,” says Jayanth Komarneni, founder and chair of the Human Diagnosis Project (Human Dx), a public benefit corporation focused on crowdsourcing medical expertise. “And nothing has that ability to exacerbate disparities like AI.”



Today, the most popular AI techniques are machine learning and its younger cousin, deep learning. Unlike computer programs that rigidly follow rules written by humans, both machine learning and deep learning algorithms can look at a dataset, learn from it, and make new predictions. Deep learning in particular can make impressive predictions by discovering data patterns that people might miss.

  But to make the most of these predictions in health care, AI can’t go at it alone. Rather, humans still must help make decisions that can have major health and financial consequences. Because AI systems lack the general intelligence of humans, they can make baffling predictions that could prove harmful if physicians and hospitals unquestioningly follow them.


  The classic example comes from Rich Caruana, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research, as he explained in Engineering and Technology magazine last year. In the 1990s, Caruana worked on a project that tried using an earlier form of machine learning to predict whether a patient with pneumonia was a low-risk or a high-risk case. But trouble arose when the machine learning model tried to predict the case for asthma sufferers, who are high risk because their preexisting breathing difficulties make them vulnerable to pneumonia. The model pegged these patients as low-risk, requiring minor intervention rather than hospitalization — something a human expert never would have done.
If you follow the model blindly, says Kenneth Jung, a research scientist at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, “then you’re hosed. Because the model is saying: ‘Oh, this kid with asthma came in and they got pneumonia but we don’t need to worry about them and we’re sending them home with some antibiotics.’”


  Deep-learning predictions can also fail if they encounter unusual data points, such as unique medical cases, for the first time, or when they learn peculiar patterns in specific datasets that do not generalize well to new medical cases.


  The AI predictions do best when applied to massive datasets, such as in China, which has an advantage in training AI systems thanks to access to large populations and patient data. In February, the journal Nature Medicine published a study from researchers based in San Diego and Guangzhou, China that showed promise in diagnosing many common childhood diseases based on the electronic health records of more than 567,000 children.


  But even large datasets can pose problems, particularly when researchers try to apply their algorithm to a new population. In the Nature Medicine study, all the half million patients came from one medical center in Guangzhou, which means there is no guarantee the diagnostic lessons learned from training on that dataset would apply to pediatric cases elsewhere. Each medical center may attract its own unique set of patients — a hospital known for its cardiovascular center, for instance, may attract more critical heart conditions. And findings from a Guangzhou hospital that mostly attracts ethnic Chinese patients may not translate to one in Shanghai with a higher number of foreign-born, non-Chinese patients.



 


										In this 2017 TEDx Talk, Shinjini Kundu of Johns Hopkins Hospital explains how AI tools have the potential to glean more from medical images than doctors alone can — including predicting diseases before patients show symptoms.									


  This extrapolation will prove difficult in other situations as well. For example, says Marzyeh Ghassemi, a computer scientist and biomedical engineer at the University of Toronto, say you have 40,000 ICU patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center — that’s just one hospital in one city. “And so I have all these papers that have done predictions with this data. Does that work with another hospital in Boston? Maybe. Does it work for a hospital in another state? Would it work in another country? We don’t know.”



While AI models may not work in every case, Ghassemi thinks the technology is still worth exploring. “I am very much in favor of taking these models from the bench to the bedside,” she says, “but with really aggressive precautionary steps.”

  Those steps need to exist throughout AI development and deployment, says I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard University and a leader for the Project on Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, and the Law. This may involve verifying the accuracy and transparency of AI predictions. And during data collection, researchers will also need to protect patient privacy and ask for consent to use patient data for training AI.


  The consent issue comes up again when the AI model is ready for experimental clinical testing with real patients. “Do patients need to be told you’re using the algorithm on them, and does it matter whether the AI is completely guiding care or partly guiding care?” Cohen asks. “There is really very little thinking on these questions.”


  Ghassemi also advocates for frequently auditing AI algorithms to ensure fairness and accuracy across different groups of people based on ethnicity, gender, age, and health insurance. That’s important given how AI applications in other fields have already shown that they can easily pick up biases.


  After all those steps, the people and companies providing AI services will need to sort out legal liability in the case of inevitable mistakes. And unlike most medical devices, which usually need just one regulatory approval, AI services may require additional review whenever they learn from new data.


  Some regulatory agencies are rethinking how to assess health care AI. In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a discussion paper to get public feedback about how to update the relevant regulatory review. “What we are continuously trying to do here is get back to our goal of giving people access to technologies, but we’re also realizing that our current methods don’t quite work well,” says Bakul Patel, director for digital health at the FDA. “That’s why we need to look at a holistic approach of the whole product life cycle.”
In addition to issues surrounding access, privacy, and regulations, it also isn’t clear just who stands to benefit the most from AI health care services. There are already health care disparities: According to the World Bank and the World Health Organization, half of the globe’s population lacks access to essential health care services and nearly 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty by health care expenses. Depending on how it is deployed, AI could either improve these inequalities, or make them worse.

“A lot of the AI discussion has been about how to democratize health care, and I want to see that happening,” says Effy Vayena, a bioethicist at the Federal Institute of Technology in Switzerland.


  “If you just end up with a fancier service provision to those who could afford good health care anyway,” she adds, “I’m not sure if that’s the transformation we’re looking for.”


  How this all plays out depends on the different visions for implementing AI. Early development has focused on very narrow diagnostic applications, such as scrutinizing images for hints of skin cancer or nail fungus, or reading chest X-rays. But more recent efforts have tried to diagnose multiple health conditions at once. 
In August 2018, Moorfields Eye Hospital in the United Kingdom and DeepMind. the London-based AI lab owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, showed that they had successfully trained an AI system to identify more than 50 eye diseases in scans, which matched the performance of leading experts. Similarly broad ambitions drove the San Diego and Guangzhou study that trained AI to diagnosis common ailments among children. The latter wasn’t as good at diagnosing pediatric diseases compared to senior physicians, but it did perform better than some junior physicians.


  Such AI systems may not need to outperform the best human experts to help democratize health care, but simply expand access to current medical standards. Still, so far, many proposed AI applications are focused on improving the current standard of care rather than spreading affordable health care around, Cohen says: “Democratizing what we already have would be a much bigger bang for your buck than improving what we have in many areas.”


  Accenture, a consulting firm, predicts that top AI applications could save the U.S. economy $150 billion per year by 2026. But it’s unclear if patients and health care systems supplemented by taxpayer dollars would benefit, or if more money would simply flow to the tech companies, health care providers, and insurers.


  “The question of who is going to drive this and who is going to pay for this is an important question,” says Kohane. “Something a bit hallucinatory about all those business plans is that they think they know how it will work out.”


  Even if AI services make cost-saving recommendations, human physicians and health care organizations may hesitate to take AI advice if they make less money as a result, Kohane cautions. That speaks to the bigger systemic issue of the U.S. health insurers using a fee-for-service model that often rewards physicians and hospitals for adding tests and medical procedures, even when they aren’t needed.



There is another AI opportunity that could improve the quality of care while still leaving most medical diagnoses in the hands of doctors. In his 2019 book “Deep Medicine,” Eric Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, talks about creating essentially a supercharged medical Siri — an AI assistant to take notes about the interactions between doctors and their patients, enter those notes in electronic health records, and remind physicians to ask about relevant parts of the patient’s history.

  “My aspiration is that we decompress the work of doctors and get rid of their data clerk role, help patients take on more responsibility, and key up the data so it doesn’t take so long to review things,” Topol says.


  That “never-forgetful medical assistant or scribe,” says Kohane, would require AI that can automatically track and transcribe multiple voices between physicians and patients. He supports Topol’s idea, but adds that most AI applications in development don’t seem to be focused on such assistants. Still, some companies such as Saykara and DeepScribe have developed services along these lines, and even Google teamed up with Stanford University to test a similar “digital scribe” technology.


  An AI assistant may sound less exciting than an AI doctor, but it could free up physicians to spend more time with their patients and improve overall quality of care. Family physicians in particular often spend more than half of their working days entering data into electronic health records — a main factor behind physical and emotional burnout, which has dire consequences, including patient deaths.


  Ironically, electronic health records were supposed to improve medical care and cut costs by making patient information more accessible. Now Topol and many other experts pointed to electronic health records as a cautionary tale for the current hype surrounding AI in medicine and health care.
The implementation of electronic health records has already created a patchwork system spread among hundreds of private vendors that mainly succeeds in isolating patient data and makes it inaccessible to both physicians and patients. If history is any guide, many tech companies and health care organizations will feel the pull to follow similar paths by hoarding medical data for their own AI systems.


  One way around this may be to use a collective intelligence system that aggregates and ranks medical expertise from different sources, says Komarneni, who is trying this approach with Human Dx. Backed by major medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, Human Dx has built an online platform for crowdsourcing advice from thousands of physicians on specific medical cases. Komarneni hopes that such a platform could, in theory, also someday include diagnostic advice from many different AI services.


  “In the same way that multiple human professionals might look at your case in the future, there is no reason why multiple AI couldn’t do it,” Komarneni says.


  As doctors wait for their AI helpers, crowdsourcing projects like Human Dx “could definitely lead to improved diagnostics or even improved recommendations for therapy,” says Topol, who coauthored a 2018 study on a similar platform called Medscape Consult. The paper concluded collective human intelligence could be a “competitive or complementary strategy” to AI in medicine.


  But if AI services pass all the tests and real-world checks, they could become significant partners for humans in reshaping modern health care.


  “There are things that machines will never do well, and then others where they’ll be exceeding what any human can do,” Topol says. “So when you put the two together it’s a very powerful package.”

He holds a bachelor's degree in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  McKesson is a large pharmaceutical distributor that delivers health information technology, medical tools and supplies, and care management tools and software to healthcare providers in the United States. The company has been working to incorporate artificial intelligence solutions internally since 2012, but in more recent years they have adopted a few important automation tools.  These tools help them free up white-collar workers to take care of more specific work that only humans can do. Additionally, they help the company make a smooth transition into value-based care, which could result in higher annual savings. In this article, we take a closer look at how McKesson facilitates healthcare AI through investments and building a new digital infrastructure internally. We also explore the tools McKesson is currently using to automate business areas that human employees may not be suitable for.  We discuss the following initiatives: Facilitating AI Inside and Outside the Enterprise:  How McKesson helps AI firms develop healthcare applications they are interested in, such as Komodo Health. How the company makes it easier for all their employees to access and make better use of the AI tools they currently use. Internal AI Initiatives for White-Collar Automation and Finance Management: McKesson’s partnership with Genpact that allows them to automate numerous white-collar processes Their acquiring of Change Healthcare and how their predictive analytics software helps discern reimbursement rates for value-based care. We begin our exploration of McKesson’s current AI initiatives with their investment in Komodo Health and adoption of the Google Cloud platform as flexible digital architecture. Facilitating AI Inside and Outside the Enterprise McKesson has made changes to allow their business to more easily adapt to new AI technologies. Their move to the Google Cloud platform is perhaps their most important change in recent years, because it enables faster implementation of new AI tools across all business areas.   Additionally, they look to smaller companies in the healthcare AI market to invest in so that they may have even more useful applications in the future. This is emphasized by their investment in newer companies with which they can build a relationship with early and possibly influence their approach to making their AI products. Investing in Komodo Health McKesson Ventures, the company’s own venture capital fund, invested in AI healthcare firm Komodo Health. Komodo claims their predictive analytics platform helps doctors diagnose and keep track of disease progression in patients. It purportedly can help doctors deliver individualized care by supplying insights about each patient or patient population. Komodo claims that all of this results in a shorter time between the patient’s check-in and their treatment. Komodo most likely achieves this by training their machine learning model on a large amount of anonymized patient data. This way, patient names and other personal information will not be circulated and thus remain compliant with healthcare regulations. The data might involve various details about a patient’s health, such as: Medical history, including past injuries and ailments Past disease and ailment treatments that have worked for the patient Medications they are currently taking Any medication allergies The patient’s current symptoms Each of these categories would then be labeled, and Komodo likely labels each piece of data under one of these categories. After Komodo’s data scientists expose the machine learning model to all of this data, it would then be able to discern correlations between symptoms, how they get worse, and which diseases or ailments they are most commonly associated with.Once trained, their predictive analytics model could be used to help physicians understand their patients’ illnesses. This software most likely uses the context it has on the medical history of past patients to predict what a doctor’s diagnosis will be on a current patient.  This could be especially helpful to McKesson because of its purported capacity to predict the progression of a patient’s disease, which would allow healthcare providers to more easily communicate to McKesson which products they need and when they need to arrive.  McKesson’s world cancer day update suggests that Komodo Health’s AI platform can also be used to accurately predict cancer relatively early compared to current diagnostics. They emphasize this with a quote from Dr. Arif Nathoo, CEO of Komodo Health.  With regards to the data used to create these predictions, Nathoo said, “Just as Amazon can tell you when you need more cereal or new running shoes based on behaviors, we’re learning from the journeys of patients across 50 billion clinical encounters how to train our algorithms to detect cancer well before symptoms manifest.” While 50 billion clinical encounters may seem like an untenable amount of patient data to use, McKesson claims Komodo uses the medical history of over 300 million patients to train its software. If this medical history includes each and every doctor’s appointment and emergency room visit on each patient’s record, then it is possible their database reaches 50 billion individual encounters. McKesson Moves to Google Cloud McKesson recently moved away from other cloud-based technology platforms in favor of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), allowing them to distribute new applications and tools across the company more easily.  They claim that it will also advance the development of their new AI technology, which includes improving their data analytics capacity. This primarily supports McKesson’s strategy for optimizing how they deliver healthcare and products more efficiently. The company claims the move to GCP will ensure that their digital infrastructure will be flexible. This likely means each department will not need to invest hard drive space to constantly installing new AI tools and updates to make sure they are operating with the newest technology.  Instead, employees use Google Cloud to remotely access the applications they need to use for their jobs, and updates are run through the cloud so that nobody can miss an update. McKesson also claims this flexible infrastructure will allow them to accomplish the following advancements to their technological resources: Create a scalable and agile database that is more useful for the company itself and the other healthcare businesses it works with. This likely means that medical data is stored in a directory where it is labeled normally, but not organized according to those labels. This allows for different ways to organize patient data and clinical data so that it can be used by anyone interfacing with McKesson’s Google Cloud applications. Modernize their solutions to common business problems such as product manufacturing, specialty product distribution, and pharmacy retail operations. This is purportedly accomplished through developing and testing new applications and software tools through GCP. Capture new medical data in real-time using cloud-based data analytics tools, which likely helps them develop and improve machine learning models. This could allow for more up to date insights on specific patient populations or how patients commonly react to certain diseases. Have a bigger capacity for integrating machine learning and AI into the enterprise. Because the AI software does not need to be installed to each computer, or even to a central computer onsite, integrating AI applications may take much less time. When combined with the real-time cloud analytics mentioned above, AI applications could likely continue updating automatically without a human monitor.  Expedite their ability to deliver new software and services along with the scalability to handle big-picture issues as well as granular business problems. This may seem redundant, but McKesson likely included this statement because Google Cloud Platform allows them to accomplish this faster than they ever have before. Reduce the need for managers and administrators to always be checking on and updating the digital architecture. This allows data scientists to focus on new projects within an infrastructure they can already rely on to be flexible enough to integrate their projects. Below is an introductory seminar about using machine learning and AI on the Google Cloud platform. In this video, a Google cloud expert describes how businesses can use the platform to facilitate the use of AI across their entire enterprise. Because the video is quite long, we have included a list of the most useful moments below.  6:12 – Machine Learning as an API. GCP has 5 machine learning APIs that can enable AI tools that use natural language processing, translation, speech recognition, machine vision, and “video intelligence,” or insights from data gathered with machine vision. 21:56 – GCP tools for training machine learning models on a business’ proprietary data. These tools are called TensorFlow and ML Engine. TensorFlow is an open-source Google-created machine learning training tool, while ML Engine is a tool specifically for GCP. 24:18 – How custom machine learning models work on GCP using TensorFlow and ML Engine.  Internal AI Initiatives for White-Collar Automation and Finance Management McKesson has made some important partnerships and mergers in the past few years that have improved its business processes using machine learning and AI. They have partnered with the AI firm Genpact in order to automate white-collar pharmaceutical work and free up employees to focus on delivering care.  Additionally, McKesson acquired Change Healthcare and are utilizing their predictive analytics software to provide value-based care and automate claims management.  White-Collar Automation at McKesson and Their Partnership With Genpact McKesson has been working on data analytics systems and finding better and better ways to manage their data since 2016. This has allowed them to try out different approaches to artificial intelligence in various business areas, but most recently they have leveraged the technology for numerous white-collar use cases. They take advantage of these use cases through their use of AI applications provided by Genpact, a partnered company. The white-collar business areas that McKesson has been able to automate include: Order to cash: The process of aggregating sales orders for pharmaceuticals and medical services, and taking in payments for those sales. Could come from individual patients, insurance providers, or hospitals in the case of medical tool sales. Record to report: The collection and distribution of important information, ideally in a timely manner. This includes communicating pathology and radiology information about patients to the correct doctors and pharmacists. Alternatively, this can be useful in a medical testing lab where results may need to be distributed to many departments at once.  Contract management: The process by which written and signed contracts are distributed, then sent back to the relevant departments. These departments will need to know the contract has been signed in order to fulfill a task or ship a product. Additionally, data analytics systems may take any currently active contracts into account when recommending the best course of action for a business leader. Master Data management: An automated process that manages a company’s store of big data and where that data is stored within the enterprise. This is most likely in reference to patient data and electronic health records (EHR) stored somewhere in McKesson’s database. Source to pay: Managing the company’s financial resources in order to reduce company spending in frivolous areas. This helps business leaders decide the areas that require the most funds and prioritize based on large amounts of enterprise data. This is most likely accomplished using predictive analytics to create a budget while taking patient data into consideration when calculating possible resource utilization in the future.  McKesson’s “source to pay” and “record to report” processes are the most likely to be automated through predictive analytics. This is because managing and recommending good business spending habits requires using historical spending data and the ROI yield from past expenditures. The image below is an example of one of Genpact’s AI software solutions, APFlow. The company claims APFlow is their recommended solution for the source to pay process.  The user is able to visualize all invoices within a system and group them by document type and payment status. The dashboard allows the user to bring up recently viewed graphs and refresh the visualizations based on any changes to the data: A preview of Genpact’s dashboard Additionally, predictive analytics software can predict where a certain type of document or memo needs to be sent based on information on past data transfers within the enterprise.  In the case of new personnel or a change in which departments are prioritized to receive information, however, this may be bypassed by directing the software to send the information to certain people.  This is different from a non-AI analytics engine that simply shows the most current trends in a company’s data. We spoke to German Sanches-Trilles about the differences between analytics and predictive analytics in our interview about data science terms that people commonly get wrong.  When asked about what makes predictive analytics different from more common analytics engines, Sanches-Trilles said: If we compare it with normal analytics, when I listen to the term analytics, the first thing that comes to my mind is Google Analytics. [In Google Analytics,] you look at the traffic of your website, perhaps the purchases of your eCommerce, looking at the data and trying to understand it.  When you are doing predictive analytics, there is this predictive part in which you think of the data you have, you build something with that data, an algorithm or a model or whatever, and try to infer something that is going to happen in the future based on the past. Predictions from AI software are reviewed by a human employee before a final decision is made. Because of this, predictive analytics software can help business leaders manage finances using all of their enterprise data with the freedom to accept or reject what the results may imply.  Acquisition of Change Healthcare: Claims Management and Predictive Analytics Recently, McKesson acquired Change Healthcare, an AI firm that has allowed them to access their predictive analytics technology for value-based care and medical reimbursement. Value-based care is a business model that charges the patient based on the value of care they received.  This functions differently from individually priced medicines and services as products based on a typical supply and demand market strategy.  Change Healthcare has AI analytics software that can possibly allow McKesson to ensure the accuracy of payments and revenue by reducing finance errors like missed payments and chargebacks. One of McKesson’s chosen solutions from Change Healthcare is their recent software called Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence. This is part of Change Healthcare’s “Intelligent Healthcare Network,” or its AI platform specifically for solving business problems in healthcare.  The company claims the Claims Lifecycle solution can help optimize claims processing for both healthcare providers and payers such as patients or their health insurance provider.  The “claims lifecycle” referred to in the name of the solution refers to the chain of events that starts when a claim is initially filed and ends when it is paid off or rejected by the company.  The software purportedly detects claims that will be denied while the claim is submitted. The machine learning model behind the software likely compares new claims with past ones that have been accepted. This allows it to discern if the claim is accurate or not. The graphic below from McKesson illustrates how Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence observes details about input claims and then accepts or rejects them: Infographic on how Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence comes to its conclusions, courtesy of Change Healthcare Claims Lifecycle Artificial Intelligence can reject claims based on the signature on the form or the dollar amount the claim is for, however, these are just some of the possible parameters. A denied claim could get sent back to the claimant so that they may complete any parts of the claim they may have missed.  Additionally, this allows the claimant to correct any information that the system rejected. According to Change Healthcare, this system has resulted in $6.2 billion in savings within all companies that use this solution. It is very possible that this software uses predictive analytics to determine if the information within each claim is accurate or complete. This inference comes from the fact that Change Healthcare is a company focused on data analytics and predictive analytics, and this was true even before they were acquired by McKesson.  Unfortunately, there is currently no information on this solution that confirms it as predictive analytics. Predictive Analytics Software Change Healthcare’s analytics platform is called HealthQx, and it purportedly can help healthcare providers make the transition to value-based care and reimbursement. These are required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the solution uses predictive analytics to determine the value of the care each patient received.  Additionally, automating this process facilitates reimbursement in the elimination of any possibility for human error. When a human employee cannot retain all of the financial information at once and makes a mistake, it could lead to less reimbursement for their company, which affects the total revenue for that company.  HealthQx uses a technique called “episodic claim grouping” to detect when business costs rise and fall. The software can then take the time period between when costs initially spike and when they fall back down as an “episode” so that it can focus in on a specific time where costs surged to find exactly how much a provider needs to be reimbursed.  HealthQx can use the data from each of these episodes to gather more insight to use in future analytics queries and projects. Change Healthcare refers to this data utilization as “episodic analysis.” However, episodic claim grouping is just one technique a predictive analytics software could use to find this type of insight that a client company could not find prior to adoption. We spoke to Steve Gullans, Managing Director at Excel Venture Management, about investing in AI healthcare applications.  While our interview mostly deals with why doctors don’t want to be fully replaced by AI, Gullans made an important observation regarding white-collar and financial automation in healthcare: …Looking for diamonds in the rough or opportunities that are undervalued, by looking through the patent histories and seeing what’s out there that people don’t appreciate, on a global basis…you could actually find things that were invisible before. It would seem that even investors at large venture funds are interested in how patient history can help determine the value of their care. Because of this, business leaders should keep an eye out for AI firms that purport to solve value-based care problems if that is a business area they are considering for integration. It is likely that the machine learning model behind HealthQx was trained on thousands of records from client healthcare providers such as EHRs, healthcare claims, and financial data. It would need to be relevant to the client company’s resources and financial plans, patient health levels and satisfaction, and the list of services that can be reimbursed.  Additionally, it is possible that the software has a natural language processing (NLP) section. This is because EHRs contain unstructured written information that NLP can process whereas predictive analytics cannot. Both Change Healthcare and McKesson claim that HealthQx is being leveraged by health plan providers that cover 33% of commercially insured citizens in the United States. However, they do not mention any of these providers by name.  It would appear that McKesson is seeing some success with the software as a value-based care solution, but they do not state any savings figures in regards to their transition into AI-powered value-based care.   Header image credit: Medium Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at Barclays - Current InitiativesBarclays is a UK bank ranked 20th on S&P Global’s list of the top 100 banks.… Artificial Intelligence at Goldman Sachs - Current InitiativesThe top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very… Venture Investments in Artificial Intelligence - Trends in 2016 and BeyondInvestments in artificial intelligence continued on an upward swing in 2016, following through on the… Artificial Intelligence at Morgan Stanley - Current InitiativesMorgan Stanley is a US financial institution known mostly for its financial advisory services.

Chiropractic in the coming years will see a number of breakthroughs for the application of artificial intelligence in medical science
Artificial intelligence, a branch of computer science dedicated to enabling computers to mimic human thinking, is making waves in health care. Inevitably, AI would start having an impact on chiropractic clinics in the process. Many of the everyday tasks chiropractors and their teams perform will likely be affected by AI and the application of artificial intelligence in medical science.
This creates a wide variety of new possibilities for chiropractors. You can save staff hours for more high-level tasks and automate much of your back office work, or create chatbots to interact online with prospective patients and mine patient data for valuable insights. In the process, these applications may save your practice time and money, providing key productivity you can apply to other tasks and responsibilities.
By learning more about how AI works and what it can do for your practice, you can start putting computer intelligence to work.
How AI works
For many of us, AI in the workplace conjures up images of robot workers carrying out human office tasks in a made-for-TV science fiction film — maybe even robots cleaning our homes (which they already do) or driving our cars (pioneered by Tesla). While it’s true that constant improvements in technology are allowing for better and more innovative robots, in practice the best applications of robotic technologies are related to data management.
Health care is rich with data, and AI can help analyze data more efficiently and discover new trends that weren’t visible before. This has a variety of different applications in the industry. For example:

Health research
Marketing and community outreach
Individualized care

Not all of these applications for AI have been fully realized just yet. They do offer a lot of promise, though, along with potentially very helpful insights for chiropractic care.
Patient data
One of the most relevant uses for AI in a clinical setting is for data analytics. Patient data contains a lot of valuable information for your practice such as:

Disease, illness and condition trends
Demographics
Patient health outcomes

While no human being could ever analyze thousands of journal articles to give a patient individualized health advice, AI could easily help doctors do this. This could allow you to personalize your care based on the best of what the research says and on an individual patient’s circumstances, past health history or other characteristics. You can eventually tailor treatments with the help of an AI assistant and reduce the likelihood something will be missed in the process of your own literature review or research.
This also means it could be easier to participate in important health research or even tailor your own in-house research using available health databases. If the data is there, the potential is enormous for the application of artificial intelligence in medical science.
Marketing and communications
Automated communications with patients and prospective new patients can improve your clinic’s ability to serve and provide information. AI allows you to set up chatbots on your website, for instance, to engage with online visitors and share important info about your practice. When you automate your marketing, it can help you focus on other things like caring for patients. At the same time, you’re still marketing at a high data-driven level.
In time, it’s likely other marketing and communications applications will become available. Right now, AI-powered email and chat marketing are two popular ways to streamline and improve marketing outreach. This creates great options for chiropractors.
Putting AI to work for your practice
Now may be the best time to start putting AI to work for you. If you like, start small. Find some voice-capture software to speed-up and auto-archive your patient notes. One great place to start is with your marketing — consider a basic chatbot app for your website to collect information and questions from potential new patients.

Their inevitable point is to interface those wires to a thought transmitter which tucks behind your ear like a portable hearing assistant..These threads identify and record the electrical signals in the cerebrum, and transmit this data outside the body. This can possibly make a scalable high-bandwidth mind-machine interface (BMI) framework, implying that it connects the cerebrum to an external device to shape a brain-machine interface..The objective is to utilize Neuralink to comprehend and treat various types of the cerebrum or spine-related disorders. For example, paralyzed people could utilize the implanted device to control telephones or computers..Anyway, Musk additionally imagines the implant as a method for improving your own brain, giving people the choice to accomplish a beneficial interaction with artificial intelligence (AI). This could, in the end, lead to an eventual fate of &quot;superhuman intelligence&quot;, as indicated by Musk..Musk and friends flaunted a smaller than usual, dedicated computer chip whose job it is to divert the electrical noise from neurons into crisp digital signals. The chip does just a single thing, like those utilized by Bitcoin diggers and does it utilizing as meager energy as possible, which is essential if it will sit under your skull. According to Andrew Hires, an assistant professor of biological sciences at the University of Southern California, one doesn't have to change batteries out in every two hours. Neuralink has taken a lot of cutting-edge stuff and set up it together in manners that academic groups have attempted to do. As yet missing from Neuralink's demo is a wireless transmitter, which different organizations have illustrated..Neuralink talked up slim, flexible, polymer wires that it needs to jab into people's brains through holes in their skulls. The flexible electrodes are like advancements being developed somewhere else (including by Chong Xie at the University of Texas, Austin)..Neuralink claims that it recorded from 1,000 or so neurons in a rodent. In any case, don't be excessively dazzled by the huge number. It isn't record-breaking, and may not be important to catch brain signals required for the applications Neuralink is taking a look at. Recording only 30 neurons in the motor cortex of a volunteer's cerebrum as they envision moving their arm is sufficient to enable them to control a computer cursor on a screen..The gadget being referred to, which is anonymous up until now, will see the tiny thread fitted with 3,000 electrodes which can screen the activity of 1,000 neurons..This implies the embedded gadget would probably target particular territories of the cerebrum, and said the device could dissect the neurons and using artificial intelligence (AI) would work out how to invigorate the patient. Details on how mind movement will be interpreted or how the brain would be simulated have not been discussed..Mr Musk stated: &quot;dislike all of a sudden we will have this fantastic neural lace and will take over individuals' brains. It will require some time.&quot;.Musk's Neuralink startup has likewise constructed a neurosurgical robot that is capable of embeddings six strings into the human brain every minute. Each thread is smaller than one-tenth of the size of a human hair and contains 192 electrodes..Every electrode group is encased inside a small implantable gadget that contains custom wireless chips, estimating four by four millimeters. The strings would be separately embedded into the cerebrum &quot;with micron accuracy&quot; by a tiny needle toward the end of the robot, which measures around 24 microns in diameter. This would almost certainly target explicit pieces of the brain and abstain from harming any veins..As of now, the operation would require drilling holes into the patient's skull to embed the threads. Later on, however, they want to utilize a laser shaft to puncture the skull with a progression of tiny holes, which wouldn't be felt by the patient..After some time, I figure we will presumably observe a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence,&quot; said Musk. &quot;It's for the most part about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your mind and the digital variant of yourself, especially yield..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

SAN FRANCISCO, July 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite recent doom-and-gloom anecdotal reporting, a nationwide survey of 1,001 workers in the United States (U.S.) finds that 70% have an upbeat attitude toward new workplace technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI), such as chatbots, robots and augmented reality. Only 5% say they dislike new technology for putting their jobs at risk today. In fact, 32% of U.S. respondents feel AI will have a positive impact on their job in the next five years, increasing from 26% today. Just 19% of those surveyed express fear that AI/bots could swallow their jobs within the next decade.

Genesys survey finds the majority of U.S. employees have a favorable view of artificial intelligence (AI) at work.







These findings stem from new research by Genesys® (www.genesys.com), the global leader in omnichannel customer experience and contact center solutions, into the attitudes of employed Americans regarding the rising adoption of AI in the workplace. Genesys conducted an identical survey in six countries — the U.S., Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand — for a total of 4,207 participants.

The picture isn't all rosy, however. While 75% of Americans surveyed say they are ""rarely"" or ""never"" threatened by new technology at work, one quarter do feel unsettled by it. Happily, only 4% ""always"" feel threatened. This is fairly similar to respondents in Germany, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand, but in Japan that figure jumps to 12%.
Is AI a Friend or Future ""Frenemy""?While 52% of U.S. workers surveyed say AI has not yet affected their jobs, that number falls to 29% when asked about a five-year timeframe, with expectations for an increase in both positive and negative effects. Part of the reason for the low percentage of AI's current impact? It's not as ubiquitous in the workplace as many people would believe. Among U.S. respondents, 68% say they are not yet using tools that leverage AI; surprisingly, there is not a noteworthy difference between large and small companies. Survey results also shed light on AI's influence on employee social interaction, ethics and upskilling, with worker attitudes varying according to age, company size, job status and job function. The overall impression? Employees have a generally positive view of technology now, but are less certain if technology enabled with AI will be their friendly co-worker in the future, or a ""frenemy.""""The survey findings substantiate a long-held Genesys belief that a blended approach to AI is best in customer contact centers as well as the workplace in general,"" said Merijn te Booij, chief marketing officer for Genesys. ""Some jobs will evolve as human work combines with the capabilities of AI. The key for organizations adopting this intelligent technology is to help employees understand its potential to make their jobs more fulfilling by taking the mundane, easily automated tasks off their plates. This opens the door for more employees to apply skills AI just can't replace – like creativity, leadership and empathy.""Considering 27% of Americans say they simply cannot predict the impact of AI on their jobs five years down the road, and only half feel they have the skills to compete effectively, it's increasingly important for companies to closely monitor the pace of AI adoption and employee training programs to address it.A few additional U.S. findings related to overall attitudes toward AI include:
Two-thirds (66%) of the U.S. cohort say technology makes them more efficient in their jobs. This response is exactly the same across the three age ranges surveyed. 
8% of U.S. employees say they dislike new workplace technology such as AI and bots because it takes away their easy tasks. 
More part-time U.S. employees (25%) fear AI will take their jobs within 10 years than do full-time workers (18%). 
Surprisingly, exactly twice as many (26%) of the U.S. employees in the youngest cohort (ages 18-38) fear replacement by AI within the next decade as do their over-55 co-workers (13%). 
Nearly 70% of U.S. employees trust their employers to use AI in an ethical way.
Genesys will release additional insights from the survey in the coming weeks, with key findings related to specific demographic groups.Survey Methodology and ParticipantsWithin the U.S., a total of 1,001 adults completed the online survey in April. Respondents were evenly divided into three age ranges: 18-38, 39-54, 55-73, with women accounting for 65% and men 35%; less than 1% did not categorize by gender.Approximately 80% of those surveyed have full-time employee status with the remaining 20% working part-time. Respondents came from seven categories of company sizes, with a total of 42% employed in companies of fewer than 250 employees. While U.S. survey respondents work in a wide variety of industries, 77% fell into one of 11 functional job categories: Administrative, Assembly Line/Manufacturing, Customer Service/Retail, Doctor/Nurse/Caregiver, Education/Training, Finance/Accounting, Food Service, Human Resources, Marketing/Inside Sales, Media, and Driver/Transportation Provider. The remaining 23% fell into an ""Other"" job category.ATTENTION: For a copy of the full survey data, please contact the Genesys media relations team at genesys@sterlingpr.com.About GenesysGenesys® powers more than 25 billion of the world's best customer experiences each year.

Here are some of the highlights from when artificial intelligence battled humans.








Man Vs. Machine: The 6 Greatest AI Challenges To Showcase The Power Of Artificial Intelligence

World Champion chess player Garry Kasparov competed against artificial intelligence twice. In the first chess match-up between machine (IBM Deep Blue) and man (Kasparov) in 1996 Kasparov won. The next year, Deep Blue was victorious. When Deep Blue won, many talked that it was a sign that artificial intelligence was catching up to human intelligence and it inspired a documentary film called The Man vs. The Machine. Shortly after losing, Kasparov went on record to state he thought the IBM team had cheated; however, in an interview in 2016, Kasparov said he had analyzed the match and retracted his previous conclusion and cheating accusation.
In 2011, IBM Watson took on Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two of the most successful contestants of the game show Jeopardy who had collectively won $5 million during their reigns as Jeopardy champions. Watson won! To prepare for the competition, Watson played 100 games against past winners. The computer was the size of a room, was named after IBM’s founder Thomas J. Watson and required a powerful and noisy cooling system to keep its servers from overheating. Deep Blue and Watson were products that came from IBM’s Grand Challenge initiatives that pit man against machines. Since Jeopardy has a unique format where contestants provide the answers to the “clues” they are given, Watson first had to learn how to untangle the language to determine what was being asked even before it could do the work to figure out how to respond—a significant feat for natural language processing that resulted in IBM developing DeepQA, a software structure to do just that.
PROMOTED
Could artificial intelligence play Atari games better than humans? DeepMind Technologies took on this challenge, and in 2013 it applied its deep learning model to seven Atari 2600 games. This endeavor had to overcome the challenge of reinforcement learning to control agents directly from vision and speech inputs. The breakthroughs in computer vision and speech recognition allowed the innovators at DeepMind Technologies to develop a convolutional neural network for reinforcement learning to enable a machine to master several Atari games using only raw pixels as input and in a few games have better results than humans.

Next up in our review of man versus machine is the achievements of AlphaGo, a machine that is able to learn for itself what knowledge is. The supercomputer was able to learn 3,000 years of human knowledge in a mere 40 days prompting some to claim it was “one of the greatest advances ever in artificial intelligence.” The system had already learned how to beat the world champion of Go, an ancient board game that was once thought to be impossible for a machine to decipher. The film about the experience is now available on Netflix.  AlphaGo's success, when not being constrained by human knowledge, presents the possibility of the system being used to solve some of the world's most challenging problems such as in healthcare or energy or environmental concerns.
In another test of artificial intelligence capabilities, DeepMind sought out a more complex game for artificial intelligence to battle that required the use of different features of intelligence that are necessary to solve scientific and real-world problems. They found the next challenge in StarCraft II, a real-time strategy game created by Blizzard Entertainment that features multi-layered gameplay. AlphaStar was the first artificial intelligence to defeat professional players of the game by using its deep neural network that was trained from raw game data by reinforcement and supervised learning.
Project Debater, a project from IBM, tackles another area of expertise for artificial intelligence—debating humans on complex topics. This skill involves dissecting your opponent’s arguments and finding ways to appeal to their emotions (or the audience’s emotions)—something that would seem like a uniquely human ability to do. Even though Miss Project Debater lost when it faced off against one of the world’s leading debate champions, it was still an impressive display of artificial intelligence capabilities. To succeed at a debate, AI needs to rely on facts and logic, be able to make sense of an opponent’s line of reasoning and to navigate human language fully which has been one of the most challenging feats of all for AI to master. While not 100% successful, Project Debater gave a good glimpse of what’s possible in the future where machines can augment human intelligence in powerful ways.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",Man Vs.

Ethics and automation: What to do when workers are displaced

Why It Matters		



Digital technologies are transforming the nature of human labor, enriching some workers, but leaving others behind. What’s the ethical approach?

As companies embrace automation and artificial intelligence, some jobs will be created or enhanced, but many more are likely to go away. What obligation do organizations have to displaced workers in such situations? Is there an ethical way for business leaders to usher their workforces through digital disruption?
Researchers wrestled with those questions recently at MIT Technology Review’s EmTech Next conference. Their conclusion: Company leaders need to better understand the negative repercussions of the technologies they adopt and commit to building systems that drive economic growth and social cohesion.
Pramod Khargonekar, vice chancellor for research at University of California, Irvine, and Meera Sampath, associate vice chancellor for research at the State University of New York, presented findings from their paper, “Socially Responsible Automation: A Framework for Shaping the Future.”

The research makes the case that “humans will and should remain critical and central to the workplace of the future, controlling, complementing and augmenting the strengths of technological solutions.” In this scenario, automation, artificial intelligence, and related technologies are tools that should be used to enrich human lives and livelihoods.  (Watch Khargonekar and Sampath's presentation here.)
Aspirational, yes, but how do we get there?
Khargonekar and Sampath explained the four levels of what they call the pyramid of progress:
Level 0: Cost-focused automation. At the lowest level of the pyramid, technology is used solely to gain economic benefits by reducing human labor. These cost-based programs are not only not socially conscious or human-centric, the researchers said, they often fail to deliver and can even be detrimental to business interests.
Level 1: Performance-driven automation. This approach is more cognizant of the role that humans play in the loop. Processes and systems are reengineered to take advantage of automation while still using human skills and capabilities to fill in technological shortfalls.
In Amazon’s warehouses, for example, employees perform tasks that require dexterity and flexibility, such as picking and packing goods, while robots take on routine heavy-lifting tasks like transporting loaded bins.
While such systems move beyond cost efficiencies, they typically are still driven by business metrics that don’t take into account larger implications of the workforce, nor the societal costs and benefits of automation.
Level 2: Worker-centered automation. At this level, the business goal is not just performance optimization, but worker development and enrichment. In these systems, the goal of automation is not to sideline people or replace them with machines, but to encourage new forms of human-machine interaction that augment human capabilities.
On Toyota’s manufacturing lines, workers manually produce goods at first, innovating and simplifying processes as they go, with machines taking over only after the process has been perfected.
While such approaches are workforce-empowering, strategies and choices are still viewed from the point of view of the organization, rather than in the context of a broader business-society ecosystem, the researchers write.
Level 3: Socially responsible automation. At the top of the pyramid, automation is deployed to produce more and better jobs for humans, driving economic growth while also promoting societal well-being. Attaining such a lofty goal requires “explicit, active interventions,” the authors write — that is, business leaders must commit to proactively identifying new revenue streams and job-enabling growth as they roll out and refine automation.
One example is Baltimore-based Marlin Steel, once known as the “king of bagel baskets.” Small business manufacturing is a segment where workers are particularly hard hit when automation is introduced, but Marlin Steel was able to buck that trend, Sampath explained.
Faced with declining demand for its products and rising competition, the company invested in robotics and automation, reengineered its production processes, enhanced its product line with highly engineered custom products, and expanded its client base — all by equipping its employees with the skills and training they needed to operate in its new, technology-driven workplace.
Giving workers a say — even in their own layoffs
If that’s the vision of socially responsible automation, the reality is less rosy, Khargonekar and Sampath conceded — at least in the short term.
When a moderator asked if most companies weren’t “stuck at the bottom row of the pyramid,” Sampath replied, “I really would say so. Today, industry focuses predominantly at the bottom-most level, cost savings, or perhaps the one level after that, which is performance-focused. So predominantly, we are still at the very bottom.”
That means that automation is likely to lead to layoffs; but even then, there’s a right way and wrong way to handle the process.
Susan Winterberg, a fellow in the Technology and Public Purpose Project at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, cited her case study about Nokia Corp., written with Harvard Business School professor Susan Sucher. (Watch Winterberg's presentation here.)
The Finnish telecommunications giant had a tough time in recent years navigating the consumer electronics marketplace. In 2008, Nokia made the decision to close a mobile assembly plant in Bochum, Germany, despite having just posted record profit for the year. Gates to the factory were locked, and workers arriving for the day were redirected to a local arena where they were told their plant was not cost-effective and their jobs were moving overseas.
An ensuing round of public protests and boycott campaigns cost Nokia money, lost it customers, and damaged its brand worldwide, Winterberg said. Which is why the company took a different tack in 2011 when competition from the iPhone and Android forced it to restructure its mobile phone division.
The decision was made to close down eight research and development centers and two assembly plants and downsize five other assembly and manufacturing plants worldwide. In total, 1,800 people were scheduled to lose their jobs across 13 countries.
This time, Winterberg said, the company pledged to:
Accept its responsibility as a driver of local economies.
Take an active role in supporting employees, notifying workers months in advance of closures and involving impacted employees in the design and operation of support programs.
Communicate openly with all stakeholders, including employees, unions, governments, and local entities, even when Nokia itself did not yet have all the answers.
As part of its Nokia Bridge program, employees could find another job at Nokia, take advantage of training opportunities to learn a new skill, or apply for grants to pursue a different career path entirely. The firm set up career fairs for employees, even inviting their competitors in local markets.
Additionally, Nokia created an incubator program that helped employees leverage intellectual property it no longer needed into new business ventures — a move that helped not just individual workers, but spurred growth and innovation in the local economies it was exiting. Along the same lines, the company found buyers for its closing plants, so employment options would remain stable in affected communities.
The upshot was more than simple good will, Winterberg said. Throughout the process, the company was able to maintain its factory scorecards and employee engagement scores, which typically fall during restructuring, and to continue completing R&D projects in the pipeline, ensuring the future health of the firm.
Most relevant to the idea of ethics and automation is that organizations adopted a stewardship mindset, Winterberg said. They acknowledge that they’re employers, they’re contributors to their communities, and that they play an important role in their customers' lives.

WeiAdvertisementIn 2062: The World AI Made, Toby Walsh renders a dystopic vision of our technology-driven future. Published in 2018, the Australian writer who is also one of the world's leading scientists in the field of artificial intelligence, chose the year 2062 because his daughter would have been as old that year as he was when he wrote the book. 
Walsh makes clear how AI will change our lives, our work, but also have effects on politics and society in general. He also sets out to answer important questions: Will robots develop consciousness? Will we end up becoming machines ourselves? And how will we wage wars in the future?
The author and researcher was recently in Germany to speak at ""Recalculating the Route,"" a cultural symposium themed around the future held at the Goethe Institute in Weimar in June. DW talked further with Walsh about his visions for the future.

DW: People have long been scared of machines. Is there a growing justification for this fear in 2019? 
Toby Walsh: There's a deep psychological fear in our psyche that goes back millennia, one in which people think that machines might actually take over. Actually, I think the things we should be fearful of are actually not the intelligent machines, but the stupidity of machines. And that we'll be giving responsibility to machines that don't have the appropriate intelligence.
Certainly machines have no consciousness, no sentience, no desires of their own. Machines do only what we tell them to do; they're not going to suddenly wake up and decide to take over the planet.
The problem with machines is is that they do exactly what we tell them to do. And sometimes we haven't thought carefully through what we're telling them to do. 

Part of the intention of my book is to prompt people not to be so worried about these sorts of Terminator scenarios in which machines rise up and take over the world. However, they should realize that it's actually much more insidious that we are already handing over decisions to machines that might be biased, might be racist or sexist, and all these sorts of things that we've been trying to get out of a society for the last hundred years.
How might AI actually serve to improve our future? 
To live in the world in a more sustainable way, we have to embrace technology. If we think of all the challenges facing the world, the only hope we have to deal with all these stresses is what we've done for the last hundred years, which is to embrace technology.

People forget that since the Industrial Revolution, in a wealthy country like Germany, life expectancy has nearly doubled — because of the fact that we have used technologies. We have used science to live healthier lives, to understand disease and to invent things like penicillin that have allowed us to live much longer. 
Politics have completely failed us, so our only hope now is to deal with things like climate change by looking for technical fixes.
Toby Walsh says artificial intelligence can bring great benefits, but also pitfalls   Image: DW/S. Dege
Do you think AI will become our new God?
I think the risk is that we won't be gods ourselves. There'll be an underclass of people who are unemployed and unemployable because the machines are doing all the work and the wealth is owned by a very few small number of individuals who are the owners of the robots. So, we'll be far from God. We'll be living a very low-quality life. At the end of the day, technology is to be used for us.
And it will hopefully amplify our humanity. After all, it's all those very human things — our empathy, our social intelligence, our emotional intelligence, our creativity — that machines don't have today.

And it's not clear if they ever will have those things. We are ultimately going to appreciate things that are touched or made by the human hand. We pay much more for handcrafted breads and homemade beer — and all those things that only humans make — than for the mass-produced things the machines make.

What should we do now to better control the way we utilize machines in the future?
People need to be better educated about the risks. We need regulation; we need governments. We're discovering that we have to properly regulate the tech sector, just like we regulated big oil and big pharma and big tobacco. All of those companies had to be regulated so that they worked for the public good.
Europe is leading the way. The General Data Protection Regulation is a beginning, an example of how to get appropriate privacy, and to get the tech companies behaving with our data more appropriately. And the interesting thing is, my friends and colleagues working in the tech sector will tell you in private they need to be regulated.

So we live in interesting times?
Yes, very interesting times. But equally, it's amazing that the biggest changes in our lives have been in the past 30 years. We've had the internet only in the last 30 years. We've only had smartphones for a dozen years. Hard to imagine we could live now without these.
They've both been a great convenience in our lives. And that's why we have to think more carefully about technology and how it can help us to tackle those wicked problems like climate change and rising inequality and the global refugee problem. Technologies can help us do that.

Companies using artificial intelligence technologies in the recruitment and hiring process may face employment practices claims if other states follow Illinois in trying to restrict the use of artificial intelligence in video interviews.
The Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act passed by the Illinois General Assembly on May 29 and sent to Gov. J.B. Pritzker is considered first-of-its-kind legislation but could be adopted by other states with strong employee and job applicant protections, experts say.
The Illinois governor has 60 calendar days to sign a law or veto it — doing nothing means the bill becomes state law after the 60 days. The Governor’s office was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.
The law is an “important first step” in legislating how artificial intelligence should be used in the employment context, said Gary Clark, Chicago-based chair of the labor and employment group for Quarles & Brady LLP.
“The failure to fully investigate and understand the use of artificial intelligence technology whether in this context or others could expose employers to huge legal liability if they just jump right in and start using it,” said Mr. Clark.
“Any time you are using artificial intelligence in the human resources or recruiting or employment function, you need to do a deep dive into how it’s being used and to fully evaluate what risks may result from how it’s being used with regard to video interviews,” he said.
While the Illinois statute requires employers to notify applicants before an interview that artificial intelligence may be used and explain how the technology works, it “doesn’t have a whole lot of teeth” in its current form, said John Litchfield, senior counsel at Foley & Lardner LLP in Chicago.
“It’s hard to know if rules will be developed by a state agency like the Department of Labor to enforce the law and, if they are developed, what type of penalties or issues may arise as a result for employers and for companies developing the software,” he said.
The Illinois law is considered the first of its kind, but other states may follow its lead, which could trigger an increase in employment practices liability insurance claims and force companies to increase their focus on managing these risks, experts say.
“There will be other states that will come on board, mainly the employment-sophisticated states like California, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey — states that have strict regulations over how employers can treat employees and applicants,” Mr. Litchfield said.
While in its current form there are no penalties or fines attached to the Illinois act, it is “definitely something to watch for in case there are amendments,” said Sheryl Falk, Houston-based partner and co-lead of the global privacy and data security task force at Winston & Strawn LLP.
Citing another ground-breaking law, the Illinois Biometric Information Act passed in 2008, Ms. Falk said “the keen difference is that the Illinois (biometrics) law provides a private right of action, so a consumer can sue the employer if the employer has not complied with the law.”
“Any time there’s a new law on the books that’s setting up best practices and required standards, this raises liability. It’s even more critical for companies to be clear and accurate about how they are using this data,” said Ms. Falk, who is also a member of the technical advisory board of Utah-based HireVue Inc., a software firm that uses artificial intelligence in its video interviewing platform.
The Illinois artificial intelligence statute incorporates elements from the ethical frameworks that many companies already operate under, such as concepts of notice and transparency, she said.
Employers also must obtain consent from applicants before the interview and only share the videos with those whose expertise is necessary to evaluate the applicant’s fitness for a position, she said.
Similar to the Illinois Biometric Information Act, assuming a private right of action is granted under the law, there is a potential for claims alleging that the employer failed to adhere to the specific notice requirements of the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, said Talene Carter, New York-based national employment practices liability product leader for FINEX North America at Willis Towers Watson PLC.
“Those types of claims could trigger employment practices liability coverage as invasion of privacy, as misrepresentation,” Ms. Carter said.
However, the act could also spur an increase in other, more traditional employment practice violations, experts say.
These types of issues relate to whether employers are screening applicants out based on their gender, race or disability at a higher rate than people that don’t fall within those protected categories, said Mr. Litchfield.
“It’s important for employers and software developers creating this technology to keep in mind the traditional, everyday bread-and-butter labor and employment issues that exist regardless of whether an interview is taking place by a machine or robot or a human-to-human interaction,” he said.
If the artificial intelligence technology that evaluates a candidate’s suitability for a job based on certain characteristics such as speech patterns or body language is found to discriminate against people with disabilities, that could violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, said Mr. Clark.
“Similarly, if the characteristics or speech patterns this technology looks for tend to discriminate against a specific race, gender, national origin or sexual orientation, that could have huge risks as it could violate Title VII,” he said, referring to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
There are different ways coverage under an employment practices liability insurance policy could be triggered, said Ms. Carter.
“There’s a potential for discrimination claims, there’s a potential for failure to hire, there’s the potential for unintentional discriminatory impact,” she said.
For example, there’s no reference in the statute to what happens if an individual did not consent to the use of artificial intelligence, she said. In this scenario, if an employer removes an applicant from consideration, “there might be a potential claim there,” Ms. Carter said.
State Rep. Jaime Andrade Jr., D-Chicago, a sponsor of the legislation, said the purpose of the act is not to “set up landmines for companies so that people can sue.”
“It is about being fair and transparent,” he said.
Kevin Parker, chief executive officer of HireVue Inc., said the company is “broadly supportive of the intentions and goals of the act in terms of candidate privacy and transparency.”
“There’s always been an abundance of caution for companies broadly to make sure there’s no adverse impact associated with any part of the hiring process. That has always extended to how they think about how they use video interviewing generally and how they use artificial intelligence to support their interviewing efforts,” Mr. Parker said.
HireVue does a “significant amount” of analysis before interviewing anyone to ensure “there is no adverse impact, or we eliminate it if we find it,” he said.
“We do a lot of testing with gender differences, age differences, ethnic differences … We can look at every group as they go through the model and see where the adverse impact might arise and eliminate that from the analysis going forward,” he said.
In the meantime, both employers and insurers should be looking at their employment practices liability insurance policies to check their coverage for “artificial intelligence-type liability in the employment context,” said Mr. Litchfield.
“Everyone should be looking at this and analyzing the risks,” he said.
From the insurers’ perspective, if a private right of action is added to the statute and an influx of claims follows, markets may start to narrow coverage for invasion of privacy employment practices liability violations, said Ms. Carter.
“There’s a potential that as we start to see more use of artificial intelligence in the employment context and if we see more states enacting similar statutes, that we may see some changes in the underwriting of employment practices liability policies,” she said.

As more employers invest in artificial intelligence, the technology is expected to play a larger role in helping employers assess their workers, according to a report from Mercer. With the help of technology, the consulting firm predicts that the manager role will shift from gauging past performance to more of a coach, that guides workers future success.   “We believe that AI, by scraping communication platforms such as text, emails and calendars, will help identify those colleagues and customers that are most connected to an employee,” says Lori Holsinger, global performance management study leader at Mercer. “Based on those touch points, it will encourage those most connected to provide coaching to the employee – in person, video chat, or online — based on the employee’s preference. We believe that this approach will increase feedback that will encourage employees and coaching in person.”See also: Turning to tech, Mars revamps employee coaching benefit  HR technology is already starting to play a role in performance management and coaching.

   “We believe you should have a one Mars experience,” Summer Davies, global senior manager of leadership at Mars told Employee Benefit News in May. “[That] means if you work at Mars in Topeka, you should have the same access to growth development and support, as if you work in Guangzhou, China or Cape Town, South Africa.”But the number of employers actually implementing new technology remains small and some are struggling to find the return on investment. Even though there was a 19% increase in the use of performance management vendor technology in the last six years — and 25% of employers integrated that tech into other people management platforms — the use of talent analytics has not increased. Less than 15% of employers have actually adopted new tools, Mercer found.

Tech can provide valuable information on growing an employee’s career, exploring career paths and understanding what a day-in-the life can be for critical jobs, she adds. “This technology needs to be supplemented with personalized career coaching by someone who invests in the employee’s career and helps them reach their short- and long-term career goals,” she says. “This will be the new role of the traditional manager.”       Caroline Hroncich   Former senior editor, SourceMedia             twitter         ",,,https://www.benefitnews.com/news/artificial-intelligence-is-changing-the-performance-review,Article,,https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/bf/be/bb2fd85b48b4af6e56ffc83e8e63/hr-tech-appreciation.4.4.19.png,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', 'affiliation': 'SourceMedia', 'articleSection': 'Author', 'description': 'Caroline Hroncich is a former senior editor of Employee Benefit News and Employee Benefit Adviser.', 'image': {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/5c/77/12ea72fc400eb023e4b3f0532a5f/5ap5li6f-400x400.jpg'}, 'jobTitle': 'Former senior editor', 'name': 'Caroline Hroncich', 'url': 'https://www.benefitnews.com/author/caroline-hroncich'}]",2019-07-10T15:10:19.236Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

          Will artificial intelligence replace doctors?Several new studies have shown that computers can outperform doctors in cancer screenings and disease diagnoses. What does that mean for newly trained radiologists and pathologists?

“Do you think we’re gonna be replaced?”
A young Johns Hopkins University fellow recently asked that question while chatting with Elliot Fishman, MD, about artificial intelligence (AI). The two men were on the opposite ends of the career spectrum: Fishman has been a professor of radiology and oncology at Johns Hopkins Medicine since 1980; the fellow was preparing for his first job as a radiologist.
“I said, ‘Well, I think it’s going to change what we do, but the good news is, at least you’re not a pathologist,’” Fishman recalls. “And he goes, ‘My wife is just graduating and she’s a pathologist.’ So I said, ‘Put away as much money as you can really fast.’”
Fishman laughs when he tells the story, but he understands the concern. Over the past few years, many AI proponents and medical professionals have branded radiology and pathology as dinosaur professions, doomed for extinction. In 2016, a New England Journal of Medicine article predicted that “machine learning will displace much of the work of radiologists and anatomical pathologists,” adding that “it will soon exceed human accuracy.” That same year, Geoffrey Hinton, PhD, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who also designs machine learning algorithms for Google (and who received the Association for Computing Machinery’s A.M. Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of computing, in 2019), declared, “We should stop training radiologists now.""
The reason for the predictions? AI’s tantalizing power to identify patterns and anomalies and to examine “pathologies that look certain ways,” says Fishman, who is among the enthusiasts: He’s studying the use of AI for early detection of pancreatic cancer.
“The hope is that if we could pick up early tumors that are missed, we would have better outcomes,” he says.
An array of studies have offered glimpses of AI’s enormous potential. In a study published by Nature Medicine in May 2019, a Google algorithm outperformed six radiologists to determine if patients had lung cancer. The algorithm, which was developed using 42,000 patient scans from a National Institutes of Health clinical trial, detected 5% more cancers than its human counterparts and reduced false positives by 11%. False positives are a particular problem with lung cancer: A study in JAMA Internal Medicine of 2,100 patients found a false positive rate of 97.5%.
Furthermore, AI performed comparably to breast screening radiologists in a study in the March 2019 Journal of the National Cancer Institute. At Stanford University, computer scientists developed an algorithm for diagnosing skin cancer, using a database of nearly 130,000 skin disease images. In diagnostic tests, the algorithm’s success rate was almost identical to that of 21 dermatologists, according to a study published in Nature in 2017. In another skin cancer study, AI surpassed the performance of 58 international dermatologists. The algorithm not only missed fewer melanomas, but it was less likely to misdiagnose benign moles as malignant, the European Society for Medical Oncology found.

“Machine intelligence presents us with an opportunity to significantly improve the delivery of health care, particularly in high-disease or low-resource settings.”
Sameer Antani, PhD
PhD National Library of Medicine

The possibilities extend beyond cancer. Recent studies have shown how AI can detect rare hereditary diseases in children, genetic diseases in infants, cholesterol-raising genetic diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as predict the cognitive decline that leads to Alzheimer’s disease. A variety of companies are offering FDA-approved AI products, such as iCAD’s ProFound AI for digital breast tomosynthesis. Israeli-based Aidoc has received three FDA approvals for AI products, the latest occurring in June 2019 for triage of cervical spine fractures. In 2018, the FDA approved Imagen’s OsteoDetect, an AI algorithm that helps detect wrist fractures.
So when will AI become an everyday tool for diagnosis? It might not happen as fast as people think, Fishman believes, but it’s definitely coming.
“If you think it’s just some passing fancy, you’re making a mistake,” he says. “In radiology and pathology, it’s going to affect everything you do.”
The upsides of AI
AI has huge potential but it’s still in its infancy as a diagnostic tool. “There are a lot of rapid advances being made and a rush for monetizing them,” says Sameer Antani, PhD, acting branch chief for the National Library of Medicine’s Communications Engineering Branch and Computer Science Branch, who leads a research team on AI in such areas as cervical cancer screening and rare diseases. Initially, AI will be most effective for dealing with specific problems. “A program that does the whole CT of the abdomen is going to take a while,” says Fishman. “There are so many organs and there’s so much variability. But for specific tests that examine individual organs — the liver, the kidneys, the pancreas, the lungs, the heart — I think that’s where AI is going to be strong. And it’s happening.”
AI could be particularly beneficial in places with limited access to health care. “Machine intelligence presents us with an opportunity to significantly improve the delivery of health care, particularly in high-disease or low-resource settings,” says Antani. Consider a study published in March 2019 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, which found that a Google algorithm improved doctors’ ability to accurately diagnose diabetic retinopathy. The algorithm has been tested in India, which is the type of country that could benefit from AI screenings, since it suffers from a shortage of doctors and ophthalmologists. At Stanford, researchers believe their skin cancer algorithm could work on a smartphone, allowing people to screen themselves.
AI could also help reduce radiology’s 30% error rate. “Our goal is to be perfect, but that’s unreasonable. People are busier than ever, they’re reading more studies, they’re working harder — errors increase with faster speed,” says Fishman. And algorithms can handle a larger workload than humans. The Google skin cancer program looked at about 130,000 images. A dermatologist looks at about 12,000 in his or her lifetime, Fishman notes.
“Computers can look at cases 24/7 and they can keep learning,” he says. “It has the opportunity to be the best helper you could ever imagine.”
Data bias and lost jobs
For all of its upsides, scientists such as the late Stephen Hawking have warned that artificial intelligence could destroy mankind. At Harvard Medical School’s 2019 Precision Medicine conference, Harvard Law School professor Jonathan Zittrain compared AI to asbestos: “It turns out that it’s all over the place, even though at no point did you explicitly install it, and it has possibly some latent bad effects that you might regret later, after it’s already too hard to get it all out.” He also noted that AI can be tricked, according to a story from Stat, citing a Google algorithm that correctly identified a tabby cat. When some pixels were changed, the algorithm thought the kitty was — no joke — guacamole.
The newness of AI applications presents a challenge for regulatory agencies to measure and validate its performance in medical diagnostics, Antani says. In April 2019, the FDA announced plans to develop regulations focusing on medical AI products that adapt based on new data.
Another issue is the data itself. The promise of AI depends on “the availability, quality, and completeness of training data and design of the AI framework/algorithm,” says Antani. Factors that affect data strength include social, geographic, or economic biases, as well as simply acquiring data. Computer scientists are developing AI architectures that produce compelling results with less data, Antani says, but “while these are exciting technological advances, they still do not address the shortcomings.”
Efforts to improve data diversity include Count Me In, a cancer project involving more than 6,000 patients so far. Count Me In collects medical information — from tumor samples to blood and saliva — and compiles it in databases for researchers. Launched in 2018, Count Me In is a collaboration between the Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the Emerson Collective (founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs). Its efforts include the Metastatic Breast Cancer Project, which has received tumor samples and medical information from over 4,800 patients.
Count Me In is not only providing its data to researchers for free, but it’s collecting it from across the United States. “If you’re at Hopkins, or you’re at Mass General, your population is Boston or Baltimore. There could be some baked in biases in your population, for good or bad,” says Fishman. “So you need wide data and this is a way of potentially collecting data that’s unbiased.”

“I’m not exactly worried that they’re going to put us out of business right away. Way back when, pathologists looked at every pap smear. Now a machine looks at them and once in a while it kicks something out. Things change.”
Elliott Fishman, MD
Johns Hopkins Medicine

But does better data simply hasten the loss of jobs for health care professionals? Will radiologists and pathologists be replaced by smartphone apps or a medical voice assistant? AI has the potential not only to be more accurate, but to work faster than humans.
“I’m not exactly worried that they’re going to put us out of business right away,” says Fishman. “Way back when, pathologists looked at every pap smear. Now a machine looks at them and once in a while it kicks something out. Things change.”
That change, while potentially profound, does not mean that radiologists and pathologists are destined for the unemployment line. Experts also predicted the demise of radiologists when MRI machines were introduced, wrote Curtis P. Langlotz, professor of radiology at the Stanford University Medical Center, in a May 2019 editorial for the journal Radiology. “Radiologists are being trained to recognize AI’s shortcomings and capitalize on its strengths,” he wrote, adding that most comparisons between algorithms and radiologists are too simplistic. “An AI algorithm that diagnoses common chest conditions at the level of a subspecialty thoracic radiologist is a major step forward, an incredible asset to underserved regions, and could serve as a valued assistant for a subspecialty radiologist.” But radiologists are also trained to detect less-common diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and sickle cell disease. “AI is impressive in identifying horses,” he wrote, “but is a long way from recognizing zebras.”
How will the job change? Over the next 5 to 10 years, the most successful radiologists and pathologists will be those “who are well equipped and eager to participate in data management and integrated diagnoses,” says Frank J. Rybicki, MD, PhD, vice chair of operations and quality with the University of Cincinnati Department of Radiology and medical director of Imagia Cybernetics Inc. When an algorithm produces unexpected results, radiologists will need to understand why. Fishman believes this will lead to a deeper role in patient care — which is one reason why he’s more excited than threatened.
“If you ask me who will benefit from AI, it’s the patients,” says Fishman. “That’s why I’m so excited. Better care for our patients. What can be better than that?”

From taking perfect pictures to predicting what we can say next in an email, artificial intelligence is being incorporated into the products and services we use every day to transform our lives for better but how can this emerging technology affect our future work?Of all the technologies that are driving digital transformation in the enterprise, often the people out AI as the most disruptive among all. There arises no question to how AI is in the process of disrupting people’s day-to-day jobs because of the sophisticated automation.Courtesy-FreepikAI is putting people out of work whether it is shifting the work for more productive tasks because automation takes the grunt work. Such discussions are clearly important as they miss out the larger transformative story. After all, the digital transformation takes place at every organizational and industry level.Unexpressed Economic Impact?There are various attempts to make a prediction that results in the overall level of employment at a national or global level where the shortage of skills and surplus are fluctuating in the coming times. In general practice, the employment outlook can be shaped by the combination of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where the decisions of powerful corporations and investors require current and predicted future industries which is likely an unpredictable number of economic cycles.Additionally, here the diverse economic factors can make up complex challenges to predict with any certainty what are the likely progress of job creation and displacement over the upcoming years. Most of the forecasters, analysts, developers, scientists, technology providers, and economists are debating whether they can evolve or accelerate the learning capability of AI and its potential impact on society. To this, the most intelligent approach will be to start preparing for a range of solutions.Is AI Emerging New Societal Structures?In present times, many in society are unaware of how AI can alter key social structures. For instance, if the legal system can be administered and enforced by AI, does that indicate that we have reached the ideals of fair objectivity? Or on the other side, would that define the new order with the inherent and unintended bias of its creators? If AI is really replacing the humans then how will humans work for the living? How would people spend their newfound permanent leisure hours?For a wider range of society, what actually impacts the large-scale redundancies across all means of professions as a result of the pervasiveness by AI? All these can just be a few topics where we the application of AI has direct and unintended consequences that challenge our current assumptions and work model which needs to get addressed in the not so near future. These challenges need an inclusive, experimental and proactive responses in order to see the impacts of change and ensure that no segment of society lags behind.What are the new Challenges for Business?With multiple technologies in the recent past, businesses are having the luxury to know that they can wait until they are ready to pursue with AI. For many organizations, this can be relatively safe in the assumption that being late to market does not necessarily mean their demise. Moreover, predominant short-term results drive focus and this culture has led to many ignoring artificial intelligence.courtesy-FreepikIn the end, those at the top of huge organizations are rarely excited about any technology and this can lead to a struggle for appreciating the true disruptive potential of AI. The exponential speed of the AI developments indicates that more the business becomes data-centric, greater the imperative to start investing time for better understanding and analyzing the technology. If we look from the top down, we need to appreciate how AI is advancing and differs from previous disruptive advancements and grasping its capability to enable new and unimaginable ideas and business models. We need to understand the true potential of AI to unlock value form the vast arrays of data within our businesses. Also, we need to become more conscious about the long-term societal impact and the broader rule of business in society.Businesses need to think much more strategically about the wider societal ramifications of operational decisions call it corporate social responsibility or enlightened self-interest. There arise multiple questions like where will the money come if organizations begin to rely on favor of automation? How we can assure the right balance between humans and machines so that technology serves the people? In clear terms, there is a deep desire in business today to implement human capability and free up the time for our best talent with the application of AI.Moreover, the evidence suggests a vast majority of AI projects that are backed by a business case prediction on reducing operational costs in the form of humans. Some are raising high concerns that such a narrow pursuit of cost efficiency with the help of automation can limit our capacity to respond to problems and change customer needs. Still, humans are the best option when it comes to adapting to new developments when we learn about emerging industries and pursue new opportunities innovating to stay ahead in this fast-changing competitive world. Business leaders weigh up the benefits of near-term cost-savings for taking humanity out of the businesses by commoditizing our offerings against the risk of automation.How will the IT industry use AI for future?The ability of smart machines to underestimate human workers is definitely a valid threat but it is not intense until and unless a tech worker feels enlightened about AI. One of the prominent ways to ensure that AI serves humanity is to keep it more beneficial and exploit the benefits by rejecting the aspects which threaten the greater good.Such massive transformation can be a startling development yet somehow it rings true to the previous technological breakthroughs like the internet which has led to entirely new economic systems and business models creating the entire IT professions.

My way of expression is through code [which] allows me to translate what is in my head out into the world better than anything I could ever accomplish with my hands and physical toolsMario KlingemannA professor at Rutgers University in the United States has complicated the debate, however.Ahmed Elgammal believes that AICAN – think GAN 2.0 – puts creativity firmly in the capabilities of machine intelligence.“GAN tries to emulate images, but art must make something new. So we developed our creative adversarial network,” says Elgammal, a professor of computer science and director at Rutgers’ Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which created a program called AICAN (Artificial Intelligence Creative Adversarial Network).Elgammal fed the program with images from across five centuries, from the Renaissance to the present day, all grouped into categories by aesthetic, so that it could learn the concept of style.Like in GAN, AICAN was tasked with learning the aesthetics of existing works of art, but it was not allowed to closely emulate styles. This effectively gave the machine two opposing forces: follow the aesthetics, don’t repeat styles.Much of AICAN’s art is abstract; Elgammal suggests this is perhaps because the algorithm has grasped that if it wants to make something novel, it cannot go back and produce figurative works as existed before the 20th century.The AICAN artwork Divided Sunshine (2018), a pigment print on rag paper, is a field of blue over a hazy strip of white, reminiscent of the sky. A thick streak of deep red runs vertically down the centre of the image, alongside a thinner, incomplete strip, also red.It was exhibited at SCOPE Miami Beach and The Arts+ in Frankfurt last year.“The definition of creativity is a long and ongoing debate,” Elgammal says. “Immanuel Kant’s definition of the 18th century is based on two qualities: something has to be novel, and it has to have influence, like Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon [1907], which sparked the cubist movement. This definition helped inspire AICAN.”“But the division of art and science – aesthetics as subjective and science as objective – can also be traced back to Kant, and I don’t believe this is true. I established this lab because I believe looking at art will advance AI. Intelligence is not just used in driving a car or playing chess, it is involved in listening to music, comprehending literature and enjoying art. If we want to build a machine that is intelligent, we need to step into this territory of creativity.”Elgammal has conducted tests with viewers, flesh-and-blood discriminators, to assess reactions to human-generated and machine-generated works. He says there is very little difference, and that, in fact, some people are more inspired by the art that is done by machine.Does this suggest AICAN works should be considered art? Not if your definition of art is that it should speak of the wider world or provide an emotional response to it. For the time being, AI art remains in the realm of science fiction.  The painting Divided Sunshine (2018), which was created using artificial intelligence. Photo: AICAN.io For me, personally, there is no question that what I and other serious artists in this field are creating with AI is art … it’s still me who plays the creative role in this relationship … and many curators, collectors and critics seem to agreeMario Klingemann This is not what art is aboutFrench artist Maurice Benayoun’s Brain Factory at Microwave FestivalMany see the extravagant US$432,500 paid last year for the world’s first AI art at auction as indicative of the art market in general.Klingemann, who describes Edmond de Belamy as “mediocre and unrepresentative”, says the sale “tells you more about the art market than about art”.Like Klingemann, Benayoun is frustrated with the fetishisation of art. A market in which an unnamed buyer spends US$91 million on Koons’ stainless steel sculpture of a rabbit is one that inspires incredulity.“The art market is important, of course, but who is inspired by this rabbit?” asks Benayoun, who has been described as France’s most cutting-edge artist.The art market is important, of course, but who is inspired by this rabbit? The technique of making a rabbit of steel or imitations of paintings made of bits … This is not what art is aboutMaurice Benayoun“The technique of making a rabbit of steel or imitations of paintings made of bits … This is not what art is about.“When someone invests US$91 million, I hope they will invest US$92 million in artist Piero Manzoni’s 1960s work Artist’s Shit – literally his own excrement in a can. This is a better artwork, was done long before, and it’s organic.“I hope whoever bought the rabbit will go bankrupt very soon as there are so many more relevant ways to spend this money. Art is supposed to help us understand the world and perhaps change it a little. Art is giving shape to ideas.”Benayoun is literally giving shape to ideas through a blockchain-based art project called Value of Va lues (VoV).In an attempt to find the real, economic value of human values through EEG (electroencephalography), an interactive art installation titled Brain Factory allows the audience to give a shape to abstract concepts through Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI), and then converts the resulting forms into physical objects.I hope whoever bought [Jeff Koons’] rabbit will go bankrupt very soon as there are so many more relevant ways to spend this money. Art is supposed to help us understand the world and perhaps change it a little. Art is giving shape to ideasMaurice BenayounSo anyone sitting in the artist’s chair can, merely by thinking of an abstract concept like justice, power or peace, can “design” them in 3D model form.The neuro-designed shapes are entered onto the blockchain and can be converted into cryptocurrency, giving a monetary value to the art. If thousands of the shapes are bartered or sold, all tracked in real time, this gives metaphorical insight into the relative value of human values and the workings of the art market.Yet projects such as VoV, and the fact that AI is able to create infinite variations around a concept or style, showing that the idea of a single perfect work is merely a dream, may be no match for the way in which the single artefact, the unique object, is revered today in an almost cultish fashion.“Art is a belief system, like a religion in which rationality has no place, so I doubt that the notion of art objects as fetishes that have arbitrary high values will go away any time soon,” Klingemann says.Want more stories like this?

The auction went on to capture public imagination, but not everyone was impressed, particularly other artists working within the field, who criticised the sale.

“The guys behind this stunt are not even artists, but a very talented start-up, who knew how – with an initially false narrative, the right keywords and some good contacts – to cash in on the hype,” German artist Mario Klingemann, one of the first creative coders to experiment with AI and art, says.
“I was disappointed that a marketing ploy as obvious as this actually worked.”
Klingemann’s own artwork, Memories of Passersby I, uses neural networks – what he calls “neurography” – to generate an infinite stream of imaginary portraits that are projected onto a two-screen installation.

Other versions followed. Memories of Passersby I was sold in March by Sotheby’s London for a much cooler US$51,000 with fees.
Robbie Barratt, a 19-year-old pioneer of GAN art, whose algorithms shared online via open-source licence were tweaked by Obvious for its project, has also reacted to the sale, describing Belamy as neither interesting nor original.

GANs are, by their nature, derivative: they don’t create, they generate.
Now a cornerstone of contemporary machine learning, GANs were first designed by researcher Ian Goodfellow in 2014.
Unlike the repetitious results produced by DeepDream, GANs can be trained to produce new and different images. But the images are still emulative and this, many agree, excludes them from serious consideration as art.

“People are interested in AI art because it looks like what we know as art, but this is not art, this is just reproduction, just imitation,” Maurice Benayoun, a professor at School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong, says.
“If a human was to make this art now, we would say it was bad art, so why is it interesting if a machine makes it?”
Art is about ideas; whether an artist uses a paint brush or AI, these are tools to communicate ideas. So while GANs themselves may not produce what many would consider as art, in the hands of an artist, they could indeed be used to speak of the world beyond the image.
“I’m not a painter,” says Klingemann. “My way of expression is through code. From my perspective, code allows me to translate what is in my head out into the world better than anything I could ever accomplish with my hands and physical tools.

“For me, personally, there is no question that what I and other serious artists in this field are creating with AI is art – and many curators, collectors and critics seem to agree.”

Klingemann is creatively involved throughout the art-making process, from the initial concept for a work, through selecting and modifying neural architectures, finding and curating data to train the models, combining various models and embedding them in other algorithms and, finally, choreographing and curating their output.
“AI in its current state is surprising, unpredictable and can be very inspiring but it’s still me who plays the creative role in this relationship,” he says.

A professor at Rutgers University in the United States has complicated the debate, however.
Ahmed Elgammal believes that AICAN – think GAN 2.0 – puts creativity firmly in the capabilities of machine intelligence.
“GAN tries to emulate images, but art must make something new. So we developed our creative adversarial network,” says Elgammal, a professor of computer science and director at Rutgers’ Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which created a program called AICAN (Artificial Intelligence Creative Adversarial Network).
Elgammal fed the program with images from across five centuries, from the Renaissance to the present day, all grouped into categories by aesthetic, so that it could learn the concept of style.
Like in GAN, AICAN was tasked with learning the aesthetics of existing works of art, but it was not allowed to closely emulate styles. This effectively gave the machine two opposing forces: follow the aesthetics, don’t repeat styles.
Much of AICAN’s art is abstract; Elgammal suggests this is perhaps because the algorithm has grasped that if it wants to make something novel, it cannot go back and produce figurative works as existed before the 20th century.
The AICAN artwork Divided Sunshine (2018), a pigment print on rag paper, is a field of blue over a hazy strip of white, reminiscent of the sky. A thick streak of deep red runs vertically down the centre of the image, alongside a thinner, incomplete strip, also red.
It was exhibited at SCOPE Miami Beach and The Arts+ in Frankfurt last year.
“The definition of creativity is a long and ongoing debate,” Elgammal says. “Immanuel Kant’s definition of the 18th century is based on two qualities: something has to be novel, and it has to have influence, like Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon [1907], which sparked the cubist movement. This definition helped inspire AICAN.”
“But the division of art and science – aesthetics as subjective and science as objective – can also be traced back to Kant, and I don’t believe this is true. I established this lab because I believe looking at art will advance AI. Intelligence is not just used in driving a car or playing chess, it is involved in listening to music, comprehending literature and enjoying art. If we want to build a machine that is intelligent, we need to step into this territory of creativity.”
Elgammal has conducted tests with viewers, flesh-and-blood discriminators, to assess reactions to human-generated and machine-generated works. He says there is very little difference, and that, in fact, some people are more inspired by the art that is done by machine.
Does this suggest AICAN works should be considered art? Not if your definition of art is that it should speak of the wider world or provide an emotional response to it. For the time being, AI art remains in the realm of science fiction.

For me, personally, there is no question that what I and other serious artists in this field are creating with AI is art … it’s still me who plays the creative role in this relationship … and many curators, collectors and critics seem to agree

This is not what art is about

Many see the extravagant US$432,500 paid last year for the world’s first AI art at auction as indicative of the art market in general.
Klingemann, who describes Edmond de Belamy as “mediocre and unrepresentative”, says the sale “tells you more about the art market than about art”.
Like Klingemann, Benayoun is frustrated with the fetishisation of art. A market in which an unnamed buyer spends US$91 million on Koons’ stainless steel sculpture of a rabbit is one that inspires incredulity.
“The art market is important, of course, but who is inspired by this rabbit?” asks Benayoun, who has been described as France’s most cutting-edge artist.
The art market is important, of course, but who is inspired by this rabbit? The technique of making a rabbit of steel or imitations of paintings made of bits … This is not what art is about
Maurice Benayoun
“The technique of making a rabbit of steel or imitations of paintings made of bits … This is not what art is about.
“When someone invests US$91 million, I hope they will invest US$92 million in artist Piero Manzoni’s 1960s work Artist’s Shit – literally his own excrement in a can. This is a better artwork, was done long before, and it’s organic.
“I hope whoever bought the rabbit will go bankrupt very soon as there are so many more relevant ways to spend this money. Art is supposed to help us understand the world and perhaps change it a little. Art is giving shape to ideas.”
Blocktails are the new cocktails: how blockchain tech is pushing new frontiers in the F&amp;B world
Benayoun is literally giving shape to ideas through a blockchain-based art project called Value of Va lues (VoV).
In an attempt to find the real, economic value of human values through EEG (electroencephalography), an interactive art installation titled Brain Factory allows the audience to give a shape to abstract concepts through Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI), and then converts the resulting forms into physical objects.
I hope whoever bought [Jeff Koons’] rabbit will go bankrupt very soon as there are so many more relevant ways to spend this money. Art is supposed to help us understand the world and perhaps change it a little. Art is giving shape to ideas
Maurice Benayoun
So anyone sitting in the artist’s chair can, merely by thinking of an abstract concept like justice, power or peace, can “design” them in 3D model form.
The neuro-designed shapes are entered onto the blockchain and can be converted into cryptocurrency, giving a monetary value to the art. If thousands of the shapes are bartered or sold, all tracked in real time, this gives metaphorical insight into the relative value of human values and the workings of the art market.
You can now own British singer George Michael&apos;s artworks – here&apos;s how
Yet projects such as VoV, and the fact that AI is able to create infinite variations around a concept or style, showing that the idea of a single perfect work is merely a dream, may be no match for the way in which the single artefact, the unique object, is revered today in an almost cultish fashion.
“Art is a belief system, like a religion in which rationality has no place, so I doubt that the notion of art objects as fetishes that have arbitrary high values will go away any time soon,” Klingemann says.

Event Summary
On July 10, AEI hosted Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun to discuss his recent book, “Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” (MIT Press, 2017), with AEI’s Brent Orrell and Stan Veuger.
Dr. Aoun introduced the concepts outlined in his book by calling attention to the widespread concern that artificial intelligence (AI) will destroy more jobs than it will create. In the discussion that followed, he demonstrated that while education providers will have to adjust, AI cannot automate out the workforce, as many jobs require human thought and connection. He emphasized that the key to responding to the challenges new technology is bringing to education and the workforce is to focus career training on the humanics and lifelong learning.
Dr. Aoun’s remarks were followed by a panel discussion with Mr. Orrell and Dr. Veuger, who emphasized the complexity of predicting the effects of automation on labor and highlighted strategies for retraining the workforce. Audience members also asked a series of questions, relating Dr. Aoun’s recommendations to the financial burden of higher education and to the value of liberal arts degrees in training the next generation in the humanics. The event concluded with Dr. Aoun highlighting the need for colleges and universities to incorporate experiential and lifelong learning, in which students connect theory learned in the classroom to practice outside of the classroom, into curriculums.

Event Description
Today, nearly every conversation about the future of work and the modern economy is dominated by the specter of robotics and intelligent machines. In his new book, “Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” (MIT Press, 2017), Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun confronts the need for colleges and universities to meet the challenge — and opportunity — presented by smart machines. His blueprint features three primary components: a new curriculum for the artificial intelligence age, the case for experiential learning, and a call for higher education to place lifelong learning at the heart of the educational enterprise.
Join AEI for a discussion on the key recommendations from Dr. Aoun’s book and the implications for the future of higher education and human capital development.

AI is changing the way we experience technology, and nowhere is its value as easily apparent as through our smartphones..It learns our preferences to personalise our news feeds and music playlists. It lets us upload photos that are Instagram-worthy and unlocks phones through facial recognition. It recognises and deciphers our voice and powers our digital assistants..Voice-enabled search is an increasingly preferred mode of vernacular web browsing, with 28 per cent of search queries in India being conducted by voice and Hindi search queries increasing by 400 per cent year on year (Indian consumers say big hello to voice-based devices, Tech Trend, Business Standard, 2019). This is increasingly true for the first-time users who find voice-based input more intuitive than typing on the phone..However, AI raises new challenges for the 40 million (More than a quarter of India’s population will be smartphone users this year, eMarketer, 2018) first-time smartphone users being added each year, especially women (Smartphone users in India 2018: 16% YoY Growth is the highest in the world, DazeInfo, 2018)..Lata, who resides in Chhattisgarh and uses her husband’s smartphone to watch the Mahabharat on a regional infotainment app, struggled to find maternal and child health content that was available on the same app — “I am not able to find videos on my child’s health on this application. I did not know it was there. I will use it now”. Why does AI fail to personalise content for her, thus limiting her ability meet her aspirations?.In its simplest form, AI uses an algorithm to monitor the user’s engagement with digital content, learning every time the user chooses to Like, Share, Play, and Skip. This information is leveraged to predict the relevance of future content, with higher usage resulting in better personalisation..Such usage-based algorithms are biased in favour of those who are active smartphone users. Where the system trips up, unfortunately, is on the fact that women are not active smartphone users on average..Like Lata, a large segment of women access smartphones that belong to a male family member, typically the father, the husband or the son. Our work in Chhattisgarh, where the government distributed 3.5 million smartphones to women, suggests that they tend to be the least active on these smartphones..As first-time users, often on ‘borrowed’ smartphones, women are a less likely to carry out even basics tasks on a mobile phone. For example, the gender gap for making / receiving calls and sending an SMS is approximately 20 per cent and 50 per cent percentage points, respectively (Wide gender gap in mobile phone access is hurting India’s women, IndiaSpend, 2018). .In such a context, AI is simply unable to learn about her likes and dislikes. Content is curated for frequent phone users such as children and men in the household..As such, women must scroll through a long list of articles and videos to discover what is relevant for them, reducing the efficacy of their time using the smartphone. AI, by the very nature of how it works, is leaving first time women users behind. .This is far from saying that AI is the root cause of the kind of digital inequality we see today. AI is a technological tool that is built to be neutral in a world that is built to be unequal..Patriarchal societal and cultural norms cause women to face restrictive environments, in which their needs are often de-prioritised over the needs of the child, or the family. It is a social ill that outdates digital technology by several centuries, and its effects cannot be willed away any time soon despite our best efforts..Other factors such as women’s lack of digital literacy and limited access to information channels compound the situation. Knowing that we cannot solve for gender inequality right away, the least we can do is ensure that advances in technology do not widen the inequality..An AI that works for women.A good starting point would be to work with solution providers who are willing to use a gender lens. We worked with one such provider to re-design an infotainment app using a human-centered design process to place a woman’s contexts and realities, and her needs and aspirations at the center of the design process. .We visited rural districts in Chhattisgarh and conducted HCD research through in-depth interviews, intercepts, group discussions, and observations. Using these research methods, the team tested prototypes for the digital solutions and co-designed specific User Interface/User Experience features with the women..Our interactions with Lata and over 80 other women revealed that traditional solutions — such as user profiles — don’t work for them. First-time users simply ignored the profiles as they were unfamiliar with the concept..Even those who understood the concept, raised privacy concerns as they did not want the profiles to become a way for the male members to inspect their usage. Passwords were hard to remember and only increased suspicion..Our work suggested a preference for non-dynamic navigable content categories — movies, songs, health and agriculture among others on the landing page. We discovered that they sought relevant content but within these categories..The convenience of this is analogous to being able to look up the right aisle in a super market to pick up the stuff you need rather than going through another frequent member’s shopping list. Pressed for time, and often struggling to use new services, women need AI that works for them..The next phase of growth in smartphone usage will come from women users.

The health system plans to deploy next-generation solutions and emerging technologies from Microsoft at a hospital facility in Seattle, in Microsoft’s backyard. (Providence St. Joseph Health)
Providence St. Joseph Health has formed a multiyear strategic alliance with tech giant Microsoft to modernize its health IT infrastructure across its entire system and leverage cloud and artificial intelligence technologies to improve health outcomes and reduce the total cost of care.The two organizations will work together to modernize Providence St. Joseph Health's IT infrastructure, particularly around informatics as well as its business infrastructure, Rod Hochman, M.D., president and CEO of Providence St. Joseph Health, told FierceHealthcare. ""All of us recognize that healthcare has been slow to this modernization and other industries have moved ahead at a more rapid rate,"" he said. The 51-hospital health system serves 10 million patients a year across seven states and operates more than 900 clinics. The Renton, Washington-based health system is in Microsoft's backyard, Hochman said, opening an opportunity to collaborate and transform the care experience.The health system plans to deploy next-generation solutions and emerging technologies from Microsoft and its partners at a hospital facility in Seattle, Washington, near Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters. A specific facility site has not yet been announced. The goal will be to scale these innovations across the entire Providence St. Joseph Health system to bring innovative and necessary solutions to more communities.""This is the most comprehensive partnership between a technology company and a health system,"" Hochman said.Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said in a statement that the goal of the partnership is to accelerate Providence St. Joseph Health’s digital transformation and to ""build new innovations together that are designed to improve health care delivery and outcomes.""RELATED: Providence St. Joseph Health launches business offering PBM service, population health expertiseThe two organizations will develop a portfolio of integrated solutions designed to improve care delivery by combining technologies from Microsoft with Providence St. Joseph Health’s data and clinical expertise. The alliance will accelerate the healthcare industry’s adoption of the cloud and enable data-driven clinical and operational decision-making by leveraging Microsoft Azure, and industry interoperability standards like FHIR, to integrate siloed data sources in a cloud environment that enables security and compliance, the organizations said.“At Microsoft, we believe that engaging a range of partners across the health care ecosystem will be required to improve the value of care that is provided,” Peter Lee, Ph.D., corporate vice president at Microsoft Healthcare, said in a statement. “With Providence St. Joseph Health, we believe we can work together to address many of the most difficult problems that affect the health care industry by combining Microsoft’s research, cloud, and productivity capabilities with Providence St. Joseph Health’s clinical expertise.” Hochman said there are several key elements to the strategic alliance which will develop over the next five years: ""The first is to heavily support our clinicians in making them more productive and to develop collaboration tools to make clinicians more effective, beyond what can do with their electronic health records.""RELATED: Providence St. Joseph Health acquires Epic IT solutions consultant Bluetree As part of the strategic alliance, Providence St. Joseph Health will use Microsoft Azure as its preferred cloud platform and standardize productivity and collaboration tools for its 119,000 caregivers on Microsoft 365. Health system doctors and nurses will use Microsoft Teams for more secure communication and collaboration, the organizations said.The health system plans to work with Microsoft to modernize its revenue cycle IT platform to become more efficient and reduce administrative costs. Providence St. Joseph Health will also transition out of eight data centers to a more flexible, secure cloud environment and harness cloud computing and analytics, Hochman said.The IT modernization will also improve the care experience for consumers, Hochman said: ""Consumers want their experience in healthcare to be a little bit more integrated, to say the least. This work will enable doctors, clinicians and nurses to have as much information at the point of care as possible.""By working with Microsoft to leverage AI, the health system will be able to tackle ""low-hanging fruit,"" Hochman noted: ""We think AI is going to be tremendously helpful, particularly in clinical decision making, orthopedics, the neurosciences, and cancer, and being able to combine research and AI to accelerate it.""The strategic alliance with Microsoft also ties into the health system's focus on nonclinical projects within its business. In February, Providence St. Joseph Health launched Ayin Health Solutions, a population health company, to offer expertise to help payers, providers, employers and government entities with the shift to value-based care. RELATED: HIMSS19: Providence St. Joseph Health acquires revenue cycle management blockchain startupIt also recently announced plans to acquire Bluetree, an Epic consulting and strategy company that helps healthcare providers maximize their return on their electronic health record investment. The health system also owns Engage, which has grown to become one of the largest Meditech solution companies in the United States, according to the health system.The health system acquired Seattle-based Lumedic, a revenue cycle management company based on blockchain technology, with the aim of streamlining data sharing and improving claims processing.Mike Butler, PSJH's president of strategy and operations, told Xconomy that the Bluetree deal is part of the health system's plan to create a billion-dollar company from its nonclinical projects. The health system expects the company to produce 20% EBITDA by 2023. Annual revenue so far is $44 million for Engage and $15 million for the Community Connect business, according to the Xconomy article.""We’ve recognized in our own organization that besides providing direct healthcare it's important for healthcare organizations our size to also be a service organization,"" Hochman said. ""The things that come out of the Microsoft partnership to facilitate clinical and business operations for our health system could be exportable to other health systems to improve the administrative back office as well as clinical tools and AI to transform healthcare.""

(Shutterstock)New and growing computing powers generated by artificial intelligence (AI), developed right here in Vancouver, could help solve the world’s most pressing problems.ADVERTISEMENT
In recent years, the city has developed a global reputation for having one of the world’s largest clusters of forefront AI companies — and now, it can add Fujitsu to the list.

The Tokyo-based multinational company recently opened its global AI headquarters office at One Bentall Centre in downtown Vancouver. It is a relatively lean operation right now, but by the end of the year its workforce could nearly triple, with continued growth expected over the coming years, matching the exponential growth of market demand for AI-based solutions.ADVERTISEMENT
According to Dean Prelazzi, vice-president and head of business development and marketing for Fujitsu Inteligence Technology (FIT), Vancouver is a highly strategic location for the company.
“[There is] tremendous innovation, a big ecosystem, lots of opportunities to work in collaboration with a variety of organizations and companies, and the startup ecosystem is particularly rich and diverse,” Prelazzi told Daily Hive.
He further emphasized Vancouver’s importance to FIT: “We are committed to being here.”
Local universities, namely the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University, provide the local ecosystem with an immense research environment. This is coupled with the industry-level research-and-development outputs and capacities of local giants in quantum computing and data science, specifically TRIUMF, D-Wave Systems, and 1QBit, which is closely associated with Fujitsu.ADVERTISEMENT
Vancouver also has close connections with Asia, especially Fujitsu’s homebase in Japan, and Silicon Valley, and it is also important for FIT to establish a presence in North America, given that is the largest market in the world for AI “by a long shot.”
Government policies on the federal level are also helping catalyze the country’s global leadership in AI. In 2017, Canada became the first country in the world to establish a strategy for developing AI, and this was paired with $125 million in public funding spanning a period of five years.
“As a result of this strategy, Canada is at the forefront globally of leading this cerebral thinking of AI and its impact on society,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT
While Japanese AI in popular media may be more commonly associated with the development of robotics, FIT’s mandate is more grounded in optimizing and commercialization calculations of high-variable problems that were previously beyond the capacity of conventional computing.
This is also about being proactive, before technological developments on computing hit the wall on the limits of Moore’s Law.
FIT’s work in Vancouver centres around its quantum-inspired digital annealer, which combines the power and speed of quantum computing using everyday physical equipment.
“We’re at a point at the development of our society, with respect to getting to the ceiling of computational power, that we need more power if we are going to solve the largest problems in the world… if we are going to solve climate change and cure the diseases of the world and push the limits of drug discovery,” continued Prelazzi.ADVERTISEMENT
He pointed to FIT’s ongoing work with European shipping company Konsberg, which uses the company’s technology’s to analyze weather data to determine the best and most efficient open ocean routes for its cargo ships.
By using AI to optimize vessel fuel usage, it is estimated each cargo ship could save up to $1 million per year in marine fuel costs, and in the process also reduce the level of high sulfur emissions.
In other transportation analysis work for the Japan Post Service, the optimization of route combinations, truck types, and mail and cargo led to an 8% reduction in the number of postal vehicles, 30% reduction in driving time, and 7% reduction in costs.
More recently, FIT began working with the City of Montreal to improve its services and mobility through smart city applications.ADVERTISEMENT
There is immense potential for its AI to be used to optimize manufacturing, particularly the monotonous tasks of production line robots, and even in-store retail. Applications of AI in stores can increase customer engagement and improve self check-out systems, with new AI-powered methods that reduce increasingly apparent fraud problems at the honour system-based kiosks.
In the financial sector, AI is already being used to model the potential direction of stock markets, analyze signatures, help detect fraudulent patterns, and improve security.
And AI in healthcare could go as far as assisting with biopsy diagnostics, helping healthcare practitioners reveal hidden correlations, identify previous care patterns, and create data that previously was not available.
“We’re still challenged in pushing the upper limits of where we need quantum to be in order for it to be integrated as a mainstream operation to solve large problems in production,” said Prelazzi.ADVERTISEMENT
“This digital technology alleviates those challenges and allows companies today to start taking advantage of solving real, very large problems.”
Fujitsu employs 140,000 people globally, and it also has offices in Toronto and Montreal. Founded in 1935, the Fortune 500 company is the world’s second oldest information technology company — just after IBM and ahead of Hewlett Packard.

The European Commission has given itself the mission of drawing up rules for the age of artificial intelligence over the next five years, building on its legacy as the world’s premier regulator of online privacy.
With Europe trying to catch up to China and the United States in developing AI, some researchers and tech companies have warned against hard rules they say could slow innovation.
But top EU officials are undeterred.

Ursula von der Leyen, the next European Commission president, has joined national governments and EU digital policymakers in calling for hard rules to govern artificial intelligence, sooner rather than later.
“In my first 100 days in office, I will put forward legislation for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of artificial intelligence,” the German former defense minister, who was narrowly confirmed by the European Parliament this week, wrote in her agenda for Europe.
“It will be the job of the next Commission to deliver something so that we have regulation similar to the General Data Protection Regulation that makes it clear that artificial intelligence serves humanity” — German Chancellor Angela Merkel
Her predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, chose not to legislate on AI over the past five years, focusing instead on privacy, cybersecurity, copyright and telecoms.
But AI, which allows computers to do tasks that previously required human thinking, has grabbed policymakers’ attention. The prospect of major AI-linked disruption in industries such as health, agriculture and transport has fueled debate over whether hard rules are necessary, as well as over who should be in charge of writing them.
To determine the scope of regulation, the Commission relied on an expert group including academics, civil society and industry representatives.

The group recently said the EU should think twice about drafting new legislation.
But capitals want to push ahead. In late June, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she wants rules similar to the General Data Protection Regulation — Europe’s sweeping privacy reform — to see the light of day in the next five years.
“It will be the job of the next Commission to deliver something so that we have regulation similar to the General Data Protection Regulation that makes it clear that artificial intelligence serves humanity,” she said.
The European Commission’s digital department has already started working on such a plan, according to an internal document from June, seen by POLITICO. Artificial intelligence “carries huge promises (from treating chronic diseases ...[to] anticipating cybersecurity risks), but also concerns (job losses, ethical implications),” it states.
The document is not final, and commissioners could choose not to follow up on the recommendations. But von der Leyen’s statements indicate she is ready to go in that direction.
Specifically, the Commission’s digital department recommends a regulatory framework for AI that would set transparency obligations on automated decision-making. The legislation would also require that AI systems be assessed to ensure they do not perpetuate discrimination or violate fundamental rights such as privacy.

Systems that could have a negative impact, such as facial recognition, would face “further constraints.” Voluntary measures, such as certifications or codes of conduct, could also be added to the framework.
A European industrial strategy for AI should also be defined, the Commission recommends. Investment in research and innovation should be increased by using EU programs from the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), such as Horizon Europe.

Artificial intelligence jobs are not a new phenomenon, but the AI job market is growing as AI market itself is seeing rapid expansion. According to research firm IDC, AI is currently seeing an annual growth rate approach 40 percent.
Amid these changes, AI job titles have changed and expanded – and AI paychecks are heading skyward. Earlier roles were “statistician” or “mathematician,” while today you’ll hear newer terms like “data scientist”  and “predictive analytics expert.”
The rapid emergence of new AI titles reflects the fact that AI has become practical for mainstream use as the result of affordable cloud computing and storage costs, a change from prohibitively expensive supercomputers. The growth of AI companies and the expansion of related technology like machine learning has expanded AI job titles.
Similarly, some of the AI algorithms used today have existed for several decades, but until recently, they lacked the volume and richness of data required to drive value. Now there are many different types of AI jobs or roles available, some of which merely add “AI” to an existing title (e.g., “AI developer”). Others reflect different aspects of AI (e.g., “data engineer,” “algorithm developer” or “machine learning scientist”).
For the purpose of this article, AI job titles, their general job descriptions and their salary ranges are limited to technical titles.

A typical ad for an AI job in today’s rapid growth artificial intelligence sector.
AI Job Titles
Jobseekers and career builders are wise not to take AI job titles at face value. For example, some companies require data scientist candidates to hold a PhD or MS in Computer Science or Statistics, while other organizations may accept a BS or even no college degree and certain types of experience. Similarly, a “senior” title may require a graduate degree and more experience at some companies than others.
Some of today’s most popular AI job titles include:

AI developer


AI engineer


Algorithm developer


AWS machine learning engineer


Azure data scientist


Data scientist


Lead data engineer


Lead data scientist


Machine learning scientist


ML data developer


Senior data scientist


Senior ML engineer

AI Job Descriptions
It is important to read the mandatory requirements of any job listing to determine whether it is actually a fit. For example, some technical AI positions require R and Python expertise whereas others may only require R or Python experience.
Sometimes job descriptions, including candidate requirements, can differ by industry. For example, in scientific industries such as pharmaceutical companies, PhDs are common, so they may require more advanced degrees for some positions than organizations operating in other industries such as advertising.
Another reason to maintain an open mind about job descriptions is that the people writing and approving job requisitions may lack the technical expertise to articulate what the organization actually needs. The result is sometimes unrealistic qualifications that even the most sought-after experts lack.
Following are some sample job descriptions that are based on actual job postings. They have been abbreviated for easier comparison.

AI Pay Scale 
AI-related jobs tend to share very similar compensation ranges, which may be misleading. While it may seem odd that people with the same title could have base compensation that varies by $50,000 or $100,000, some of the differences have to do with the present levels of compensation in specific markets. For example, jobs in San Francisco and Manhattan tend to pay more than those in other major metropolitan areas given the cost-of-living differences.
Also, a “senior” title may not necessarily be reflected in compensation, which may seem odd. In medium and large companies, those with senior titles tend to be compensated more than people with similar but more junior titles. However, smaller companies with more modest budgets may advertise a senior title in lieu of senior compensation to lure career builders.  
Job candidates should therefore go into a job search with an open mind and research what’s available at that point in time. The candidate should also be clear about which titles and compensation packages are acceptable since a better title may not mean more pay or vice versa.
Current salary ranges for the positions discussed above are:

AI developer: $90,000 – $150,000


AI engineer – $130,000 – $210,000


Algorithm developer – $90,000 – $130,000

Experts predict how AI will transform the workplaceThis article is more than 5 years oldAs artificial intelligence is increasingly introduced into business, an expert panel – hosted by the Guardian – forecast how it will change our working livesSA MathiesonThu 18 Jul 2019 06.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Jul 2019 06.04 EDTShareWorkplaces should use automation technologies to enhance employees’ jobs rather than to replace humans, according to speakers at an event held by the Guardian on 11 July. However, they saw problems in the introduction of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, the latter including software as well as physical machines.Will robots replace us?“Humans should not worry too much about replacement, but need to find new ways to work together with AI,” said Chelsea Chen, co-founder of Emotech, a company which makes a voice-operated device called Olly that aims to recognise users’ emotions as well the content of speech.Chen said that human employees are likely to remain better at dealing with people’s emotions than computers. She says Olly can express excitement in response to what a user says, but that does not make it conscious: “Any job which is highly relevant to people will be really hard to replace.”Automation is ideal for office chores that divert employees from their actual jobs, argued Manu Dell’Aquila, technology transformation manager for software staffing consultancy Red Commerce. “There isn’t a single person in my business who will not say there are not enough hours in the day,” he said, and automating administration would help with this.But he added that in some cases automation will lead to redundancies, such as drivers being replaced by autonomous vehicles, and some organisations could force staff to train their software replacements. “I would want to work with staff to build a better set of processes for them to do a more fulfilling job,” he said. “Is that approach going to be used by everybody? Probably not.”Can robots be trusted with the important stuff in business?Cecilia Harvey, chief operating officer of security-focused technology company Quant Network, said that two decades working in banking technology have made her wary about allowing automated systems to manage important processes. She said technology suppliers often tell “the happy trail story”, which talks about improved efficiency and financial savings while ignoring the increased risk of failures.“There are going to be errors, whether it’s humans or robots. It’s more about where do you want those errors to occur,” Harvey said. This means it may make more sense to focus on internal processes where mistakes are unlikely to cause significant problems. But when they could affect clients or have a regulatory impact, “that’s probably not where I would want to have AI. I would want to seriously look deep into what the potential losses are associated with that – not only to clients but to the firm.” She added that this could include reputational damage and recruitment difficulties, as well as financial costs.View image in fullscreen(Panel L-R) Manu Dell’Aquila, technology transformation manager, RED Solutions; Chelsea Chen, co-founder, Emotech; Cecilia Harvey, chief operation officer, Quant Network; Alastair Jardin, head of product, Trint; Alex Hern, UK technology editor, The Guardian. Pictured at the Guardian offices. Photograph: n/a/The GuardianAlastair Jardine, head of product for speech transcription service Trint, said there are specific risks involved with the data needed to establish artificial intelligence systems. These typically develop probability-based models of how to behave by processing large amounts of “training data”, such as audio files of speech and the resulting transcriptions. “We have to be so aware of the data we are using to train things,” said Jardine, adding by way of example that if training data for an automatic transcription service includes swearing, the system may include these words by mistake in its output.Jardine added that there are questions of ethics and privacy over how training data is gathered. Technology giants such as Amazon and Google use much of the information they collect as training data, including through their voice-activated speaker services: “What Amazon has done in gathering voice data and not anonymising it in a sufficient way really worries me,” he said. Google does much the same: “You are effectively training their algorithms for them.”Full disclosure is necessaryPanel members agreed that users should be told whether they are communicating with a human or with software, and when they are being handed from one to the other. “I’m always for full disclosure, and being clear with users that they are speaking to a robot,” said Harvey.Despite the problems to be overcome, the panellists were optimistic over how workplaces will use artificial intelligence systems in five years’ time. Harvey said they could contribute to staff wellbeing, such as through a chatbot asking employees every day if they are happy with work. Jardine expects it will be possible for employees to set up AI systems themselves, rather than needing experts to do this. Chen said organisations could be using AI to open access to high-quality medical diagnosis and education across the world, given the low cost of adding more users to a working automated system.Dell’Aquila said that the workplaces most likely to accept such developments are those aiming to expand their businesses, rather than put people out of work. “I would like the AI revolution within a business to come from a business, not just thrown in from above or by technology teams,” he said.The panel spoke at the Guardian offices on 11 July 2019.Explore more on these topicsSmarter workingArtificial intelligence (AI)Business to businessComputingWork & careersRobotsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

So how do you make sure you’re still employed when the music stops? Thriving in the age of automation is less about picking a safe job and more about constantly updating your skills, according to Northeastern University President Joseph Aoun, who wrote Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. His approach, which he calls humanics, emphasises three areas. First, technical ability, which is understanding how machines work. Second, data discipline, which is learning how to navigate the information that's generated by these machines. And finally, the human discipline, which he defines as “what we humans can do that machines for the foreseeable future, cannot emulate”. The good news is that many of the jobs that go will be replaced by others. Some studies even suggest there’ll be a net increase. But disruption is very likely, and it’s difficult to know which jobs are in danger. That’s why Aoun thinks a learning philosophy might be more useful. The bad news, unfortunately, is that you’ll probably be doing homework forever.This is one of the 101 indispensable things you need to know about work today.

Patrick Winston, a beloved professor and computer scientist at MIT, died on July 19 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 76.
 
A professor at MIT for almost 50 years, Winston was director of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory from 1972 to 1997 before it merged with the Laboratory for Computer Science to become MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
 
A devoted teacher and cherished colleague, Winston led CSAIL’s Genesis Group, which focused on developing AI systems that have human-like intelligence, including the ability to tell, perceive, and comprehend stories. He believed that such work could help illuminate aspects of human intelligence that scientists don’t yet understand.
 
“My principal interest is in figuring out what’s going on inside our heads, and I’m convinced that one of the defining features of human intelligence is that we can understand stories,'” said Winston, the Ford Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, in a 2011 interview for CSAIL. “Believing as I do that stories are important, it was natural for me to try to build systems that understand stories, and that shed light on what the story-understanding process is all about.”
 
He was renowned for his accessible and informative lectures, and gave a hugely popular talk every year during the Independent Activities Period called “How to Speak.” 
 
“As a speaker he always had his audience in the palm of his hand,” says MIT Professor Peter Szolovits. “He put a tremendous amount of work into his lectures, and yet managed to make them feel loose and spontaneous. He wasn’t flashy, but he was compelling and direct. ”
 
Winston’s dedication to teaching earned him many accolades over the years, including the Baker Award, the Eta Kappa Nu Teaching Award, and the Graduate Student Council Teaching Award.
 
“Patrick’s humanity and his commitment to the highest principles made him the soul of EECS,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a letter to the MIT community. “I called on him often for advice and feedback, and he always responded with kindness, candor, wisdom and integrity.  I will be forever grateful for his counsel, his objectivity, and his tremendous inspiration and dedication to our students.”
 
Teaching computers to think
Born Feb. 5, 1943 in Peoria, Illinois, Winston was always exceptionally curious about science, technology and how to use such tools to explore what it means to be human. He was an MIT-lifer starting in 1961, earning his bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees from the Institute before joining the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1970.
 
His thesis work with Marvin Minsky centered on the difficulty of learning, setting off a trajectory of work where he put a playful, yet laser-sharp focus on fine-tuning AI systems to better understand stories.
 
His Genesis project aimed to faithfully model computers after human intelligence in order to fully grasp the inner workings of our own motivations, rationality, and perception. Using MIT research scientist Boris Katz’s START natural language processing system and a vision system developed by former MIT PhD student Sajit Rao, Genesis can digest short, simple chunks of text, then spit out reports about how it interpreted connections between events.
 
While the system has processed many works, Winston chose “Macbeth” as a primary text because the tragedy offers an opportunity to take big human themes, such as greed and revenge, and map out their components.
 
“[Shakespeare] was pretty good at his portrayal of ‘the human condition,’ as my friends in the humanities would say,” Winston told The Boston Globe. “So there’s all kinds of stuff in there about what’s typical when we humans wander through the world.”
 
His deep fascination with humanity, human intelligence, and how we communicate information spilled over into what he often described as his favorite academic activity: teaching.
 
“He was a superb educator who introduced the field to generations of students,” says MIT Professor and longtime colleague Randall Davis. “His lectures had an uncanny ability to move in minutes from the details of an algorithm to the larger issues it illustrated, to yet larger lessons about how to be a scientist and a human being.”
 
A past president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Winston also wrote and edited numerous books, including a seminal textbook on AI that’s still used in classrooms around the world. Outside of the lab he also co-founded Ascent Technology, which produces scheduling and workforce management applications for major airports.
 
He is survived by his wife Karen Prendergast and his daughter Sarah.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

With new technology available to us, we’re inching closer to the end of the days when deciphering ancient languages is a painstaking task filled with frustration and confusion. Nifty machines following complex algorithms are helping researchers around the globe as they take on the often monumental task of understanding ancient texts and lost languages.
Big Think reports that linguistic experts estimate there have been approximately 31,000 languages spoken throughout human history. Many of them are now dead and forgotten, but a new AI project may be part of the answer in how to decipher the writing of ancient languages.
How could something like this work? As Big Think points out:
“While languages change, many of the symbols and how the words and characters are distributed stay relatively constant over time. Because of that, you could attempt to decode a long-lost language if you understood its relationship to a known progenitor language.”



And that knowledge is the basis for the work of a joint team of researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab and the AI project called Google Brain. According to Discover Magazine the project team has ‘devised an algorithm that can begin to match words from unknown languages to related words, or cognates, in languages that share the same root.’ By using computing and linguistics advancements the project is make headway in creating algorithms that will help other researchers decipher ancient texts.

Exploring an Ancient and Undeciphered Language: Eteocypriot and the Amathus Bilingual Inscription

And while the algorithm hasn’t been applied to undeciphered languages such as Olmec, Linear A, or Proto-Elamite script yet, the researchers behind it have shown it’s an advance in translating texts that have enough examples to provide a decent dataset for the algorithms to work with. So far their work has focused on training the system with Linear B and Ugaritic – two ancient languages that have mostly been translated by other means in the past.

Working with Linear B and Ugaritic
Linear B is a script that was used by the Mycenaean civilization in the Late Bronze Age, 3000-plus years ago. It was first deciphered in 1953 by an architect named Michael Ventris. Ugaritic on the other hand is a cuneiform early Hebrew language that also dates back some 3000 years. It was first identified by French archaeologists in 1929.

To test the AI system, Big Think reports the researchers “focused on 4 key properties related to the context and alignment of the characters to be deciphered – distributional similarity, monotonic character mapping, structural sparsity and significant cognate overlap.”
It seems the effort was worthwhile because a report on the project states that: “When applied to the decipherment of Ugaritic, we achieve a 5.5% absolute improvement over state-of-the-art results. We also report the first automatic results in deciphering Linear B, a syllabic language related to ancient Greek, where our model correctly translates 67.3% of cognates.”

That means this could be a helpful tool for the researchers who want to speed up their work in studying these ancient scripts. While the creativity and understanding of past cultures is undoubtedly part of translation work – and something AI isn’t able to do yet – Big Think mentions the biggest plus to the new program “it can simply take a brute force approach that would be too exhausting for humans.” With the AI’s help, researchers “can attempt to translate symbols of an unknown alphabet by quickly testing it against symbols from one language after another, running them through everything that is already known.”





What Can AI Translation Teach Us?
By cracking the codes of ancient languages we will be able to gain much more insight into what life was like in ancient cultures. All sorts of insight could be gained on social, political, cultural, and everyday matters.
As technology keeps improving, it makes sense that researchers want to take advantage of it. Why spends hours upon hours painstakingly trying to compare the letters of the most distant with something more recognizable today when a machine can accomplish the same task in much less time (and with far less frustration)?

In December 2018, BBC reported that Émilie Pagé-Perron, a researcher in Assyriology at the University of Toronto, was “coordinating a project to machine translate 69,000 Mesopotamian administrative records from the 21st Century BC.”
As Pagé-Perron explained, even though we have garnered much information through archaeological digs and analysis, there’s still a missing element that can be filled in by translating ancient texts:





“We have information about so many different aspects of the lives of Mesopotamian people, and we can’t really profit from the expertise of people in different fields like economics or politics, who if they had access to the sources, could help us tremendously to understand those societies better.”

Jacob Dahl, a professor of Assyriology at the University of Oxford, says that “We have more sources from Mesopotamia than we have from Greece, Rome and ancient Egypt together.” But only 10% of the thousands of examples of tablets and seals have been deciphered – the problem is not the lack of texts to work with, but finding enough experts who can read it.
The BBC report states that the Pagé-Perron team are “training algorithms on a sample of 4,000 ancient administrative texts from a digitised database. Each records transactions or deliveries of sheep, reed bundles or beer to a temple or an individual.” And while Pagé-Perron admits that the standalone texts are less than exciting, she believes “they’re extremely interesting if you take them as groups of texts.”
Irving Finkel, curator of the 130,000 cuneiform tablets in the British Museum’s collection, provides even more of a reason for making these translations of Sumerian writing possible:
“Sumerian is probably the last member of what must have been a large family of languages that goes back thousands and thousands of years. Writing appeared in the world just in time to rescue Sumerian… We’re just lucky that we had some ‘microphone’ that picked it up before it went away with all the others […] It’s actually rather astonishing how interesting it is when you find a human mind across millennia, where it is like talking to them on the telephone. It’s the most exciting thing in the world when you meet one of these people.”

Finkel’s excitement is easily applied to other ancient cultures as well. Any ancient text translation may be the next big breakthrough in uncovering the biggest secrets in humanity’s past.
But that’s not to say that AI is anywhere near ready to take over for the good old-fashioned human creativity and social understanding that’s often needed to make the mental leaps that are necessary to making sense of old writing. For now, it’s just another amazing tool that can help researchers on the quest to make sense of what our ancient ancestors thought important enough to jot down or laboriously carve into tablets.

Many fear about the future of artificial intelligence and robotics. There are multiple factors supporting the claim that AI is in fact not a threat to humankind, but rather an advantage. One factor is that humans thrives off of social interaction and human communication, which robots evidently can’t provide. While online chatbots are a useful and efficient form of artificial intelligence, robots lack the necessary emotional connection to humans. In addition, while AI can replace certain human occupations, it also has the potential to increase job opportunities for people in the technology field. Lastly, as seen at Walmart, AI can improve the efficiency of employees without necessarily replacing them. Artificial intelligence is an amazing technological advancement and it isn’t a threat to humankind.Most humans partake in social interaction countless times per day. Whether it’s speaking with family members, meeting with colleagues or ordering food and drink at a restaurant, social interaction keeps humankind moving forward. A study published in 1997 by Lisa F. Berkman and S. Leonard Syme, discovered that “people who lacked social and community ties were more likely to die in the follow-up period than those with more extensive contacts,” emphasizing the need for social interaction. People need social interaction to live long, healthy lives — and artificial intelligence can limit this. While AI can easily replace humans in various customer service jobs, the potential for AI to replace humans in the business world and other occupations based on social interaction is much more limited.In addition to limiting social interaction, some fear that AI will replace many human jobs. Keith Block, author for The World Economic Forum, explains that advancements in the field of technology have historically created jobs. His claim is supported by various examples, such as “the advent of diesel, the internal combustion engine and electricity caused societal disruptions as workers moved from farms to cities, yet these innovations brought us Ford’s Model T, refrigeration, mechanised agriculture and an age of mass production that produced a new global middle class.” Keith suggests that while the structure of the job market may change, new jobs surrounding artificial intelligence will likely develop, as has happened in the past.While AI can pose a targeted threat to white collar jobs, it will eventually spark a new wave of job opportunities once the initiatives are in full swing. Box is an “enterprise content management platform” meaning they deal with “sharing and accessing files,” as well as “data retention and governance.” Due to the relevance of AI in that field, their chief product officer Jeetu Patel discussed artificial intelligence in an interview for Forbes, saying it will “enable workforces to spend more energy on deep thinking versus completing low value tasks like data entry. With work that can be automated, enterprises can redistribute talent resources and gain cost savings.” Overall, artificial intelligence will benefit humankind greatly without posing a threat to our society. AI will replace some tedious forms of labor will be replaced in the workplace, developing our society to be higher functioning and more successful. While there are many pros and cons to the integration of AI in the workplace, it will benefit humanity more than it will harm it. Maddy Piovano is a junior media arts and design major.

Nobody waits for the government to do something. It happens automatically,” Ben-Israel told Science|Business. In the country of eight million often referred to as “start-up nation”, reality has kept pace with rhetoric. AI-related investments in Israel are surging: 37 per cent of the total capital raised last year was for AI companies, according to a report from Start-Up Nation Central, which tracks and supports investment deals. Ben-Israel, a long-time figure in Israeli research, is leading the multi-committee work on the government’s AI vision along with another big name, Eviatar Matania, founder and former head of the Israel National Cyber Bureau. Both were chosen for their past roles in making cybersecurity products and services one of Israel’s biggest exports. Ben-Israel was chief cybernetics adviser to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu from 2010-2012, when he launched the national cyber initiative, propelling the country into the top five leaders of the global cyber industry. Today, according to estimates, some 20 per cent of the total global investment in cybersecurity pours into Israeli companies and start-ups.   “We took cybersecurity out into the real world and made it a legitimate pursuit for the economy,” Ben-Israel said. “I started the cyber revolution here, and now with some of my help we are looking to repeat the trick with AI.” Israel’s strength in applying AI to computer vision, which benefits greatly from the country’s huge investment in military equipment, is beginning to extend into a range of different industries. One of the biggest successes is Mobileye Vision Technology, which provides technology for autonomous vehicles. Founded in Jerusalem in 1999, the company develops image processing algorithms to interpret images from conventional cameras, to see traffic. The money raised in its initial public offering in the US in 2014 was the largest ever by an Israeli firm. Three years later, Intel, the world's largest chipmaker and one of Israel’s largest private employers, purchased the company for $15.3 billion. Now, Mobileye aims to start trials of self-driving cars in Israel next year, with hopes of commercialising a robo-taxi service. At the same time, Israel aims to become a world leader in medical applications of AI, with companies developing algorithms that use patient data and lifestyle information to speed up and inform diagnoses. Hospitals are amassing a huge and valuable collection of data. “Everyone has their records registered with four big insurance groups, so it’s quite a centralised system here, unlike in the US,” said Shai Bagon, an AI researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science. “Everyone is aware of the potential of this data and there is an initiative to try and open it securely.” Growing demand There are some constraints on the growth of AI, however. “We would like to triple the number of AI graduates but many of our professors are going to work in the private sector. So here’s a problem that can’t be solved by the market – it has to be the government,” Ben-Israel said. The answer, he suggests, is to grant researchers more flexibility to work between university and the private sector. “The rule could be that a researcher has to spend 20 per cent of their time at university. It’s not a lot, but if you make them choose between university or industry, they’re going to choose industry.” It is already the case that some researchers share their time between universities and tech companies, like Google and Facebook, which have research hubs in the country. “They are here for the talent, and they bring money,” Ben-Israel says. Israel’s strict immigration laws create additional competition for AI recruits. Opening more positions in computer science departments around the country would help “bring excellent researchers back to Israel”, argues Jonathan Berant, senior lecturer at the Blavatnik School of Computer Science in Tel-Aviv University. “[Our] university would like to hire more faculty but it is hard to fill the positions at this point where demand is very high.” Academics are drawn to the private sector by far higher salaries, but also the opportunity to work with more processing power. “There are types of research that require large amounts of computational resources that are only available in industry,” Berant says. He proposes that universities work out a way to share servers. “[We] can substantially improve the quality of research by distributing resources better and having better IT services,” he said. AI in defence There is no doubt that Israel’s defence establishment helps drive the country’s tech success. However, Ben-Israel prefers not to discuss whether investments by the armed forces and intelligence services in high tech surveillance tools could give Israel an edge in AI. Much of the work undertaken by Israeli defence agencies inevitably remains in the shadows. “This kind of research is not open to the wider AI community,” said Bagon. “They understandably keep their cards close to their chest.” Israeli men and women are required to perform military service after secondary school. Many gain experience in a variety of high technology systems and that leads directly to careers. Tech companies make no secret of their military backgrounds; start-ups’ websites regularly highlight the units in which the founders served. There is some public information on new AI defence systems under development in the country. The Times of Israel has reported that an Israeli armed robotic vehicle called the Guardium has been used on the Gaza border. Another Israeli company, Rafael Advanced Defense System, says on its website that it has developed a bomb that can use autonomous capabilities to navigate and correct its location in environments where the global positioning system has been inactivated. Chinese competition China and the US are seen as head-to-head in competing for AI leadership, but Ben-Israel suggests that Chinese strengths in the field have been over-promoted. “There’s no difference between brains, it’s the conditions of the ecosystem and culture,” he said. “You have Chinese Nobel Laureates, for instance, but more often than not they did not win for research carried out in China.” “Harmony is one of the main values in China, so people don’t try and differentiate themselves from others. You don’t go into the streets with pink hair. Obedience to certain rules in society is too important,” Ben-Israel said. “As long as they have these values, it’s very difficult to see how they will grow to become a large innovative country. The same [deference] to authority didn’t work out in the Soviet Union,” he says. Israel doesn’t have it all figured out either. Start-ups there, like in Europe, face challenges in scaling up to become bigger, sustainable businesses; many promising companies leave to find bigger markets in the US. Thousands of start-ups are being developed in incubators, but the country has only a handful of so-called unicorns, or start-ups valued at over $1 billion. The success rate for new businesses in Israel is low at 5 per cent. It’s not hurting motivation, though. “In Israel, we have five new start-ups per day; or 1,500 a year with maybe 200 surviving,” said Ben-Israel. “What makes us good in science and business is that we’re not ashamed to fail, or too timid to tell people how to do things differently and better.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

Tel Aviv, Israel - The Israeli government is developing a national strategy to make the country a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), and according to one researcher involved in drawing up the plan, the starting point could hardly be better. 
“There’s not much that needs to be done, in fact; the government has to send a signal, that’s all,” said Isaac Ben-Israel, a former Israeli defence force major general who, among many other titles, is head of the Security Studies programme in Tel Aviv University. 
“There is in fact a lot of money already invested in AI research here by global companies. Nobody waits for the government to do something. It happens automatically,” Ben-Israel told Science|Business.

AI-related investments in Israel are surging: 37 per cent of the total capital raised last year was for AI companies, according to a report from Start-Up Nation Central, which tracks and supports investment deals. 
Ben-Israel, a long-time figure in Israeli research, is leading the multi-committee work on the government’s AI vision along with another big name, Eviatar Matania, founder and former head of the Israel National Cyber Bureau.
Both were chosen for their past roles in making cybersecurity products and services one of Israel’s biggest exports.

Tech companies make no secret of their military backgrounds; start-ups’ websites regularly highlight the units in which the founders served. 
There is some public information on new AI defence systems under development in the country. The Times of Israel has reported that an Israeli armed robotic vehicle called the Guardium has been used on the Gaza border. Another Israeli company, Rafael Advanced Defense System, says on its website that it has developed a bomb that can use autonomous capabilities to navigate and correct its location in environments where the global positioning system has been inactivated.
Chinese competition
China and the US are seen as head-to-head in competing for AI leadership, but Ben-Israel suggests that Chinese strengths in the field have been over-promoted. 
“There’s no difference between brains, it’s the conditions of the ecosystem and culture,” he said. “You have Chinese Nobel Laureates, for instance, but more often than not they did not win for research carried out in China.” 
“Harmony is one of the main values in China, so people don’t try and differentiate themselves from others. You don’t go into the streets with pink hair. Obedience to certain rules in society is too important,” Ben-Israel said. “As long as they have these values, it’s very difficult to see how they will grow to become a large innovative country. The same [deference] to authority didn’t work out in the Soviet Union,” he says. 
Israel doesn’t have it all figured out either. Start-ups there, like in Europe, face challenges in scaling up to become bigger, sustainable businesses; many promising companies leave to find bigger markets in the US. Thousands of start-ups are being developed in incubators, but the country has only a handful of so-called unicorns, or start-ups valued at over $1 billion.
The success rate for new businesses in Israel is low at 5 per cent. It’s not hurting motivation, though. “In Israel, we have five new start-ups per day; or 1,500 a year with maybe 200 surviving,” said Ben-Israel. “What makes us good in science and business is that we’re not ashamed to fail, or too timid to tell people how to do things differently and better.”

The 2ACI function has been assessed in combat-like conditions, associated to the turret sights of a French Army AMX10RCR tank.
MBDA, along with its industry and French Government partners, have been awarded the prestigious Ingénieur général Chanson prize for their work combining artificial intelligence (AI) and massively parallel processing to develop new real-time target Detection, Recognition and Identification (DRI) technology.
 
The Association de l’Armement Terrestre (AAT) has presented this year’s award (the 46th) to the 2ACI (Acquisition Automatique de Cibles par Imagerie – automatic target recognition by imaging) programme team, which was made up of employees of MBDA and Kalray and staff from the French defence procurement agency (Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA)) and the French Army’s technical section (Section Technique de l’Armée de Terre). The award was presented by Stéphane Mayer, president of the Groupement des industries françaises de défense et de sécurité terrestres et aéroterrestres (GICAT).
The 2ACI programme has produced technology based on Artificial Intelligence (algorithms and image data bases for deep learning) that enables automatic target recognition by imaging. The 2ACI function thereby allows the detection, recognition and identification of fixed and moving targets through real-time processing of the video stream output from weapon systems imaging sensors. The technology therefore meets a common functional need across the different services of the French armed forces both for active surveillance and for early warning and engagement of threats. It provides a substantial aid to the human operators, giving them more time to confirm a target identification while reducing the overall reaction time of the system.
The work of this programme has resulted in the production of two demonstrators. The first was installed on a heavy armoured vehicle and was evaluated in operational conditions on a DGA-Techniques Terrestres (DGA land techniques) test site. The second was delivered to DGA-Maîtrise de l’Information (DGA information management) for a laboratory evaluation.
Those demonstrators have proved the operational efficiency of the 2ACI function and that it could be integrated in due course to the French Army combat system Scorpion, as well as to the MMP firing unit.
This technology programme has been conducted by MBDA together with the French start-up Kalray – a pioneer of processors for new intelligent systems. It also illustrates the sovereignty strategy established by MBDA within its Open Innovation framework, which aims to reinforce its links with French and European partners.
The DGA has contributed its technical expertise and the Section Technique de l’Armée de Terre its experience operational needs
 
 


Le démonstrateur 2ACI a été intégré à la tourelle d’un char AMX10RCR, pour vérifier l’aide qu’il apporte à un opérateur humain placé en conditions proches du combat.
L’Association de l’Armement Terrestre récompense l’équipe ayant mis au point une fonction temps réel de Détection, Reconnaissance et Identification de cibles, faisant appel à l’intelligence artificielle et au traitement de données massivement parallèle.
 
Ce 3 Juillet, le 46ème prix Ingénieur Général Chanson a été décerné par l’Association de l’Armement Terrestre (AAT) à l’équipe du projet « Acquisition Automatique de Cible par Imagerie » (2ACI), composée des industriels MBDA et Kalray, ainsi que de la Direction générale de l’armement (DGA) et la Section Technique de l’Armée de Terre (STAT). Il a été remis par Stéphane Mayer, président du Groupement des industries françaises de défense et de sécurité terrestres et aéroterrestres (GICAT).
Dans le cadre de ce projet de S&T (Sciences et Technologie) piloté par la DGA, MBDA a développé des outils et capacités d’acquisition automatique de cible par imagerie, faisant appel à l’intelligence artificielle (chaînes algorithmiques et base de données d’apprentissage). La fonction 2ACI permet ainsi de détecter, reconnaitre et identifier en temps réel des cibles terrestres, fixes ou mobiles, via un traitement d’images en temps réel réalisé sur les flux vidéo issus des viseurs de systèmes d’armes. Le projet 2ACI répond ainsi à un besoin fonctionnel commun aux différentes armées françaises, tant au niveau de la veille active à distance de sécurité que de l’anticipation et de l’engagement des menaces. Il apporte une aide significative à l’opérateur en lui ménageant du temps pour confirmer l’identification de la cible, tout en réduisant le temps global de réaction.
Les travaux 2ACI ont conduit à la réalisation de deux démonstrateurs. Le premier a été intégré sur blindé lourd et a été évalué en conditions opérationnelles sur un site du centre d’expertise et d’essais de DGA Techniques Terrestres (DGA TT). Le second a été livré au centre de DGA Maîtrise de l’Information (DGA MI) pour une évaluation en laboratoire.  Ces travaux ont démontré l’efficacité opérationnelle de la fonction 2ACI, qui pourrait à terme être intégrée au système SCORPION ou au poste de tir MMP
MBDA a réalisé ce projet d’innovation planifiée en collaboration avec la PME française Kalray, pionnier des processeurs pour les nouveaux systèmes intelligents qui a bénéficié par ailleurs du fonds d’investissement en capital dans les PME de défense Def’invest, mis en œuvre conjointement avec Bpifrance. Ce programme s’inscrit également dans la stratégie de souveraineté mise en place par MBDA dans le cadre de l’Open Innovation, en renforçant ses liens avec des partenaires français et européens.
La DGA a apporté son expertise technique et la STAT son expertise des besoins opérationnels.

Many of the issues surrounding content moderation have been reported on extensively by The Verge, and they’re now the focus of UCLA professor Sarah T. Roberts’ new book Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media.Below is a lightly edited excerpt of Roberts and Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel’s discussion about why artificial intelligence is not the solution to the content moderation problem. You can hear this and more in the latest episode of The Vergecast. My colleague and Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton says to me, “If you live in a world where your dream is to replace human beings with math, then of course you’re going to treat the human beings poorly.” AI is designed to take the place of people. That’s why these content moderators are contractors. Have you encountered this sort of AI vision of content moderation? Have you seen attempts to build it? Do you think it works? First off, it’s a fundamental cultural and political orientation to work. There is an inherent belief that those systems are somehow less biased, that they can scale better, and they’re just somehow preferable. I would argue that there’s a lot that goes unsaid in such an attitude. Here are some things that algorithms don’t do: they don’t form a union, they don’t agitate for better working conditions, they don’t leak stories to journalists and academics. So we have to be very critical about that notion. But yes, since 2010, as I looked at the work life and the behavior of moderators on the job and what they were being asked to do, it was very clear to me that the processes they undertook were binary decision trees. If then, if this is present, then do this. If this is not present in an adequate amount, then leave and go to line 20. And that’s an algorithm kind of thinking that not only is endemic to the culture but also would go very easily toward building a computational system tool that could replicate. So one of the things that I’ve been seeing as a trend more recently is the fact that there are entirely new pockets of what I consider to be commercial content moderation work that have opened up that may go by another name. And now what we see is a bunch of humans whose full-time job is, rather than to deal with live content on a system, is to train datasets for machine learning tools so that their decisions on a particular piece of content or a set of prescreened images are then captured and put back into a computational system with the hope of using that to replicate. And then, ultimately, replace the humans. That said, if you talk to actual industry insiders who will speak candidly and who are actually working directly in this area, they will tell you that there is no time that they can envision taking humans entirely out of this loop. And I believe that to be true. If for no other reason than what I just described, we need human intelligence to train the machines right. And people are always going to try to defeat the algorithm. They’re going to try to defeat it. They’re going to try to game it. We can’t possibly imagine all the scenarios that will come online. And of course, those decisions need to be vetted at various points along the decision-making chain. At best, what we’ll have and what we’ll continue to have is a hybrid. But over the past few years, all I’ve seen is an increase in hiring not a decrease.

Because innovation never ends and you can only be successful if you make the organization itself more innovative instead of hiring people to “do” innovation for you. If you’d like to know about this mindset, check out my last article.
In a recent interview, our CFO Lutz Meschke pointed out one of Porsche’s big challenges when it comes to being more innovative: “Our corporate culture has been shaped by the field of engineering, and we are very good at continually optimizing things further. But that can only continue for a few more years.”
Assessing our skills: Next Level Engineer Thinking
I absolutely agree with this and I want to put those words in perspective, using the Innovation Ambition Matrix, a simple modification of a strategy framework called Ansoff-Matrix. Internally, we use this instrument quite a lot to explain the different challenges of innovation and it really helps to structure this broad topic.
Basically, the Innovation Ambition Matrix looks at markets and products. The core innovations mentioned in the matrix as horizon 1 are the incremental changes made to existing products for our existing clients. Whereas the transformational innovations in horizon 3 mean “new to the world” products we present to different markets and target groups. In-between are the adjacent innovations in horizon 2 that include products and services that are new to business for the company but have been seen before in the market.











The challenge is, though, that the ways to approach those horizons differ fundamentally:
Horizon 1: Know your products and your clients
In core innovation projects, Porsche is very successful due to operational efficiency and incremental improvements. We know our products, our clients and we know how to assess if a project is worth being followed — probably using simple Return on Investment (ROI) metrics. However, since products and services developed here are deeply connected with our core business, their complexity is higher than in other horizons.
Horizon 2: Old shoes in new markets
Broaching the adjacent innovations, we take something we are already good at and use this to target something new. In this case, we can keep uncertainty low and predict ROI. The Taycan is a good example for that approach — we developed it following our long experience in sports car manufacturing, but it will be the first fully electric Porsche coming to market this fall. Therefore, it might sell to an entirely new customer group we currently do not serve with our established product portfolio.
Horizon 3: Transformational innovation
Transformational innovation initiatives are the king of business development. They include developing a product for a market that does not yet exist — no certainty or prediction possible. Transformational innovations probably take capabilities we haven’t even developed yet. The only way to get these capabilities: test and experiment fast and often, understand the relevant questions you need to answer for the product to excel. Only by gaining feedback directly from our customers we can understand and continuously improve our work, products, and services. The good thing within this horizon is that it does not interfere with the running business, thus — despite the uncertainty — the complexity is not that high.
How to balance total innovation
Porsche, like other corporates, has to be able to pursue different tracks of innovation — all at the same time. Rather than bringing forward stand-alone innovation initiatives which compete for funds, time, and attention with one another, Porsche has to implement a holistic innovation approach to be successful in the future. For Porsche, that means establishing a balance between our core, adjacent, and transformational innovation initiatives.
Now, this is the tricky part. To produce cars quickly, in high quality and with a high margin, Porsche has to work like clockwork. What does that mean? Not only a rather linear mindset, but also little time to educate ourselves in new work methods and to take part in innovative projects — apart from the daily business.
So, how can we buy us more time in order to meet the requirements of the different horizons?
AI: Transforming Finance & IT
That’s where AI comes into play. When most people think about Artificial Intelligence (AI), they probably think about self-driving cars, robots from Boston Dynamics or similar things. When we at the Porsche Finance & IT department think about AI, we fiddle about how to improve standard processes in order to preserve our precious human resources.
Wouldn’t it be nice if a machine could take over those repetitive tasks? If we could win time to work on the exciting stuff? Intelligent technology will give us the so badly needed free time. Time that we can invest in the preparation for the future, interesting experiments, and great new products — reaching out from horizon 1 to 3.
As a McKinsey study about the effects of AI in Finance states, the technology can fully automate 42 percent of finance activities and mostly automate a further 19 percent — this includes robotic process automation (RPA), even though that is not a very intelligent technology. If we could really enhance our processes to such an extent, we would free up our most valuable resources — our employees — in order to teach and train them to tackle the challenges to come.
Learning what AI can and cannot do
Interestingly, Artificial Intelligence is not only a tool to support Porsche’s employees, but it is also a great example of how the company itself is already learning and transforming. In 2017 and 2018, our innovation department tested AI in various pilot projects, experimenting with all three innovation horizons to understand what the technology can and cannot do. In those two years, we learned valuable lessons, especially which questions to ask in order to make AI scalable and to understand which capabilities are needed.
Not very surprisingly, it became quite obvious: Artificial Intelligence can do a lot. So, it is not without reason that our CIO Matthias Ulbrich made AI one of the main pillars of Porsche’s IT strategy. As one key technology, it can e.g. help us to balance our different tracks of innovation at Porsche. With the help of intelligent technology, we can enhance our core initiatives, empower operations in the adjacent horizon and create the right conditions for transformational innovations. Besides that, AI also poses its own challenges — not only on the technological side but especially in terms of organization and culture. At Porsche, our AI@Porsche initiative gathers all the activities around AI at Porsche as part of our digitization strategy — such as the AI Monday that we now brought to Stuttgart. We need to address all those different levels to fully leverage the potential of AI. I am looking forward to contributing to this process with my work in the Finance and IT department!

Now, the firm prepares to launch it officially for consumers across the world to purchase from this month, if they have a spare 400 bucks (£340) that is.
So, is this pricey toothbrush really as smart as they say it is? Well, Oral-B claims what makes this AI-powered oral scrubber so advanced is that it's been trained via thousands of volunteers to assess different brushing styles and detect how it's used in the mouth to give pointers on improving how your brush your teeth.









Oral-B's Genius X AI toothbrush launches on 18 July
Oral-B





The firm says this is important because 80% of people miss areas of their mouth when brushing their teeth, which if not improved, could lead to serious future dental issues. When it was unveiled, Oral-B said its AI toothbrush would be smart enough to track where you are actually brushing (or not brushing enough) in your mouth and generate personalized feedback via a connected app to show you how to achieve better results.
PROMOTED
But does your toothbrush really need to be loaded with AI, and does it even work? I have been trying the device ahead of its launch to find out.
Hands-on review: Setup









Choosing the color of your LED-lit handle
Lee Bell





Upon first unwrapping the Genius X, you'll want to download the Oral-B app, which syncs with the toothbrush and gives you all the feedback when it comes to improving your, erm, stroke.
Once the app is downloaded and it finds the Genius X via Bluetooth (and chosen your preferred LED-lit handle color), simply brush as you usually would, twice a day, and all your data will be synced on your connected device.
Hands-on review: Daily use








Applying too much pressure
Lee Bell





You can choose to have the app open while brushing, or simply sync all the data every couple of days or so and look at your feedback retrospectively. The former is recommended as real-time training is better for understanding where you are going wrong when brushing. Here you can also choose from your six brushing modes to find one that best suits your oral care needs. These range from whitening to sensitivity preferences.
While brushing, you can use the in-built two-minute timer to ensure you brush for the length your dentist recommends. What I found to be super clever was a red pressure sensor will light up within the app on the area of your teeth you're brushing to tell you when you’re brushing too hard. The LED in the handle will do the same in case you're not using the app.








Obviously, I didn't brush my teeth all so well, according to the app
Lee Bell





It's this feature that makes use of the Artificial Intelligence to track where you are brushing in your mouth, and any spots you’ve missed too, and afterward, view your personalized feedback and ""brushing score.""
Hands-on review: post-brushing
Once brushing is done, it's time to check your score. The app will score you out of 100% taking account of how long you brush for, whether you press too hard and how effective your overall brushing coverage is. It can tell you exactly how long you were applying too much pressure for and where, as well as the repercussions of this. It will also ask you if your gum bled during brushing, and give appropriate feedback to tackle that in the future, if so.








The app will ask if your gums bled during brushing
Lee Bell





Over time, you can work to improve your score so you can achieve your best oral care results on a daily basis, which is very useful.
Hands-on review: Verdict
Okay, so it doesn't come cheap. But like they say: you can't put a price on health, and in this case, that's oral health. I was quite taken aback at how accurately the Oral-B app knew where exactly the Genius X toothbrush was in my mouth at any given moment while brushing, and how it was quickly able to tell me that I was pressing too hard in certain areas. The use of AI here, I think, is pretty unique and does seem to work really well. It's also all very intuitive and easy to use.
So to answer my own question, I think AI can be needed in a toothbrush, especially if it improves the way you brush your teeth as well as your oral health in general.








My brushing score - not so great
Lee Bell





Check back in a couple of weeks to see how the Genius X fares longer term and if I've managed to improve my brushing score thanks to the built-in AI.
In terms of availability, the Genius X can be bought now on Amazon with an eye-watering RRP of £340 ($430). It's available in two colors; a smart black (as pictured above) or metallic rose gold design. The new smart brush also features a travel case that charges both the brush and a USB device, such as a smartphone, to make traveling a little less stressful.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Lee BellMy journalism career kick-started in the technology industry at The INQUIRER in 2012, where I soon found my voice in the innovations space, focusing... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & PermissionsThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Comments Off on Artificial Intelligence: Working Hand in Hand with Hotel Staff




 


New technologies often turn out to be complements, not substitutes, to the old technologies (and even manual processes) they are envisaged to replace. A new technology may simply be better suited to serving a different user need and in a different situation.By Jeff Zabin, Managing Editor - 7.1.2019



















Artificial intelligence has been disrupting and transforming various industry sectors for years. While the hospitality industry as a whole may not have been at the forefront of AI-enabled technology adoption, hotel operators are now paying close attention to the potential benefits as well as the potential threats that AI may present to them.
In many cases, as discussed, they are investing significant resources in AI-related technologies, particularly ones that allow them to take advantage of the evolution in guest experience management. At the same time, they are seeking to understand the potential impact of artificial intelligence on front desk personnel, customer service reps, concierge and other guest-facing hotel staff positions and support resources.
For most hoteliers, regardless of the size or type of property they operate, it seems clear that, sooner or later, they will need to embrace the fusion of AI-enabled speaker systems and personal assistants, IoT advanced in-room controls, consolidated service devices and even robots that might appear to be straight out of Star Wars to transform their properties and redefine their guest service standards.
The financial benefits are obvious. In fact, according to research conducted by Starfleet Research in partnership with Oracle Hospitality, 89 percentage of hoteliers agree that AI significantly reduces operating costs in the customer support function. By integrating artificial intelligence to redefine the meaning of an exceptional customer experience, hotels also have the opportunity to increase positive brand awareness and increase customer loyalty, which should translate into tangible revenue gains.

An important question for hoteliers to ask as they embark on this journey is: To what extent will the migration from humans to machines redefine, or even possibly eliminate, existing jobs? Can humans and machines work together in a way that is complementary and benefits both hotel staff and hotel guests?
The answer, in most cases, would appear to be a resounding “yes.” In fact, according to the research, 86% of hoteliers agree that AI actually improves employee satisfaction. It does this, in part, by handling mundane tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, freeing employees to focus on higher-value, high-touch tasks and by enhancing their knowledge and performance.
To that point, one should keep in mind that new technologies often turn out to be complements, not substitutes, to the old technologies (and even manual processes) it is envisaged to replace. A new technology may simply be better suited to serving a different user need and in a different situation.
Guests who prefer to interact with real humans in some situations may be perfectly content to interact with AI-enabled technologies in other situations. With artificial intelligence, hotels are better able to handle guest inquiries and provide support in a far more efficient and effective manner, reducing strain on employees while improving guest satisfaction in the process, and in a way that complements and enhances existing processes.
At a growing number major hotel groups, artificial intelligence is already reducing the workload of human customer support reps by orders of magnitude. Until recently, the team at one major hotel group was struggling to keep up with the tens of thousands of support tickets it received each year. Its multiple support systems were running at full capacity. Responses to guest inquiries were often delayed or incomplete, putting the company’s reputation at risk. To meet its capacity demands, the company implemented AI-enabled virtual assistants with natural language integration and self-learning capabilities that could provide guests with a conversational support experience.
Integrated with the hotel’s case management tools, the technology has the ability to adapt over time. It can get up to speed on the customer support processes quickly while feeding back information that continues to help improve the guest experience with each interaction and support engagement.
To date, the technology has accelerated call resolution times in a large number of tasks, reportedly reducing contact time by more than four minutes per interaction and with upwards of 85 percent accuracy on received queries for many tasks. This has gone a long way toward taking the pressure off of the human support personnel, who are now free to focus on higher-value tasks, while improving the guest experience on a mass scale.

The complementary nature of AI is such that it can also enhance the knowledge, performance and speed of human customer service reps. Some hotel groups are experimenting with an AI-enabled voice-controlled speaker to listen in on sales reps conversations with prospective guests. If the rep fumbles on a response, the technology comes to the rescue.
Some companies are using AI bots to suggest responses to guest queries which a human agent can then approve or adapt before sending. In some cases, this approach has doubled the number of text-based inquiries a hotel can handle without increasing the number of reps on its payroll.
At one hotel group, the bots are now able to handle upwards of 2 million queries a day, a workload equivalent to around 7,000 human staff. By offering a virtual concierge that automatically answers guests’ queries by text, it has reduced calls to the human concierge desk by 30 percent.
Technology adoption requires an internal culture change. Employees need to understand the benefits of artificial intelligence and how it can enhance not only the guest experience but also improve their own employee experience. They need to overcome any fears, particularly as they relate to job security, and see how AI allows their jobs to fit into higher-level roles.
AI-enabled technology needs to be made a part of the overall business strategy. Employees need to be included in the strategy and understand how they can work together with the technology to their own advantage as well as to the advantage of the organization as a whole.

This is based on research conducted for UNDP Innovation Unit Africa.For the purpose of this article, the Global South refers to countries in Africa, Latin America, and developing Asia including the Middle East.1 Current LandscapeTo date almost all of research work has been focused on the implications of frontier technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, automation and Internet of Things (IoT) for people living in higher income countries such as the EU, UK and US. The focus of this article is to identify key examples on the impact of artificial intelligence as a frontier technology on citizen engagement in low and middle-income countries for whom many of the same opportunities and risks apply as in the higher-income courtiers (often to a greater extent), along with additional opportunities and risks unique to these countries.Fig.1 shows a map of Global South (red) and highlights the current AI uptake situation. The mapping exercise for the region identified over 50 artificial intelligence applications for citizen engagement across the three continents. These applications ranged from traditional chatbots to advanced robotics and machine learning processes.According to PWC (2017), China stands to see the biggest economic gains with AI enhancing GDP by 14.5% in the coming years but it notes that most of the other developing countries will experience more modest increases due to the much lower rates of adoption of AI technologies expected. China’s State Council has recently issued guidelines on AI development wherein it is aiming to become a global innovation centre in the field by 2030, with an estimated total output value of the AI industry projected at $147 billion. China Artificial Intelligence Industry Innovation Alliance (CAIIIA) was set up in 2017. The newly formed alliance set a target to incubate 50 AI-enabled products and 40 firms, launch 20 pilot projects, and set up a technology platform in the next three years. Singapore recently announced plans to invest over $100 million in AI over the next five years. Measured by patents filed, from 2010–14, China was second submitting 8,410 AI applications. During this period, Japan and Republic of Korea submitted 2,071 and 1,533 respectively. India was also among the top 10 countries globally in terms of numbers of patents submitted. In addition, China and India are among the top 10 countries in terms of the number of AI companies (ESCAP, 2017).There are plenty of instances where AI is being used to improve delivery of public services and public goods in low and middle-income countries, ranging from pilot projects to larger scale roll out. AI seems particularly fit for simplifying transactions on government websites. AI has also been deployed as a response to public health concerns, such as to anticipate outbreaks of diseases such as Zika and dengue fever. For example, the Brazilian NGO Viva Rio partnered with start-up AIME (Artificial Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology) which analyses existing local government datasets in combination with satellite image recognition systems to deploy low cost predictions of where we should expect greater incidence of disease in an upcoming three-month period. Notably, the technology was designed to work in Malaysia, but it had success rates of 84% diagnosis in Brazilian trials. Following its low-cost success in Brazil, AIME has been deployed in Dominican Republic.In other cases, AI has been used to improve police coverage, such as in dealing with transit issues. In Uganda, AI is used to advise individuals or emergency vehicles on optimal routes, dynamically redeploying a limited number of traffic police officials, and analysing possible reconfigurations of the road network to remove bottlenecks. In other cases, it has been used for environmental ends. In Kenya, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) supports the use of an AI device with drones. After nine months, over a dozen hunters had been apprehended in the Maasai Mara. WWF has received a $5 million grant from Google.org to employ this AI-powered device to protect wildlife. AI has also been used for agricultural matters, including identifying crop disease with a smartphone. Mcrops, developed in Uganda, is a diagnostic tool for diagnosing viral crop diseases in cassava plants. Sick plants are flagged in real time, which allows farmers to take action and stop the spread of the disease. In Nigeria, AI is being employed to help farmers sell their produce and buy services via a bot platform that relies on SMS and other channels such as USSD, Slack, etc.AI has also been used to prevent and predict natural disasters. The Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre has an on-going project with Togo’s Nangbéto Dam, which frequently overspills, causing great disruption to the livelihoods of people living downstream. In the past models were poor at predicting the likelihood of overspill but using a combination of crowdsourced information (including by mobile phone) and AI techniques, an improved model of overspill prediction was developed. Also, the Netherlands Red Cross’ data initiative has developed models using data from previous natural catastrophes to allow better resource management and prioritization of aid. It was employed after Typhoon Haima in the Philippines in 2016 and proven to be accurate after a comparison with data on damaged property.AI-based automated translation and voice recognition systems are also emerging which can have significant impact in countries with multiple languages. This is the case for numerous low and middle-income countries, including India, Indonesia and Nigeria. These systems could also have an impact in places with high levels of illiteracy, allowing people to engage with the government or public service provision interfaces by spoken rather than by written means. This would particularly benefit marginalised groups who experience disproportionate rates of illiteracy. Some of the examples of automated translation and voice recognition systems include ‘Translator Gator’ developed by Pulse Lab Jakarta (Indonesia) to invites people to create taxonomies, or collections of keywords, in lesser-known languages and dialects, and ‘Conversations as a Platform’ developed by Microsoft and Government of Singapore to represent a fundamental shift where the power of human language will be used to make chatbots more anticipatory, accessible, engaging and inclusive for citizens and constituents.Some case studies are discussed in detail in the next section. For each case study, information about geographical coverage and scale of operation is provided.1.1 Case Studies1.1.1 AsiaAI for Parliament in Japan (Japan, Asia; Scale: Pilot)The Japanese Government is trialing artificial intelligence to help officials draft responses submitted to the parliament. The tech would help officials draft responses used in policy-making, by mining past opinions on policy issues and alternative suggestions voiced out by officials during parliament. The government will first feed five years’ worth of parliament agenda summaries to the system before it churns out responses.Based on trial results, Tokyo will then expand the use of AI in other branches of government. The government has launched a broad plan to use AI and robotics across public services. Called “Society 5.0”, the government envisions using science and technology [to] play even more key roles in tackling challenges like ageing, sluggish productivity growth and enhancing [the] wellbeing of humans.Singapore’s Dengue Risk Map (Singapore, Asia; Scale: Operational)As a tropical country, Singapore faces seasonal bouts of dengue cases, peaking in the warmer months of June to October. The country’s main strategy is to carry out preventive surveillance of dengue hotspots. However, this is labour-intensive, and drains an already limited pool of skilled vector control officers. So, the Government decided to use data to identify the areas most at risk of dengue — and help the agency deploy officers more effectively.The team used a machine-learning model to create a colour-coded risk map. The model analyses data from various agencies to rank the overall risk of dengue across the entire country. These data include past dengue cases from the Ministry of Health; population estimates from Singstat; vegetation indices from the Centre for Remote Imaging Sensing & Processing at the National University of Singapore; public transport information from Future City Lab ETH-NUS; and mosquito population data from NEA’s surveillance programme.The risk map also enables targeted publicity campaigns — for example, placing advertisements about dengue prevention at bus stops in high-risk towns. The project won Best Use of Data at the GovInsider Innovation Awards, held at Innovation Labs World in 2017.mAadhaar app (India, Asia; Scale: Operational)The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has launched the mAadhaar app, which allows users to carry digital versions of their identification profiles on their phones. Users of the app may download their Aadhaar number profiles on their smartphones and will therefore not need to carry the physical cards with them, The Economic Times reported. The Aadhaar number is a 12-digit random identification number issued by the UIDAI to Indian citizens, which is linked to basic demographic information such as name and date of birth, and biometric information such as fingerprints and iris scans. These data are stored in a centralised biometric ID database. The Aadhaar system has over 1.1 billion citizens enrolled, and is saving current administration about US$2 billion a year.In November 2017, The Ministry of Commerce and Industry in India has set up a Task force on Artificial Intelligence to kick-start the use of AI for India’s economic transformation.SAAD (Dubai) (United Arab Emirates, Asia; Scale: Operational)The city’s first government service utilising artificial intelligence, powered by IBM Watson. It was aimed at allowing entrepreneurs and investors to ask questions related to setting up a business in Dubai, and to get real-time responses on various topics, including business licensing requirements and registration processes. “Saad” is designed to understand natural language and ingest and comprehend massive amounts of data, learn and reason from its interactions, and provide responses that will aid users in deciding on correct courses of action.VAMPIRE tool (Indonesia, Asia; Scale: Operational)Indonesia is under threat of food insecurity and undernutrition, and faces “alarmingly high” stunting levels. Pulse Lab Jakarta joined forces with the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation to develop a platform that identifies affected communities in need of help. The VAMPIRE visualisation tool combines data in several layers: users can view where food-insecure and agriculture-dependant communities live; data on rainfall anomalies and vegetation health; and crowdsourced prices of staple foods in these areas. VAMPIRE, which is installed in the President’s situation room, is “an early warning system” for authorities to manage food security and better allocate resources. Following VAMPIRE’s success in Indonesia, WFP is now in discussions with the Sri Lankan government to have it installed there too.Bindez (Myanmar, Asia; Scale: Operational)Bindez emerged out of a challenge that has faced many countries coming online in the last few decades: how to make their countries languages talk with computers. Bindez is an acronym for Burmese Index, a project that started as a local language search engine by 2 Burmese techies Yewint Ko and Htet Will in mid-2013, shortly after the country had opened up to new technology, and content consumption needs became evident. It now uses natural language processing and text analysis to track online hate speech.1.1.2 AfricaSustainability and Artificial Intelligence Lab (Africa; Scale: Operational)The Lab is combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty. Using the final model that has been trained on survey data, it can estimate per capita consumption expenditure for any location where we have daytime satellite imagery. The Lab is commissioned by Stanford’s Global Development and Poverty Initiative and partially supported by the National Science Foundation.Robotic Pharmacists for HIV Patients (South Africa, Africa; Scale: Pilot)Robotic pharmacists are dispensing drugs to people with HIV on the streets of South Africa. The country has the highest number of people living with HIV — 7 million. However, 3.3 million people are not on drugs they should be, according to South Africa’s Department of Health. In the past, the antiretroviral drugs have been available only via expensive and private care.The robots will not reveal patient identity helping to remove any social stigma associated with the disease. It will also dispense medicines also for other patients with chronic diseases like TB. With the robot dispenser, patients may no longer need to wait for hours at hospitals or clinics to get their monthly dose. The pilot is run by the Right to Care project in Helen Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg funded by the Department of Health and non-profit The Global Fund.Similar Initiative: Nigerian startup Aajoh uses artificial intelligence to help individuals that send a list of their symptoms via text, audio and photographs, to diagnose their medical condition.1.1.3 Central and South AmericaRosie (Brazil, S. America; Scale: Operational)In Brazil, a group of data-analysis experts has used artificial intelligence techniques to monitor public officials. They focused on limiting fraud among members of congress seeking reimbursements for their travel and food expenses; after getting crowdfunding for the startup costs, they created Rosie, an Artificial Intelligence robot that analyzes the reimbursement requests of lawmakers and calculates the probability that they are justified. To no one’s surprise, Rosie found that the deputies often cheated.Similar Initiative: The Serious Fraud Office in the UK developed a robot with help of AI startup RAVN which then helped the government’s law enforcement arm sift, index and summarise 30 million documents relating to fraud investigations.CitymisVis (Argentina, S. America; Scale: Operational)An interactive tool developed by Government of Argentina in collaboration with Microsoft Latin America that allows citizens to report and track problems from poor street infrastructure to deficient urban sanitation. Through this tool, municipalities listen and respond to requests and complaints from the citizens. As a result of the successful adoption of Citymis Community in several municipalities, large amounts of data are daily generated, which require analysis by the corresponding service departments. The intelligent analysis of citizen requests and complaints can lead to improved levels of service coordination and can help in the decision-making process by relevant authorities.Minecraft (Mexico, C. America; Scale: Operational)A United Nations initiative is using the computer game Minecraft to help citizens design public spaces in more than 25 developing countries including Mexico. Called Block by Block, the UN project turned the game into a ‘community participation tool’ in urban design, with a focus on poor communities. Minecraft is the world’s second best-selling videogame of all time. In the game, players use textured cubes to build a virtual world. According to Microsoft Research’s Cambridge lab, people build amazing structures that do amazing things in Minecraft, and this allows experimenters to put in tasks that will stretch AI technology beyond its current capacity.Elefantes Blancos App (Columbia, C. America; Scale: Operational$163 million in public works corruption and inefficiencies has been identified citizens using the smartphone app, Elefantes Blancos (White Elephants). The smartphone app was introduced in 2013 by Colombia’s Transparency Secretariat and since that time 54 “white elephant” projects — those projects perceived by citizens as public works that were languishing, unfinished or abandoned — have been identified. 15 of the projects worth more than $400,000 were completed with pressure from the Transparency Secretariat, 27 are under prosecution and 12 projects are currently being investigated (Guay, 2017).Citizens can download the app to their smartphone and then upload photos of the unfinished public projects. Users can vote on the most problematic projects, and the app determines location and frequency of reporting for each project. The Transparency Secretariat then begins the process of assessing the projects for corruption. While the Transparency Secretariat cannot prosecute cases, the Elefantes Blancos app has proven its value, and control of the app will be transferred to the local comptroller — the comptroller has the legal authority to prosecute corruption.1.1.4 ChallengesIt is important to note that countries in this geographical region are diverse politically, economically and socially. Hence, AI technologies pose several challenges at national and regional levels. Some of the key impediments identified include:A possible frontier technology divide emerging with advanced economies like Singapore and Indonesia investing in technological leapfrogging at astonishing rates, leaving others in the region at a risk of being left behindImbued trust deficit amongst countries, private and development sectors exists regarding use and abuse of such technologies and associated dataLimited technical capacity of governments and policymakers in developing technologically advanced governance solutions is leading to overdependence on donor agencies and other developed countriesLimited research and baseline data are available to prioritise infrastructural elements of national and regional decision support systemsA potential concern about technological unemployment persists due to surge in technological adaptation.The article acknowledges that some countries in the Global South are leading from the front and are forecast to be the major market of the future. This prominent position means it is prudent for governments to think carefully about the policy priorities and issues raised in this article to address ethical issues, ensure development of an adaptable workforce for the future, and put in place regional level systems to allow sustainable technological innovation.",Is Artificial Intelligence the frontier solution to Global South’s wicked development challenges?,,https://towardsdatascience.com/is-artificial-intelligence-the-frontier-solution-to-global-souths-wicked-development-challenges-4206221a3c78,,,,['Ehsan Gul'],2019-07-05T08:55:55.228Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4206221a3c78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rapid advance of technology has resulted in CPA firms hiring more nonaccounting graduates in order to integrate new tools into their practice. For example, one national firm leader reported that more than 25% of its new entry-level hires are science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors (Allan Koltin, opening remarks at Advisory Board’s Winning is Everything Conference, Dec. 13, 2017, http://bit.ly/2wrh091). Specifically for the accounting profession, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with robotic process automation (RPA) can create intelligent virtual workers to improve productivity. On facing the challenge of AI, Barry Melancon, AICPA CEO and president, has said, “With AI the whole ramification of jobs in society is a huge issue, and those that embrace it will be the most successful” (Michelle Perry, “AICPAs Barry Melancon on the Challenge of Change in Accountancy,” ICAS website, Oct. 6, 2017, http://bit.ly/2Wajgkm).
While AI is still an evolving technology, many applications have recently made impressive leaps. For example, computers can defeat chess champions, help drive cars, instruct drones to return automatically, provide medical diagnoses, perform as virtual assistants, and navigate vacuum cleaners through a furnished house. The AI applications for business involve training computers to do tasks employees can perform, learning from experiences and adjusting to new data, if needed. Currently, CPA firms can use intelligent robots to count inventories, inspect fixed assets, handle bank audit confirmations, and read contracts or other documents to generate meaningful insights.
Some CPAs may assume that, like big data or blockchain, AI is a relatively recent development. To the contrary, AI research started even before the creation of the Accounting Principles Board, FASB’s predecessor, in 1959. Subsequently, several subfields of AI have emerged, including robotics, perception (vision and speech), machine learning (ML), and expert systems (ES). This article will help CPAs understand AI and the current AI-enabled tools in accounting. In addition, it offers suggestions on how to embrace this powerful technology to benefit CPAs and CPA firms.

Development of the AI Field
Alan Turing, who played a pivotal role in breaking Germany’s Enigma code during World War II, is considered by many as the father of AI. In his milestone paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing raised the question, “Can machines think?” and discussed how to build intelligent machines (Mind, October 1950, http://bit.ly/2MgwNCq). The term “artificial intelligence” was first coined by John McCarthy, who defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” In 1955, McCarthy coauthored a research proposal to study AI with Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon (A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, https://stanford.io/2KdBeeK), which launched it as a research field. Unfortunately, contemporary computers could not store enough data or process it fast enough to exhibit intelligence. As research interest subsided, so did funding (Rockwell Anyoha, “The History of Artificial Intelligence,” Harvard University blog, Aug. 28, 2017, http://bit.ly/2VZgQzU).






In the 1980s, AI research was reignited thanks to refined development tools (e.g., Lisp, Prolog, EMYCIN, VP-Expert) and increased funding. Consequently, there was a proliferation of business-related AI projects using ML and ES. ML studies the algorithms and statistical models that computers use to effectively perform a specific task (e.g., predicting corporate financial stress or bankruptcy). ML algorithms can generate a model from the available data—known as the “training sample”—that can then be used to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed by humans. One of the models for ML is the artificial neural network (ANN), a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons that emulates a human’s biological neural network and develops algorithms from a set of given samples. Specifically, an artificial neuron can process the data it receives and then pass them on to connected artificial neurons. Initially, artificial neurons were subclassified into three layers—input, hidden, and output. Later on, ANN evolved into deep learning, in which there are multiple layers between the input and output layers.

CPA firms can use intelligent robots to count inventories, inspect fixed assets, handle bank audit confirmations, and read contracts or other documents to generate meaningful insights.

An ES is a computer program that emulates the decision-making process of human experts. It is designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through a collection of existing experiences and knowledge, generally represented as “if-then” rules. An ES is divided into two subsystems: the knowledge base and the inference engine. The knowledge base represents facts and rules, while the inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities. David Yang and Miklos Vasarhelyi reported that there were 167 accounting-related ES studies in the ’80s and ’90s covering five areas: auditing, taxation, financial accounting, personal financial planning, and management accounting (“The Application of Expert Systems in Accounting,” Artificial Intelligence in Accounting and Auditing, vol. 4, Markus Wiener Publishers, 1995, http://bit.ly/2KaW3Y1).
In the 21st century, the applications of AI have become increasingly widespread; Exhibit 1 presents several popular applications. There may, however, be some drawbacks for users, depending to a great extent upon individual experiences, expectations, and preferences.

AI Projects by CPA Firms
CPA firms often develop and use cutting-edge tools to stay competitive, and adopting AI is no exception. By integrating AI with RPA, CPA firms can increase productivity and improve job performance. AI is, however, an evolving technology, and not every firm is willing to commit the required resources to adopt AI into its practice. Nonetheless, the Big Four have already invested in AI, as illustrated by the sample projects in Exhibit 2. While the Big Four are at the forefront in developing AI-enabled tools, smaller firms should not preclude themselves from reaping the benefits. For example, Gursey Schneider LLP used AI-enabled audit tools to process a massive amount of client data and compile enough evidence to move forward with a $2.8 million criminal fraud case (Solon Angel, “How AI Could Protect Your Business from Financial Fraud,” Forbes.com, Feb. 14, 2019, http://bit.ly/2KaYolS). According to the Accounting Today 2019 Regional Leaders Report, Gursey Schneider is a “small” firm in California with 16 partners and 192 total employees (http://bit.ly/2HL6iAR).

Examples of AI Applications in Accounting



To help CPAs learn more about developing AI-enabled tools, the authors present the following excerpt from a post on the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) website written by Gary Krausz of Gursey Schneider and John Colthart of MindBridge Ai, explaining how and why they used AI to enhance the fraud audit (http://bit.ly/2HN45F7):

The client had $120 million in annual sales. … They had suspected fraud to have occurred across three years and requested an examination of their general ledger for the period between 2014 and Q2 2018, to the tune of 6.2 million transactions. … AI gave us the ability to take very big data sets and make them manageable, as it took all the data and knew how to put different thoughts together and infer relationships between items. Unlike the traditional methods in our industry of relying on hunches and instinct to pick an account and start digging, AI offered up its own “intuition” based on the current data set and the learnings from prior analysis. In this case, without any tuning by us, the AI analyzed the entire data set from the client’s general ledger and flagged the fraudulent transactions in a very short amount of time, including identifying items of large amounts posted into unusual accounts and items posted by the same person multiple times. …
AI offers the opportunity to ingest and inspect 100% of a client’s accounting transactions and go beyond simple rules reporting (sorting and filtering). It allows examiners to dig deeper into insights based on the behavior of the data and to augment professional judgment with insights that replicate what an army of the world’s best experts can do.

This case illustrates how an AI-enabled tool can significantly improve audit efficiency with effective analytics and auditing of the entire transaction dataset. In the end, Krausz and Colthart concluded that firms are advised to start planning their AI adoption strategies now.


How to Embrace AI
In its 2018 report on the annual Rosenberg Survey, the CPA Journal noted that “the CPA profession is on the cusp of arguably its greatest transformation” due to technological innovations such as blockchain and AI. The survey also concluded that this change “will dramatically transform how a CPA firm is managed and staffed, and what it will mean to be a CPA” (CPA Journal, December 2018, http://bit.ly/2MiAyHz). Thus, the authors would like to offer some suggestions on how to embrace AI in the accounting profession.

For accountants.
The modern technology-driven business approach drives accountants to evolve from information providers to business enhancers. AI opens the door for business enhancement, and CPAs can contribute to AI projects with their extensive knowledge in business operations and data. Accountants who are willing to embrace AI-enabled tools can develop advanced skills for career development. For example, to prepare the training samples for AI projects, CPAs need to have data management skills in order to collate the data and prepare it in a format that can be used for ML. The authors suggest accountants learn and use a database management system (e.g., MS Access) or generalized audit software (e.g., ACL, IDEA) to slice, join, and merge the data coming from various platforms.
To start learning AI, accountants and accounting students are encouraged to take advantage of free online courses available at edX, MIT OpenCourseWare, Coursera, Udacity, Codecademy, Youtube, or numerous universities; these courses often offer self-paced lessons directed at varying levels of personal experience, existing knowledge, and needs.


For accounting professors.
To help accounting students adapt to new technology, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business adopted Accounting Standard A7 in 2013 and called for adding “the development of skills and knowledge related to data creation, data sharing, data analytics, data mining, data reporting, and storage within and across organizations” to the curriculum. Although the AACSB aims to ensure that students are well prepared for career development, the applications of AI and RPA, not yet included in A7, have become increasingly important for businesses. Critics still claim that “our education system is doing a dismal job of preparing accountants to work deeply with technology” (Daniel Hood, “The Profession’s Biggest Challenges,” Accounting Today, Oct. 1, 2018, http://bit.ly/2KkANzl).

CPA firms that embrace AI will likely continue to prosper, but those who do not may end up being left behind.

Having dealt with financial data, accountants can play an important role in transforming unique insights into competitive advantages. In addition to structured transaction data, big data projects often include unstructured and external data to generate analytical insights. Consequently, the authors suggest integrating data management, AI, and RPA within accounting curricula to prepare the next generation of accountants. Furthermore, accountants need to know computer programming because coding requires performing tasks in proper sequence and creating a clear roadmap for problem solving (”Should Accounting Students Learn to Code,” AICPA website, Jul. 14, 2015, http://bit.ly/2RyYVyi). Taking even one semester of computer programming would allow accounting students to evolve from knowing how to use computers to understanding how to make computers solve problems. Knowledge of coding would also help accountants collaborate with IT professionals to develop AI-enabled tools.


For accounting firms.
Scott Showalter, chair of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, has stated that the impact of new technology is the greatest change to the profession since the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and that “no matter the discipline, whether audit, accounting, tax or advisory, all will be affected by these innovations” (Hood 2018). Thus, after assessing the impact of AI on their practice and identifying the potential niche of new technology, CPA firm leaders should keep staff informed regarding their vision and implementation plans; firms can then acquire or develop the new skills to use intelligent tools.
Many CPA firms’ entry into the AI field may be accelerated by focusing their hiring to include recent college graduates who have been exposed to some level of AI knowledge through coursework or internship. It generally takes longer for existing staff to develop and learn new skills, and they require adequate support to complete the transformation to an AI-enabled workplace. Furthermore, in addition to online courses, CPA firms can take advantage of seminars, workshops, and CPE training—already required as part of annual CPE requirements—to facilitate additional knowledge-based training in AI.
Generally, large firms tend to discern the economic benefits of utilizing new technologies first, and smaller firms follow suit. This wait-and-see approach, however, is no longer an option due to AI’s disruptive potential. CPA firms that embrace AI will likely continue to prosper, but those who do not may end up being left behind. Consequently, a firm’s management teams—including IT, audit, tax, advisory, and HR—need to work together to identify where AI can be best utilized to build on their existing strengths, create new ones, and develop strategies for deploying AI-enabled tools in the workplace.

                    Wondering how the advances of artificial intelligence might impact your future career? Murdoch alumnus Dr Jeremy Nunn, Founder and Director of Workmetrics shares his views and predictions about the impact of AI on future graduate roles in the workplace.
                
The promise of AI in the workplace is an intimidating one. Slowly, a new workforce that doesn’t rest or demand a raise is being eased into the work environment, begging the fierce debate if this technology is an advantage or a threat. What we know for certain is the transformative impact it will have on how the role of humans in the workplace could change.
The impact of AI on workplaces
Right now, there is an increasing amount of jobs the current crop of graduates are doing that didn’t exist a decade ago, not to mention the more traditional graduate roles of their parents. I think we can all agree artificial intelligence will change the workplace forever; the question is how.
There is plenty of pessimistic outlook on AI in the workplace. Kai-Fu Lee, former President of Google China, says up to half of our jobs will be “technically and economically doable by AI and automation over the next 15 years”. Regarding graduate jobs specifically, a third of jobs across the globe will be eventually replaced by machines and/or software, according to a report by the International Bar Association (IBA).
How industries could be affected
The legal profession is a glaring example of AI’s impact on the work environment. Its ability to innovatively produce more work with fewer production costs means law graduates and paralegals – as the brunt of the legal processing – will be replaced by technology that can perform repetitive and mundane tasks vastly quicker.
Areas like investing and brokering are witnessing an influx of sophisticated and low-cost AI-powered advisers. Due to their superior skills of selecting investments and stocks and lessening their risk, they are slowly replacing human brokers. Basically, any graduate role that includes a certain degree of routine and monotony (skills like information retrieval, planning, pattern recognition) is at the highest risk of being automated through AI.
The good news is this doesn’t mean those jobs are lost forever for the people holding them, but rather there’s a significant change in their day-to-day tasks.
Legal professionals will be liberated to do other things. There will still be demand for lawyers and advisers to handle complex litigation and legal requirements, and there’ll still be a need for doctors and medical professionals to discuss various treatment options even if AI will be quicker and more accurate in diagnosing a disease.
Preparing for the careers of the future
Instead of worrying about job cuts, graduates should focus on ensuring they have an attractive skillset which complements the abilities of AI. The ability to learn, adjust, and evolve a specific competence will increasingly be in demand as AI advances and becomes more integrated in the workplace. This means soft skills like leadership, creative thinking and problem-solving, as well as non-technical skills like communication and project management will still be necessary skills to have.
There will also be jobs created in the AI landscape which relate directly to the technology, some which will be fairly unique. As machines cannot learn anything human by themselves, AI trainers will have to make sure their performance is as close as possible to human-like. Various machine learning researchers and developers will be at the forefront of efforts in adding a touch of human reasoning and intuition to machines.
Then, AI support analysts will act as AI-focused advisors to organisations looking to harness the power of this technology. These people will be in charge of explaining how AI contributes to the workplace and making sure it is placed in the right role. As technology continues to push forward at a breathtaking pace, there will be a whole new host of careers and branches that haven’t been invented yet.
A permanent change to the way we work
It’s business’ need to process an exponentially growing quantity of data which ensures AI an enduring presence in workplaces. This increase in volume and number of ways we use data is unlikely to ever slow or phase out, so the sooner graduates begin to adapt, the greater the advantage they will have when this technology inevitably becomes mainstream.  Perhaps that is the greatest effect AI is having on graduate roles – instilling a broader perspective for a more valuable and meaningful workplace.

The universe is filled with beautiful objects, like this bubble nebula, located more than 8,000 light-years from Earth. Researchers recently used artificial intelligence to simulate the universe. Though the simulation did surprisingly well, no one fully understands how it works.

The first-ever artificial intelligence simulation of the universe seems to work like the real thing — and is almost as mysterious.Researchers reported the new simulation June 24 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The goal was to create a virtual version of the cosmos in order to simulate different conditions for the universe's beginning, but the scientists also hope to study their own simulation to understand why it works so well.""It's like teaching image-recognition software with lots of pictures of cats and dogs, but then it's able to recognize elephants,"" study co-author Shirley Ho, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City, said in a statement. ""Nobody knows how it does this, and it's a great mystery to be solved."" [Far-Out Discoveries About the Universe's Beginnings] Simulating the universeGiven the enormous age and scale of the universe, understanding its formation is a daunting challenge. One tool in the astrophysicist toolbox is computer modeling. Traditional models require a lot of computing power and time, though, because astrophysicists might need to run thousands of simulations, tweaking different parameters, to determine which is the most likely real-world scenario.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceHo and her colleagues created a deep neural network to speed up the process. Dubbed the Deep Density Displacement Model, or D^3M, this neural network is designed to recognize common features in data and ""learn"" over time how to manipulate that data. In the case of D^3M, the researchers inputted 8,000 simulations from a high-accuracy traditional computer model of the universe. After D^3M had learned how those simulations worked, the researchers put in a brand-new, never-before-seen simulation of a virtual, cube-shaped universe 600 million light-years across. (The real observable universe is about 93 billion light-years across.)The neural network was able to run simulations in this new universe just as it had in the 8,000-simulation dataset it had used for training. The simulations focused on the role of gravity in the universe's formation. What was surprising, Ho said, was that when the researchers varied brand-new parameters, like the amount of dark matter in the virtual universe, D^3M was still able to handle the simulations — despite never being trained on how to handle dark matter variations. Computers and cosmologyThis feature of D^3M is a mystery, Ho said, and makes the simulation intriguing for computational science as well as cosmology.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""We can be an interesting playground for a machine learner to use to see why this model extrapolates so well, why it extrapolates to elephants instead of just recognizing cats and dogs,"" she said. ""It's a two-way street between science and deep learning.""The model might also be a time-saver for researchers interested in universal origins. The new neural network could complete simulations in 30 milliseconds, compared to several minutes for the fastest non-artificial intelligence simulation method. The network also had an error rate of 2.8%, compared with 9.3% for the existing fastest model. (These error rates are compared to a gold standard of accuracy, a model that takes hundreds of hours for each simulation.)The researchers now plan to vary other parameters in the new neural network, examining how factors like hydrodynamics, or the movement of fluids and gases, may have shaped the universe's formation.From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through TimeThe 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark MatterThe 12 Strangest Objects in the UniverseOriginally published on Live Science.

IIT Hyderabad has been the first institute in the country to introduce B.Tech in AI technology, enrolling 20 students this year.India is expected to create 39,000 new analytics jobs by 2020. The advent of automation and the demand for changing job skills has attracted a large chunk of Indian students enrolling in India premier institution — Indian Institute of Technology(IITs) — for advanced engineering courses in artificial intelligence and machine learning. As industries face talent shortage in the sector, IITs recently rolled out degree programmes and certifications including a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Artificial Intelligence — providing diverse options in technology courses. IIT Hyderabad has been the first institute in the country to introduce B.Tech in AI technology. The institute started its first batch this year, enrolling 20 students to the course.“What surprised us was that many students this year chose BTech course in AI as against regular CSE (computer sciences) despite having a better score. It’s a sign that students have realised the potential of AI as a career prospect considering the scope of research and jobs in the industry,” Vineeth N Balasubramanian, associate professor at IIT Hyderabad told the Times of India.This year, the JEE advanced rank for opting AI stood at 478 and closed at 657. Overall, IIT Bangalore and IIT Delhi continue to remain top choices for engineering aspirants.The industry estimates that India has less than 10% of data scientists available globally. According to a survey by Analytics Vidhya and ed-tech platform Great Learnings, India has 50,000 vacancies in data and analytics sector. In fact, the country is expected to create 39,000 new analytics jobs by 2020. Coping with the growing demandIndian IT majors including GE Research, Ericsson and Bosch, for their part, have also been funding various research programs at IITs.Microsoft too recently announced that it will establish AI digital labs in India, jointly with 10 colleges and universities including Indian School of Business (ISB).In its most recent budget, Indian government announced a key national programme focussed on AI under its ‘Digital India’ initiative. This will include the setting up of AI centers across the country to help AI-based startups in India.See also:Accenture comes in ahead of Deloitte, Wipro and TCS in IDC’s AI rankingsIITs to offer programs in artificial intelligence as India faces talent shortage",,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '600', 'height': '60', 'url': 'https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-60085318,width-1000,height-750/default-thumb.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5 Ways Work Will Change in the Future
At least 30% of the activities associated with the majority of occupations in the United States could be automated, which includes even knowledge tasks that were previously thought to be safe according to a McKinsey Global Institute report. This echoes what executives see as well and prompted Rick Jensen, Chief Talent Officer at Intuit to say, “The workforce is changing massively.” Here are just a few of the ways:
1. Fluid gigs
Within an organization, positions will be more fluid, and a strict organizational chart will likely be tossed in favor of more project-based teams. This is especially appealing to Generation Z employees since 75% of Generation Z employees would be interested in having multiple roles in one place of employment. The “gig” economy will continue to expand where professionals sign on as contractors or freelancers and then move on to the next gig.
PROMOTED
2. Decentralized workforces
Thanks to mobile technology and readily available internet access, remote workers are already common. Employees won’t need to be in the same location. This will make it easier for the next generation workers to choose to live anywhere, rather than find a job and then move to a city with that job.

3. Motivation to work
People will need something more than a paycheck as a motivation to work. Many want to work for an organization with a mission and purpose they believe in. They will also want different incentives such as personal development opportunities, the latest tech gadgets to facilitate their work-from-anywhere ambitions, and more.
4. Lifelong learning
Not only will employees want to learn throughout their career, but they will also need to learn new skills. Technology will continue to evolve the role humans play in the workforce, so everyone will be required to adapt their skills throughout their working lives.
5. Technology will augment human’s jobs
Artificial intelligence algorithms and intelligent machines will be co-workers to humans. The human workforce will need to develop a level of comfort and acceptance for how man and machine can collaborate using the best that both bring to the workplace.
How to Prepare for the Future of Work
Even though we can’t predict all the changes that will occur in the future, we do have a fair amount of certainty that there are some things people can do to prepare for it.
Rather than succumb to the doomsday predictions that “robots will take over all the jobs,” a more optimistic outlook is one where humans get the opportunity to do work that demands their creativity, imagination, social and emotional intelligence, and passion.
Individuals will need to act and engage in lifelong learning, so they are adaptable when the changes happen. The lifespan for any given skill set is shrinking, so it will be imperative for individuals to continue to invest in acquiring new skills. The shift to lifelong learning needs to happen now because the changes are already happening.
In addition, employees will need to shape their own career path. Gone are the days when a career trajectory is outlined at one company with predictable climbs up the corporate ladder. Therefore, employees should pursue a diverse set of work experiences and take the initiative to shape their own career paths.
Individuals will need to step into the opportunity that pursuing your passion provides rather than shrink back to what had resulted in success in the past. This shift in work opens the possibility to achieve more of our potential. We need to begin to think of work as more than a paycheck.
Employers need to think differently about how they recruit and hire new employees. Companies need to review a prospective employee’s potential and assess skills that are less likely to be automated any time soon, including emotional intelligence, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.





Another way employers will need to adjust operations is to create a structure and culture that honors lifelong learning, and that celebrates creativity. It's time for employers to assess their benefit and incentive programs to ensure they are providing the motivation the next generation of employees will want in order to attract the best talent.
While nothing is certain, it's important for every human to begin taking steps in the direction to prepare for a future where machines become colleagues. If we don't begin to adapt to the changes today, it will be challenging to catch up later.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",The Future Of Work: 5 Important Ways Jobs Will Change In The 4th Industrial Revolution,False,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/07/15/the-future-of-work-5-important-ways-jobs-will-change-in-the-4th-industrial-revolution/,Enterprise & Cloud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glitch is the work of two people who met on a course at Massachusetts Institute of Technology that encouraged students to develop deep learning software for creative initiatives, such as AI-generated art, jewellery and perfumes. Pinar Yanardag and Emily Salvador's studies led to a program capable of designing a version of the “little black dress”.

Yale and Oxford researchers looked at how AI will reshape every aspect of our lives, transforming transport, health, science, finance and the military.The survey of machine-learning researchers predicts a 50% chance AI will outperform humans in every job by 2062, and of automating all jobs in 120 years. But the results highlight wide regional differences in expectations of the potential of AI.People around the world have different predictions as to when when machine learning will exceed human performance. Image: ArxivAsian respondents expect high level machine intelligence (HLMI) to transform our world sooner than other regions predict. This describes a situation where unaided machines are able to complete tasks more effectively and cheaper than human employees, which includes activities such as designing clothes and other creative functions. On average, Asian machine-learning researchers predict the arrival of HLMI within 30 years, compared with 74 years for North Americans. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs 2018 report, lists AI, machine learning and the spread of new technologies as key drivers of change in the global labour market. As self-learning algorithms become more sophisticated and integrate further with our work and social lives, they could have greater capacity to undertake jobs requiring artistic interpretation and creativity. New categories of jobs will emerge, too, the report predicts.

This week, multiple companies have advanced their AI programming.  The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is almost commonplace in the biotech and pharma industry as multiple companies are harnessing the power to aid in drug discovery and development. This week more companies have announced advancements in their AI programming. This morning, San Francisco-based Notable Labs announced it secured $40 million in a Series B funding round to use its artificial intelligence platform to advance cancer drug development. The company’s approach is aimed at predicting which types of patients are most likely to respond to a drug in as little as five days. The process is designed to help physicians make more informed decisions about which clinical trials will be effective with patients and can also benefit the likelihood of a trial’s success by matching the right patients to the right trial. Notable noted that in a recent clinical trial, its process achieved an 84% overall accuracy rate in predicting patient response to drugs or drug combinations. Notable Labs was founded by De Silva, a former analyst at noted biotech investor Peter Thiel’s Clarium Capital, nearly five years ago. De Silva said the concept for the company came out of his experiences caring for his father, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme. None of the approved medications benefitted the elder De Silva and his father was not eligible to participate in any clinical trial due to the advanced form of the disease. De Silva said that all of the treatment solutions for his father were sort of a “one-size-fits-all” approach. He wanted to find a way to focus on personalized treatment for individual cancer patients, and Notable Labs was born. De Silva said the company is ready to scale the results Notable has so far generated to expand its AI platform to other cancer types. “Patients with aggressive cancers are in a race against time, but if we can use technology to identify the best drug or drug combination at the time of diagnosis, there is a much better chance those therapies will work,” he said in a statement. Notable’s funding round was supported by B Capital Group and LifeForce Capital, along with Industry Ventures. This round brings Notable’s total funding to more than $55 million. Iframe Embed Notable isn’t the only AI-focused company advancing its programs. Computational pathology-focused Paige published an article in Nature Medicine describing an AI system for computational pathology that achieves clinical-grade accuracy levels. The paper outlines how a series of novel algorithms created using datasets ten times larger than those that have been manually curated performed better and also are more generalizable. In its announcement, Paige said the significance of this development hinges on the fact that curating datasets can be prohibitively expensive and time-intensive. By eliminating the need to curate datasets, Paige can now develop many more highly accurate algorithms that can be built into clinical decision support products to help pathologists around the world drive better patient care. GlaxoSmithKline has also made a move this week to support its AI program. Bloomberg reported that the U.K. pharma giant poached Genentech veteran Kim Branson to oversee the use of AI in the finding of novel targets for potential medicines. GSK first turned to the use of AI in 2017 with a strategic drug discovery collaboration with Exscientia. Under the terms of that particular collaboration, Exscientia is using its AI capabilities and combining them with GSK’s drug discovery expertise in order to discover novel and selective small molecules for up to 10 disease-related targets. In the interview with Bloomberg, GSK Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley said harnessing the big data capabilities of AI will enable the company to predict better targets for potential drugs and which patients are more suited to those drugs in clinical trials, much like Notable indicated. Walmsley said the AI capabilities boos the chance of “improving the productivity of an R&D organization.” Last week, AI startup Kyndi secured $20 million in Series B funding that will be used to expand the company’s engineering and sales teams to meet growing customer demand in government, financial services and life sciences. Kyndi is developing the first “Explainable AI platform.” Unlike traditional “black box” AI solutions, the Kyndi platform scores the provenance and origin of each document it processes, while helping organizations quickly find difficult-to-locate information within collections of documents – without requiring large, labeled data sets to train the system, the company said in its announcement. ideal-employer-email-banner.jpg"", 'articleSection': 'Business, News', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/alex-keown/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/alex-keown/'}, 'name': 'Alex Keown', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/alex-keown'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2019-07-16T12:22:53.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-07-16T15:15:05.000Z', 'headline': 'Artificial Intelligence-Focused Companies Advance Programming', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/15c57a8/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF1CD5DB8-1C04-4B47-9D00-78EE50357799.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/10b161f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF1CD5DB8-1C04-4B47-9D00-78EE50357799.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming'}], 'breadcrumb': {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/news', 'name': 'News', 'position': 1}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/business', 'name': 'Business', 'position': 2}]}, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence-Focused Companies Advance Programming', 'datePublished': '2019-07-16T12:22:53.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-07-16T15:15:05.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/10b161f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF1CD5DB8-1C04-4B47-9D00-78EE50357799.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly all Fortune 500 companies – more than 98 percent – plus an increasing number of smaller businesses filter resumes using an applicant tracking system before they ever make it to a human hiring manager, according to a 2018 analysis of job listings by resume optimization service Jobscan. “And it’s only a matter of time before AI-enabled tools become even more prevalent,” says Lisa Rangel, former recruiter and managing director of Chameleon Resumes. “Many larger companies are already using AI-candidate screening tools that focus on the whole candidate and not just a resume. As these tools become more mainstream and affordable, they will become more widely used.”
AI is infiltrating many processes related to recruiting and hiring, according to Al Smith, CTO with talent acquisition software provider iCIMS. “This includes screening candidate resumes in comparison to job descriptions and using AI-powered chatbots to streamline communications and schedule interviews,” Smith says. “Organizations are recognizing that machines can be incredibly efficient in identifying the most qualified individuals in the candidate pool, thereby giving recruiters the chance to focus their time on more meaningful tasks and building relationships with best-fit candidates.”
[ What artificial intelligence can and can’t do now: AI in the enterprise: 8 myths, debunked. ]
But what does that mean for the candidate on the other side of these machine-driven hiring efforts? IT leaders can take steps to make sure their resumes are optimized to use this AI screening to their advantage – and avoid some common mistakes. Consider these do’s and don’ts:
1. Do spell out acronyms
This is true, both figuratively and literally. “Candidates should highlight all their skills that are relevant to a particular role on their application or resume,” says Smith. “Applicant tracking systems match keywords from job descriptions with resumes to find candidates that are the best fit for the role. Many AI tools also have semantic and synonym capabilities, so they can align similar language between job descriptions and resumes.”
Include any special projects, skill sets, and certifications, and the full name of relevant systems and software. It’s important to be accurate, Smith says, and define acronyms to avoid being filtered out of the pool.

2. Don’t try to game the system
“It is incredibly important to be honest,” Smith says. “Some candidates apply to several jobs at an organization with a slight change to their email address or name. Applicant tracking systems are designed to match similar profiles, so the technology will catch and flag this, potentially reflecting badly on the submitted resume and impacting the candidate’s potential.”
Smith has seen some job hunters overload their resumes with keywords they think will get them in the door or sneak some in a white font readable only by machine. “While one may have the ability to trick an AI system to a certain degree, eventually a phone screening or live meeting with a hiring manager will bring to light that the applicant may not be as qualified as they claim.” 
3. Do differentiate yourself
Many job seekers assume that 100 percent compliance [with] the perfect keywords will get them past the screens, says Rangel. That’s not the case. Instead, candidates should focus on their achievements and differentiators in their resumes. In fact, Smith says, “they should avoid overloading their resume with the exact keywords from the job description, as advanced applicant tracking systems can recognize this and it may have potential to reflect poorly on the application.”
You may want to rethink overused words like innovation or transformation as well.
You may want to rethink overused words like innovation or transformation as well, advises Pat Ryan, executive vice president of enterprise architecture at SPR. “If a company is sifting through a collection of documents it will likely filter out words used by many people or that are filler words. If everyone wrote the words ‘innovative’ or ‘leadership’, then the algorithm might filter those words out, even if these words are individually important to the text being analyzed.”
4. Don't limit your job hunting to online submissions
“Realize that if you want a human to reach out to you, reach out to a human,” says Rangel. “Use the job posting to research the job.” Do some research using LinkedIn to get close to the hiring manager, and contact him or her directly or through a connection.
5. Do continue to network with human beings
“Networking [employee referrals, social media connections, and personal contacts] is still the best way to land quality jobs,” says Rangel. “There will always be a new tool or application that can make the job landing process smoother for some. Try it, but if the new shiny hiring tool doesn’t seem to work for you, know there is nothing wrong with you, but instead you might need to use a more traditional tactic that has been tried and true for years.”
6. Don’t wait for an opening to enter the resume tracking system
“Candidates should join talent pools for companies of interest, even if there isn’t a current role open,” says Smith. “When a relevant role opens, those in the talent pool will be among the first to know and could give them a competitive edge. “
7. Do consider the upside of AI in job hunting

While bot-enabled recruiting is new and imperfect, it has potential benefits not just for the hiring companies, but for IT leaders trying to land their next job. “AI can help eliminate human error by always ensuring that employers see the resumes of those who are truly qualified for the role,” Smith points out. “Without AI, a recruiter may miss a qualified candidate’s resume by simple mistake, or their own bias may get in the way of advancing a candidate to the next stage. AI screening systems also make it much easier for qualified candidates to be elevated for hiring manager review more quickly, as those who are not qualified are weeded out earlier the process.”

Artificial intelligence, which is predicted to grow to an $89.8 billion industry(link is external) by 2025, is already having a profound effect on consumers—but it will also significantly impact real estate professionals. From chatbots that handle clients’ needs to smarter ad campaigns that produce high-quality leads, AI is changing the way agents work.
Here’s how the technology will impact the buying and selling process for agents and brokers.
Provide accurate property valuations.
Determining property value can be challenging. You must evaluate as many factors as possible to give a fair price. However, the assessment no longer has to be done manually.
Automated valuation models, or AVMs, use regression analysis to estimate the market value of a property accurately by looking at similar properties that recently sold in the market. You can leverage machine learning software to analyze vital information, such as changes in the local neighborhood, schools, public transportation, and other factors, to assess property values. This enables you to dig deeper beyond the previous sale price to provide a more precise property value.
AI software can also streamline the negotiation process by predicting where a price compromise is likely to happen. You can prevent business losses that may result from giving a property price that’s too low or too high. With AI, you can be assured that an initial offer is well within the market price and that you have the data to back it up.
Create better ad campaigns for lead generation.
AI is improving how ads target consumers(link is external) so you can get in front of more people. Instead of spending time and resources to set up an ad campaign manually, you can let AI do the hard work for you.
From ad creation and targeting to custom video listings, AI is a powerful tool that can help increase lead generation. AI-based software can automatically generate suggested ad campaigns by detecting your new listings and upcoming open houses in the MLS. With every new lead, the system then notifies you via a text message and email. You’ll also be able to access detailed reporting that shows ad performance and specific insights about who the ad has reached. This helps you save time to focus on other meaningful business tasks.
Engage clients and increase lead conversions.
You aren’t available to speak to potential clients around the clock. However, chatbots are ready to interact 24/7 with online leads that come to you via your website. Sixty-nine percent of consumers prefer chatbots for quick communication with brands, according to The 2018 State of Chatbots Report(link is external).
Chatbots can prompt customers to ask questions and instantly respond to queries about a property, such as those related to square footage, lot size, number of bedrooms, and any other details. Using machine learning, you can discover more about a client’s home search and preferences and then respond to more complex questions over time. Chatbots can also make personalized offerings based on a specific user’s preferences.
While chatbots will not replace you entirely, they make it easier for you to qualify online leads and increase transactions. Many agents have managed to increase property closings by using chatbots and personal assistants.
Streamline data management.
You deal with massive amounts of data involving legal papers, appraisal reports, zoning regulations, and other crucial documents. Although documents have become digital, humans must still sift through all of the data. However, AI makes it possible to manage data faster and more thoroughly without the human eye.
AI-based tools can spot inaccuracies in data by continually analyzing it. These tools can send notifications to you in the event of any inconsistencies, such as empty MLS fields, missing signatures, legal mistakes, and invalid characters.
You can use AI-powered software to conduct demographic market research and financial and environmental analysis. Software that uses machine learning can recognize patterns in the data to generate actionable insights. For example, with enough relevant data, AI can predict when a particular type of property will increase in popularity.
Much of AI has yet to enter the real estate industry. However, it’s gaining traction quickly. Agents that are prepared to embrace AI-based technologies will take their business to new heights and remain competitive in a changing landscape.

July 16, 2019 — Computational pathology company Paige announced the publication of an article in Nature Medicine describing an artificial intelligence (AI) system for computational pathology that achieves clinical-grade accuracy levels. The paper provides further scientific evidence that pathologists’ work in diagnosing and treating cancer can be complemented and aided through the deployment of computational decision-support systems to improve patient care.
The team of scientists responsible for the work described in the article developed specially-designed deep learning algorithms to build a system that can detect prostate cancer, skin cancer and breast cancer with near-perfect accuracy. These algorithms are based on a vast dataset of nearly 45,000 de-identified, digitized slide images from more than 15,000 cancer patients from 44 countries.
The paper outlines how a series of novel algorithms, created using datasets 10 times larger than those that have been manually curated, performed better and also are more generalizable. The significance of this new development hinges on the fact that curating datasets can be prohibitively expensive and time intensive. By eliminating the need to curate datasets, Paige can now develop many more highly accurate algorithms that can be built into clinical decision support products to help pathologists around the world drive better patient care.
Paige plans to commercialize several of these solutions to address the most pressing needs in pathology to improve patient care. The company has already built on the academic work described in Nature Medicine to develop a clinical product, based on technology currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a designated Breakthrough Device, for an intended indication different than the one described in the article.
All data collection, research and analysis for this research was conducted exclusively at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) in New York City. The publication of the study’s findings was the result of collaboration between numerous researchers and clinicians, and made possible by Paige’s partnership with MSK. All data were de-identified and did not contain any protected health information or label text.

July 16, 2019 by Twain Taylor 1 Comment Artificial intelligence (AI) is making all the difference between innovators and laggards in the global marketplace. Yet, implementing a state-of-the-art DataOps operation involves a long-term commitment to putting in place the right people, processes and tools that will deliver results.In this post, we look at three organizations that are doing cutting-edge work in the field of DataOps. We look at the specific strategies they use and the results they’ve seen as they navigate the uncharted waters of DataOps.Uber: End-to-End DataOpsUber is very vocal about the way it leverages AI across its apps and services globally. The company runs all its machine learning (ML) models on a platform called Michelangelo and use many other proprietary tools such as Manifold, Horovod and Piper to optimize and scale these operations.



Michelangelo helps manage DataOps in a way similar to DevOps by encouraging iterative development of models and democratizing the access to data and tools across teams. On top of this platform, Uber uses other tools to help data teams.Uber ran its models in Tensorflow and realized model training was taking too long because of the large data sets it was dealing with. Taking a page from Facebook’s data team, the company realized the power of distributed training. This would enable Uber to run data operations in parallel on hundreds of distributed GPUs, rather than on a few GPUs. Yet, managing all this would be a challenge, which is why Uber built a tool called Horovod. Now under the auspices of The Linux Foundation’s Deep Learning community, Horovod supports additional frameworks such as PySpark, Petastorm and Apache MXNet. Additionally, using mixed precision training, Horovod is able to optimize the use of memory when running models, and in doing so, it enables running larger data models or running numerous mini-batches of data in parallel.

Manifold is a visualization tool that helps to gauge the performance of various models against each other. Rather than use a simplistic, two-dimensional axis to plot performance data, Manifold groups large quantities of model performance data into subsets that avoid duplicating the important indicators of performance. This reduces noise and helps speed analysis of the data. The lesson: Look beyond the trees to view the entire forest when it comes to metrics.By adopting an end-to-end approach to DataOps and leveraging specialized tools at every step of the pipeline, Uber is pioneering the use of AI in its large-scale consumer applications.Netflix: Offline First, Then OnlineContent recommendation is key to the user experience in the Netflix app. Highly relevant content makes the experience personal and drives higher engagement. However, making this happen behind the scenes involves working with large quantities of data and overcoming obstacles every step of the way.Netflix uses Spark to power content personalization. While the company has existing models in production, it always is testing new models and hypotheses to improve on existing ones. However, every new model needs to be tested against an older model and should be proven to be better before being implemented. Netflix does this model testing offline rather than online in the live app. The company makes a copy of historical data and performs offline feature generation on this data. The features are stored in a Hive store in AWS S3, and subsequent feature generation and model training is done in Spark. Once a new model is ready, it is run in parallel with a live model and, if it performs better, it is deployed.Key to the success of this operation is the logging of historical facts from online to offline. This includes Netflix-specific facts such as video, user and computation facts. Once this historical data is stored, a data worker is able to run simulation tests against it using the newly developed models. These simulation tests are a great way to test models without breaking things and save time by failing fast. Once tested and compared with live models, Netflix goes on to establish different SLAs for different microservice apps that these models serve. All this effort results in a highly relevant recommendation engine and a very personalized experience for Netflix users.Airbnb: Tapping Into Related Data StoresAirbnb uses AI to improve the search rankings and relevance of its “AirBnB experiences” offering. The company started simply, only recording users’ daily searches, clicks and bookings. Soon, it created features on top of this raw data, including features such as experience duration, price of experience and user reviews, which would help build models. Airbnb used a ranking model to give weight to experiences that had a better conversion rate, better user reviews and a lower price than those with just a higher booking volume. This improved experience bookings by 13%.Going further, Airbnb tapped into the other user data it had—homes booked by Airbnb users—to further personalize the ranking of experiences. This is where things get interesting, as AirBnB is able to show experiences that are more likely to match a user’s interests. This is only possible by looking beyond a single data store and looking for relevant data that may exist elsewhere in the organization. This personalization further improved experience booking by 7.9%.Similar to Uber, Airbnb uses a combination of offline and online scoring for models. While the historical data is great to get started with and run basic simulation tests, online scoring unlocks additional features such as user location, search filters and login status that wouldn’t otherwise be available offline.ConclusionAI is changing everything, and DataOps is no exception. By helping companies to make sense of their data more quickly and with less reliance on human effort, AI drives faster, more consistent results.The good news for most of us is you don’t need to be a major tech company such as Uber, Netflix or Airbnb to take advantage of AI-driven DataOps. Tools such as Unravel are making AI-powered data insights practical for organizations everywhere, without requiring them to build bespoke DataOps solutions.This sponsored article was written on behalf of Unravel.— Twain Taylor

Britain Honors Computer Scientist Alan Turing As The Face of Their New Bank Note

Humans16 July 2019By Karla Adam, The Washington Post 

 
(Public Domain) 



Alan Turing, a founding father of computer science and artificial intelligence, was revealed Monday as the face of Britain's new 50-pound bank note.Turing was also famed as a World War II codebreaker whose work was widely credited with hastening the end of the war and saving thousands of lives. But at the time, his achievements were overshadowed following his conviction of engaging in homosexual activity - then a criminal offense in Britain.



Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said that ""as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as [a] war hero, Alan Turing's contributions were far-ranging and pathbreaking."" He called Turing ""a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand.""



Carney made the announcement Monday at Manchester's Science and Industry Museum, which will also feature an exhibition of the 12 finalists who were considered for the note, including theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking.



During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, where he helped to develop a machine that cracked the Enigma code used by Nazi Germany.



His work also laid the groundwork for the modern computer and artificial intelligence. His famous ""Turing test"" is still used as a benchmark for examining whether a machine can be considered to be thinking.



After the war, Turing pleaded guilty to a charge of ""indecency"" related to his homosexuality and was sentenced to chemical castration. In 1954 - at age 41 - he died after apparently poisoning himself with cyanide. A bitten apple was found by his bedside.



British Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted Monday that Turing's ""pioneering work"" played a ""crucial part"" in ending World War II. ""It is only fitting that we remember his legacy and the brilliant contribution LGBT people have made to our country"" on the new 50-pound note, she wrote.



Dermot Turing, Alan Turing's nephew, said in an emailed statement that the entire family was ""delighted."" He also praised the Bank of England for focusing on his uncle's work in computer development and computer science.



""It reminds us that this was what he was best known for during his own lifetime and - I think - what he would most wish to be remembered for today,"" he said.The Oscar-winning 2014 biopic ""The Imitation Game,"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch, brought further attention to the complex math genius and his team's role in the defeat of Adolf Hitler. On Monday, Cumberbatch told the BBC that he ""couldn't think of a more deserving candidate."" Turing was an ""extraordinary human being, a unique mind, and he suffered a great deal in an intolerant time,"" he said.



Kim Sanders, a spokeswoman for Stonewall, a gay rights charity, said in a statement: ""It's important that we remember and recognize the impact of LGBT figures throughout history, so it's great that Alan Turing will be the face on the new £50 bank note. It's vital that we celebrate LGBT history, which is often less visible, and make sure that we represent the diversity of those who paved the way before us.""



She added: ""The world we live in now is very different to Turing's time, and LGBT rights have come a long way. But the fight for true equality is far from over.""



In 2013, after a lengthy campaign, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a royal pardon for his ""crime"" of homosexuality. In 2017, under legislation that became known as ""Turing's law,"" Britain granted pardons to thousands of gay and bisexual men who were convicted of offenses related to their sexuality.



The new note, expected to enter circulation at the end of 2021, will include an image of Turing, ticker tape of his birth date in binary code, and a table and formula from a 1936 paper that introduced the concept of how computers could operate.



It will also include a quote from Turing about the ascent of computers, given to the Times of London newspaper in 1949 but perhaps just as apt today: ""This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.""

Researchers set out to detect bias in AI using an AI tool and found it. (NicoElNino/iStockPhoto)
Researchers have developed a tool using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect unfair bias in protected areas such as race or gender. The tool could be used in finding bias in AI systems or even bias by human decisions makers, according to the researchers at Penn State and Columbia University.“Artificial intelligence systems—such as those involved in selecting candidates for a job or for admission to a university—are trained on large amounts of data, but if these data are biased, they can affect the recommendations of the AI systems,” said Vasant Honavar, professor of information sciences and technology at Penn State in a statement.If a company has never hired a woman for a particular job, an AI system trained on such historical data wouldn’t likely recommend a woman for a new job at the company.Honavar said in that example that there would be nothing wrong with the machine learning in the software program itself. “It’s doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to identify good job candidates…but since it was training on historical, biased data it has the potential to make unfair recommendations.”The researchers created an AI tool to detect bias by human or AI systems that is based on causality, or cause and effect.The question, “Is there gender-based discrimination in salaries?” can be restated as “Does gender have a causal effect on salary?” or “Would a woman be paid more if she was a man?” To know that answer directly, the researchers used counterfactual inference algorithms to arrive at a best guess. One way of arriving at a best guess for a fair salary for a female would be to find a male with similar qualifications, productivity and experience. “We can minimize gender-based discrimination in salary if we ensure that similar men and women receive similar salaries,” said Aria Khademi, a grad student in information sciences and technology at Penn State.Researchers used income data from the U.S. Census Bureau to spot gender-based discrimination in salaries and New York City police department data for findings of bias against people of color arrested after stop-and-frisk arrests. With incomes, the teams used data on 50,000 people and found evidence of gender discrimination in salary, specifically that the odds of a woman having a salary greater than $50,000 a year is only one-third that of a man. For the possible racial bias, the researchers revealed evidence of possible racial bias against Hispanics and African-Americans, but found no evidence of discrimination against them on average as a group.Honavar said the tool the researchers built can help organizations avoid becoming instruments of discrimination and threats to unfairness. “You cannot correct for a problem if you don’t know that the problem exists…Our tool can help with that,” he said. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.RELATED: ""AI chips advance with Intel's Pohoiki Beach""

Preventing unfair treatment of individuals on the basis of race, gender or ethnicity, for example, has been a long-standing concern of civilised societies.   However, detecting such discrimination resulting from decisions, whether by human decision makers or automated AI systems, can be extremely challenging.   'Artificial intelligence systems—such as those involved in selecting candidates for a job or for admission to a university—are trained on large amounts of data,' said Vasant Honavar, a professor at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in the US.   'But if these data are biased, they can affect the recommendations of AI systems,' Honavar said.   He said if a company historically has never hired a woman for a particular type of job, then an AI system trained on this historical data will not recommend a woman for a new job.   'There's nothing wrong with the machine learning algorithm itself,' said Honavar.   'It's doing what it's supposed to do, which is to identify good job candidates based on certain desirable characteristics. But since it was trained on historical, biased data it has the potential to make unfair recommendations,' he said.   The team created an AI tool for detecting discrimination with respect to a protected attribute, such as race or gender, by human decision makers or AI systems.   'We can minimise gender-based discrimination in salary if we ensure that similar men and women receive similar salaries,' said Aria Khademi, graduate student at Penn State.   The researchers tested their method using various types of available data, such as income data from the US Census Bureau to determine whether there is gender-based discrimination in salaries.   They also tested their method using the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk programme data to determine whether there is discrimination against people of colour in arrests made after stops.   'We analysed an adult income data set containing salary, demographic and employment-related information for close to 50,000 individuals,' said Honavar.   'We found evidence of gender-based discrimination in salary. Specifically, we found that the odds of a woman having a salary greater than USD 50,000 per year is only one-third that for a man.   'This would suggest that employers should look for and correct, when appropriate, gender bias in salaries,' he said.   Although the team's analysis of the New York stop-and-frisk dataset—which contains demographic and other information about drivers stopped by the New York City police force—revealed evidence of possible racial bias against Hispanics and African American individuals, it found no evidence of discrimination against them on average as a group.   'You cannot correct for a problem if you don't know that the problem exists,' said Honavar.

How advanced is AI today? 











Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence
12:54

Despite what you hear about artificial intelligence, machines still can't think like a human, but in the last few years they have become capable of learning. And suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. Today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. That's why so many people are desperate to meet Kai-Fu Lee, the oracle of AI.Kai-Fu Lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a Beijing Internet Conference. His 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.60 Minutes Overtime: China's greatest natural resource may be its dataScott Pelley:  I wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence? 






Kai-Fu Lee: I think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.Scott Pelley: But you do believe it's going to change the world?


Kai-Fu Lee: I believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China. His Beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.
Kai-Fu Lee in a scrum of selfie seekers
Kai-Fu Lee: These are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.He's funded more than 50 AI start-ups.


Kai-Fu Lee: We have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.Scott Pelley: Ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.In 2017, China attracted half of all AI capital in the world. One of Lee's investments is Face++, not affiliated with Facebook. Its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. It settled on 61 which was wrong. I wouldn't be 61 for days. On the street, Face++ nailed everything that moved. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called ""deep learning."" Computers used to be given rigid instructions. Now they're programmed to learn on their own.Kai-Fu Lee: In early days of AI, people try to program the AI with how people think. So, I would write a program to say, ""Measure the size of the eyes and their distance. Measure the size of the nose. Measure the shape of the face. And then, if these things match, then this is Larry and that's John."" But today, you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system, ""Go at it. You figure out what separates Larry from John.""Let's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? Well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. That's what they mean by deep learning. It's not intelligence so much. It's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.So, Face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. It's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. When engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again. 


Another recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.Scott Pelley: Now what are all the dots on the screen? The dots over our eyes and our mouths?Songfan Yang: The computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.Songfan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students. 

Scott Pelley: Well let's look at what we are seeing here now. According to the computer, I'm confused, which is generally the case. But when I laughed I was happy. That's amazing.Songfan Yang: Exactly.The machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.


Scott Pelley: It can tell when the child is excited about math?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes.Scott Pelley: Or the other child is excited about poetry?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes. Scott Pelley: Could these AI systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?Kai-Fu Lee: That's possible in the future. It can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.""AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.""We found Kai-Fu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing studio. He's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. This English teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Duh-Fang.


Many students in Duh-Fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. Most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a boy.Kai-Fu Lee: When I arrived in Tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me English. And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.And, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm – they too are alumni of America – with a dream for China.

Scott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.Scott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.


College student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.Scott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?Monica Sun: I never think about it.Scott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?Monica Sun: Not that much.Scott Pelley: Not that much.With a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China. 






Why China is the ""Saudi Arabia"" of data
01:30

Scott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?


Kai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.Scott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.Kai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.Scott Pelley: But governments do.Kai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.Lee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in his latest book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.""Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.


Scott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40% of the jobs in the world.Scott Pelley: 40% of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40%, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions. 






What data does China have on its citizens?
02:06

There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. This system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. So for now, it may be that calling this ""intelligence,"" isn't very smart.


Scott Pelley: When will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?Kai-Fu Lee: Back when I was a grad student, people said, ""If machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence."" Now we say that's not enough. So, the bar keeps moving higher. I think that's, I guess, more motivation for us to work harder. But if you're talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, I would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.Scott Pelley: Possibly never? What's so insurmountable?Kai-Fu Lee: Because I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. And I currently see no way of solving them. Obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.Scott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?Kai-Fu Lee: We may.Produced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast

But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.Scott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?Kai-Fu Lee: We may.Produced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast",,Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 60, 'width': 600, 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/assets/standalone/cbsnews-logo-white-600x60.png'}]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/,,,,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/60-minutes-ai-facial-and-emotional-recognition-how-kai-fu-lee-is-advancing-artificial-intelligence-2019-07-14/'}, 'name': 'Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence', 'description': ""Scott Pelley reports on the developments in artificial intelligence brought about by venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee’s investments and China's effort to dominate the AI field"", 'thumbnail': {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/14/fd3ed823-3bc5-4fd6-80a6-6650d684c23d/thumbnail/1200x630/e7f49a83e8455ab3eba37d7012127738/oraclepic-1891097-640x360.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/14/fd3ed823-3bc5-4fd6-80a6-6650d684c23d/thumbnail/1200x630/e7f49a83e8455ab3eba37d7012127738/oraclepic-1891097-640x360.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d', 'uploadDate': '2019-07-14T19:05:00-0400', 'publisher': {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/', 'name': 'CBS News', 'foundingDate': '1927-09-18', 'sameAs': ['https://www.cbsnews.com/', 'https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews/', 'https://instagram.com/cbsnews/', 'https://twitter.com/CBSNews', 'https://www.youtube.com/CBSNews', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News'], 'logo': [{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 60, 'width': 600, 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/assets/standalone/cbsnews-logo-white-600x60.png'}], 'url': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/', 'parentOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}, 'actionableFeedbackPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735', 'correctionsPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#a0060f90-73b0-4a57-b756-ca7a7f26cc7d', 'Masthead': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963', 'missionCoveragePrioritiesPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca', 'ownershipFundingInfo': 'https://www.paramount.com/company-history', 'unnamedSourcesPolicy': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857', 'publishingPrinciples': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/'}, 'duration': 'PT0H12M54S', 'embedUrl': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/60-minutes-ai-facial-and-emotional-recognition-how-kai-fu-lee-is-advancing-artificial-intelligence-2019-07-14/?embed=1'}",,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/13/93adc61d-7eff-47a1-a569-c3925cb470fb/thumbnail/1200x630/61450745d76d094e06f25818618a3897/fullepisode.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d'}",1927-09-18,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#a0060f90-73b0-4a57-b756-ca7a7f26cc7d,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca,https://www.paramount.com/company-history,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857,,,,,,,,,,

The women, mostly from the local Muslim community, are helping to train computer vision algorithms used in autonomous vehicles and augmented reality systems, for the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, eBay and TripAdvisor.
The all-female centre is one of eight Indian offices operated by iMerit, an India- and US-based data annotation company, whose 2,200 local employees label the oceans of data generated by industries as diverse as manufacturing, medical imaging, autonomous driving, retail, insurance and agriculture.
The operation is part of a growing data-labelling industry that employs hundreds of thousands of workers in lower-income countries including Kenya, India and the Philippines. 
Companies such as Figure Eight and Mighty AI, and more traditional IT companies such as Accenture and Wipro, are forming part of a so-called “AI supply chain” that creates algorithms able to interpret material including driving footage, search results and photos for the largest US and European multinationals, including Facebook, Volkswagen and Google.

Today
, companies are embracing artificial intelligence as a way to automate decision-making and help drive new business opportunities. The challenge is that the algorithms that underpin the technology are as naive as newborns. They need to be fed millions of labelled examples to teach them to “see”.

For a self-driving car algorithm to be taught the meaning of road signs, or to tell the difference between a child and a fox, hours of footage have to be watched and objects tagged, frame by frame. An hour of video takes eight hours to annotate. In fact, a McKinsey report from 2018 listed data labelling as the biggest obstacle to AI adoption in industry.







According to a January 2019 report by analyst firm Cognilytica, the market for third-party data labelling solutions was $150m in 2018, growing to more than $1bn by 2023. “The largest technology companies don’t want to be in the business of training data, they want to own customer relationships [and] are using partners and procurement wisely,” said Leila Janah, founder and chief executive of Samasource, a San Francisco-based data labelling vendor with offices in Kenya, Uganda, and the US.
“But this is why conversations around ethical AI supply chains are so vital to have now. Before it starts moving out of their four walls, we have to make sure we set the standards, and this market doesn’t go the way of apparel factories. There is a huge opportunity to ensure this [labelling] industry is a positive force.”
The new workforce
When large multinationals first started developing machine learning algorithms for consumer products, data labelling was either farmed out to gig workers via crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, or conducted in-house by teams of workers in low-wage economies. These contractors were often grossly underpaid compared with other employees at the same companies, and not afforded the same benefits, while their work was treated as menial, according to researchers such as Sarah T Roberts, who interviewed dozens of tech workers in countries such as the Philippines for her book Behind the Screen.

As the volume of data that requires labelling has expanded exponentially, large companies have increasingly turned to third parties able to supply workers who specialise in specific types of data such as driving or medical information — and who are also paid and treated in an ethical manner.
Samasource, whose employees label data for Walmart, Google, Microsoft, Glassdoor, Continental and General Motors, among others, is headquartered in Nairobi and employs more than 2,800 people. “We have a labour model that employs people as full-time workers with benefits, paid at a living wage.
On average, we almost quadruple our workers’ incomes [when we hire them],” Ms Janah said. “We work with a population usually coming from informal settlements, rural villages, so the chance to have a job that pays well, and gives you computer skills and exposes you to AI, it means people treat this very seriously.”
iMerit’s all-female training facility near Kolkata has become a specialist centre for computer vision labelling, and overall the company employs a 50 per cent female workforce, most from low-income families in India. “It’s a community where the women were not allowed to travel to go to work elsewhere. So we started bringing projects to them,” said Radha Basu, chief executive of iMerit. 
The human factor
AI supply chain companies insist that their work no longer involves mindless, rote labelling of basic objects such as cats, dogs and houses but has evolved into a far more specialised set of tasks. 
For instance, iMerit employees might analyse in-car footage of drivers, including facial expressions and eye blinks to determine driver fatigue; they have trained voice clips for Amazon’s Echo speaker to understand language and analysed satellite imagery of individual buildings and construction sites, to train risk assessment algorithms for insurance companies, Ms Basu said.

Samasource worked on a project for Bayer that required annotating vascular cross-sections of plants to detect diseased cells for crop protection, to train an aerial field image algorithm. Ms Janah explained: “We want to focus on complex edge cases that machines can’t easily grasp, where you need humans to provide nuance and judgment. That’s where we add value.”
As the AI training market starts to explode, western groups using AI are looking to work with more ethical outsourcing companies, with a social impact model. “For the first time, people are questioning the [labelling] companies that don’t guarantee a living wage to workers in the AI supply chain. As a company, if you’re getting your data trained by those labourers, you owe it to them to treat them fairly,” Ms Janah said.
Ms Basu said: “In the long run, these young rural, tribal workers will cause a real change in the economic empowerment of their communities.”

Looking into the future of AI



In 1987, the US series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" introduces the Starfleet crew member Data, an AI in the form of an android. With the intellectual abilities of a human, Data worked based on parameters that allowed him to capture and analyze information. Subjective findings, intuition or social competences are not part of his system. Nevertheless, the figure strives to become more and more human-like through intensive training. For over 30 years, Data has embodied the vision of an intelligent machine – a strong AI that acts intelligently and flexibly on its own initiative.
Nowadays, that’s more than just a vision.
Research into AI was already ongoing as early as the 1950s.[1] One of its most famous representatives is Alan Turing, a British Mathematician who is known as the founder of the theoretical information and computer technology. In his paper “Computer Machinery and Intelligence”, published in 1950, he brings up the question of whether machines can simulate the human brain and act at the same level of intelligence.[2] The Turing Test, which he developed to test those capabilities, is still valid nowadays. But to date, no machine has passed this test.
Although there are many examples of so-called ‘weak’ or ‘narrow’ AI already being applied in everyday life – for example, in navigation systems, speech recognition, automated translations – these are primarily rule-based systems that use various methods to solve problems. The more advanced systems, such as voice assistants, self-driving cars or robots – such as those that are being developed by the American company Boston Dynamics – are still far away from the strong AI that can perform at the same level as a human brain. While we can learn facts independently using a few examples and transfer them to new problems, machines today must be trained with very large amounts of pre-structured data – this is known as ‘deep learning’.
All in all, the possibilities in the field of AI are far from exhausted.[3] Researchers are striving to create a form such as the fictional android, Data: a machine that finds its way around the world, continuously learns new things, and can transfer existing knowledge to new tasks.

Interview:  Dr. Helmut Linde, Global Head of Data Science & Analytics














Where do we stand today in the field of AI research? 



In recent years, AI research has made impressive progress in various fields – for example, in the recognition and synthesis of images or speech, in the motor control of machines, or in games such as chess or Go. Essentially, these advances are based on a special class of algorithms called deep learning. Its theoretical foundations are quite old and are based on ideas from brain research from the middle of the last century. However, the advances of recent years have been made possible by ever faster hardware and - thanks to the Internet - ever better access to huge amounts of training data. However, deep learning still has serious limitations: the dependency on training data, but especially the difficulty of transferring what has been learned into a new context.





















 
                                                            















What comes after Deep Learning?



I think that you have to completely rethink machine learning in order to overcome the previous limitations. On the one hand, we need input from the neurosciences - the neurosciences of the 21st century! - because so far, human or animal brains are the best proof that a physical living system can be much more intelligent than today's algorithms. On the other hand, we lack theoretical foundations: just as mathematicians have developed ""probability theory”, on which statistics are based, we need a ""theory of intelligence"" with which we can develop new algorithms. 











How far are we from an AI in the form of an android? Is it fiction or almost reality?



It is practically impossible to give a serious time estimate about it. Most experts agree that in principle it is possible to build such a strong AI. One can only speculate about when this will be achieved. But most AI researchers seem to think in decades rather than centuries, and I would agree.











How do they assess the social impact of successfully passing the Turing test?



The social impact will be greater than any other change humanity has ever experienced in its history. A strong AI could do almost any job at least as well as a human being and even much better. Furthermore, like any other software, it could be multiplied with very little effort. The potential of such a technology for economic and scientific progress is simply immeasurable. The big question is whether humanity will be able to use this power profitably for everyone. How will one distribute material abundance and secure the existence of those whose human labor is no longer needed? What are the psychological effects on society if most of its members no longer need to work? And is a strong AI even permanently controllable or do we have to fear that we will lose control over our technology?











To what extent do you at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany contribute to current research in the field of AI and how do you cooperate with other institutions (beyond your organization)?



On the one hand, of course, we do applied AI research, i.e. we try to use or adapt existing algorithms cleverly in the context of our industry so that we can derive economic benefit from them. This involves, for example, automatically analyzing medical imaging data or finding new chemicals with certain pre-defined properties for our Electronics business. In addition, we are currently setting up a small research group that will deal with the basics of intelligence. In essence, we want to understand how an agent - a biological brain or an AI - can get an idea of its environment and how it can abstract from irrelevant details. For example: how does a child learn so quickly what a cat is, even though each cat looks a bit different and even the same cat is constantly perceived from different perspectives and under changing light conditions? It is said that the brain forms an ""invariant representation"" of the cat - a kind of data set that describes a cat ""in itself"" and is unchangeable - i.e. invariant - regarding the many unimportant details. How exactly this works, however, is completely enigmatic. Answering this question is probably an important and necessary step towards strong AI. We believe that experts from brain research, computer science, mathematics and theoretical physics need to be brought together to make progress. Various academic institutions can be interesting cooperation partners here, such as the TU Darmstadt or the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt.











What do you find fascinating about your work?



I think that the phenomenon of intelligence is one of the most exciting topics of our time. You have to realize how impressively detailed and comprehensive the scientific worldview has become in the meantime. We can measure and understand things on time and size scales that are unbelievably far beyond our direct sensory perception. We can predict tiny elementary particles such as the Higgs boson on the basis of theoretical considerations and then prove them experimentally. The same applies to unbelievably massive and distant objects such as black holes and their gravitational waves. We measure cosmic background radiation that is over 13 billion years old and pulses from femtosecond lasers that last several millionths of a billionth of a second. We now also have a pretty good understanding of how living beings have developed in the more than 500 million years since the Cambrian explosion, and how the biochemistry of their cells works in the nanometer range. And then we have this 1.5 kg organ that we call the brain, that consumes just 20 watts of energy and that we constantly carry around with us - and we actually have no idea how it works...











How are we are using AI already?



From Siri to facial recognition, AI and machine learning are becoming familiar features of everyday life, transforming the way that we prevent, diagnose and treat different illnesses – as well as improving patient care. But they could also save lives, by helping find new and better treatments for disease, faster or by screening for diseases. 
The processes behind drug discovery can be challenging. Can AI and machine learning help alleviate some of the traditional bottlenecks, so we can get new and more effective drugs to patients, faster? Read our story how we are using AI for drug discovery. If you are interested in learning more about how we are enabling chemists to synthesize new compounds more efficiently, thus speeding up drug discovery so new medicines can reach patients sooner, than get to know SYNTHIA™, our AI based software. 

Medical robots, however, can help by relieving highly-skilled healthcare professionals from routine tasks. They can also perform highly accurate surgery, improve patient rehabilitation or target medicines specifically to where they are needed inside the body. Are medical robots with human-like characteristics about to change the way we diagnose medical conditions? Learn more about PETRA, the social medical robot who can screen for diseases!

The companies have worked together since 2016.Share this articleShareLike all technology, advances in artificial intelligence come with formidable questions about application and impact, and the pursuit of superhuman cognition is likely to yield proportionally significant ethical quandaries. Keeping these issues at the fore is key for Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership, the companies said.“The technology industry in the last few years has not done a good enough job about thinking ahead of time about the impact that their work is going to have,” Altman said in a conversation with Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. “So we want to make sure that the systems that we build are safe, understandable and most importantly, that the benefits of it are broadly shared.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, with $1 billion in backing from tech heavyweights like Musk, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel. Musk stepped down as chairman in February 2018, to “eliminate a potential future conflict” of interest, the company said in a blog post. Since then, OpenAI has restructured into a for-profit company so it can pursue the kind of financing necessary for such research, and to compete with giants like Google and Amazon.""The amount of money we needed to be successful in the mission is much more gigantic than I originally thought,” Altman told Wired. The San Francisco-based research lab has garnered mainstream attention with its projects, like a language modeling program that can take a prompt like a fake headline and use it to generate a convincing news article, complete with quotes and statistics. (You can test a slimmed-down version of the program here.) In April, an OpenAI notched a global first when its system trained to play Dota 2, a complex, multiplayer strategy game, beat the world champion esports team.Share37 CommentsNewsletterWednesdaysThe Color of MoneyAdvice on how to save, spend and talk about your money for the short and long term from Michelle Singletary.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

The company’s facial recognition software serves police in the US, Australia, and France. Idemia software checks the faces of some cruise ship passengers landing in the US against Customs and Border Protection records. In 2017, a top FBI official told Congress that a facial recognition system that scours 30 million mugshots using Idemia technology helps “safeguard the American people.”Tom Simonite covers artificial intelligence for WIRED.But Idemia’s algorithms don’t always see all faces equally clearly. July test results from the National Institute of Standards and Technology indicated that two of Idemia’s latest algorithms were significantly more likely to mix up black women’s faces than those of white women, or black or white men.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTThe NIST test challenged algorithms to verify that two photos showed the same face, similar to how a border agent would check passports. At sensitivity settings where Idemia’s algorithms falsely matched different white women’s faces at a rate of one in 10,000, it falsely matched black women’s faces about once in 1,000—10 times more frequently. A one in 10,000 false match rate is often used to evaluate facial recognition systems.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIDonnie Scott, who leads the US public security division at Idemia, previously known as Morpho, says the algorithms tested by NIST have not been released commercially, and that the company checks for demographic differences during product development. He says the differing results likely came from engineers pushing their technology to get the best overall accuracy on NIST’s closely watched tests. “There are physical differences in people and the algorithms are going to improve on different people at different rates,” he says.Computer vision algorithms have never been so good at distinguishing human faces. NIST said last year that the best algorithms got 25 times better at finding a person in a large database between 2010 and 2018, and miss a true match just 0.2 percent of the time. That’s helped drive widespread use in government, commerce, and gadgets like the iPhone.But NIST’s tests and other studies repeatedly have found that the algorithms have a harder time recognizing people with darker skin. The agency’s July report covered tests on code from more than 50 companies. Many top performers in that report show similar performance gaps to Idemia’s 10-fold difference in error rate for black and white women. NIST has published results of demographic tests of facial recognition algorithms since early 2017. It also has consistently found that they perform less well for women than men, an effect believed to be driven at least in part by the use of makeup.Advertisement“White males ... is the demographic that usually gives the lowest FMR,” or false match rate, the report states. “Black females ... is the demographic that usually gives the highest FMR.” NIST plans a detailed report this fall on how the technology works on different demographic groups.NIST’s studies are considered the gold standard for evaluating facial recognition algorithms. Companies that do well use the results for marketing. Chinese and Russian companies have tended to dominate the rankings for overall accuracy, and tout their NIST results to win business at home. Idemia issued a press release in March boasting that it performed better than competitors for US federal contracts.Many facial recognition algorithms are more likely to mix up black faces than white faces. Each chart represents a different algorithm tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Those with a solid red line uppermost incorrectly match black women's faces more than other groups.
NISTThe Department of Homeland Security has also found that darker skin challenges commercial facial recognition. In February, DHS staff published results from testing 11 commercial systems designed to check a person’s identity, as at an airport security checkpoint. Test subjects had their skin pigment measured. The systems that were tested generally took longer to process people with darker skin and were less accurate at identifying them—although some vendors performed better than others. The agency’s internal privacy watchdog has said DHS should publicly report the performance of its deployed facial recognition systems, like those in trials at airports, on different racial and ethnic groups.The government reports echo critical 2018 studies from ACLU and MIT researchers openly wary of the technology. They reported algorithms from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM were less accurate on darker skin.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThose findings have stoked a growing national debate about the proper, and improper, uses of facial recognition. Some civil liberties advocates, lawmakers, and policy experts want government use of the technology to be restricted or banned, as it was recently in San Francisco and two other cities. Their concerns include privacy risks, the balance of power between citizens and the state—and racial disparities in results. Even if facial recognition worked equally well for all faces, there would still be reasons to restrict the technology, some critics say.Despite the swelling debate, facial recognition is already embedded in many federal, state, and local government agencies, and it’s spreading. The US government uses facial recognition for tasks like border checks and finding undocumented immigrants.Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a home invasion that escalated into a fatal shooting. One suspect was arrested but another escaped. Detectives identified the fugitive by using an online photo to search through a mugshot facial recognition system maintained by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.Lieutenant Derek Sabatini of the Sheriff’s Office says the case shows the value of the system, which is used by more than 50 county agencies and searches a database of more than 12 million mugshots. Detectives might not have found the suspect as quickly without facial recognition, Sabatini says. “Who knows how long it would have taken, and maybe that guy would not have been there to scoop up,” he says.“Having these systems work equally well for different demographics or even understanding whether or why this might be possible is really a long term goal.”Michael King, Florida Institute of TechnologyThe LA County system was built around a face-matching algorithm from Cognitec, a German company that, like Idemia, supplies facial recognition to governments around the world. As with Idemia, NIST testing of Cognitec’s algorithms’ shows they can be less accurate for women and people of color. At sensitivity thresholds that resulted in white women being falsely matched once in 10,000, two Cognitec algorithms NIST tested were about five times as likely to misidentify black women.Thorsten Thies, Cognitec’s director of algorithm development, acknowledged the difference but says it is hard to explain. One factor could be that it is “harder to take a good picture of a person with dark skin than it is for a white person,” he says.Sabatini dismisses concerns that—whatever the underlying cause—skewed algorithms could lead to racial disparities in policing. Officers check suggested matches carefully and seek corroborating evidence before taking action, he says. “We’ve been using it here since 2009 and haven’t had any issues: no lawsuits, no cases, no complaints,” he says.Concerns about the intersection of facial recognition and race are not new. In 2012, the FBI’s top facial recognition expert coauthored a research paper that found commercial facial recognition systems were less accurate for black people and women. Georgetown researchers warned of the problem in an influential 2016 report that said the FBI can search the faces of roughly half the US population.The issue has gained a fresh audience as facial recognition has become more common, and policy experts and makers more interested in the limitations of technology. The work of MIT researcher and activist Joy Buolamwini has been particularly influential.Early in 2018 Buolamwini and fellow AI researcher Timnit Gebru showed that Microsoft and IBM services that try to detect the gender of faces in photos were near perfect for men with pale skin but failed more than 20 percent of the time on women with dark skin; a subsequent study found similar patterns for an Amazon service. The studies didn’t test algorithms that attempt to identify people—something Amazon called “misleading” in an aggressive blog post.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDBuolamwini was a star witness at a May hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, where lawmakers showed bipartisan interest in regulating facial recognition. Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) said racial disparities in test results heightened his concern at how police had used facial recognition during 2015 protests in Baltimore over the death in police custody of Freddie Gray, a black man. Later, Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) declared that Congress needs to “do something” about government use of the technology. “[If] a facial recognition system makes mistakes and those mistakes disproportionately affect African Americans and persons of color, [it] appears to me to be a direct violation of Americans’ First Amendment and Fourth Amendment liberties,” he said.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceWhy facial recognition systems perform differently for darker skin tones is unclear. Buolamwini told Congress that many datasets used by companies to test or train facial analysis systems are not properly representative. The easiest place to gather huge collections of faces is from the web, where content skews white, male, and western. Three face-image collections most widely cited in academic studies are 81 percent or more people with lighter skin, according to an IBM review.Patrick Grother, a widely respected figure in facial recognition who leads NIST’s testing, says there may be other causes for lower accuracy on darker skin. One is photo quality. Photographic technology and techniques have been optimized for lighter skin from the beginnings of color film into the digital era. He also posed a more provocative hypothesis at a conference in November: that black faces are statistically more similar to one another than white faces are. “You might conjecture that human nature has got something to do with it,” he says. “Different demographic groups might have differences in the phenotypic expression of our genes.”Michael King, an associate professor at Florida Institute of Technology who previously managed research programs for US intelligence agencies that included facial recognition, is less sure. “That’s one that I am not prepared to discuss at this point. We have just not got far enough in our research,” he says.King’s latest results, with colleagues from FIT and University of Notre Dame, illustrate the challenge of explaining demographic inconsistency in facial recognition algorithms and what to do about it.Their study tested four facial recognition algorithms—two commercial and two open source—on 53,000 mugshots. Mistakes that incorrectly matched two different people were more common for black faces, but errors in which matching faces went undetected were more common for white faces. A greater proportion of the mugshots of black people didn’t meet standards for ID photos, but that alone could not explain the skewed performance.The researchers did find they could get the algorithms to perform equally for blacks and whites—but only by using different sensitivity settings for the two groups. That’s unlikely to be practical outside the lab because asking detectives or border agents to choose a different setting for different groups of people would create its own discrimination risks, and could draw lawsuits alleging racial profiling.While King and others carefully probe algorithms in the lab, political fights over facial recognition are moving fast. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have promised action to rein in the technology, citing worries about accuracy for minorities. Tuesday, Oakland became the third US city to ban its agencies from using the technology since May, following Somerville, Massachusetts, and San Francisco.King says that the science of figuring out how to make algorithms work the same on all faces will continue at its own pace. “Having these systems work equally well for different demographics or even understanding whether or why this might be possible is really a long term goal,” he says.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

How to Balance Artificial Intelligence and Decision-Making in HR



By Steve Boese

July 26, 2019 

This is not the first time we have discussed artificial intelligence in the Inside HR Tech column, and it quite likely won’t be the last time. Judging by my unscientific but still reasonably accurate measure of the relative importance of an HR-technology topic or trend based on how much attention it received at recent HR Technology Conferences, I reckon that AI has emerged in the last five years as the single most discussed topic in HR tech. If it seems to you that everyone is talking or writing or speaking about AI in HR and in the workplace, you are pretty much correct. Even so, the topic feels so important for HR, for employees, for workplaces, that it may not (yet) be possible to pay too much attention to AI. That’s the conclusion I reached recently while reading some of the latest applications of AI technology in the workplace. Here are three themes on the issue.
RELATED: What’s coming up at HR Tech?
1. The Promise of Artificial Intelligence
My favorite explanation of AI and how it can be applied by organizations comes from the excellent book Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb. In the book, the authors lay out a simple model for decision-making and illustrate where and how AI tools affect decision-making. In short, a decision is simply choosing the best prediction of what might happen next, given a set of data and inputs, and applying our own judgment. They further explain that the power and benefit of AI technologies is that AI lowers the cost and increases the number of predictions available for us to select from.
Let’s take a common HR example: ranking a set of 1,000 applicants for an open job, with the decision being choosing which applicants to “short list” for additional interviews. A skilled recruiter could review all 1,000 applicants and create such a short list of the top eight to 10 applicants, but it would be extremely time-consuming. And as we have learned, even the best HR and recruiting professionals sometimes can miss important traits and characteristics, can fail to think expansively or creatively about applicants, and even can introduce unconscious bias into their evaluations and assessments.

Now let’s imagine this same process–ranking 1,000 applicants and creating a short list–supported by a powerful AI-technology solution. The AI can assess and rank the applications in a fraction of the time it would take a person, it can make connections between a person’s credentials and key success factors for the job, and it can ignore information about applicants that is inconsequential but often is the area where bias enters the process. In this case, the AI tool allows the recruiter to bypass the steps that are labor-intensive, lengthy and arguably better handled by the technology. The recruiter then can spend all of his or her time on the short-listed applicants, conducting meaningful interviews and determining which would make the best new hire. In an ideal world, this is a perfect example of how AI and people can work together to make the best HR decisions.
2. What if AI Goes Too Far?
But, if the above example is truly an ideal, we can also easily imagine a scenario where we allow the AI tools to perhaps go too far and take on too much of the responsibility for HR and decision-making about people. What if a recruiter permits the AI tools to create short lists of fewer candidates, thus missing the opportunity to interview some compelling candidates? What if the AI tool’s models are allowed to screen candidates and applications on an increasingly narrow set of characteristics and traits, also effectively artificially (pardon the pun) reducing the number of candidates who get to interview? Or finally, what if HR decides that the AI tool is so good at identifying the best candidate that it simply skips the short list and instructs the tool itself to send a job offer to the top-ranked candidate?
RELATED: The HR Technology Conference & Exposition® will be held Oct. 1-4 at the Venetian in Las Vegas.
Do these scenarios seem unlikely? Maybe, but news already is being reported that some applications of AI technology in the workplace are crossing this fine line between technology on one side and human judgment and agency on the other. In one example, a report from the NNY360 site shared how an AI-powered “assistant” works with customer-service representatives in a large call center.
“When Conor Sprouls, a customer-service representative in the call center of insurance giant MetLife talks to a customer over the phone, he keeps one eye on the bottom-right corner of his screen. There, in a little blue box, AI tells him how he’s doing. Talking too fast? The program flashes an icon of a speedometer, indicating that he should slow down.
Sound sleepy? The software displays an ‘energy cue,’ with a picture of a coffee cup. Not empathetic enough? A heart icon pops up.
Sprouls and the other call-center workers at his office in Warwick, Rhode Island, still have plenty of human supervisors. But the software on their screens–made by Cogito, an AI company in Boston–has become a kind of adjunct manager, always watching them. At the end of every call, Sprouls’ Cogito notifications are tallied and added to a statistics dashboard that his supervisor can view. If he hides the Cogito window by minimizing it, the program notifies his supervisor.”
If Sprouls or other call-center reps attempt to minimize or close the Cogito AI assistant, the report goes on to state, their supervisor is immediately notified. Does the application of AI in this example for these workers seem like it has gone too far by effectively placing an AI technology in a constant, always-on, never-silent combination of supervisor, colleague and coach? Some would argue yes. But just the fact that these kinds of applications and use cases of AI tech exist, and are growing, reminds us that HR leaders need to think about these technologies and issues with growing attention and concern.
3. Finding a Balance Between High Tech and High Touch
These examples of applying advanced technologies like AI to support HR and individual decision-making remind us of something that sounds simple and obvious but will become more important as AI technology is infused in more HR-tech solutions and incorporated into HR processes. And that is this: We must endeavor to find and even create the appropriate balance between the responsibility and influence that we grant technology to inform decisions and the responsibility and ultimate authority over those decisions that we reserve for ourselves. We can’t be beguiled into allocating or ceding more of the decision-making processes in HR and talent to technologies until we are certain that these technologies truly are advancing our practice of HR and, more importantly, not diminishing what is more important and what is best about HR: our understanding of, concern for and empathy toward people.
In HR, we are not as lucky as, for example, our colleagues in finance or in supply-chain management, whose decisions are often and certainly much less centered on people. For the CFO, the decision of which set of short-term securities will generate the best return on the organization’s excess cash with an acceptable level of risk can be granted to an AI tool without much concern about the impact of a bad choice. But in HR we are not so fortunate.
Our decisions, all of them eventually, impact lives. Sometimes in small ways, like when we use an AI tool to set worker schedules, a tool that can’t “know” how important it might be for a retail worker to be able to have an afternoon off to see his child’s soccer game. And other decisions can impact people in much larger and more significant ways, like when we decide to use a tool like the call center AI, which hovers over reps tracking not just their work but always making suggestions and reporting their actions. It is our responsibility, in the end, to know the people impact of our decisions, even the ones that we allow the AI tools to make.

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) leads the Arab world with its adoption of artificial intelligence in other sectors and areas of life and has a government that prioritizes artificial intelligence including an AI strategy and Ministry of Artificial Intelligence with a mandate to invest in technologies and AI tools.
The Amazing Ways Dubai Airport Uses Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock

AI Customs Officials

The Emirates Ministry of the Interior said that by 2020, immigration officers would no longer be needed in the UAE. They will be replaced by artificial intelligence. The plan is to have people just walk through an AI-powered security system to be scanned without taking off shoes or belts or emptying pockets. The airport was already experimenting with a virtual aquarium smart gate. Travelers would walk through a small tunnel surrounded by fish. While they looked around at the fish that swim around them, cameras could view every angle of their faces. This allowed for quick identification.

AI Baggage Handling

Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, the world’s biggest long-haul carrier, believes artificial intelligence, specifically robots, should already be handling baggage service including identifying them, putting the bags in appropriate bins and then taking them out of the aircraft without any human intervention. He envisions these robots to be similar to the automation and robotics used at Amazon.com’s warehouses.
PROMOTED
Air Traffic Management
In a partnership with Canada-based Searidge Technologies, the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) is researching the use of artificial intelligence in the country’s air traffic control process. In a statement announcing the partnership in 2018, the director-general of the GCAA confirmed that it is UAE’s strategy to explore how artificial intelligence and other new technologies can enhance the aviation industry. With goals to optimize safety and efficiency within air traffic management, this is important work that could ultimately impact similar operations worldwide.
Automated Vehicles
Self-driving cars powered by artificial intelligence and 100% solar or electrical energy will soon be helping the Dubai Airport increase efficiency in its day-to-day operations, including improvements between ground transportation and air travel. Imagine how artificial intelligence could orchestrate passenger movement from arrival to the airport to leaving your destination's airport. In the future, autonomous vehicles (already loaded with your luggage) could meet you at the curb. Maybe AI could transform luggage carts to act autonomously to get your luggage to your hotel or home, eliminating any need for baggage carousels and the hassle of dealing with your luggage.
Staff Clearance
While much attention is given to the process of vetting passengers to ensure safe air travel, artificial intelligence can also improve the staff clearance process. Some airports see the most significant security threat airports, and airlines face is with airport personnel. An EgyptAir mechanic, baggage handler and two police officers were arrested in connection with the bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268 where all 224 people on board died. There have been several arrests in Australia of border force officers linked to international drug smugglers. Part of these efforts to improve the staff clearance process includes enhancing staff entrances to enable greater control with biometrics, advanced facial recognition and the use of artificial intelligence rather than just CCTV cameras and police monitoring which is used now. Artificial intelligence can look for areas of concerns with a staff member’s behavior and record for crime and violence even before they are hired. After they are hired, AI algorithms can continue to look for changes that could indicate a security problem.

AI Projects Being Explored for the Future
Emirates is developing AI projects in its lab at the Dubai Future Accelerators facility. Some of these include using AI to assist passengers when picking their onboard meals, scheduling a pickup by a taxi as well as personalizing the experience of every Emirates passenger throughout the entire journey. They are also exploring how AI can help Emirates teach cabin crew. We can expect that artificial intelligence will be put to work to solve the problems of airplane boarding by looking at the issue in a way humans have been unable to. The goal would be for AI to architect a queue-less experience.
AI at Other Airports
The first biometric airport terminal is already running at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and a similar system is running at Dubai International Airport for first- and business-class passengers. Here are some other ways airports and airlines around the world are using artificial intelligence or plan to:
·         Cybersecurity: Airports and airlines have shifted from identifying cybersecurity to preventing cybersecurity threats with an AI assist in response to the expansion of digitalization across aviation.
·         Immersive experiences: Augmented reality might be the future of helping travelers find their way through an airport.
·         Voice recognition technology: At Heathrow Airport, passengers can already ask Alexa to get flight updates. United Airlines allows travelers to check in to their flight through Google Assistant by simply stating, “Hey Google, check in to my flight.”
As innovation gets pushed by the UAE, Dubai International Airport and other technology innovators around the world, there will be opportunities for abuse and privacy considerations when using these new AI tools and capabilities for air travel. But, if artificial intelligence can remove the biggest headaches from travel, some people (possibly most) will be more than ready to exchange a bit of privacy for a better experience when AI takes over.

Kalifa·FollowPublished inTowards Data Science·7 min read·Jul 25, 2019209ListenShareSOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKThroughout history, we have seen how organisations across entire industries have embraced robotic technology, and how today, it is almost impossible for some of these organisations to operate without it. Every day, we are witnesses of how technology is integrating into nearly every aspect of our life at work, and in many cases, we depend on it to perform most of our daily tasks.Over many decades, organisations have been using robots to automate daily processes. In fact, every day we are surrounded by them, whether at home, in the street or at the office — from ATMs and vending machines to more sophisticated surgical robots and self-driving cars. These robots come in different forms and shapes, and perhaps they don’t look like humans, but the enterprise loves them, and they surely are a key driver for massive productivity.Now, imagine a regular day — wake up in the morning, go to your workplace, grab a coffee, and start a conversation with your colleague… Everything seems normal, you engage in the conversation, exchange thoughts and new ideas, then finish and move on to your desk to start working. An hour later, your manager asks you to analyse and compare five long reports. You don’t have time for that, it would take too many hours of work and tons of energy; plus there are other things that you have to do. So, you ask your colleague for help and amazingly get the results back within an hour.This sounds very unrealistic, right? No normal colleague would do this work for you or even finish it so fast. But what if I tell you that your colleague is a ROBOT? A robot that looks and acts the same as any other human being. It can talk like you, think like you, and almost reason like you do. But it is still a robot. How would you feel?SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKArtificial Intelligence, Machine Learning & Robotics:Many robots are not artificially intelligent, they are programmed to perform repetitive tasks or movements to manipulate objects in the real world. However, some experts suggest that what constitutes a robot is its ability to think and make decisions, but doesn’t it imply the use of AI?On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to replicate human intelligence behaviour by addressing skills like problem-solving, learning, perception, and reasoning. It can involve some level of Machine learning (ML), which is based on the idea of granting machines access to data that will allow them to learn by themselves.AI together with ML and Robotics intend to create a man-made machine/robot with human intellectual capacities that can be able to formulate original ideas by itself. We have not achieved this yet, but we have made a lot of progress.You have probably already heard about Sophia, the social robot that looks like a human. If you know what I’m talking about, think about a more sophisticated version of Sophia working and collaborating with humans.Other big developments include the so-called “Robotic Process Automation” (RPA). These are software robots that help businesses and employees do simple jobs by replicating human interaction. It is only a software and not a physical AI Robot, but this is definitely a significant breakthrough.The real challenge is to make AI understand how natural intelligence works because we know how our brain functions, and we can teach AI how to think and learn, but we still don’t know exactly how all these connections can lead AI to the use of abstract reasoning or “common sense”.SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKMy Colleague is a Robot:Going back to where we started — robots designed to share a workspace with humans by carrying out physical and intellectual tasks, building up ideas with humans, learning from our environment, questioning decisions, and finding solutions together, will reduce many risks and exponentially increase productivity.Robots can already do many things much better than humans, but it still takes humans to interpret their work and apply the results in strategic and creative ways. For this reason, we need to make sure that robots are seen as complementary rather than competitive, and assign them the work that no one wants to do, the one that is intense and repetitive; leaving the part of the work that involves judgement and expertise, to humans.Imagine one more time, the same scenario where you engage in a conversation with your colleague, but now you know for sure and from the beginning that it is a robot. Would it feel weird?Probably, and I know it sounds scary as well, but if we give this deeper thought and think about the benefits and not the drawbacks of having an artificially intelligent coworker, it might just change our perspective. Some of these benefits include:Safety: Tasks that involve the use of heavy machinery, sharp objects, very high or low temperatures, chemicals, and others, will be performed by robots. This will protect workers in dangerous and unhealthy working conditions.Speed and Consistency: AI robots work fast and without any distractions, they have no need for vacations and are available 24/7.No Errors: Robots have almost no room for mistakes, they are precise and deliver quality.Happiness & Productivity: Most importantly, all these perks are intended to increase both, employee happiness and productivity. As mentioned before, these robots will take over those tasks that we don’t enjoy. From dangerous, tedious, and repetitive basic tasks to more complicated ones that require highly analytical skills.SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKExamples of Work That Can Be Complemented By AI Robots:Data Journalists: This type of journalists are those who are focused on analysing data. AI robots could perfectly perform these work much faster and efficiently.Secretaries: Administrative tasks like answering phone calls, sending emails, scheduling meetings, and others (including physical, manual tasks), can be done by AI robots.Document-Review (Attorneys): Many attorneys have to search through thousands of documents looking for specific information. AI robots can filter information in a flash, they can also analyse it and generate reports. This work applies to other related fields as well.Pharmacists: When you go to a pharmacy, an AI robot could scan your prescription and get your medicine. For over-the-counter medicine, you could indicate your symptoms and the robot will suggest a recommendation. Also, these robots could potentially have access to data from hospitals and your health records to make suggestions more accurate.AI Police and Intelligence Assitant: AI Robots could potentially assist the police and agencies like the CIA by collecting, storing, sorting through, and highlighting key data that is necessary for investigations. They could also perform some physical duties like patrolling, arresting, and even directing traffic.Botenders: Robots can be taught how to mix and serve drinks. Anything from beers to signature cocktails. They can make hundreds of them within minutes.There are many concerns about robots replacing people and eliminating jobs, but these robots could potentially work alongside humans, collaborate and complement our work rather than taking over jobs. In fact, technology will create more jobs than it will eliminate. Many jobs will change, and the new ones will require a new set of skills that we must acquire through advanced education and training systems boosted by AI.If we are going to share a workspace with robots and see them as partners rather than adversaries, they must first experience the world as a human, meaning that they would need to be able to learn about us. This will make the interaction between humans and robots much easier and can also allow them to keep learning much faster.Morality and AI CoworkersWhat do we expect from artificially intelligent coworkers in terms of morality?SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKAI and robotics will have a huge impact on society, values, and human rights.If we want machines to operate autonomously, at one point, they will require to collect a lot of data. But how much of these data do we want to share with robots? If a robot causes an accident, who would be responsible? Are we willing to give up our privacy to interact with robots? Can we even trust a robot?More questions will continue to arise as technology develops, and it is up to us to answer those questions by working together to implement a structure that regulates and protects the contour of these innovations.There are always two sides to every story, times of uncertainty will come and technology if gone wrong, can become dangerous. Therefore, we have to manage robots carefully, in the end, it is humans who will take charge of controlling, checking, and running the bots.AI and robotics should no longer be feared, but rather be seen as a tool for collaboration.",What if Your Colleague is a Robot - Towards Data Science,,https://towardsdatascience.com/what-if-your-colleague-is-a-robot-e1256b3e2c94,,,,['Emilio H.

But the Director of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Software Engineering at Intel, one of the world’s largest tech firms, is certain that by 2030 artificial intelligence will generate $13 trillion across the world. Abidi, who is originally from Lucknow, joined the chipmaker as a software engineer and is now responsible for deep learning framework software optimisation for Intel’s top of the line Xeon processors. “I was actually studying to be a doctor. But that was a long time ago and somehow it just ended there,” says Abidi who followed up her BS in pre-med and chemistry with an MS in computer science from the University of Massachusetts. Being responsible for optimising deep learning frameworks and workloads, Abidi now helps companies like Google, Facebook and Baidu iron out all areas where deep learning runs on Intel hardware. “My team works daily with Google. The optimisations we do get upstreamed to Google Tensorflow. Anybody downloading Tensorflow gets all the work my team has done.” On open source machine learning library, Tensorflow powers a lot of Google’s machine learning products like image recognition. Abidi’s portfolio is broad, straddling both the hardware and software sides of what Intel is doing in top-end computing. “On the hardware side, there are data centres and accelerators as well something like a compute stick. On the software side, which is my focus, we did so much work that it became at par with the competition,” explains Abidi, whose team came in for recognition for their work improving deep learning capabilities by 278 times. For someone who has been in the IT industry for well over two decades, the work on AI has been an eyeopener. “What I liked the best about AI is how people are building over each other’s breakthroughs. The models have been put on GitHub, papers are being shared, archive downloaded… I have not seen this before. Unbelievable,” she says, adding how everybody is coming together to standardise as much as possible. Abidi says her team’s work on Intel One API — a set of developer tools that provide a unified programming model — is an attempt to offer a solution so that everyone can collaborate more across different architectures. AI is nothing new, says Abidi, but now the coming together of data availability, cheap hardware and powerful algorithms have made this spurt possible. “So it is moving in a very good direction and that AI winter and all is gone. This is phenomenal and I’m really happy to be part of it. But if someone is hoping it to solve all those problems, then it is early.” But there are many projects that have given Abidi immense satisfaction. Like the work her team did to help Novartis process an image about 26 times larger than what the were used to in a matter of minutes and not days like before. Then there is the work on handheld devices that can detect diabetic retinopathy, as well as some image detection work that helped reduce poaching in Tanzania. For companies looking to add an artificial intelligence layer to their work, Abidi has a simple message: “Don’t do AI for the sake of AI, but do it so that it helps your business. So bake it into your underlying core and see how you can use it. And don’t reinvent the wheel.” She cites the example of Mujeeb Kolasseri from Palakkad in Kerala, a high school dropout who set up a business of tagging data from camera for clients all over the world to help machine learning. “That’s what I said about the kind of jobs that can be created.” “We have to be careful not to discard AI as a bad thing,” Abidi warns, underlining the ability of this new technology to “uplift mankind” in all areas.","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'IE Premium', 'productID': 'indianexpress.com:showcase'}",,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.ie-premium-content-block', 'video': [], 'audio': []}","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}",,,The Indian Express,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}",,,,,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}",en,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,,,2024.0,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/07/huma.jpg', 'caption': '', 'description': 'Behind cutting edge AI work, Lucknow woman who set out to be a doctor', 'width': 1200, 'height': 675}",1932.0,,,,,,,,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-16,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}"

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Data is crucial for business, but in order for it to be useful, there must not be any errors in collecting, processing and presenting that data. Artificial intelligence can monitor ETL processes to make sure they’re error-free.




ETL (extract, transform and load) is one of the most important processes in big data analytics — and simultaneously, it can be one of its biggest bottlenecks. (For more on big data, check out 5 Helpful Big Data Courses You Can Take Online.)
The reason ETL is so important is that most data a business collects is not ready, in its raw form, for an analytics solution to digest. In order for an analytics solution to create insights, the raw data needs to be extracted from the application where it currently resides, transformed into a format that an analytics program can read, and then loaded into the analytics program itself.
This process is analogous to cooking. Your raw ingredients are your raw data. They need to be extracted (purchased from a store), transformed (cooked), and then loaded (plated), before they can be analyzed (tasted). The difficulty and expense can scale unpredictably — it’s easy to make mac n’ cheese for yourself, but much more difficult to create a gourmet menu for 40 people at a dinner party. Needless to say, a mistake at any point can make your meal indigestible.
ETL Creates Bottlenecks for Analytics
ETL is in some ways the bedrock of the analytics process, but it also has some drawbacks. First of all, it’s slow and computationally expensive. This means that businesses often prioritize only their most important data for analytics, and simply store the rest. This contributes to the fact that up to 99% of all business data goes unused for analytics purposes.
In addition, the ETL process is never certain. Errors within the ETL process can corrupt your data. For example, a brief network error may prevent data from being extracted. If your source data contains multiple file types, then they might get transformed incorrectly. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say — errors during the ETL process will almost certainly express themselves in terms of inaccurate analytics.
A corrupted ETL process can have bad consequences. Even in the best-case scenario, you’ll probably have to re-run the ETL, which means a delay of hours — and in the meantime, your decision-makers are impatient. In the worst-case scenario, you don’t notice the inaccurate analytics until you’ve begun to lose money and customers.Advertisements




Streamlining ETL with Machine Learning and AI
You can — and probably do — assign someone to monitor ETL, but it’s honestly not that simple. Bad data can result from process errors that happen so quickly that they can’t be noticed in real time. The results of a corrupted ETL process often don’t look different from correctly loaded data. Even when errors are obvious, the problem that created the error may not be so easy to trace. (To learn more about analyzing data, see Job Role: Data Analyst.)
The good news is that machines can catch what humans can’t. These are just a few ways in which AI and machine learning can catch ETL errors before they turn into inaccurate analytics.
1. Detect and Alert Across ETL MetricsEven though your data is a constantly moving picture, the ETL process should still produce consistent values at a consistent speed. When these things change, it’s cause for alarm. Humans can see big swings in the data and recognize errors, but machine learning can recognize subtler faults, faster. It’s possible for a machine learning system to offer real-time anomaly detection and alert the IT department directly, allowing them to pause the process and remedy the issue without having to discard hours of computational effort.
2. Pinpoint Specific BottlenecksEven if your results are accurate, they might still come out too slowly to be of use. Gartner says that 80% of insights derived from analytics will never be harnessed to create monetary value, and that may be because a business leader can’t see an insight in time to take advantage of it. Machine learning can tell you where your system is slowing down and provide you with answers — getting you better data, faster.
3. Quantify the Impact of Change ManagementThe systems that produce your data and analytics are not static — they constantly receive patches and upgrades. Sometimes, these affect the way that they produce or interpret data — leading to inaccurate results. Machine learning can flag results that have changed and trace them to the specific patched machine or application.
4. Reduce the Cost of OperationsStalled analytics operations equal lost money. The time you spend figuring out not just how to solve the problem but also who is responsible for solving the problem is time you could be spending building value. Machine learning helps get to the heart of the matter by alerting only the teams that may be responsible for responding to specific kinds of incident, letting the rest of the IT department free to continue performing core job functions. In addition, machine learning will help eliminate false positives, reducing the overall number of alerts while increasing the granularity of information they can provide. Alert fatigue is very real, so this change will have a measurable impact on quality of life.
When it comes to winning in business, analytics is crucial. A landmark study from Bain Capital shows that companies employing analytics are more than twice as likely to overperform financially. ETL provides the foundation for success in this arena, but delays and errors can also prevent the success of an analytics program. Machine learning, therefore, becomes an invaluable tool for the success of any analytics program, helping to guarantee clean data and accurate results.
