US-based Mr Musk made his fortune at the digital payments firm PayPal before going on to run electric car-maker Tesla, space rocket company SpaceX and tunnel-transport business The Boring Company among other ventures. He also helped create OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research company, although he has since broken ties with it.Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, which rivals Amazon for the title of the world's largest e-retailer and is also one of the world's largest cloud computing providers. The group is one of the world's biggest spenders on AI, both within its own business as well as via investments in dozens of third-party companies.Their 45-minute conversation kicked off the World AI Conference (WAIC), which ties into China's goal of overtaking the US to become the world's leading artificial intelligence innovator by 2030.Less workMr Ma focused much of his comments on how machine learning could act as a force for good. He said it was something ""to embrace"" and would deliver fresh insights into how people think. ""When human beings understand ourselves better, then we can improve the world better,"" he explained.Furthermore, he predicted AI would help create new kinds of jobs, which would require less of our time and be centred on creative tasks. ""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" he said.""In the artificial intelligence period, people can live 120 years.""At that time we are going to have a lot of jobs which nobody [will] want to do. So, we need artificial intelligence for the robots to take care of the old guys.""So that's my view about jobs, don't worry about it, we will have jobs.""Getty ImagesJack Ma is China's second richest man, according to Forbes magazineBy contrast, Mr Musk suggested that mass unemployment was a real concern.""AI will make jobs kind of pointless,"" he claimed.""Probably the last job that will remain will be writing AI, and then eventually, the AI will just write its own software.""He added that there was a risk that human civilization could come to an end and ultimately be seen as a staging post for a superior type of life.""You could sort of think of humanity as a biological boot loader for digital super-intelligence,"" Mr Musk explained.""A boot loader is... sort of like the minimal bit of code necessary for a computer to start. ""You couldn't evolve silicon circuits. There needed to be biology to get there.""To avoid such a fate, he said we needed to find a way to connect our brains to computers so that we could ""go along for the ride with AI"" - something he is trying to achieve via one of his latest start-ups.Otherwise, he cautioned, AI would become weary of trying to communicate with humans, as we would be much slower thinkers in comparison.""Human speech to a computer will sound like very slow tonal wheezing, kind of like whale sounds,"" Mr Musk explained.""What's our bandwidth? Like a few hundred bits per second, basically, maybe a few kilobits per second, if you're going to be generous. ""Whereas a computer can easily communicate at a terabit level. So, the computer will just get impatient if nothing else. It'll be like talking to a tree - that's humans.""It will be barely getting any information out.""Musk and Zuckerberg clash over future of AIElon Musk quits AI ethics research groupJack Ma defends the 'blessing' of a 12-hour working dayBy contrast, Mr Ma acknowledged that AI could now beat humans at games like chess and Go, but claimed computers would only be one of several intelligent tools that we would develop in time.""Don't worry about the machines,"" he said.""For sure, we should understand one thing: that man can never make another man. ""A computer is a computer. A computer is just a toy. ""Man cannot even make a mosquito. So, we should have a confidence. Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It's the heart where the wisdom comes from.""Although Mr Ma acknowledged that we needed to find ways to become ""more creative and constructive"", he concluded that ""my view is that [a] computer may be clever, but human beings are much smarter"".Mr Musk responded: ""Yeah, definitely not.""It's going to get to the point where [AI] just can completely simulate a person in every way possible, like many people simultaneously,"" he added.""In fact, there's a strong argument, we're in the simulation right now.""Getty ImagesThe two men were given a range of topics to discuss but the event was unmoderatedTowards the end of the event the two men came together on one point - that concerns about overpopulation were misguided.""Assuming... there's a benevolent future with AI, I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse,"" said Mr Musk""I want to emphasise this, the biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse, not explosion collapse.""Mr Ma said he was absolutely in agreement.""One point four billion in China sounds a lot, but I think [over the] next 20 years we'll see this thing bring big trouble to China,"" he said.""And the speed of population decreasing is going to speed up. Now you've got a collapse.""However, he suggested, using AI to help people live longer, healthier lives could be part of the solution.

The job portal, which connects freelancers with clients, claims to have more than 34 million people from across 247 countries. According to CEO of Freelancer(dot)com, Matt Barrie, there has been an enormous demand for any skill relating to AI and ML, and is growing continuously. ""The second big trend is large companies moving towards a more agile, leaner workforce that addresses their immediate needs. This is evident in the number of administrative skills in this quarter's Fast 50,"" company's statement cited Barrie.

It has also added skills related to statistics and mathematics, along with mechanical engineering as top trending jobs. ""Overall, there's a heavy tech focus in this quarter's Fast 50,"" the report said.


Here's a narrative of the trending jobs on Freelancer(dot)com during Q2 2019.1/ Customer Service Customer service was the big winner in this quarter's Fast 50 report, with demand for the skill rising 54.78 per cent in Q2 2019 (from 1,913 to 2,961).

He spoke onstage with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., who is building manufacturing facilities in the city.Ma cited electricity as an example of how developments in technology could free up time for leisure. “The power of electricity is that we make people more time so that you can go to karaoke or dancing party in the evening. I think because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time enjoying being human beings.” Advertisement    He went on: “For the next 10, 20 years, every human being, country, government should focus on reforming the education system, making sure our kids can find a job, a job that only requires three days a week, four hours a day. If we don’t change the education system we are in, we will all be in trouble.”Just this year, Ma endorsed the China tech sector’s infamous 12-hours-a-day, six-days-a-week routine, so common it earned the moniker 996. In one blog post, China’s richest man this year dismissed people who expected a typical eight-hour office lifestyle, defying a growing popular backlash.“I don’t worry about jobs,” Ma said Thursday, making an optimistic case that AI will help humans rather than just eliminate their work. “Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It’s the heart where the wisdom comes from.”   Ma said the current education system was outdated — modeled for the industrial period — and that he foresaw a day when machines could outsmart humans in areas of memory and repetitive skills. He said future education systems needed to help people become more creative. Musk agreed with Ma, touting his Neuralink project, which is trying to merge the human brain with AI.“The way education works right now, it’s really low bandwidth, it’s extremely slow, lectures are the worst,” Musk said. “Down the road with Neuralink, you can just upload any subject instantly.

Jack Ma: You’ll Thank A.I. for That Ultra-Short Workweek

Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma thinks that artificial intelligence (A.I.) will allow humans to work 12-hour workweeks.  
Ma made that statement while sharing a stage with Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai.  “I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,” Ma said, adding: “I think that because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time to enjoy being human beings. I don’t think we’ll need a lot of jobs.” (Hat tip to The Washington Post for covering the event.)  
Musk, who helped co-found OpenAI, a semi-non-profit dedicated to mitigating any existential risk from A.I., also offered that computers will surpass humans “in every single way” (per CNBC).  
Ma’s statement about A.I. radically curbing the standard workweek is more than a little ironic, considering how he’s long been a supporter of the brutal “996” workweek, in which someone grinds away from 9 AM to 9 PM six days a week. He’s also framed workers who churn long hours as “blessed.” (Musk also likes to claim that he works more than three times the average workweek, thanks to managing Tesla and private-spaceflight firm SpaceX simultaneously.)  
People have spent nearly the past century predicting that technology will someday kill the need to work “full time.” Way back in 1930, famed British economist John Maynard Keynes theorized that people would eventually work only 15 hours per week. As recently as last year, billionaire Richard Branson suggested that the three-day workweek was within reach. So this isn’t a new concept, to say the least, even long before Ma seemingly thought it was inevitable.  
However, all the technological advancements and machine learning in the world won’t eliminate one key thing about humanity: we like to work. We might not like our current job, and we might bristle at some of the responsibilities shoved upon us on a day-to-day basis, but fundamentally we’re animals who like to do things. That’s why you see technologists worth millions (or even billions) still grinding away at their projects, when they could just as easily spend the rest of their lives on a beach somewhere, watching their company’s stock price fluctuate in-between sips of a tropical drink.  
The bigger issue is A.I. and machine learning taking jobs away entirely. There’s every possibility that automation will reduce and even eliminate the need for humans to do certain tasks—programmers, datacenter administrators, help desk staff, and even data analysts could end up in a battle to the death with software that can replicate much of what they do. Even though many companies aren’t really spending all that much money on A.I. at this juncture, that could quickly change as these A.I. and machine learning tools become more sophisticated.   
It would be great if Ma’s optimistic prediction turns out right, and machines assist people to the point where they only have to work a few hours a week. But what do we do if automation begins wiping out whole industries, and the people who want (and need) to work can’t find jobs?

Billionaire Jack Ma, booster of 12-hour days, now says AI will allow 12-hour weeks

Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, has vigorously endorsed China's grueling ""996"" culture, or working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. But now he has an even bolder vision for the future of work thanks to artificial intelligence: the 12-hour workweek. In the future, people may end up working only three days a week, with only four hours of work per day, Ma said at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News. In Ma's view, the development of AI could free humanity to partake in activities other than work, with the entrepreneur comparing AI with the advent of electricity.""The power of electricity is that we make people more time so that you can go to karaoke or dancing party in the evening. I think because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time enjoying being human beings,"" he said, Bloomberg reported.  






But, Ma added, the emergence of AI must be paired with an overhaul of the education system to prepare new generations for a drastically changed labor market. Education reform can ensure ""our kids can find a job, a job that only requires three days a week, four hours a day. ""If we don't change the education system we are in, we will all be in trouble,"" he said.The trouble is hereMa's remark about needing to revamp education to adapt to technological shifts underscores an issue that's already affecting the labor market: job losses for workers who have been replaced by tech. One group that has felt the biggest impact is women without a college degree. 






Automation could force millions of women out of their jobs

Decades ago, these workers flocked to offices to work as administrative assistants and other clerical workers. While it's not an issue that's received as much attention as the struggles in manufacturing, the fallout in clerical jobs is ongoing, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting a 5% decline in these workers through 2026. 


That equates to a loss of almost 200,000 jobs, which are mostly filled by women who rely on this type of employment to achieve a middle-class lifestyle. Such workers aren't enjoying shortened workweeks as they are replaced by software. Instead, they're shifting to lower-paying professions, like restaurant servers and home-health aides, that often entail longer work hours.40% of jobs are at riskSo rather than free up more time for karaoke, AI and other forms of automation threaten to displace tens of millions of workers, economists and policy makers warn.""Nearly 40 percent of current U.S. jobs are in occupational categories that could shrink between now and 2030,"" McKinsey researchers wrote in a recent report on the U.S. economy. ""No community will be immune from automation-related displacement.""Workers of all ages will need to retool their skills or else risk getting sidelined, in other words. And the shifting labor dynamics may explain the surge in interest for universal income. Without steady jobs, the least skilled and poorest workers may face a dismal future, even with a 12-hour workweek.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Jack Ma and Elon Musk discuss the peril and promise of artificial intelligence at a Shanghai AI conference. (Xinhua via YouTube)
In the debate over artificial intelligence, whose side is Elon Musk on?
Musk, who’s in charge of SpaceX, Tesla and the Neuralink brain interface venture, sized up the odds with AliBaba founder Jack Ma today during a widely watched one-on-one session at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai.
The way Musk sees it, the prospects aren’t great for humans if future AI agents decide to go rogue. That’s despite pronouncements from AI researchers who say machines won’t match humans anytime soon when it comes to general intelligence, as opposed to specialized AI applications such as playing chess or Go.
“The biggest mistake I see artificial intelligence researchers making is assuming that they’re intelligent,” Musk said. “Yeah, they’re not, compared to AI. And so a lot of them cannot imagine something smarter than themselves.”
Musk said future AI agents will be “vastly smarter” than humans. “So what do you do with a situation like that?” he asked. “I’m not sure. I hope they’re nice.”
For his part, Ma saw more promise than peril in AI.
“I’m not a tech guy. I think more about life,” Ma said. “I think AI is going to open a new chapter of the society of the world [in which] people try to understand ourselves better than the outside world.”

Ma said he wasn’t concerned about machines replacing humans in the workplace. “I think that because of artificial intelligence, people will have more time to enjoy human beings. I don’t think we’ll need a lot of jobs,” he said.
He went so far as to say that in the next 20 or 30 years, people could get by working three days a week, four hours a day.  (After the debate, The Washington Post noted that Ma’s prediction struck some Chinese observers as grimly ironic, in light of his past praise of a 72-hour weekly work scheme that’s known as “996” because it involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.)
Ma implied that humans would be able to keep the machines under control. “We invented a computer,” he said. “I never saw a computer invent a human being.”
Musk was far less sanguine. When Ma said “street-smart” people like himself will never be scared of AI and will always think it’s great fun, Musk replied: “I don’t know, man, that’s like ‘famous last words.’ ”
That’s why Musk is putting so much money into Neuralink, which recently reported progress in its effort to create an integrated brain-machine interface.
“If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em,” Musk said. “That’s what Neuralink is about. Can we go along for the ride with AI?”

Ma joked that he wasn’t crazy about the term “artificial intelligence,” even though his company has a network of AI labs around the world, including in Seattle. “I call it ‘AliBaba Intelligence,” he said.
Ma took aim at Musk’s plan to send settlers to Mars on the Starship launch system he’s developing. “It’s great to send 1 million people to Mars, but we have to care about the 7.4 billion people on Earth,” he said. “How can we make the world more sustainable?” Musk replied that his efforts to advance clean energy with Tesla could make a big difference in keeping Earth sustainable, and that his vision for Mars was meant merely to ensure that humanity survives as a multiplanetary species, even if Earth suffers a catastrophe. “To be clear, I’m pro-Earth,” he said.
Musk said it looks as if it’s up to humanity to keep the flame of consciousness burning, at least in our corner of the universe. “There are people out there who think we have found aliens,” he said. “Trust me, I would know. We have not. People ask me if I’ve been to Area 51. OK, please … SpaceX actually has Area 59 — eight better than Area 51.”
Doesn’t the prowess of game-playing programs such as Google’s AlphaGo prove AI’s superiority? Ma said it would be “stupid” to say machines were smarter than humans on that basis, just as it would be wrong to dwell on an automobile’s ability to go faster than a human. He contended that competitions like track and field, or Go and chess, are meant to pit humans vs. humans, not humans vs. machines. “I never, ever play chess or Go with a computer,” Ma said.
Musk noted that he was visiting Shanghai in part to visit Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 in China. Some media outlets speculated that Musk would show off the first Tesla electric car produced at the Chinese factory. Musk was also due to launch the Chinese division of his Boring Company tunneling venture.
Musk and Ma agreed that it’s hard to predict the future. Ma said “99.99% of the predictions that human beings had in history about the future — all wrong.” Which led Musk to ask, “Including that one?”

In the last 200 years, we have worried [that] new technology is going to take away all the jobs,” he said in a discussion in Shanghai with Elon Musk, Tesla’s billionaire co-founder. Tesla is building an electric-vehicle factory in the city, and the two were on the stage at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference there. Story continues below advertisementMa has previously courted controversy with his endorsement of the “996” work practices prevalent in China’s tech industry, under which employees are expected to work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.AdvertisementIn remarks earlier this year, Ma said that the opportunity to work such hours was a “blessing” and that without this kind of work culture, China’s economy was “very likely to lose vitality and impetus.”🌎Follow World newsFollowAnother tech titan went further, declaring that the 996 culture was for slackers. Richard Liu, chief executive of rival e-commerce company JD.com, said he works “8116+8” — or 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday to Saturday, then a mere eight hours on Sunday.

But speaking with Musk on Thursday, Ma said that in the future, people will be able to enjoy a much shorter workweek.Story continues below advertisement“In the next 20 to 30 years, human beings will live much longer. Life science technology is going to make people live probably 100 or 120 years,” he said. “That may not be a good thing because you get your grandfather’s grandfather still working hard.”AdvertisementBut it didn’t matter, he said, as the world wouldn’t need a lot of jobs.Artificial intelligence has been around for decades.

China’s netizens were unimpressed.“Ma has said previously that 996 was a blessing.

Okay, that may be a bit overblown, to the extent that it is worth asking what exactly all this artificial intelligence stuff is, and whether it may actually not be as great as everyone claims it is (nor as bad as everyone fears, if you take the opposite stance that AI is going after everyone's jobs).

A bit of a history lesson then is in order. Artificial intelligence as a concept has been around for as long as humans have been telling stories. Singing swords, enchanted items, the various stuff of magic is a way of ascribing intelligence and free agency to inanimate objects. Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge, supposedly created bronze handmaidens to help him when he was crafting the weapons of the gods. Talos, the Bronze automata that Hephaestus created to protect the isle of Crete featured as one of the more gripping stories in the tales of Jason and the Argonauts, where Jason and his men were only able to defeat him by taking off the oil cap on his ankle (the original Achilles heel) and letting the oil drain out.

Much more recently, in the 1950s, a team of researchers led by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy established what would in time become the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Minsky himself was a controversial figure during his life (he died in 2016). He was reponsible for one of the first neural networks, an algorithm that roughly modeled the way a limited number of neurons worked in the brain, but his criticisms of the theories of others such as Frank Rosenblatt's works on what the latter referred to as Perceptrons and his attempt to downplay what AI could do dampened investor interest in AI dramatically, leading eventually to what has since become known as the AI Winter that lasted through much of the 1960s and 70s.

In retrospect, this may not have been a bad thing. Minsky was correct in his assessment that computing power was insufficient at the time for AI to really work, and it would take the compounding factor of Gordon Moore's doubling of processing power every eighteen months another thirty years to reach a stage where the computers were beginning to have the horsepower to explore neural networks to a reasonable level. Ironically, Rosenblatt's perceptron would end up figuring prominently in that, along with the growing realization that non-linear mathematics would be at the heart of that.

Indeed, this was one of Minsky's key arguments in the book that he and psychologist Nicolas Papert wrote, that the perceptron was a non-linear approach, and hence not solvable with technology of the time.The bulk of all computational analysis tools are essentially linear - even data science problems can ... [+] generally be solved by someone with a high school mathematics background and enough persistence.Getty
Moving Beyond Linearity
Linearity is a mathematical concept that has a few different meanings. At its simplest, it means that you can solve problems using variations off of y=a*x + b. For instance, the relationship between temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius is given as C = (5/9) * (F - 32). More generally, it means that you can transform formulas in such a way that the transformed formula has this kind of relationship. Exponential and logarithmic equations are often handled this way, and, if complex numbers (real + imaginary numbers) are used, this also includes trigonometric functions like sines and cosines.
All of these happen (not coincidentally) to be solutions of linear differential equations in calculus, which means among other things, they can be solved exactly, and can be solved with comparatively little problem using numerical methods. Because they describe the behavior of a lot of engineering systems at a fundamental level, mathematicians work very hard to take problems and make them linear.
Non-linear equations, on the other hand, describe a much wider domain of problems, but usually the solutions cannot be transformed into a linear equation, making it harder to solve. For instance, Newton's equations of motions describe the behavior of perfect objects - a hockey puck on ice, for instance, will stay at the same velocity it was hit until it encounters a barrier.Non-linear systems are typically chaotic, forming intra-dimensional fractals and solutions that ... [+] cannot be readily expressed functionally. Most of the core artificial intelligence technologies are non-linear, typically because they are recursive.Getty

However, the same hockey puck on concrete will slow down dramatically, will hop about, and will spin. Why? Friction. Once you introduce friction into the equation, that equation goes non-linear, and it becomes considerably harder to predict its behavior. They become much more sensitive to initial conditions, and can often become discontinuous so that for two points that are more or less next to one another in the source, the resulting function maps them in ways that result in them being nowhere near one another in the target.
The simplest example of this is the hyperbolic equation: y = 1/x. As you get closer to x on the positive size, the value of y goes up, while it goes down for the corresponding negative values of x. At x = 0, the equation is meaningless. This is called a discontinuous function, and it's the bane of mathematicians and physicists everywhere.
There is, however, another class of functions called higher order functions, in which the output of a function is then used as the input to that same function. For instance, suppose that you have a function y = f(x) = x + 1. When x = 0, y =1, a nice simple linear equation. However, f(f(0) = f(1) = 2, f(f(f(0) = 3 and so forth. This is an example of a recursive function.
Non-linear recursive functions tend to produce a cloud of discontinuous points, but the intriguing thing, first discovered by meteorologist Edward Lorentz in 1971, was that if you ran enough points, the cloud would converge upon an orbit that was not quite re-entrant, what he dubbed a strange attractor.
Based upon the work of Lorenz and his own research on the similarity of the stock market movement to the shape of coastlines, mathematician Benoit Manderlbrot popularized the visualizations of non-linear equations by calling them ""fractals"", because they exhibited characteristics similar to the linear-dimensions (dot,line,plane,space, hyperspace) that we're familiar with, but fell somewhere in between these dimensions.
Fractals for a while become a popular field for mining for computer screen backgrounds before the craze finally died down, but unbeknownst to most, they would find a second life in the world of computing as the research into neural networks began to encounter the increased speed and memory availability of computing systems.Text analytics has long been statistical in nature, but because of the non-linearity of language, ... [+] the need for something that moves beyond statistics is more and more pressing.Getty
Text Analytics In A Non-Linear World
However, another diversion is necessary to get there. Linguistic computing has long been something of a backwater in the computing science field. As computers went from large vacuum tube systems down to notebooks and ultimately cell phones and tablets, the urge to talk to (okay, scream at) your computer has, if anything, only become stronger over time. Similarly, there are many tasks associated with curating books and magazine articles - determining salient points, common topics and summarizing - that are both time intensive and require a great deal of skill to do well. If we could get computers to read and summarize (or even more powerfully read and translate) on the fly, it would solve one of the biggest headaches in almost any organization: being able to find the information that you need in media.
There is a whole field that has been around since the 1960s called textual analysis, which involves the use of statistical functions in order to determine the thematic similarity between two works. It's success has been mixed - the search capabilities that these bring is far better than the manual efforts of a legion of librarians manually summarizing, but relevancy is still pretty poor.
In most cases, what is actually used in such systems are indexes, typically with some kind of strength indicator between words and phrases, coupled with where these are located. The statistics are (mostly) linear, but it means in general that there are significant limitations to what can be interpreted.
Semantic solutions are defined by graphs of interconnected content. As with non-linear computation, ... [+] semantic networks (which are often used to model language) are fractal in nature.Getty
Tim Berners-Lee , the creator of the first web browser, client and communication protocol that underlies the Internet, started this effort primarily as a way to make it easier to find documents at CERN in Switzerland. By tagging content and building in metadata directly in the documents, Berners-Lee was able to make the documents more machine readable.
He came back to this theme a decade and a half later, and realized that he could use a similar approach with any kind of data. The big difference was that he realized that the information in a ""data document"" could be broken down into an interconnected graph network of simpler assertions. Each node became an identifier of an entity or concept, each edge a vector that described a relationship with other nodes.
This ""graph"" view provided a number of huge advantages over traditional databases. First, metadata about something could be added simply by creating an link to from the metadata back to the item in question. Second, a resource could have more than one value for a given property without the requirements of building a whole table. Finally, it became much easier to abstract out patterns of behavior in the data using the metadata, patterns that could be traversed recursively.
Notice a pattern beginning to develop here? Recursion is difficult to do in a relational database, so there are very few recursive design patterns. With one query, you can essentially reproduce a family tree when working on a graph, you can traverse across the graph without necessarily knowing the next adjacent nodes, and you can merge multiple graphs together without duplication.
This can be used to provide searches based upon connections - search for Batman and you get superhero as a concept, and from this can search through all black (or dark gray) wearing caped crusaders. This is difficult to do with a relational database. It can be done with an XML or JSON database, but in general neither of these is very good at managing references to other entities.
The advantage of working with graphs of information is that the information gets atomized and refactored as distinct properties, often buildable from other properties. In effect, you're dealing with multi-dimensional data, and can even change the categories that different facets of the data have dynamically. Finally, you can detect patterns based upon clusters of data dynamically, without necessarily knowing a priori what properties you're working with. This means that the data can, over time, become self-organizing.
These types of graph databases are known as knowledge graphs. There are other forms of graph data stores that are optimized for different kinds of processing, but most of them work on the idea that information is stored in a graph or mesh connecting entities with relational information.Artificial Intelligence is systemic computing, complex non-linear networks in which the most ... [+] important characteristics are the emergent ones.Getty
Wheels Within Wheels
Approaching 2020, artificial intelligence seems to have several key factors:


Recursion (non-linear processing) is used to create multiple levels of abstraction,
Information is worked on holistically - at any given point information is determined primarily by context, but context switching between and along abstraction layers is a critical part of finding and transforming content.
Categorization is an integral part of the process, with categories coming into existence as a utility to perform certain operations before disappearing once again.
The graph of information is constantly changing in response to filters that are themselves dynamically generated based on existing information.
Intelligence is nodal but also distributed and stochastic - the information that you have in the system is never complete nor totally comprehensive, and decisions can only be made when a tipping point of facts confirming or denying a certain query are reached (information becomes stochastic).
At any given point, information exists in a model, but that model is itself flexible and has the potential to be self-modifying. This is unlike existing systems where the model is usually predetermined.


I think these all fit into our current definition of artificial intelligence, but there's an additional definition that is only beginning to emerge:


The system has a certain degree of self-awareness.


I add this final point with some trepidation, but I think that it is important. Awareness comes in the ability to detect anomalous patterns that threaten the fidelity of the data, actions that are potentially destructive, and actions that incentivize more efficient storage or access of information. Self-healing data systems are one such form of awareness. Systems that are able to determine (and later counter) unwanted bias are another. Once you have a data system that is capable of rejecting data not because of syntactical issues but because the provenance of that data ""tastes funny"", you have a system that is beginning to become self-aware.
There's another important point here that may not have been obvious - artificial intelligence is not an algorithm. It is a network of databases that uses both data science algorithms (which are mostly linear in the broader sense) and higher order functions (recursion and fractal analysis) to change the state of itself in real time.
I think this also sidesteps the Turing Test problem, which basically says an artificial intelligent system is one in which it becomes indistinguishable from a human being in terms of its ability to hold a conversation. That particular definition is too anthropocentric. To be honest, there are a great number of human beings who would appear to be incapable of holding a human conversation - look at Facebook. If anything, the bots are smarter.
The above set of definitions are also increasingly consistent with modern cognitive theory about human intelligence, which is to say that intelligence exists because there are multiple nodes of specialized sub-brains that individually perform certain actions and retain certain state, and our awareness comes from one particular sub-brain that samples aspects of the activity going on around it and uses that to synthesize a model of reality and of ourselves. We even have a pretty good idea how to turn that particular node on or off, via general anesthesia. The rest of the brain is still working, just the part that is your consciousness is temporarily 404'd.With these criteria, we can see artificial intelligence as the process of making things, both ... [+] physical and virtual, aware of themselves and their universe.Getty
Classifying AI
Within those definitions, there are a number of technologies that fall within the rubric of Artificial Intelligence:


Machine Learning. Data systems that modify themselves by building, testing and discarding models recursively in order to better identify or classify input data.
Reinforcement Learning. The use of rewarding systems that achieve objectives in order to strengthen (or weaken) specific outcomes. This is frequently used with agent systems.
Deep Learning. Systems that specifically rely upon non-linear neural networks to build out machine learning systems, often relying upon using the machine learning to actually model the system doing the modeling. It is mostly a subset of machine learning with a specific emphasis on neural nets.
Agent Systems. Systems in which autonomous agents interact within a given environment in order to simulate emergent or crowd based behavior. Used more and more frequently with games in particular, but is also used with other forms of simulations.
Non-Linear Grid Systems. A variation of agented systems in which cells in n-dimensional grids maintain internal state but also receive stimulae from adjacent cells and generate output to those cells. The distant ancestor of most of these is Conway's Game of Life, but the idea is used to a much higher degree of complexity with most weather and stock modeling systems that are fundamentally recursive.
Self-Modifying Graph Systems. These include knowledge bases and so forth in which the state of the system changes due to system contingent heuristics.
Knowledge Bases, Business Intelligence Systems and Expert Systems. These often form a spectrum from traditional data systems to aggregate semantic knowledge graphs. To a certain extent they are human curated, but some of this curation is increasingly switching over to machine learning for both classification, categorization and abstraction.
Chatbots and Intelligent Agents. This differs from agent systems. Agents in general are computer systems that are able to parse written or spoken text, use it to retrieve certain content or perform certain actions, and the respond using appropriately constructed content. The earliest such system, Eliza, dates back to the mid-1960s, but was very primitive. Today's agents and chatbots, on the other hand, use a combination of semantics, Bayesian analysis and machine learning to both build up the appropriate information and learn about the user.
Visual/Audio Recognition Systems. In most cases V/A systems work by converting the media in question to an encoded compressed form, then algorithms look via either indexes or machine learning systems for the closest matches. This is often enhanced with Bayesian Analysis, where specific patterns are analysed based upon their frequency of occurrence relative to one another, and are also often tied in with semantic systems that provide relationship information.
Fractal Visualization. The connection between fractals and AI runs deep, and not surprisingly one of the biggest areas for AI is in the development of parameterized natural rendering - the movement of water, the roar of fire, the coarseness of rock, the effects of smoke in the air, all of which have become standard fare in big Hollywood blockbusters.


It's also worth noting what aren't themselves AI systems, but often play in the same general ""space"":


Autonomous Vehicles. These make use of visual recognition systems and real time modeling in order to both anticipate obstacles (static and moving) and to determine actions based upon objectives.
Drones. A drone is an autonomous vehicle without a passenger, and can be as small as a dragonfly or as large as a jet. Drones can also act in a coordinated fashion, either by following swarm behavior (an agent system) or by following preprogrammed instructions.
Data Science / Data Analytics. This is the use of data to identify patterns or predict behavior. This uses a combination of machine learning techniques and numeric statistical analysis, along with an increasingly large roll for non-linear differential equations. The primary distinction is that most data scientist does not make heavy use of higher order functions or recursion, though again, this is changing.
Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers. Distributed ledger technology underlies electronic coinage, but it is also playing a bigger and bigger role in tracking resources and transactions. One aspect of such systems is that they make it possible to bind virtual objects as if they were unique physical objects, in effect making intellectual property exchangeable. This has application throughout the AI space, especially in the realm of agented systems, even if it is not AI per se.i
Internet of Things / Robotics. Internet of things is intended to provide network connectivity to devices so that they can communicate with other devices. Robotics involves creating autonomous physical agents capable of movement. In that both of these may end up managing their own state, relies upon AI-based systems for identifying signals and determining response, they use AI, but aren't directly AI.
GPUs. The Central Processing Unit is so last century. Artificial intelligence is taking advantage of Graph Processing Units in a big way, as their structure makes them ideal for both semantic analysis and recursive filter applications.


The modern high end camera is a good example of an AI-enabled device. The focusing system is essentially a robot - it has servos and actuators, it is capable of operation independent of a human host, its auto-focusing system involves a continuous feedback loop to determine the best focal length and exposure even before the picture is ""taken"", it makes use of light sensitive arrays that convert light into digital signals, it typically stores dozens or even hundreds of ""photos"" that it can then composite, and then has AI routines capable of removing red-eye, improve focusing and compensate for lighting conditions. In most cases these very complex operations are hidden from the user, who just know that they are taking better photographs than ever before.
As to where the line gets drawn between software and AI, the reality is that the line has been blurry and is becoming more so daily. The vanilla office suite - word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentation software and mail clients - would seem to be the last bastion of non-AI software, but in point of fact all of these packages learn from their users.
Clippy, the annoying pop-up sprite that defined an entire generation of Microsoft Office users, was AI, albeit a very primitive one. Clippy's descendents are busy at work pointing out editing problems and misspellings, making suggestions about different presentation styles, identifying patterns and suggesting better tools to solve problems. Excel's charting suite will create what it believes is the most suitable type of chart to display data, and will then factor in your own interests when you override it so next time it may be more inclined to use your charts of interest - and even note what color schemes you most like to work with.
Adobe Photoshop CS now has the ability to select figures of interest with a single menu click. Image recognition plays a big part in that capability, and increasingly that is also being tied back into semantic systems that will identify the person being selected and update the metadata so that photoshop files can be searched automatically for pictures of that person - all without the user being aware that anything is happening.
In other words, what is happening today is that while most of the software that users work with are not examples of artificial intelligence, AI is in the background, making suggestions, handling classification and identification, pulling together options for making decisions and in some cases making those decisions autonomously. This trend will only continue.AI is still evolving. AI is about making things both physical and virtual aware - of us, of ... [+] themselves, of the world at large.Getty
Summary
It can be argued that artificial intelligence isn't really a technology, per se, but is instead, at any given point, a set of future facing technologies that usually manifest near the end of an ascending business cycle. Some, like fully certified Level 5 autonomous vehicles, quantum communication systems and even artificial general intelligence (AGI) are years or decades in the future. However, seeds for these are being planted now, and it is likely, even if there is an economic downturn, that research will continue during the quiet periods.
So, one good way of thinking about artificial intelligence is that it is the process of teaching computers to deal with multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. It's information processing gone fractal. And it is, ironically enough, here to stay.

LIKE other human champions facing a machine opponent, Grzegorz “MaNa” Komincz rated his chances. “A realistic goal would be 4-1 in my favour,” he told an interviewer before the match.
One of the world’s best players of video game StarCraft II, Komincz was at the height of a successful esports career. Artificial intelligence company DeepMind invited him to face its latest AI, a StarCraft II-playing bot called AlphaStar, on 19 December 2018.
Komincz was expected to be a tough opponent. He wasn’t. After being thrashed 5-0, he was less cocky. “I wasn’t expecting the AI to be that good,” he said. “I felt like I was learning something.”
It was just the latest in a series of unexpected victories for machines that stretch back to chess champion Garry Kasparov’s 1997 defeat by IBM’s Deep Blue. In 2017, another of DeepMind’s AIs, AlphaGo Master, beat the world number one Go player a decade before most researchers predicted it would be possible. The company’s AIs then mastered chess and StarCraft – a game played with dozens of different pieces with hundreds of moves a minute.
But this isn’t just a case of humans being humbled by superhuman AI. The real story is that each win gives us a glimpse of how AIs will make us superhuman too. That’s because thinking is set to become a double act. Working together, humans and AIs will bounce ideas back and forth, each guiding the other to better solutions than would be possible alone.
The potential goes far beyond games. The hope is that this teamwork will help us make vital breakthroughs in energy use, healthcare…

Are you ready for the robot invasion? Or are you just plain worried that your job will be automated away?
The age of artificial intelligence is not simply here but has permeated through our very existence already. From forecasting market trends to reordering your groceries that were going low to being delivered by drones, artificial intelligence is all around our lives and the way we do business. When we talk about artificial intelligence, its focus centers around adding and, more importantly, enhancing our current capabilities.
AI should be looked at as a way to increase what we currently do. To improve current performance, speed execution times and deliver greater value faster and more direct to our customers. So what would that mean for us as business analysts?











 
 
 
It begins with a great opportunity for us analysts! We get to take our tried and true skills and apply them in new contexts and environments and even emerging industries to uncover needs and see opportunities. Innovation is constantly happening, but the great successes are the ones that address critical problems. How do you know what’s a good problem that needs solving? You do some analysis work. Root cause analysis, process modeling and analysis, business rules analysis and data modeling can show where key aspects of organizations are under performing or even paralyzed by their own behavior.

Identifying these opportunities helps us open the doors to conversations with customers about what is possible. Then getting to expand our knowledge by learning new technologies, approaches and perspectives on how AI can be leveraged by organizations makes us great resources. We get to learn capabilities of new technologies to facilitate collaborative brainstorming sessions on how the new capacities can mean value for our organizations.
With this perspective, analysts need to be mindful of their time and, as always, focus on what key activities deliver the most value. What day-to-day activities could you automate so you spend more time facilitating collaborations, supporting decision making and understanding needs? This makes us then focus on what value we, as analysts, provide organizations. The automation of jobs is focused on removing the non-thinking aspects of work. Yes, there are amazing things that the AI and robotics and drones and other innovative technologies are doing, but first and foremost, having the power of computing to help daily activities is focused on what is repetitive.











 
 
 
What is redundant? What are the things we would often call monotonous? These are GREAT for automating!  And how do you know what these things are? That’s right – you have to do some business analysis! There is a great technique analysts use called decision modeling. The challenge many analysts have with this technique is that they find out that their stakeholders do not make decisions the same way all the time. When you can define rules that lead to patterns in behaviors and activities then you can start to leverage the AI technology. It still needs a foundation to start with and grow from.
Begin looking at your analysis activities: What work is repetitive? What decisions do you make daily? Again, start simple! Think about project management software that begins to notice patterns of status updates and deliverable timeframes so then starts creating reminders and building templates that make your work easier and faster. Then you can spend more time working with your stakeholders than working on your reports.
With the “easy” stuff being taken care of AI, we can then tackle the harder stuff, but that means we need to grow and improve our own skills. Our questions have to get better. Better questions on what the business wants to do. Better questions on what technology is now doing for us. Better questions on considering the possibilities.











 
 
 
As a business analyst, our focus is always on the right questions to determine through consensus, validation and verification activities what the right answers are for the organization at that point in time. Our questions need to have a focus beyond the current timeframe. Can we leverage what we’re doing today for tomorrow? For one year from now? For five years from now? Or can we constantly adapt our focus to meet the evolving landscape? Do you recognize the changes the consumer environments are going through and their perspective on getting their needs satisfied? Customers have gone from Uber to self-driving cars – do you really want to ask them to fill out a paper form?
If you haven’t already shifted your view to the consumer experience, now is the time. What questions can you think of to try to predict what your consumers and stakeholders want? What would they want a month from now? Six months?
Even more important, AI challenges us to not only ask questions of our customers, but ourselves. The biggest question people ask about with AI in many office jobs is what AI means to their livelihood. As business analysts, the same is true to us, we just need to use our own analysis skills. Consider asking yourself some serious questions. What are we doing to avoid becoming obsolete? Have you asked yourself today, what would prevent your role from being automated by a machine? Do you perform complex analysis work? What about your work and daily processes is programmable or repeatable? And more importantly what is not? Those things you could feed into a machine to do – get them off your plate.











 
 
 
Booking a flight, for example, may feel like a personal activity as you pick your timing, seat preference and favorite airlines. But all these preferences can still be elicited, captured and then fed into decision making models. Your actions, along with these models, can then be automated and even forecasted so that the work is now off your plate. But notice in here – requirements must still be elicited (preferences in this case), decisions need to be modeled and processes need to be captured.
Whether using technology to help you or not, the analysis work is still valuable but now must simply come from a new perspective and work in evolving context. Do not hold onto your techniques with such rigor you cannot apply them in new environments. Stay fluid in your approaches and grounded in the theory so that you can see possibilities while driving discussions forward.
We already know our analysis skills sets are valuable – we need to think though what they mean in this changing environment. This is where you want to shift your energies on growing your skills. Do you understand AI well enough that you can articulate its value to an organization? AI is still a ways away from telling businesses to buy new AI technology, but perhaps not that far off. WHY is AI important? What can it do for organizations?











 
 
 
Often the most valuable innovations are asking good questions about existing and often old problems rather than inventing new things. What challenges, inefficiencies and legacy components are holding your organization back? Perhaps these have to be addressed before AI technologies can be introduced? Or perhaps AI technologies can address these items themselves? How do we know? We have to do good analysis work.
In short, keep your skills sharp, continue to learn as much as you can and drive people to articulate what needs are not being satisfied today. Those needs are your opportunities for success!

We live in a world filled with technology that makes our lives easier every day. Drones deliver our packages, chatbots answer our questions online, and safety detection in vehicles help keep us safe. However, this era of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics comes at a price: large portions of the workforce are afraid they will lose their jobs because of advancing technology.
And while some positions do lend themselves to automation, not every role falls into this category. When it comes to positions that require problem-solving, leadership, and initiative, AI can never replace a valuable employee. Here are seven ways these employees bring value to businesses in ways that AI simply can’t:
1. Caring and Empathy
Today, robots can perform surgeries and therapy bots are now available to people seeking mental health assistance. However, nothing can replace the caring and empathy that a live person can extend. Caregivers, therapists, and doctors can show patients sincerity and empathy, which is something a machine can’t do—and likely won’t be able to emulate for another several years.
2. Self-Starting
Employees who take initiative and proactively look for areas of improvement are invaluable to their employers. They develop processes and train others, so the company works more efficiently and effectively. And once they master a skill, they consistently look for ways to improve processes even further. Fired-up employees are proactive and highly valuable to businesses.
Artificial intelligences could never be proactive or creative on its own. Image: Pixabay
AI may be good at processing commands and even identifying new trends or patterns, but it’s not at a point where it can find and start new tasks without some sort of prompt.
3. Creative Thinking
The human brain can take input from various outside influences to develop new, creative ideas. We can be inspired through music, poetry, art, or photography, and then channel that inspiration to develop business or product ideas. 
Companies need that kind of innovation to thrive. Creative employees help their companies to think bigger and sometimes completely out of the box. It’s in this atmosphere where new products are created, new ventures are discussed, and big growth can happen.
Creativity is one area where AI is still lacking. Machines can replicate media with greater accuracy in every subsequent iteration, but creating something new and unique is an ability humans still have a monopoly on.
4. Team Collaboration
Employees who work well with others can bring co-workers and multiple departments together to push the company toward a common goal. When employees feel the workplace is collaborative, they are more engaged—and a recent Gallup report found that teams with high employee engagement rates are 21% more profitable.
While AI programs may be receptive to direct feedback inputs, they lack the sense of human camaraderie that engenders feelings of real collaboration. So though a company might be able to run some processes without human workers, it would be hard to artificially replicate the feeling of real teamwork (and the benefits that come with it).
Collaboration, creativity and teamwork are inherent qualities of human workers. Image: pexels.
5. Role Adaptability
A good employee embraces change and adapts when it’s necessary for the good of the business. When an employee takes on work outside the scope of their position and quickly adjusts to shifting goals and assignments, that’s a huge benefit to employers, particularly in markets that change quickly and frequently.
Machines, on the other hand, are programmed for specific roles. If an industry shift requires a quick pivot in a new direction, tech often has to be deliberately redirected (or replaced) to keep up.
6. Community Contribution
Today’s businesses rely a lot on their communities—both local and online—to make money. Small businesses especially thrive in small, local towns and their homegrown wealth exchanges. Employees contribute to the local economy, which creates local jobs, helps the environment, and nurtures the community.
Robotics, machine learning, and AI cannot do this. In fact, companies that automate jobs out of existence run the risk of alienating their communities, which can lead to difficulty sustaining supply and demand.
7. Contextual Application
One of the most important factors in showing that people are more valuable than AI is that employees have real-life understanding of the business factors, situational circumstances, and other outside data that isn’t always given to the machine. Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data it’s given; people, though, can account for things outside of data—the context of a situation.
While it is inevitable that technology will eliminate many occupations, it’s obvious that it will not take the place of every job. Creativity, ingenuity, and human nature are all things that machines cannot replicate at this time. Without input from people, AI can’t function as it’s supposed to.
There’s no doubt of AI’s impact on society: it’s making its mark, and things are changing fast. But smart tech is years away from overrunning the job market—just ask your smartphone assistant to weigh in on any subject tougher than the daily weather forecast if you need some reassurance.

The future of work
Executives who are early adopters of AI and cognitive analytics technologies continue to be enthusiastic supporters. According to Deloitte’s second edition of the State of AI in the Enterprise, these trailblazers are reporting substantial returns on initial AI projects and planning more projects for the future.1
AI and its ability to augment human workers is one of the most influential forces shaping the future of work. AI is nearing ubiquity in today’s economy, appearing in both the micro economies—the share of jobs requiring AI increased by 450 percent from 2013 to 20182—and macro economies—industry experts predict that AI deployment will add $15.7 trillion to the global GDP by 2030.3 Humans with machines, data with actions, companies with their customers. The future of artificial intelligence is now.

Lack of AI understanding
Access to talent is a major issue in this new age of humans with machines. The demand is especially intense for technical skills that don’t widely exist. Among the early adopters surveyed for the Deloitte's State of AI in the Enterprise study, lack of AI skills is a top-three concern for 31 percent.4
Clearly, organizations need to look at new ways of sourcing skills if they want to build future success on a foundation of analytics and AI technologies. Deloitte's 2019 Global Human Capital Trends report suggests several ways to tackle this, including finding ""gig workers"" in the alternative workforce and strategically leveraging technology, which can range from AI-driven chatbots to video interviews to targeted job advertising.5

Jobs of the future
A few examples of future jobs in the future of artificial intelligence:6

Cognitive work (re) designer. Redesign knowledge-based jobs and their underlying business processes to take advantage of technologies such as deep and machine learning, natural language processing and generation, and robotic process automation.
Renaissance worker. Combine technical expertise in one or more domains with expertise in design, project management, or client and customer interaction. Bring background in science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM), not just science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), fueled by art courses that add creativity and communication skills.
Digital twin engineer. Whether it’s a jet engine or a shop floor, create a virtual representation of both the physical elements and the dynamics of how an IoT-connected product operates and interacts with its environment and use machine learning to optimize product performance.

AI enhances, does not take away
While the very concept of a job—where it is done and by whom—is being redefined by such forces as the gig economy, proximity, and technology, there are fundamentals that contribute to a positive and fulfilling employee experience that remain constant. These include having meaningful work, a flexible work life fit, and opportunities to learn and perform activities that have an impact.
AI in the workplace has the potential to make jobs much more interesting for human workers by augmenting their tasks and freeing them to perform higher-level functions and make better-informed decisions. Artificial intelligence can spark new ways of working that blend the best of what machines do with what humans bring to this collaboration: experience, judgment, and empathy. In fact, 78 percent of executives surveyed believe that AI-based augmentation of workers will fuel new ways of working.

In the Age of With, which human skills are irreplaceable?
This is a fundamental question that leaders in business and academia are grappling with, and we are only beginning to get a sense of what the enduring human skills are in this nascent phase of human and machine collaboration.
Imagine that you are responsible for operations at a large manufacturer and you want to maximize the life of equipment parts while avoiding unnecessary downtime. In the past, your maintenance team relied on ""tribal knowledge"" estimates or doing an ongoing, in-depth analysis of each piece of equipment. Today smart factories can use machine-to-machine and machine-to-human communication with cognitive technologies to make timely, accurate decisions. This predictive maintenance raises thought-provoking questions about the role of maintenance personnel versus the role of predictive algorithms, and what kind of traits a modern-day maintenance worker should possess.
Determining the immutable human skills needed in a workplace filled with AI solutions is hard, but necessary work. The need for human involvement is not going away, and the value of powerful, esoteric capabilities like imagination cannot be underestimated.

Five questions to unleash talent in the Age of With

What are the skills and capabilities that are going to be paramount for the future success of my organization?
How does the composition of my workforce relate to what I need? What is the gap between today and future needs?
If I am advocating a business strategy that implies a certain level of skill, have I thought about the external and internal talent landscape required to support that?
How am I planning to access those skills and capabilities? Have I opened the aperture to consider the gig economy and proximity dimension?
How do I set up internal systems and platforms to enable continuous adaptation of skills?

AI and radio frequency communications: Trends and innovations happening now

Sometimes people combine things you wouldn’t really think would go well together. Chocolate and peanut butter come to mind, a wonderful mix that doesn’t seem like it should work as well as it does.
Well, technology also frequently mixes and matches things to see what works best. A lot of people probably didn’t think something as modern as artificial intelligence would go well with radio frequencies, but they actually work great together.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to grow radio frequencies (RF) and bring this retro technology to the modern sphere. With RF, we can expand our signals further than before, working faster than with the tools we currently have.
To be clear, we aren’t trying to move backward or get rid of the technology we have now. We’re just finding interesting ways to mix radio into our modern applications and coming up with incredible results. Here’s what the future holds for the meshing of AI and RF.
AI detects offshore RF signals
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have worked together to create a way for the United States Navy to share a popular 150MHz section of RF for communicating. By using AI, NIST can detect when offshore radars are working so multiple channels don’t try to use the same band at once. The AI will tell commercial users when they have to pause in using the 3.5GHz band.
The FCC created the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) in 2015. It allows commercial vendors and providers to use the 3.5GHz band when it’s not needed for operations from the United States Navy. Companies like AT&T and Google jumped at the chance because the band was expected to grow their markets and provide better coverage and data rates. Without the AI and a little legislature, companies and citizens alike wouldn’t be able to use this very popular band.
RF recognition
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) noticed a problem with too much happening all at once. There are a lot of RF signals put into the same spectrums, making things difficult to discern and hear. DARPA created the Radio Frequency Machine Learning Systems program (RFMLS) to fix this problem.
RFMLS can pick out and discern one signal from the next, identifying more important ones and those that don’t follow the rules. With the internet of things (IoT) gathering data from all sorts of sectors, including radio, RFMLS helps collect important, relevant information for this exact purpose. DARPA is hoping to continue the implementation of AI to create better spectrum sharing in the future, much like what NIST has worked on.
Enhancing system performance
As a company that works to bring new engineering technologies to the United States Department of Defense, Alion Science & Technology works to lower costs and improve efficiency. It has also found the same problem as DARPA, with the RF spectrum becoming congested with useless information that drowns out important data. Instead of picking out certain signals, Alion has found a way to boost the ones it needs.
Alion designed a custom AI network to find any signal in raw in-phase/quadrature data with signal-to-noise (SNR) values from +10dB to -10dB. These SNR values are on different sides of the extreme, with -10dB being afflicted with a lot of noise to the point of being nearly discernable. However, Alion’s found that certain networks can understand different aspects of SNR data. AI is used to pair the two up to effectively boost the signal.
RFI and causes
Radio frequency interference (RFI) is what happens when another electronic signal impedes upon the original one. These days, because most things have moved past radio technology, we often call this phenomenon electromagnetic interference, or EMI. The two terms, RFI and EMI, are used synonymously — but it’s important to know where exactly the differences lie, mostly with the product being affected.
The main cause for RFI is usually a congested space of other electronic devices using the same spectrum, like when a radio buzzes because your cellphone is getting a call. The problem could also be due to the design of the product, creating low absorption loss. Both of these are pretty prominent problems, but the core issue is often a design flaw.
Minimizing interference
A technique called RF shielding is often used to minimize RFI. The shield protects important circuit functions and prevents emissions, lowering the chance for RFI to occur. One could use conductive foam, a metal box or metallic film. Either way, RF shielding should be done as early into the design as possible.
You can also use a filter to protect your device from RFI and prevent it from being emitted. Most filters apply a three-pole approach to target a range from 150kHz to 30kHz. These are available at both the commercial and consumer levels for anyone to use. However, this is not a DIY project like RF shielding.
Machine learning and RF
A lot of AI implementation comes down to necessity, as evidenced by machine learning and RF. The military, companies and average people all use radio these days, which can congest the systems on a ridiculous level. Radio communication isn’t obsolete yet.
While a lot of people have become used to satellites, radio is still a viable and quick way to get information across large areas. Unlike many satellites, radio will also always remain dependable — no matter what the situation or how far into the future we look.
Getting AI involved only helps RF evolve into modern-day usage. Now congestion doesn’t have to be an issue. We can pick out certain frequencies, boost even the lowest of signals or tell others to get off when something more important needs to go through.
With AI, radio can rise in popularity again and become the prominent figure it once was. Satellite communication won’t be going anywhere, but perhaps the radio can take us further than any of us previously thought possible.

Every day, progress in artificial intelligence is addressing tasks currently performed only by humans, and it's worthwhile to take a short-term view of what this all means to your company.

Games like chess have been tackled by artificial intelligence with amazing results, but there was this big gap between those games - where everything about the game state and consequences is known before making a decision - and the reality of life where, like poker, there is only a little bit of information available to the decision-makers, and the quality and quantity of information used to make decisions varies wildly. We humans face this situation of high uncertainty every time we cross the street or eat a hamburger, but it doesn't seem to bother us. Until recently, computers have had a lot of trouble dealing with games that give the decision-maker incomplete information about the state of the game. Also, developing strategies in real-time is harder than deciding if you want to bet or fold. Strategic plans can have multiple steps that need to be properly sequenced, and these plans can include contingency plans.

The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.
William Gibson

Artificial intelligence is very hyped up, and for good reasons, but many pop culture information sources lose the ""how"" of it all, and instead focus in on the dream of what may come next, in some far-off future. Vaporware is common in the industry. It's not a good state of affairs because regular people don't see the connection between the research and the resulting products, and people fear what they don't understand.

PROMOTED
I am a practitioner in the artificial intelligence field, and my problem with futurism fever is an endless focus on the distant future devoid of a simple and rational view of reality in the here and now. The tyranny of the rocket equation held back the futuristic promises of spaceflight for a generation, and the progress of artificial intelligence is similarly limited by the inertia that all disruptive technology faces. The fear of change brought on by progress in the artificial intelligence field should not lead society directly to extreme solutions like universal basic income or strong regulation of artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence as it is developed today, is primarily programming, data gathering, and mathematics. It isn't sexy and it works poorly at first. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. The scary results you see in demonstrations are the product of a lot of hard work to hide the shortcomings of a narrow machine intelligence. I like to think of the artificial intelligence field like ""Charlotte's Web"", in the sense that Wilbur (the artificial intelligence agent) gets all of the attention at the fair, but Charlotte (the programmer) stays up all night spinning the web. When Wilbur gets all the attention at the fair, as was intended, you have to ask yourself what exactly the pig did to deserve the attention. Why didn't the farmer market a magic spider instead of a magic pig? Well, the short answer is that the marketers want to promote pigs, but the deeper answer is that too few information sources are looking behind the curtain to explain the reason for the cool demo, ruining the magic trick but enlightening the audience.

I don't mean to give ""real"" futurists a hard time though. Nick Bostrom's excellent book ""Superintelligence"" is worth reading, and even just a watch of his TED talk on the potential future dangers of artificial intelligence could change the way you think about these things. Real research is ongoing on the far future of artificial intelligence, on things like the singularity, and artificial general intelligence, but that is simply not

relevant to your real life right now. It might be someday, but it isn't today. What I want to share with you in this article is the here and now; The gritty reality of compiling code and deploying solutions that companies use to make money, save money, and save time. Specifically, let's look at recent progress in strategic thinking developed by artificial intelligence. Yes, artificial intelligence really is being applied to model decision making of governments and corporations. An example that comes to mind right away is a machine learning model of China's decision making called the Policy Change Index.
Cool Things Are Reaching From The Lab Into The Real World
I am claiming that society should be getting more meaningful information about what's happening right now in the artificial intelligence field. Let's back that up with an example: Artificial intelligence agents are getting better at hard problems they couldn't solve before, and these stronger capabilities will matter. I'm talking specifically about DeepMind's AlphaStar, and many similar systems that are upgrading the plumbing and the brains that run the world economy. This is going to impact the way services are delivered because the strategy part of delivering services has until recently relied very heavily on humans at keyboards wearing headsets. It also impacts the finance sector, where 80 percent of market activity is algorithmic trading agents, and automated strategy plays a major role in these agents moving markets.

DeepMind's AlphaStar has recently been playing online StarCraft 2 matches in Europe, against human opponents who don't know they are playing a computer. The base technology within DeepMind's approach to solving Real-Time Strategy (RTS) ""imperfect information"" game theory is a deep neural network trained on past games and perfected by playing against itself to get even better. Self-play facilitates learning beyond simply copying decisions made in past matches. The core of the approach is a system that uses a mash-up of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, but the key concept to absorb is that a complicated RTS game only humans could play is now being solved very comprehensively by an artificial intelligence system. A predecessor of AlphaStar for playing the game Go was called AlphaGo. Unlike AlhpaGo, AlphaStar needs to develop and execute strategies based upon an incomplete set of information. That's a big step forward, into a more businesslike and realistic domain.Lee Se-Dol, one of the greatest modern players of the ancient board game Go, speaks during a press ... [+] conference after the third game of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google-developed supercomputer AlphaGo at a hotel in Seoul on March 12, 2016.
A Google-developed computer programme took an unassailable 3-0 lead in its match-up with a South Korean Go grandmaster on March 12 -- marking a major breakthrough for a new style of ""intuitive"" artificial intelligence (AI). / AFP / JUNG Yeon-Je        (Photo credit should read JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images)AFP/Getty Images
The first set of AlphaStar matches earlier this year were against professional players in a private controlled setting, relying on the ability to perform an amazingly high (superhuman) number of actions per minute to beat the humans. Playing such a hard to play incomplete information game was super impressive, but they are not done just yet.
Developing agents is sort of like building a rocket and watching someone else fly it around. Over the past few months of following AlphaStar news, I've been entertained that Casters watch AlphaStar play like programmers debug their artificial intelligence agents: they look at the successes and marvel at the ideas the agent came up with, and then look at the failures and try to figure out ""Why did it do that?"" Super wonky low-level in-game mistake details like bad building placement and scouting strategies then tie into super wonky low-level in-agent details like analyzing the sequence of states that led the agent to learn to do what it did.
DeepMind is now trying to make AlphaStar even better, by making it play under constraints more like those imposed on a human. DeepMind is looking to train agents like AlphaStar to beat humans at tasks only humans are good at, and they are also making an effort to do it in a way similar to how humans do it, without relying on click spamming the game, or other unfair superhuman ""cheats"" that rely on being a computer to work. I am very sure this is not the solution to all problems humans solve, but it is cool that some subset of all the stuff we humans do is slipping into the realm of automation. Right now there still seems to be a limit to the set of maps AlphaStar can play, but progress is being made, and we can see that progress marching forward in real-time. The initial demonstration of the system played only one of the three StartCraft 2 races (Protoss), but the newer version works for all 3 races in the game. To me, this is the exciting part of the artificial intelligence field today. Every day the limit of what is possible is going up, and there does not seem to be an end in sight.
Assuming the aforementioned progress on machine learning-based strategy generation is within reach, what does an automated corporate strategy look like? In my experience, government and corporate projects contain limited scope requirements to model one part of corporate strategy. Be it credit risk models, recommender systems, customer segmentation, legislative risk models, or trading algorithms, these scope-limited approaches benefit from being easily abstracted into a box in a flowchart with a name on it. Rather than holistic solutions that model a whole company, the most popular kind of project today is a tool that serves management. Tools for forecasting and decision making are very popular right now, and I predict that at some point these smaller bites at the elephant will grow into holistic solutions. The pushback I have heard and seen is that ERP systems promised to provide this sort of holistic strategy generation but didn't, and that the technical debt in the current infrastructure is best addressed by incremental changes in how things work.
Automation in corporate strategy has been around for a long time, but with recent advances in artificial intelligence, it should get even better. The ideas above should lead you to the inevitable conclusion that corporate strategy development is going to benefit from more automation, and specifically from artificial intelligence. Companies are organized a certain way, with specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and plans for improving the KPIs. Expect artificial intelligence to creep into corporate strategy discussions right about now.
There is so much work still to do
To build a system that generates strategies, a good starting point is to develop a simulator to define the boundaries of the world where the agent can play around and make decisions. The simulator also needs lots of data on past decisions and their outcomes, in order to gain some experience. This process of building a simulator also involves deciding how much of the world to simulate. The approach DeepMind followed to avoid the large gap between dumb newborn and beginner agents was to first teach the agent to mimic the historical data, and then to pivot into playing against copies of itself once it was sort of on the right track.
Some key challenges holding back the broader adoption of artificial intelligence for autonomous business strategy development and execution are interpretability, dataset handling tools, automated machine learning, and bias.
Let's first talk about interpretability. We humans need to understand what the machine learned from the data, how it thinks and why it makes certain decisions. Researchers are now working to address these interpretability issues. Some recent progress interesting work on this topic is ""A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions"" and their open-source library shap.A unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model.Scott Lundberg
Beyond interpretability, another challenge is wrangling datasets for training these artificial intelligence agents and labeling the data without too much human effort. Some major efforts in that direction should address most of the problem. One noteworthy project for labeling, transforming, and organizing datasets is snorkel.org, which has a wide corporate user base and US Government support. Pre-built datasets and models are also becoming more available as they are put into the public domain by researchers, corporates, and governments adopting open data policies.
A third challenge on top of interpretability and dataset preparation is automating the process of building machine learning models, which today often requires a data scientist, a machine learning engineer, and a DevOps engineer, as well as a project manager to keep the trains running on time. There are many active automated machine learning projects such as TPOT, which aim to remove these humans from the process as much as possible. This automation is not yet a solved problem, and it gives you a realistic sense of the strings artificial intelligence researchers are pulling on.
A fourth challenge I want to bring to your attention is biases. Artificial intelligence systems are very good at learning and perpetuating bias that exists in observed data. It's a big and unsolved area of machine learning that is holding up some key business processes from easily adopting strategies generated using artificial intelligence. It is the process of verifying that certain biases do not exist in the generated advice that adds significant cost to machine learning projects of this nature.
Rather than waiting for all of these problems to be fully solved, the world is moving ahead with adoption of artificial intelligence at scale, and I believe the training wheels will come off slowly, as these systems become more commonplace within corporate infrastructure.
This article and those that follow should help you understand how the field of artificial intelligence is coming along, and help you to get a sense of what this all means to you right now. Let me briefly summarize the 5 main takeaways:


Under certain constraints, artificial intelligence will be able to generate corporate strategy
Corporate strategy crafted by artificial intelligence will become more popular
Don't freak out. New things are happening, but Skynet is not just around the corner
Computers are getting very good at tasks only humans could do before, like driving
Artificial intelligence, as a field of study, is not finished being invented yet. There are a lot of open problems that humans are working to define and solve, both within the AI field and as problems that AI could help to solve

What does artificial intelligence do?Published9 August 2019comments21 CommentsImage source, Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence - or AI for short - is technology that enables a computer to think or act in a more 'human' way. It does this by taking in information from its surroundings, and deciding its response based on what it learns or senses.It affects the the way we live, work and have fun in our spare time - and sometimes without us even realising.AI is becoming a bigger part of our lives, as the technology behind it becomes more and more advanced. Machines are improving their ability to 'learn' from mistakes and change how they approach a task the next time they try it.Some researchers are even trying to teach robots about feelings and emotions.You might not realise some of the devices and daily activities which rely on AI technology - phones, video games and going shopping, for example.More technologyWhy did this photo make history 60 years ago?How robots and drones are changing deliveriesFlyboard inventor crosses English ChannelWhy Instagram is going to hide your 'likes'Some people think that the technology is a really good idea, while others aren't so sure. Just this month, it was announced that the NHS in England is setting up a special AI laboratory to boost the role of AI within the health service.Announcing that the government will spend £250 million on this, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the technology had ""enormous power"" to improve care, save lives and ensure doctors had more time to spend with patients.Read on to find out more about AI and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.What does AI do?AI can be used for many different tasks and activities.Personal electronic devices or accounts (like our phones or social media) use AI to learn more about us and the things that we like. One example of this is entertainment services like Netflix which use the technology to understand what we like to watch and recommend other shows based on what they learn.It can make video games more challenging by studying how a player behaves, while home assistants like Alexa and Siri also rely on it.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, It has been announced that NHS England will spend millions on AI in order to improve patient care and researchAI can be used in healthcare, not only for research purposes, but also to take better care of patients through improved diagnosis and monitoring.It also has uses within transport too. For example, driverless cars are an example of AI tech in action, while it is used extensively in the aviation industry (for example, in flight simulators).Farmers can use AI to monitor crops and conditions, and to make predictions, which will help them to be more efficient.You only have to look at what some of these AI robots can do to see just how advanced the technology is and imagine many other jobs for which it could be used.Where did AI come from?The term 'artificial intelligence' was first used in 1956.In the 1960s, scientists were teaching computers how to mimic - or copy - human decision-making. This developed into research around 'machine learning', in which robots were taught to learn for themselves and remember their mistakes, instead of simply copying. Algorithms play a big part in machine learning as they help computers and robots to know what to do.What is an algorithm?An algorithm is basically a set of rules or instructions which a computer can use to help solve a problem or come to a decision about what to do next.From here, the research has continued to develop, with scientists now exploring 'machine perception'. This involves giving machines and robots special sensors to help them to see, hear, feel and taste things like human do - and adjust how they behave as a result of what they sense.The idea is that the more this technology develops, the more robots will be able to 'understand' and read situations, and determine their response as a result of the information that they pick up.Why are people worried about AI?Many people have concerns about AI technology and teaching robots too much.Famous scientist Sir Stephen Hawking spoke out about it in the past. He said that although the AI we've made so far has been very useful and helpful, he worried that if we teach robots too much, they could become smarter than humans and potentially cause problems.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sir Stephen Hawking spoke out about AI and said that he had concerns that the technology could cause problems in the futurePeople have expressed concerns about privacy too. For example, critics think that it could become a problem if AI learns too much about what we like to look at online and encourages us to spend too much time on electronic devices.Another concern about AI is that if robots and computers become very intelligent, they could learn to do jobs which people would usually have to do, which could leave some people unemployed.Other people disagree, saying that the technology will never be as advanced as human thoughts and actions, so there is not a danger of robots 'taking over' in the way that some critics have described.What do you think about AI? Do you think that it is a good thing or a bad thing?

While there is much discussion of how artificial intelligence will continue to transform industries and organizations, a key driver of AI’s role in the global economy will be cities. How cities deal with coming changes will determine which ones will thrive in the future. 
Many cities have plans to become “smart cities” armed with AI-driven processes and services, like AI-based traffic control systems, to improve residents’ lives. But simply adopting these new technologies won’t be enough to guarantee their success. Jobs that exist today may not exist tomorrow. Completely new jobs will need to be filled quickly. Many people today don’t yet have the skills needed for the jobs of the future. Yet cities cannot just shrink and grow their populations and talent at will.
To realize the potential of AI, city administrations have to work with local employers to plan for new opportunities — along with possible painful transitions — that their communities may experience. Many U.S. cities once dependent on manufacturing industries have made the shift to knowledge-based economies, including cities like Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Rochester, New York; and Madison, Wisconsin. In order for these economies to continue to prosper, cities — along with organizations and education experts — need to assess and prepare for AI-related skills gaps.
Urban Shifts
As with other technological revolutions, the move toward widespread use of AI will likely trigger urban shifts in cities. To better understand the scope of these, we conducted three studies. First, we examined how many people in American cities work in jobs with a greater than 70% probability of being automated. Applying a framework developed by Oxford University researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne to 24 major U.S. cities, we found that between 33% and 44% of people work in jobs considered at high risk, including retail salespeople, cashiers, office workers, and other service-related jobs. 
That means millions of people will likely need assistance in transitioning to new jobs and roles as soon as within the next five years. In cities like New York and Los Angeles, with millions employed, many workers will need to find new professions (such as those in highly vulnerable roles such as tax preparers, loan officers, bank tellers, receptionists, and administrative assistants) as the nature of work is completely transformed.

They also raised concerns over where the money was coming from and whether it was the result of trade-offs elsewhere in the cash-strapped health service.AI is already being used in some hospitals to predict cancer survival and cut the number of missed appointments. It is used to identify those patients most likely not to turn up, who will then be given a reminder phone call.On Tuesday, the prime minister promised £1.8bn towards the maintenance and rebuilding of crumbling hospitals, estimated to need a total of £6bn. On Wednesday, he promised changes to a pension tax hitting the best-paid doctors and nurses that has resulted in their cutting back on extra shifts. The latest announcement would help the NHS become a world leader in AI, he said.Boris Johnson’s £1.8bn for the NHS isn’t what it seems – just ask the trustsSally GainsburyRead moreJohnson said the NHS was “leading the way in harnessing new technology to treat and prevent, from earlier cancer detection to spotting the deadly signs of dementia”.“Today’s funding is not just about the future of care though.

Adam Steventon, director of data analytics at the Health Foundation thinktank, said: “Technology needs to be driven by patient need and not just for technology’s sake. Robust evaluation therefore needs to be at the heart of any drive towards greater use of technology in the NHS, so that technologies shown to be effective can be spread further and patients protected from any potential harm.”He also said clarity was needed “on where this money will come from and whether there may need to be trade-offs”, adding: “Despite the extra capital funding pledged this week, there remains a £6bn maintenance backlog for supporting basic infrastructure, including IT equipment, of which over £3bn is identified as ‘high or significant risk’.“And with a shortfall of 100,000 staff, the NHS will struggle to sustain current services, let alone take advantage of the benefits of new technology.”AI cancer detectorsRead moreMatthew Honeyman, a researcher at The King’s Fund health thinktank, said: “Many staff in the NHS currently feel that IT makes their life harder, not easier.

The government has pledged £250 million for a National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab to improve diagnostics and screening in the NHS.
The lab will be used to develop treatments for cancer, dementia and heart disease.
The programme aims to improve cancer screening and speed up results, use DNA data to identify patients most at-risk of diseases, upskill the workforce to use artificial intelligence (AI) systems and automate routine administration tasks to free up clinicians.
Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said the NHS was “leading the way” in harnessing new technology.
“Today’s funding is not just about the future of care though. It will also boost the frontline by automating admin tasks and freeing up staff to care for patients,” he added.
The lab will sit within NHSX, in partnership with the Accelerated Access Collaborative, and bring together the industry’s best academics, specialists and technology companies to harness the power of AI to improve the health and lives of patients.
Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX, added: “Today’s announcement gets the NHS ready for the AI revolution, so that doctors can identify and treat disease faster and more effectively. It also puts the UK in pole position for healthtech research and lifesaving innovations.”
NHSX confirmed on Twitter that the funding is “new money”.

Yes the AI Lab is new money.  And yes we need to fix the basics too, but it's not either/or.  
Staying ahead of where the tech is going is good for the NHS. One reason why the NHS struggles with interoperability now is that we failed to futureproof our technology in the past.

AI is already being developed in a number of NHS hospitals, including in Imperial College London to predict survival rates for ovarian cancer and in University College Hospital to predict missed appointments and allow staff to follow-up with targeted phone calls, saving £2-3 per appointment.
Data from a Genomics England programme that will see five million NHS patients receive a free personalised health record based on their DNA will also be linked into the lab.
The programme, announced in July, will see volunteers have their genomes analysed to identify their risk of developing diseases like cancer or heart disease.
The project follows the 100,000 Genomes Project, which ran from 2013 to 2018 and led to roughly one in four participants with a rare disease receiving a diagnosis.
[themify_box icon=”info” color=”gray”]
Government’s AI Lab proposals:

Build systems to improve cancer screening by speeding up the results of tests including mammograms, brain scans, eye scans and heart monitoring, helping to save millions of lives a year
Use predictive models to better estimate future needs of beds, drugs, devices, or surgeries
Identify which patients could be more easily treated in the community, reducing the pressure on the NHS and helping patients receive treatment closer to home
Use DNA tests or already-available data to help screening programs identify patients most at risk of diseases, allowing for earlier diagnosis and cheaper, more effective treatment
Build predictive systems to detect people at risk of postoperative complications, infections or requiring targeted follow-up from clinicians, improving patient safety and reducing readmission rates
Upskill the NHS workforce so they know how to use AI systems to assist with day-to-day tasks
Inspect algorithms already used by the NHS to increase the standards of AI safety within our healthcare system, making systems fairer, more robust and ensuring patient confidentiality is protected to the highest standards
Automate routine admin tasks to free up clinicians so more time can be spent with patients

Second wave of NHS funding this week
It’s the second wave of NHS funding announced by Downing Street this week.
On 4 August, Johnson pledged a £1.8 billion cash injection for the NHS, with part of the money going towards harnessing the potential of new technologies.
Some 20 hospital projects are to benefit from a £850 million funding package to upgrade outdated facilities and equipment, with a further £1 billion to boost capital spending to tackle urgent infrastructure projects.
Responding to the announcement chair of the Digital Health CCIO Network, James Reed, said more funding was needed to “fundamentally change” the NHS.
“We have benefited hugely from recent investments such as the GDE [Global Digital Exemplar] programme and I would like the whole digital agenda to feature in this new spending,” he said.
“It would be a missed opportunity if this money was spent on capital developments without associated investment in the staff and skills which will be needed to make the most of them.”

2019 has already unfolded as a banner year in terms of the union between artificial intelligence and sales. While 2018 saw the artificial intelligence sales revolution beginning to gain momentum, the applications were limited. According to a report by Pactera Technologies and Nimdzi Insights, in 2017, 51% of enterprises leveraged some form of artificial intelligence. In 2018, the percentage increased by a mere 2% to 53% adoption.

This year, artificial intelligence will increasingly play a vital role in sales organizations. One of the most profound implications will be in the context of CRMs. CRMs have long struggled to gain the favor of sales professionals. Less than 40% of businesses report a CRM adoption rate in excess of 90%. This year and beyond, we're sure to witness a marriage between artificial intelligence and CRM systems, a transformation that amplifies the capabilities and effectiveness of antiquated CRMs.
1. Data ingestion and retrieval 
Many individuals have predicted that artificial intelligence’s foray into the sales landscape poses a threat to the human sales profession. Yet the belief that artificial intelligence signals the demise and replacement of the human sales function entirely, is tremendously short-sighted. 
PROMOTED
Artificial intelligence promises to enhance, not replace, the human component of sales. The sales professionals of the future will use artificial intelligence to complement their efforts and skillsets. When it comes to CRMs, this starts with data ingestion and retrieval. As it stands, sales professionals spend 17% of their time entering data—the equivalent of nearly one work day per week. Indeed, manual data entry is the primary obstacle that inhibits CRM adoption.  
Artificial intelligence not only empowers sales professionals to eliminate manual data entry, it also bolsters their ability to centralize disparate customer databases and, in turn, capture the complete customer lifecycle—whether it has transpired via email, phone conversations, chatbots, etc. CallMiner Eureka, for example, uses artificial intelligence and machine language to capture and transcribe customer interactions. Transcriptions are tagged according to key topics and a rich categorization schema. When this data is ingested into a CRM, it can surface key insights, including objections, specific data with respect to competitors, and ideal use cases. Salespeople can search transcript metadata for keywords, phrases, or even acoustics such as increased voice intonation that may signal excitement and increased interests. With the air of topic clusters and frequency maps, salespeople are equipped to detect vital customer trends. 
2. Sentiment analysis 
It's critical that salespeople develop high levels of trust and rapport with their customers. According to research by Salesforce, 79% of business buyers state that it’s absolutely critical or very important to interact with a salesperson who is a trusted advisor. We have a long way to come. A mere 3% of buyers trust sales reps. 
With the vast majority of customer interactions occurring virtually, via mediums that conceal revealing body language and facial expressions, it's become more and more difficult for salespeople to develop trust and a strong rapport with their customers. Fortunately, artificial intelligence offers a powerful antidote. Using sentiment analysis, AI-powered tools can analyze conversations and assess customers' emotional states. Cogito, for example, provides in-call voice analyses that help salespeople understand customers’ emotional states and how best to respond. A color-coded meter serves as a gauge of how effective a specific conversation is. If a customer—or salesperson—reacts too abruptly, the color changes from green to yellow or red. Cogita assesses several key aspects of any given conversation, including energy, interruption, empathy, participation, tone and pace. Analyses as sophisticated as this empowers salespeople to proactively redirect conversations. 
When all this historical in-call data is integrated with CRMs, the benefits are far-reaching. Salespeople and managers, for example, can leverage the output for training purposes to improve conversations and relationships with customers. As CEO and Cofounder Joshua Feast has explained, ""Conversations are like a dance...You can be in sync or out of sync.”
3. Data integrity 
CRMs are chock-full of dirty data. According to research by Dun & Bradstreet, 91% of data in CRM systems is incomplete, 18% is duplicated, and 70% is rendered stale each year. The fallout of dirty data is devastating. 8 out of 10 companies believe that dirty data disrupts their sales pipelines and 25% experience reputational damage due to bad data. 
The effectiveness of artificial intelligence is directly proportional to the accuracy of the data it is fed. Garbage in, garbage out. Artificial intelligence tools are integral to data cleanliness. By 2025, we will create 180 zettabytes of data each year. Gone are the days when humans can ensure optimal data quality. Artificial intelligence is able to detect irregularities, anomalies, duplicates, and other errors that compromise CRM data and, in turn, customer relationships. By integrating with third-party databases, artificial intelligence can also interpolate missing records and update records in real-time as contact and other data changes. It can automatically detect duplicates. There's no disputing the fact that data cleansing has been a big headache deterring salespeople from embracing CRMs. AI is the Tylenol.
4. Predictive lead scoring 
Artificial intelligence primes salespeople to supercharge their lead scoring abilities with predictive analytics and algorithms. Seventy-four percent of companies state that converting leads into customers is their top priority. It's no wonder why. 96% of visitors who arrive at a company's website aren’t ready to buy. 
Historically, sales professionals have relied on “rules-based” lead scoring. That is, they’ve scored and ranked leads manually, according to a set of rules—”If this, then that.” This approach is outdated and suboptimal. Artificial intelligence is key in terms of motivating sales organizations to shift from rules-based lead scoring to predictive lead scoring. Artificial intelligence can analyze millions of different historical and real-time attributes, including demographic data, firmographic data, geographic data, activity data and web behavior, to determine customers’ buying readiness. When integrated with CRM systems, artificial intelligence can analyze won versus lost deals to detect trends that can inform predictive lead scoring methods. 
Perhaps most exciting is the fact that predictive lead scoring tools powered by artificial intelligence rely on a ""champion-challenger"" model. Different predictive models are tested and the most accurate one is selected. Each time a more accurate model is identified, it becomes the default. 
5. Prescriptive account-specific recommendations 
CRMs have traditionally been data repositories. When artificial intelligence is powering CRM systems, they assume a new and more useful role as a trusted advisor. Based on the relevant data housed in a CRM system, artificial intelligence has the capability to generate targeted recommendations for salespeople, including personalized sales and marketing collateral to be delivered at specified times. The most effective artificial intelligence-powered CRMs will also provide the ""why,” informing salespeople as to the rationale behind certain prescribed courses of action.
CRMs are in desperate need of a makeover. The time is now. Sales reps can no longer survive without garnering the trust of the customer. Artificial intelligence promises to equip salespeople with a heightened reputation. With targeted and prescriptive recommendations, artificial intelligence empowers them to become a thought leader and transform customer relationships from salesperson/customer to doctor/patient, providing effective treatments for potentially fatal business issues. The implications are game-changing. Whereas only 3% of salespeople are trusted, 49% of doctors are trusted.

Much of the chatter amounts to no more than hot air. The most farfetched imaginings are usually easy to spot and dismiss.Yet accounts of real-world AI deployments—applications with strong potential to improve patient care while cutting costs—are amassing into a category of medical literature in its own right.RSNA’s Radiology: Artificial Intelligence is the first peer-reviewed journal to focus entirely on the technology, signaling radiology’s place at the forefront of the AI revolution within healthcare. But the journal and the profession are both likely to have lots of company at the head of the class before long.With those observations in hand, RBJ sought out a representative sampling of radiologists who are not just talking about AI but also using it to beneficial effect. Here are five highlights from what we found.An Unfractured View of FracturesThe diagnosis of elbow injuries in children and adolescents is difficult because the developing skeletal system has unique features not seen in adults. For example, cartilage still comprises a portion of pediatric elbow joints, making certain injuries impossible to detect via X-rays. Additionally, pediatric elbow joints have many growth centers that ossify as children grow. As a result, fracture patterns vary significantly depending on an individual child’s age and unique developmental factors.During their tenure in the diagnostic radiology program at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Jesse Rayan, MD, now an imaging fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Nakul Reddy, MD, an interventional radiology fellow at MD Anderson Cancer Center, developed a means of using AI to overcome these and other diagnostic challenges by automating the analysis of pediatric elbow radiographs.The model leverages a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to process multiple images together. A CNN is a deep learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign learnable weights and biases to various aspects of or objects in that image, and differentiate one aspect or object from another. An RNN recognizes patterns in sequences of data and images, decomposing the latter into a series of patches and treating them as a sequence.“A simpler way to think about this would be to consider the CNN as analogous to the human visual cortex,” Rayan explains. “It’s able to recognize patterns in an image and classify if something is present or not. This works great for single images, but many radiographic studies have more than one image for a single study.”In the elbow application developed at Baylor, the RNN is used to effectively process multiple outputs—i.e., multiple views of the pediatric elbow—passed through the CNN before arriving at a single decision point.Rayan, Reddy and colleagues tested the method on 21,456 X-rays containing 58,817 images of pediatric elbows and associated radiology reports, all captured at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. Accuracy on the studied dataset was found to be 88%, with sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 84%.The researchers concluded that deep learning can effectively classify acute and nonacute pediatric elbow abnormalities on radiographs in a trauma setting. “A recurrent neural network was used to classify an entire radiographic series, arrive at a decision based on all views and identify fractures in pediatric patients with variable skeletal immaturity,” they underscore.Radiology: Artificial Intelligence published the study in its inaugural issue (“Binomial Classification of Pediatric Elbow Fractures Using a Deep Learning Multiview Approach Emulating Radiologist Decision Making,” January 2019).Rayan tells RBJ the model’s greatest potential to improve patient care lies in ER triage, where studies that need more attention can be prioritized for quicker turnaround. Additionally, he notes, using AI in this context could enhance the caliber of patient care by allowing radiologists to home in on specific findings that might otherwise be overlooked.Rayan believes this is just one example of how AI can assist radiologists in clinical decision-making without delay. If AI tools help radiologists increase the accuracy of their diagnoses and recommendations, he asserts, costs can be reduced across hospitals and health systems.Going forward, Rayan plans to work on similar projects in the ER radiology setting, including studying whether deep learning can effectively triage studies in other emergent situations. He deems increasing radiologists’ confidence in their decisions without slowing turnaround times “the most exciting application of this technology.”Another Eye on Alzheimer’sPhysicians face a tough dilemma when diagnosing older patients with memory issues. Once organic causes like stroke, infection and Parkinson’s have been ruled out, they must determine whether these individuals have dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or, alternatively, some form of mild cognitive impairment.Radiologist Jae Ho Sohn, MD, of UC-San Francisco and colleagues developed an algorithm that addresses this dilemma by analyzing FDG-PET scans of patients whose memory no longer appears to be functioning properly. Based on this analysis, the algorithm provides what Sohn considers a “highly accurate prediction that can boost the confidence of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis or rule it out.”The algorithm looks for subtle, slow diffuse processes and global changes in the brain that are difficult to see with the naked eye, such as changes in glucose uptake.“Traditionally, radiologists analyze the patterns of reduced glucose uptake,” Sohn explains. “For Alzheimer’s disease, symmetric reduction of glucose uptake in the temporal and parietal lobes of the brain has been the most specific finding. But these classic findings manifest later in Alzheimer’s disease” than the changes identified by the algorithm.Moreover, the algorithm considers the whole picture of the brain on the FDG-PET scan to make its prediction. “We show a saliency map image that demonstrates where the algorithm is looking in the brain, and it covers the entire brain—not just one region,” Sohn says.Sohn and colleagues trained the algorithm on images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a massive public dataset of PET scans conducted on patients who were eventually diagnosed with either Alzheimer’s Disease, mild cognitive impairment or no disorder. Over time, the algorithm learned on its own which features and patterns are important for predicting the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and which are insignificant.The researchers tested the algorithm on two novel datasets after it had been trained on 1,921 scans. One dataset contained 188 images from the same ADNI database; these had not yet been presented to the algorithm. The other was an entirely novel set of scans from 40 patients of the UCSF Memory and Aging Unit, all of whom had presented with possible cognitive impairment. The algorithm correctly identified a respective 92% of patients from the first test set and 98% of patients from the second test set who eventually developed Alzheimer’s disease.These predictions were made slightly more than six years, on average, before the patient received a final diagnosis. Sohn et al. report the research in “A Deep Learning Model to Predict a Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease by Using 18F-FDG PET of the Brain” (Radiology, online Nov. 6, 2018).“With further large-scale external validation on multi-institutional data and model calibration, the algorithm may be integrated into clinical workflow and serve as an important decision-support tool to aid radiology readers and clinicians with early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease,” the authors write.Sohn believes the algorithm may greatly enhance radiologists’ ability to accurately predict whether a patient with memory issues will progress to Alzheimer’s disease. It also could add confidence to Alzheimer’s disease diagnosesmade by neurologists—before all the symptoms have manifested.“An even more important implication is that, without early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease”—for example, as enabled by the algorithm—“there will likely be no cure or stopping the progression,” Sohn says.He adds that by expanding the indications for FDG PET scans of the brain, which are currently not routinely used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in patients who present with memory impairment, the algorithm will generate more work for radiologists and create a need for additional radiologist manpower. However, it has the potential to increase radiology revenues from performing additional FDG PET studies.Sohn is currently focusing on streamlining and optimizing the methodology of applying AI to radiology research so that similar advancements can be made in other clinical areas. Accordingly, he is building a large, well-organized database of images and annotations designed to support an approach wherein radiologists first detect patterns in very big radiological data and then identify which patterns are of clinical significance. This approach would replace traditional,hypothesis-based research and is now being applied in brain CT, lung cancer, health economics and dermatopathology datasets.Objectivity Aids Prostate AssessmentIn recent years, multiparametric MRI has become an important modality for assessing prostate cancer, but the process of interpreting mpMRI prostate studies is variable because of its subjective nature. One team of researchersis working to wring clarity from the fuzziness with the creation of a new framework for predicting the progression of prostate cancer, specifically by differentiating between low- and high-risk cases.The framework melds radiomics—the use of algorithms to extract large amounts of quantitative characteristics from images—with machine learning. Among members of the team that developed the technique were Guarav Pandey, PhD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and radiologists Vinay Duddalwar, MD, and Bino Varghese, PhD, of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.“Machine learning-based methods, the specific form of AI used” to create the framework, “are designed to sift through large amounts of data—structured or unstructured and without any particular guiding biomedical hypothesis—to discover potentially actionable knowledge directly from data,” Pandey says.One form of this knowledge is a predictive model that shows a mathematical relationship between the features in the data describing an entity of interest—say, a patient—and an outcome or label such as the disease status.The framework harnesses seven established classification algorithms to predict and assign a prostate cancer aggressiveness risk label (high or lower) for each patient from the radiomics features extracted from that patient’s mpMRI images.A trial of the framework was presented in “Objective Risk Stratification of Prostate Cancer Using Machine Learning and Radiomics Applied to Multiparametric Magnetic Images,” a retrospective study published in Scientific Reports (online Feb. 7, 2019). The study involved 68 prostate cancer patients and was based on mpMRI images, along with transrectal ultrasound-MRI fusion-guided biopsy of the prostate performed within two months of mpMRI. The framework was shown to offer a high sensitivity and predictive value on the strength of the combination of machine learning with radiomics. Large training and validation datasets yielded more accurate predictions than prior studies, Pandey et al. write.According to the research team, the value of the framework in enhancing the quality of patient care extends beyond improving diagnostic confidence: It offers more precise clinical information related to individual patients’ data.Specifically, it does not simply identify a patient’s cancer; instead, it allows radiologists to differentiate between patients with aggressive prostate cancer and indolent prostate cancer. This, Duddalwar and Varghese assert, has numerous implications for the physician team preparing a treatment plan for a patient. For instance, a more radicalapproach to treatment may be instituted earlier rather than at a later stage, or follow-up imaging may be performed at a different interval during treatment. In addition, alternative and supplemental treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, may be introduced earlier in treatment if indicated.Duddalwar and Varghese note that their model doesn’t add to costs already incurred, as it’s based not on standard-of-care imaging protocols but on an innovative means of analyzing routinely collected images.They also emphasize that only a minimal amount of time is needed to implement the machine learning-based risk classifier through a graphical user interface and a few keystrokes or mouse clicks. Consequently, the big benefits of better diagnosis and thus prognosis should outweigh the cost of utilizing AI in this context.In tandem with AI experts like Pandey, Duddalwar and Varghese are presently involved in several projects involving the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases using a combination of imaging and AI techniques. For example, they are integrating imaging and molecular/genomic attributes in bladder and renal cancers, with the objective of finding patterns in clinical imaging.Such patterns, Duddelwar and Varghese explain, could suggest specific mutations and molecular attributes in particular patients, in turn providing physicians with more information about which treatment(s) would be better suited for a givenindividual. Another project in the exploration stages involves the use of AI techniques to identify radiomic features in oncologic imaging as a means of best predicting patients’ response to immunotherapy.Patterns Emerge in MammographyConnie Lehman, MD, PhD, MassachusettsGeneral HospitalDecades into research and awareness efforts, effective early detection of breast cancer remains a challenge. To reverse the tide, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) built a deep-learning model that, based on a mammogram image alone, can predict as far as five years in the future whether a patient is likely to develop breast cancer.Using mammograms and outcomes from more than 60,000 of the hospital’s patients, the research team trained the model to pick out subtle patterns in breast tissue that are known precursors of breast cancer, explains Mass General radiologist Constance Lehman, MD, PhD. Among the team members was AI expert Regina Barzilay, PhD, of MIT’s computer science and AI lab. Lehman and Barzilay previously created an AI algorithm that measures breast density at the level of an experienced clinician and has been in use since January 2018.“The model deduces the patterns that drive future cancer right from the data,” Lehman tells RBJ. “These patterns are so subtle, it’s impossible for us to see them with the naked eye.”In “Deep Learning Mammography-Based Model Can Improve Breast Cancer Risk Prediction,” published in the May 2019 edition of Radiology, Barzilay, Lehman and co-authors report that their model performed significantly better thanother models designed for the same purpose, accurately placing 31% of all cancer patients in its highest-risk category. By comparison, traditional models correctly placed only around 18% of these patients.Lehman says the model is a game-changer, as the detailed information it can provide allows for more precise assessment of breast cancer risk at the level of the individual patient. “Women have unique and very variable patterns of breast tissue that we can see on their mammogram—patterns that represent the influence of everything from genetics, hormones and pregnancy to lactation, diet and changes in weight,” Lehman says. “By identifying them through deep learning, we remove generalization” from the equation.The model enables the same level of customization and personalization when it comes to breast cancer screening and prevention programs, regardless of varying recommendations put forth by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventative Task Force. While the former advocates annual breast cancer screening starting at age 45, the latter recommends screening every other year, beginning at age 50.“Instead of fitting women into a box and following either one of these recommendations, we can plan screening based on a particular patient’s risk of developing breast cancer, in keeping with what is indicated by the tool,” Lehman says.“Some women may be told to have a mammogram every two years, while women whose risk is found to be higher might be steered toward supplemental screening. But across all patients and groups, diagnosis comes sooner.”Moreover, Lehman observes, the model should take the accuracy of breast cancer risk assessment to a higher level. This, she says, was not possible with earlier models developed only on breast MRIs of Caucasian women.“Our model makes breast cancer detection a more equitable process because it was built using images from Caucasian and non-Caucasian women alike, and it’s accurate for white and black women,” Lehman states. Such equitability is critical given that black women are, due to such factors as differences in detection and access to health care, 42% more likely than other women to die from breast cancer.Additionally, the model may help to reduce the waste of imaging and other care resources, thus driving costs incurred by radiology practices and imaging departments downward. “This comes from the targeted care it enables,” Lehman says.Next on the agenda is developing an AI tool for triaging patients. This will allow physicians to determine whether mammography patients are at greater risk for developing health problems other than breast cancer—for example, a different kind of cancer or cardiovascular disease.Off to the MRI RacesMRI scans typically take 20 to 60 minutes to complete—considerably longer than, say, CT or x-ray. Under the umbrella of an AI-centric project called fastMRI, two very unlikely partners—the New York University School of Medicine’s Department of Radiology and social media giant Facebook—are teaming up to make the modality 10 times faster than it is today.FastMRI calls for speeding up MRI studies by capturing less data. An artificial neural network is trained to recognize the underlying structure of the images being captured. It harnesses this training to fill in the views that are missing from “fast scans,” producing the image detail necessary for accurate detection of abnormalities.The imaging dataset used to train the neural network was collected exclusively by NYU School of Medicine and consists of 10,000 clinical cases comprising approximately 3 million MRI images of the knee, brain and liver.Daniel Sodickson, MD, PhD, New York University/NYU Langone HealthNYU professor Daniel Sodickson, MD, PhD, likens the AI-based image reconstruction technique behind fastMRI to the way in which the eyes and brain function when making out objects in low light.“We don’t have a complete view of the object, because of the dark,” he elaborates. “However, we know in our brain what the underlying structure of the object is, and we quickly and accurately ‘fill in’ all of the details.”So far, the team is seeing “encouraging results in the knee MRIs” less than a year into the project, Sodickson says. “We’ve accelerated these scans by a factor of six compared to standard MRI scans, and radiologists cannot distinguish between the images from both types of scans,” he adds. “So we’re halfway there with that.”Speeding up MRI scans using AI will yield a multitude of benefits that will have a positive impact on patient care, Sodickson says. Reduced time in the scanner will lead to a better MRI experience for patients—especially children, the critically ill and individuals who have difficulty lying down or remaining still. Less time means less movement, which generally translates to optimal image quality and fewer patient back-outs. The end-result is more accurate diagnosis and a high likelihood of appropriate treatment.Then too, there’s decreased wait time for patients in the queue. “The faster each MRI study is done, the greater the number of patients who can be scanned each day on each unit and have access to care,” Sodickson explains. “Access to MRI in general is increased, too, which has positive effect on patient care as well. For example, in broad geographic areas where there’s only one MRI scanner, the wait for an MRI study could be really long. But if that scanner is being used to perform more scans per day, less delay follows and triaging cases is easier.”Additionally, increasing exposure speed allows motion to be frozen out and a clearer view of the anatomy to be gained.Sodickson emphasizes that the project is HIPAA-compliant. All MRI images being utilized in the endeavor have been scrubbed of distinguishing features, and no Facebook data of any kind are being used. NYU Medical Center and Facebook are open-sourcing their work so that other researchers can build on the developments.Following their initial success, Sodickson and his team have begun to test a handful of other MRI accelerations. And they’re looking beyond musculoskeletal applications.“Now that we’ve seen encouraging results with the knee imaging, we’re starting on other datasets,” he says. “We hope to have good documentation and clinical evaluations before the year is out and to begin accelerating brain MRI along with body MRI—specifically, faster MRI of the abdomen, liver and kidneys.“The potential for AI is deep. We’re just getting started,” Sodickson says. “In some applications, faster MRI may let patients avoid the exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs with X-rays and CTs. But I envision a day when scanners can be changed to gather just the data that’s needed. That’s long-term, of course, but it’s the power of AI in radiology.”Julie Ritzer Ross,Contributor Related ContentRayus Radiology launches whole-body MRI service in Seattle, SimonMed expands, RadNet touts legislation, plus more company newsACR opens doors of AI quality-assurance center AI critical care software revolutionizes emergency responseStrategic Radiology signs on with Qure.ai ASNC supports AMA effort to limit use of AI in prior authorization decisionsAmerican College of Radiology asks CMS to create new alternative payment pathway for high-value AI",,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'What Has Artificial Intelligence Done for Radiology Lately?', 'name': 'What Has Artificial Intelligence Done for Radiology Lately?', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://radiologybusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2019-08/ai_radiology.jpg?h=6adfd4d5&itok=za18y80a', 'width': '1200', 'height': '630'}, 'datePublished': '2019-08-09T20:06:14+0000', 'dateModified': '2022-05-05T20:04:26+0000', 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Radiology Business', 'url': 'https://radiologybusiness.com/'}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The robots are coming: How artificial intelligence will shape the future of chest medicine (and CHEST)*

The robots are coming – at least according to a report,1 which states that Google created an artificial intelligence model that was able to detect lung cancer and cut back on false-positives at a rate that beat experienced radiologists.

Robots have long been an interest of the author – both professionally and as a hobby. As a part of the CHEST Foundation’s Lung Health Experience, Chad Jackson constructed a simple robot that included pig lungs to simulate human lung activity. 

As a fan of Star Wars, sci-fi, and innovation, in general – I say, bring it on! It’s an exciting trend in medicine to see technology that has already changed the way we work and live enter into the world of health care. And, this is not about replacing humans either (like what occurs in a lot of sci-fi ); this technology will potentially provide clinicians with the tools they can use to improve outcomes for their patients.The researchers for this study used a system called convolutional neural networks to study patterns in 3D CT scans. One advantage computers has over humans is that a computer can process the entire scan all at once while trained radiologists need to review individual slices of each scan to make their diagnosis.










While this technology will need more testing and large-scale trials before being used to diagnose patients’ disorders, the early results are encouraging. The researchers also picked a cancer that impacts so many of CHEST’s members and their patients. Lung cancer kills more Americans than any type of cancer while accounting for more than 25% of all cancer deaths annually.2 In a statistic that many people find shocking, lung cancer actually kills more women than breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers combined.3 Given the devastation of this disease, we can use all of the help we can get. Another positive from this study that might be overlooked is the rate of improvement for false-positive results. This could be a major benefit of both saving the time and preventing invasive treatments or attempts to confirm a diagnosis.This news is exciting for everyone trying to (as we say at CHEST) crush lung disease, but seeing AI in medicine is not surprising, because we are already using it at CHEST. The AI projects at CHEST include analyzing the types of activities that are most beneficial to members and building predictive analytics models for a project. These were only initial forays into using this new technology. One of the even more mind-blowing developments has been rolling out natural language processing4 for our internal data reporting.This is a new development, and much like the Google lung cancer study, we cannot tell you what the end result will be. What we can say is that it’s likely to change the way we work and provide new opportunities to create analytics solutions for our partners.CHEST is not “just” a medical association: we are also an innovative group using the latest tools to create a better future for members, partners, and ,ultimately, patients and their families.

The field of particle physics produces colossal amounts of data as it pushes the frontiers of human understanding. Fermilab scientist Nhan Tran is working to make sure researchers have the innovative techniques and technology they need to handle the data deluge and to select the details that are likely to reveal exciting new physics phenomena.
And now he has received a prestigious award to advance this work. The Department of Energy Early Career Research Award will provide Tran with $2.5 million over five years to lead efforts to apply artificial intelligence to push the frontiers of both physics and technology.
Tran will use a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning to expand the capabilities of particle collider research. Deep learning uses a complex artificial neural network, inspired by biological brains, to allow a computer to learn how to perform a complex task, such as identifying an object in a picture, without being explicitly programmed for that task. Each of the many layers or artificial neurons in an artificial neural network can modify the data before passing it on to another piece of the network. The program adjusts how these changes occur based on test information that is provided to it in order to configure itself for the desired task.
“As we get more and more data, computing is going to be a real issue,” Tran said. “Using new types of computing hardware with deep learning algorithms is a promising way to overcome this issue.”
Tran is applying his expertise to expand the impact of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, a 17-mile-around particle collider at CERN in Switzerland, in two major ways. He will use the award funds to develop systems that will improve how computers handle the LHC data flood. He will also further develop a technique he pioneered that allows scientists to identify in the LHC data particles called Higgs bosons, whose discovery in 2012 led to a Nobel Prize.
At the LHC, beams of protons collide to produce other particles, including Higgs bosons, and these post-collision particles carry a wide range of momenta. Nhan is interested in using deep learning to identify Higgs bosons with high momentum and how they decay into other particles. Studying Higgs bosons under these new conditions opens the door to discovering new physics.
“Observing these specific events was considered to be impossible at hadron colliders,” said Fermilab senior scientist Anadi Canepa, head of the CMS Department in which Tran works. “And then Nhan and collaborators came up with this new technique, and he’s extracting much more than we thought we could from the data we collect.”
His work on the Higgs boson will be helped by the other thrust of his award-supported work: developing computer systems to cope with the increasing amounts of data that particle colliders produce. Instead of just improving generalized computing technologies, Tran’s plan is to develop systems that combine hardware that is specialized for efficiently performing specific types of computations, exceeding the capabilities of traditional computer technology to address those tasks.
“Nhan is a very clear thinker with a keen taste for where to focus his efforts,” said Fermilab scientist Gabriel Perdue, who leads artificial intelligence efforts at Fermilab. “He knows better than anyone that what you choose to work on is more important than any other decision you make, and his ability to figure out the most important problems and tackle them directly really sets him apart. He really understands the point of highest leverage for AI in high-energy physics and is making a huge difference right at that point.”
Tran was introduced to the world of advanced computer technology through his postdoctoral physics research on trigger systems, which select what collision data to keep from among hundreds of millions of particle collisions generated every second at the LHC. He and researchers in industry are now exploring the high-tech electronics that Tran worked on for opportunities to improve computers.
Tran plans to couple more efficient hardware developed by tech companies, such as Microsoft and Xilinx, with Fermilab’s existing computer infrastructure to meet future demands.
“People in the computer industry are always interested to hear about our problems, because we present them with very challenging data sets in terms of their complexity, their size and our own unique requirements,” Tran said. “We generally present them with problems that can push the boundaries of their own technology.”
Tran plans to use the award to purchase new computer hardware, to hire a postdoctoral researcher for the projects and to enable experts at Fermilab to determine how to apply novel computing systems on a large scale.
“Nhan is internationally recognized as an innovator who completes his ideas,” Canepa said. “If he has an idea, that idea then becomes a reality. He has demonstrated that in challenging situations, and every time, he succeeded. He also chooses the right ideas. He really sees what are the main challenges — what is pulling us back from extracting the most information out of our precious data — and he identifies what’s the most relevant and impactful improvement and goes after that.”
Tran says Fermilab is a great environment for his work. He appreciates the excellent postdoctoral researchers that come to the lab and the ability to just walk up or down a floor and consult with experts, especially about the computing topics that he is not formally trained in.
“It’s an honor to receive this award,” Tran said. “And it’s really exciting to explore new techniques in deep learning and push it as far as we can go, both on the physics side and the technical side.”

U.S. Employees’ Perspectives on the Jobs Most at Risk from Artificial Intelligence in the Workplace

Opinion survey from Genesys flags manufacturing, retail, telemarketing and data entry positions as most likely to be impacted by AI
SAN FRANCISCO (Aug. 6, 2019) — A new survey finds U.S. workers believe jobs in Manufacturing (43%), Retail/Checkout Clerks (40%), Telemarketers (38%) and in Data Entry (37%) are the most likely to shrink due to the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). However, two-thirds (67%) of respondents say they are not afraid that AI/bots will replace their own jobs within the next 10 years.
These findings stem from research sponsored by Genesys® (www.genesys.com), the global leader in omnichannel customer experience and contact center solutions, into the attitudes of 1,001 employed Americans regarding the current and future effects of AI on the workplace.
Survey participants in a wide variety of industries were asked to select the three jobs most likely to be replaced by AI from among the following options: Accountant/Tax Preparer, Data Entry, Food Service, Insurance Underwriters, Manufacturing, Paralegal, Pharmacist, Retail/Checkout Clerk, Telemarketer, Transportation/Driver, and Other.
Who’s afraid of AI?
The Genesys findings reveal that U.S. employees working in Education/Training and as Doctor/Nurse/Caregivers are the least afraid that AI/bots will take their jobs within the next 10 years. The most afraid? The Media and those with Assembly Line/Manufacturing jobs.
Human Resources employees, who should have the pulse on employment trends, identified Data Entry and Retail/Checkout jobs as the most likely to be replaced by AI, and equally at risk. Employees working in Customer Service tend toward pessimism, selecting the jobs of Retail/Checkout Clerk and Telemarketer as the most likely to suffer from AI.
Surprisingly, Transportation-related jobs, such as drivers, are considered by only 16% of U.S. survey respondents as among the most likely functions to be replaced by AI. This response appears to indicate that participants are not paying close attention to the predicted coming revolution in autonomous vehicles and trucking fleets.
Equally interesting is that in spite of publicity surrounding automated restaurants and robot servers, particularly in Asia, only 17% of U.S. respondents see Food Service jobs in danger of AI. Survey respondents working within Food Service and Transportation themselves ignore negative media coverage and point the finger at Retail/Checkout Clerks and Manufacturing positions as the most threatened.
Just over half (52%) of U.S. employees surveyed express confidence in their skillset for competing in the AI-enabled workplace, but this could change as an equal 52% say they don’t feel AI has impacted their jobs — yet.
“The American employees we surveyed have a generally positive view of technology in their workplaces, with 86% affirming its benefits. However, that doesn’t make them blind to how artificial intelligence could impact particular industries,” said Merijn te Booij, chief marketing officer for Genesys. “The key is that humans and technology must work together. When implemented strategically and balanced with the human touch, AI can elevate the workforce by enabling employees to be more productive, accurate and fulfilled as they are positioned to enjoy the more complex aspects of their work.”
The survey uncovers many other interesting insights, including:
Across age groups, U.S. employees agree that Manufacturing and Retail/Checkout Clerks are most at risk, while believing that Paralegals (4%), Insurance Underwriters (5%), and Pharmacists (7%) have the best chance to survive automation.More part-time U.S. employees (25%) fear AI will take their jobs within 10 years than do full-time workers (18%), although there is no significant difference in attitudes on the specific jobs they think are likely to disappear.Employees in the largest companies, with more than 20,000 staff, are slightly less afraid (17%) than the overall group (19%) of the effect of AI/bots on their jobs within the next 10 years, possibly because they have already experienced its negative impact (10%) and see a more stable future.
The responses of U.S. employees line up very closely to the opinions held by U.S. employers surveyed separately by Genesys, who also found the four jobs most threated by AI to be Data entry, Manufacturing, Retail/Checkout Clerk and Telemarketer. The only notable difference was that more employers (52%) selected Data Entry as their top choice, compared to 37% of the employees.
Genesys announced initial employee survey findings in July and will release additional insights in the coming months from both employee and employer surveys. 
Survey Methodology and Participants
Within the U.S., a total of 1,001 adults completed the online survey of employees in April. Respondents were evenly divided into three age ranges: 18-38, 39-54, 55-73, with women accounting for 65% and men 35%; less than 1% did not categorize by gender.
Approximately 80% of those surveyed have full-time employee status with the remaining 20% working part-time. Respondents came from seven categories of company sizes, with a total of 42% employed in companies of fewer than 250 employees.
While U.S. survey respondents work in a wide variety of industries, 77% are currently working in one of 11 functional job categories: Administrative, Assembly Line/Manufacturing, Customer Service/Retail/Technical Support, Doctor/Nurse/Caregiver, Education/Training, Finance/Accounting, Food Service, Human Resources, Marketing/Inside Sales, Media, and Driver/Transportation Provider. The remaining 23% fell into an “Other” job category.
Genesys commissioned third-party research consultancy Vitreous World to conduct an identical survey in six countries — the U.S., Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand — for a total of 4,207 participants.

Many organizations are struggling to find strategies for recruiting a more diverse workforce, and some are turning to artificial intelligence (AI). But artificial intelligence got a bad rap last year when news got out that Amazon's internal AI recruiting tool had ""learned"" gender bias. So, is AI beneficial to those seeking diversity, or will it just exacerbate the problem? One recruiting firm has found that AI is an effective strategy for increasing the diversity of candidate pools, as long as its implemented correctly.


The Problems With Using AI In Recruiting

Amazon scrapped its internal AI recruiting efforts after realizing that the test recruiting program they designed was biased against women. The computer models were trained with résumés submitted to Amazon over the previous ten years. Not surprisingly, most of these résumés came from men. Therefore, the computer models “learned” that men were superior job candidates. 

As a result, the models became biased against women, generating lower ratings to graduates of two all-women’s colleges and penalizing résumés that contained the word “women’s” as in “women’s chess club captain.” Although the programs could be altered to become neutral to these particular terms, Amazon decided to scrap the project out of fear that the models may develop other discriminatory selection criteria.

The Benefits Of Using AI In Recruiting
Despite Amazon's setbacks, Genevieve Jurvetson, cofounder and CMO of the artificial intelligence-based recruiting firm, Fetcher, believes AI is an essential tool for those seeking a more diverse candidate pool. “If you get too caught up in the fears surrounding AI, you miss a huge opportunity,"" Jurvetson says. She explains that there are innumerable criteria that you can use to find good candidates that are not remotely gender-related. Jurvetson claims that Fetcher's use of AI techniques allows them to bring minorities and women into their clients' hiring pipeline in a way other recruiting methods just can't.
Why are AI techniques so effective? We all know humans have biases. Take gender bias, for example. After a lifetime of exposure to mostly men in leadership roles, in boardrooms and in tech jobs, we develop a bias to prefer men in these positions. The big advantage of artificial intelligence is that it removes the humans and their biases from a large chunk of the recruiting process. The more you can remove human intervention, particularly at the stages of the recruiting process that are most prone to bias, the less that bias will be able to influence decision-making.

Although Fetcher allows clients to “thumbs up or thumbs down” potential candidates, Jurvetson thinks the most diverse candidate pools come from what they call their fully automated mode. In this mode, Fetcher hones in on client preferences by asking the client to review a handful of candidates. Then, Fetcher's systems take control, assembling a candidate pool, and contacting potential candidates directly. This way, a client's potential biases are removed from the process of choosing who will be contacted. Jurvetson describes, “When you pull yourself out of the process, that’s a really important step because when you’re not hand-selecting each candidate, you’re not bringing in these inherent biases that we all have.”

One reason that organizations have trouble increasing diversity is that the traditional methods of searching for candidates are often biased. The problem, Jurvetson explains, is that searches often use bias-ridden proxies for candidate potential. “Did they go to a top 20 university? Did they come from a top-tier company? Those tend to be pools of talent that might not be that diverse to start with. Using AI to be able to identify patterns, career progression is a great one, that correlate with success better than those old proxies is exciting and effective,” she explains.

According to Jurvetson, searches using these less-traditional proxies for success identified by artificial intelligence programs allow Fetcher to find candidates that might otherwise go overlooked. This allows organizations to cast a wider net than they might otherwise.
Research confirms there are huge advantages of casting a wide net when assembling a candidate pool if you want to increase diversity. One study found that if you only have one female candidate or underrepresented minority candidate in your pool of candidates, they have almost no chance of making it to the offer stage. That's because the lone woman or minority seems too different from the norm. However, if you add a second female or minority candidate, their odds of making it to the final round increase dramatically, and they have the same chance of receiving an offer as the other candidates.    
What keeps the Fetcher models from having the same issue as Amazon’s failed model? Jurvetson suggests that precautions need to be taken to minimize any unintended effects. At Fetcher, she says they keep their models simple, and they keep a trained human eye on the models and the outputs to be sure the recruiting criteria are gender-neutral and that the models are returning diverse candidate pools.
The Future Of AI In Recruiting
Recently, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic and Reece Akhtar made an argument in Harvard Business Review for taking the use of AI techniques one step further and applying them to the interview process. The researchers report, “One of the major problems with the way we currently interview job candidates is that the process is largely unstructured, leaving the questioning to the whims and fancies of the interviewer. It shouldn’t take much convincing to see how this is not only inefficient, but how it also leads to biased decision-making due to interviewers expressing and seeking to confirm their own preferences. This is where video or digital interviews are likely to help. Digital interviews can remove these limitations almost entirely.”
While optimistic at about their potential, Jurvetson doesn't think AI job interviews will take over any time soon. ""I think if used thougthtfully, they can be really powerful and helpful for a lot of candidates, especially at early stages of the recruiting process, but I don’t have to tell you all the ways that can go wrong as well. You have to be smart about how and when you utilize these types of interviews, or racial or gender issues could come into play in a really sad way, and you could also negatively impact the candidate experience,"" she reports. One more limitation she added, “I’ve heard from candidates interviewing for more experienced roles that they sometimes find [automated interviews] insulting, because they can give the impression that the potential employer isn't willing to give you their time.”
For those looking to create a more diverse workforce, removing human decision-making from at least a part of the recruiting process seems like a no-brainer for reducing unconscious bias in hiring. Implemented correctly, AI tools can be a great way to search in an unbiased manner. And for those job seekers of the future, keep an open mind about a robot interviewer—hopefully it will be programmed to be less biased than a human manager.

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 15, 2019  /PRNewswire/ -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is moving full steam ahead in the U.S. workplace. By 2022, 60% of U.S. companies expect to be using AI or advanced automation to support efficiency in operations, staffing, budgeting or performance. Currently 24% of companies are using AI or advanced automation with an additional 36% planning to use it within three years — and half of those (18%) within the next year alone.

Recent opinion surveys sponsored by Genesys examine the attitudes of U.S. employers and employees about the rising adoption of AI in the workplace -- and the impact they think it will have on jobs.







These insights stem from an opinion survey sponsored by Genesys® (www.genesys.com), the global leader in omnichannel customer experience and contact center solutions. The survey examined the attitudes of American employers about the rising adoption of AI in the workplace. The results come on the heels of findings from a companion survey of employees announced by Genesys in July. The company surveyed employers and employees in six countries — the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Regardless of the age of their organization, the U.S. employers surveyed believe AI makes their companies more effective. Specifically, 32% of employers find it enables companies to achieve goals faster, more effectively and at lower cost. An additional 25% believe AI allows employees to become more productive and to feel more valuable. That said, even with a total positive response among 57% of employers, their enthusiasm for new workplace technology tools such as AI and bots is surpassed by that of their employees, 70% of whom voiced a positive attitude toward AI in the earlier Genesys survey of employees.
But AI is not for every workplace. Nearly a third (31%) of employer survey respondents do not feel AI or advanced automation is practical for their type of business. The exact same percentage wonder if AI is too complex to implement.How leadership feels about AILuckily for technology vendors, 40% of employers say there is no hesitation within their companies about the need to adopt new technologies such as AI, bots or augmented reality. Their leadership realizes it makes the business more efficient. There is some concern within 24% of employers about the cost of adopting new technologies, but only 13% of the survey pool, mostly employers with younger companies, are suspicious that the usefulness of AI is over-hyped.Currently, 47% of the employers surveyed think AI will have a positive impact on their company within the next year, with a mere 5% predicting a negative impact. Looking five years ahead to 2024, 62% of employers believe AI's positive impact on their companies will continue, while the negative has only increased by 2%, to 7%. AI is seen by 26% of employers as necessary for their companies to remain competitive in the future. In addition, U.S. employers recognize that AI is changing their employees' lives. In fact, almost two-thirds (64%) of the U.S. employers surveyed think their employees are excited to have better, AI-enabled technology tools because it assists them in their jobs.""The survey results serve as another proof point that businesses win big when they deploy automation and AI-assisted technologies – and so do employees,"" said Merijn te Booij, chief marketing officer for Genesys. ""Our research shows 61% of employers believe workers are more fulfilled when their workplace adopts AI because it allows them to take on more challenging tasks. When AI moves rote, mundane duties off employees' plates, they have more time to focus on what they're best at – work that's more interesting, diverse and requires more complex problem solving."" The future of jobs There's a definite disconnect between U.S. employers and their employees when discussing ""fear of the bot."" According to the Genesys research, employers believe employees are more concerned than they really are. Are employers seeing a specter that doesn't exist, or do employees have their heads in the sand?
42% of U.S. employers believe employees are scared of AI/bots because of potential job elimination. Due to the perceived risk to jobs, 8% of employers say they would like to avoid adoption of AI/bots in their companies. 
67% of U.S. employee respondents in an earlier Genesys survey said they are not afraid that AI/bots would eliminate their jobs within the next 10 years while just 19% are fearful. 
50% of the U.S. employers surveyed say the adoption of AI will not cause them to reduce their workforce. 
30% of the U.S. employers surveyed anticipate workforce cuts due to AI adoption but 53% don't expect major staffing changes. 
36% of U.S. employers surveyed see a positive impact of AI on their employees in the next year with the number jumping to 53% when questioned about five years in the future. 
32% of U.S. employees surveyed anticipate a positive impact from AI on their jobs in five years.
Methodology and Demographics of SurveysGenesys commissioned third-party research consultancy Vitreous World to conduct online Employee and Employer surveys in six countries. 303 adults completed the U.S. Employer survey in May. The survey pool was divided into Millennials (43%), Generation X (41%), and Baby Boomers (17%), with 56% women and 44% men. The margin of error is plus/minus 3%.For a copy of the full survey data, North American press and analysts should contact the U.S.-based Genesys media relations team at genesys@sterlingpr.com.About GenesysGenesys® powers more than 25 billion of the world's best customer experiences each year.

Aug 14, 2019, 1:58 PM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeEngineer.ai, an Indian startup claiming to have built an artificial intelligence-assisted app development platform, is not in fact using AI to literally build apps, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Instead, the company, which has attracted nearly $30 million in funding from a SoftBank-owned firm and others, is reportedly relying mostly on human engineers, while using hype around AI to attract customers and investment that will last it until it can actually get its automation platform off the ground. The company claims its AI tools are “human-assisted,” and that it provides a service that will help a customer make more than 80 percent of a mobile app from scratch in about an hour, according to claims Engineer.ai founder Sachin Dev Duggal, who also says his other title is “Chief Wizard,” made onstage at a conference last year. However, the WSJ reports that Engineer.ai does not use AI to assemble the code, and instead uses human engineers in India and elsewhere to put together the app. The company was sued earlier this year by its chief business officer, Robert Holdheim, who claims the company is exaggerating its AI abilities to get the funding it needed to actually work on the technology. According to Holdheim, Duggal “was telling investors that Engineer.ai was 80% done with developing a product that, in truth, he had barely even begun to develop.” Engineer.ai uses mostly conventional software and human engineers to make appsWhen pressed on how the company actually employs machine learning and other AI training techniques, the company told the WSJ it uses natural language processing to estimate pricing and timelines of requested features, and that it relies on a “decision tree” to assign tasks to engineers. Neither of those really qualify as the type of modern AI that powers cutting-edge machine translation or image recognition, and it does not appear that any kind of AI agent or software of any kind is actually compiling code. Engineer.ai did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Engineer.ai is not alone in allegedly talking up its AI capabilities. Funding for AI startups is growing fast, reaching $31 billion last year, according to PitchBook, and companies like Japanese conglomerate SoftBank have pledged to invest hundreds of billions in AI in the coming years. The number of companies which include the .ai top-level domain from the British territory Anguilla has doubled in the last few years, the WSJ reports. In other words, saying your company is building a traditional technology, like an app development platform, but tossing in AI is an easy way to get funding and attention in a saturated startup landscape increasingly squeezed by the efforts of giants like Facebook, Google, Uber, and others. According to the UK investment firm MMC Ventures, startups with some type of AI component can attract as much as 50 percent more funding than other software companies, and the firm tells the WSJ that it suspects 40 percent or even more of those companies don’t use any form of real AI at all. Part of the issue is that AI can feel easy to get off the ground in a testing or preliminary format, but that it’s much harder to actually deploy at scale. Additionally, gaining the necessary training data to build capable AI agents can be extremely costly and time-consuming; companies like Facebook and Google have gigantic research organizations paying engineers top salaries for the purpose of developing better AI training techniques that may one day be used to build commercial products. The revelations around Engineer.ai also reveal an uncomfortable truth about a lot of modern AI: it barely exists. Much like the moderation efforts of large-scale tech platforms like Facebook and YouTube — which use some AI, but also mostly armies of contractors overseas and domestically to review harmful and violent content for removal — a lot of AI technologies require people to guide them.

Instead, the company, which has attracted nearly $30 million in funding from a SoftBank-owned firm and others, is reportedly relying mostly on human engineers, while using hype around AI to attract customers and investment that will last it until it can actually get its automation platform off the ground. 

The company claims its AI tools are “human-assisted,” and that it provides a service that will help a customer make more than 80 percent of a mobile app from scratch in about an hour, according to claims Engineer.ai founder Sachin Dev Duggal, who also says his other title is “Chief Wizard,” made onstage at a conference last year. However, the WSJ reports that Engineer.ai does not use AI to assemble the code, and instead uses human engineers in India and elsewhere to put together the app. 

The company was sued earlier this year by its chief business officer, Robert Holdheim, who claims the company is exaggerating its AI abilities to get the funding it needed to actually work on the technology. According to Holdheim, Duggal “was telling investors that Engineer.ai was 80% done with developing a product that, in truth, he had barely even begun to develop.” 

""Engineer.ai uses mostly conventional software and human engineers to make apps""

When pressed on how the company actually employs machine learning and other AI training techniques, the company told the WSJ it uses natural language processing to estimate pricing and timelines of requested features, and that it relies on a “decision tree” to assign tasks to engineers. Neither of those really qualify as the type of modern AI that powers cutting-edge machine translation or image recognition, and it does not appear that any kind of AI agent or software of any kind is actually compiling code. Engineer.ai did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Engineer.ai is not alone in allegedly talking up its AI capabilities. Funding for AI startups is growing fast, reaching $31 billion last year, according to PitchBook, and companies like Japanese conglomerate SoftBank have pledged to invest hundreds of billions in AI in the coming years. The number of companies which include the .ai top-level domain from the British territory Anguilla has doubled in the last few years, the WSJ reports. In other words, saying your company is building a traditional technology, like an app development platform, but tossing in AI is an easy way to get funding and attention in a saturated startup landscape increasingly squeezed by the efforts of giants like Facebook, Google, Uber, and others. 

According to the UK investment firm MMC Ventures, startups with some type of AI component can attract as much as 50 percent more funding than other software companies, and the firm tells the WSJ that it suspects 40 percent or even more of those companies don’t use any form of real AI at all. Part of the issue is that AI can feel easy to get off the ground in a testing or preliminary format, but that it’s much harder to actually deploy at scale. Additionally, gaining the necessary training data to build capable AI agents can be extremely costly and time-consuming; companies like Facebook and Google have gigantic research organizations paying engineers top salaries for the purpose of developing better AI training techniques that may one day be used to build commercial products. 

The revelations around Engineer.ai also reveal an uncomfortable truth about a lot of modern AI: it barely exists. Much like the moderation efforts of large-scale tech platforms like Facebook and YouTube — which use some AI, but also mostly armies of contractors overseas and domestically to review harmful and violent content for removal — a lot of AI technologies require people to guide them. 

""Numerous startups use AI to build hype without actually making use of the tech""

The software must be trained to improve and be corrected when it gets stuff wrong, and that requires human eyes and ears to review, annotate data, and seed it back into the system where engineers can use it to fine-tune algorithms. This was especially true of the short-lived chatbot boom of a few years ago, when big names like Facebook and startups like Magic began employing scores of contractors hidden behind AI agents, like Facebook’s discontinued M, that would take the reins (or were the ones talking the whole time) when conversations became too complicated.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming smarter every day, beating world champions in games like Go, identifying tumours in medical scans better than human radiologists, and increasing the efficiency of electricity-hungry data centres. Some economists are comparing the transformative potential of AI with other “general purpose technologies” such as the steam engine, electricity or the transistor.
But current AI systems are far from perfect. They tend to reflect the biases of the data used to train them and to break down when they face unexpected situations. They can be gamed, as we have seen with the controversies surrounding misinformation on social media, violent content posted on YouTube, or the famous case of Tay, the Microsoft chatbot, which was manipulated into making racist and sexist statements within hours. 
So do we really want to turn these bias-prone, brittle technologies into the foundation stones of tomorrow’s economy?
Minimising risk
One way to minimise AI risks is to increase the diversity of the teams involved in their development. As research on collective decision-making and creativity suggests, groups that are more cognitively diverse tend to make better decisions. Unfortunately, this is a far cry from the situation in the community currently developing AI systems. And a lack of gender diversity is one important (although not the only) dimension of this. 
A review published by the AI Now Institute earlier this year, showed that less than 20% of the researchers applying to prestigious AI conferences are women, and that only a quarter of undergraduates studying AI at Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley are female.

The authors argued that this lack of gender diversity results in AI failures that uniquely affect women, such as an Amazon recruitment system that was shown to discriminate against job applicants with female names. 
Our recent report, Gender Diversity in AI research, involved a “big data” analysis of 1.5m papers in arXiv, a pre-prints website widely used by the AI community to disseminate its work.
We analysed the text of abstracts to determine which apply AI techniques, inferred the gender of the authors from their names and studied the levels of gender diversity in AI and its evolution over time. We also compared the situation in different research fields and countries, and differences in language between papers with female co-authors and all-male papers.
Our analysis confirms the idea that there is a gender diversity crisis in AI research. Only 13.8% of AI authors in arXiv are women and, in relative terms, the proportion of AI papers co-authored by at least one woman has not improved since the 1990s.
There are significant differences between countries and research fields. We found a stronger representation of women in AI research in the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark, and a lower representation in Japan and Singapore. We also found that women working in physics, education, biology and social aspects of computing are more likely to publish work on AI compared with those working in computer science or mathematics.
In addition to measuring gender diversity in the AI research workforce, we also explored semantic differences between research papers with and without female participation. We tested the hypothesis that research teams with more gender diversity tend to increase the variety of issues and topics that are considered in AI research, potentially making their outputs more inclusive. 
To do this, we measured the “semantic signature” of each paper using a machine learning technique called word embeddings, and compared these signatures between papers with at least one female author and papers without any women authors.
This analysis, which focuses on the Machine Learning and Social Aspects of Computing field in the UK, showed significant differences between the groups. In particular, we found that papers with at least one female co-author tend to be more applied and socially aware, with terms such as “fairness”, “human mobility”, “mental”, “health”, “gender” and “personality” playing a key role. The difference between the two groups is consistent with the idea that cognitive diversity has an impact on the research produced, and suggests that it leads to increased engagement with social issues. 
How to fix it
So what explains this persistent gender gap in AI research, and what can we do about it? 
Research shows that the lack of gender diversity in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce is not caused by a single factor: gender stereotypes and discrimination, a lack of role models and mentors, insufficient attention to work-life balance, and “toxic” work environments in the technology industry come together to create a perfect storm against gender inclusion.

There is no easy fix to close the gender gap in AI research. System-wide changes aimed at creating safe and inclusive spaces that support and promote researchers from underrepresented groups, a shift in attitudes and cultures in research and industry, and better communication of the transformative potential of AI in many areas could all play a part.
Policy interventions, such as the £13.5m investment from government to boost diversity in AI roles through new conversion degree courses, will go some way towards improving the situation, but broader scale interventions are needed to create better links between arts, humanities and AI, changing the image of who can work in AI.
While there is no single reason why girls disproportionately stop taking STEM subjects as they progress through education, there is evidence that factors including pervasive stereotypes around gender and a teaching environment that impacts the confidence of girls more than boys play a part in the problem. We must also showcase those role models who are using AI to make a positive difference.
One tangible intervention looking to tackle these issues is the Longitude Explorer Prize, which encourages secondary school students to use AI to solve social challenges and work with role models in AI. We want young people, particularly girls, to realise AI’s potential for good and their role in driving change.
By building skills and confidence in young women, we can change the ratio of people who study and work in AI – and help to address AI’s potential biases.

Robots and the workforce: understanding the research
As artificial intelligence (AI) technology develops at breakneck speed, some worry that robots may take away jobs. A new research primer from the Journal of Organization Design looks at the current and future research landscape.

Erica Gordon-Mallin 12 Aug 2019

Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics technology has been advancing rapidly over the past several years. For example, the AI Index reports that the number of papers, courses, and patents related to AI has grown dramatically over the past five years, and a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research reports that venture capital investment in AI startups has increased almost tenfold and the annual number of purchases of robots has tripled over the past decade.
In all likelihood, the advances in AI and robotics technology will help stimulate economic growth in many countries. This is welcome news as 36 of 37 advanced economies had slower productivity growth during 2006–2016 compared to 1996–2006. Across these economies, growth has slowed from a 2.7% average growth rate in the earlier decade to a 1.0% average annual growth rate.
New technologies typically create occupations even as they destroy existing ones.
However, some worry that this technology-enabled growth will come at a substantial cost. For example, some research has warned that AI threatens 15–30% or even 50% of jobs. Despite these concerns, such visions of the future are likely far-fetched, in part because new technologies typically create occupations even as they destroy existing ones—for example, “Web Developer” is an entire occupational category tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that didn’t exist a few decades ago—and in part because new technologies typically augment most jobs rather than directly leading to the creation or destruction of entire occupations.
In order to stimulate research on the effect of AI and robotics on organizations, we recently published a research primer on artificial intelligence and robotics in the Journal of Organization Design that describes the current state of the field. We draw on a wide body of literature on previous innovations, as well as the nascent literature on AI and robotics technologies themselves, to outline the various ways in which artificial intelligence and robotics may alter the ways in which we work and how organizations can structure themselves to best take advantage of these new technologies. We hope this primer can serve as a resource for scholars as we continue to investigate how these novel technologies affect labor and firms.
In an effort to understand where AI may substitute for or complement jobs, we devise a new methodology that links advances in AI to occupational abilities, and use this to create an AI occupation impact (AIOI) score for each occupation from 2010 to 2015. We utilize these AIOI scores to study the link between AI and employment and wage growth. We provide broad evidence that, on average, occupations impacted by AI are correlated with a modest growth in wages: an increase of one standard deviation in AI impact is associated with a 0.41% increase in wage growth. However, we find no evidence that AI and employment are correlated.
We also study the link between AI and the presence of complementary software skills. To do this, we use data from Burning Glass Technologies on software skill requirements in job listings and classify occupations into terciles depending on the proportion of software skills needed in a job.
Our findings suggest that the complementary effects of AI, at least as it relates to wage growth, are largely driven by occupations involving a high level of software skills. While there is no statistically significant relationship between the impact of AI and wage growth for occupations with low- or medium-software-prevalence occupations, there is a positive and significant effect for high-software-prevalence occupations. An increase of one standard deviation in the occupation impact score is associated with a 0.61% increase in wage growth for high-software-prevalence occupations (compared to 0.41% for all occupations).
Overall, our findings suggest that the effects of AI on labor are not uniform across occupations, and that access to complementary skills and technologies may play an important role in determining the impact of AI on occupations.
More broadly, and as highlighted in our article, we believe there are many fruitful avenues for scholars to study how these new technologies affect labor and firms. Other avenues include investigations of differences in adoption across organizational forms (e.g., for-profit vs not-for-profit vs government-owned firms), effects of these new technologies on competition between firms, effects of these technologies on inequality within an occupation, firm, or region, and effects of these technologies on the nature of skills required for an occupation.

Services Babylon Offers

Babylon's engineers, doctors, and scientists developed an AI system that can receive data about the symptoms someone is suffering from, compare the information to a database of known conditions and illnesses to find possible matches, and then identify a course of action and related risk factors. People can use the ""Ask Babylon"" feature to inquire about their medical concerns to get an initial understanding of what they might be dealing with, but this service is not intended to replace the expertise of a doctor or be used in a medical emergency.

In pursuit of its mission, Babylon offers a ""talk to a doctor"" service via its app, GP at Hand that provides 24/7 access to healthcare professionals through video or audio conferencing. The app can be downloaded from Google Play or the App Store. At the consultation, doctors can give medical advice, answer questions, discuss treatment, and can order prescriptions that can be delivered to a patient's door. All of the patient's clinical records are stored in a secure environment, and their health history can be accessed and referenced when it's needed. If a patient needs to revisit their appointment, they can review the medical notes and replay a recording of the appointment at any time.

PROMOTED
Another feature that is available on the app is Healthcheck. Built with the support of doctors, scientists and disease experts, this AI tool can take answers from questions about family history and a person's lifestyle and compare it to the medical database to then create a health report and insights to help someone stay healthy.
GP at Hand App's Popularity and Growing Pains
Even Matt Hancock, theUK health secretary, champions the GP at Hand app and more than 51,000 people across London have downloaded it. The app operates through the Hammersmith and Fulham clinical commissioning group, a National Health Service (NHS) body for the area. In fact, the app hasten times more patients registered than the practice it took over from. Since the clinical commissioning group (CCG) is required to pay for the healthcare of all the patients registered on the app—even if they do not live in Hammersmith and Fulham—the popularity of the app has pushed up the costs for the CCG. In addition, the app has been criticized for attracting younger users, leaving traditional practices shouldering the burden of higher costs for caring for an aging population. The GP at Hand app and artificial intelligence technology is expected to ultimately lower overall costs for NHS; however, the current situation of how to handle the app's popularity straining one CCG and to determine how to fit the app into the NHS's financial structure still need to be resolved.
In other examples, it's clear that the GP at Hand app and the AI used to power its recommendations needs to continue to train and get better. Some industry watchdogs have pointed out that the chatbot doctor onGP at Hand misadvised action in a potentially life-threatening situation that required immediate medical attention. More rigorous and independent testing is still necessary before AI can be completely trusted with life or death advice.

The start-up claims that in its own tests, the AI system was spot on80 percent of the time and that the tool was never designed to completely replace the advice of a real doctor, but actually to reduce waiting times and to help doctors make more accurate decisions. The world is facing an extreme shortage of doctors and medical professionals, and tech such as what Babylon offers is one way to help improve the healthcare of millions of people.According to NHS England, ""Each safety case [of Babylon] meets the standards required by NHS and has been completed using a robust assessment methodology to a high standard.""
While it might not be a perfect system, Babylon shows that artificial intelligence has progressed enough to work alongside healthcare professionals and can be a beneficial tool. But, patients still need to remain to be their own fierce healthcare advocates. If the advice received from artificial intelligence doesn't seem to hit the mark, it's good advice to request a second opinion—from a human.

Artificial intelligence, robotics, and the workforce of the future

The spread of advanced automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence is transforming the way manufacturers work. Manufacturers’ Monthly explores how these development are impacting the workforce.




In the manufacturing sector, technological change and transformations in production processes are pointing towards changes in business models. In particular, developments in advanced automation, robotics artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, sensor technology, data analytics, and 3D printing are altering the way in which operations are carried out. That there will be impacts upon the makeup of the workforce is obvious; but the precise nature of the long-term changes to work in the manufacturing sector is debated.
The factors leading to the intensification of industrial automation in recent years, including the growth of AI, are expansions in the capacity for data storage and advances in data analytics, computational power and internet connectivity. Along with these, improvements in transferring digital instructions to the physical world, such as robotics and 3D printing are, according to some experts, on the precipice of transforming the world of work.
According a recent report by Oxford Economics, “How Robots Change the World”, while the ever- faster adoption of robots will lead to greater productivity and economic growth, and create jobs in hitherto non-existent roles and industries, business models across a variety of sectors will be disrupted, with tens of millions of jobs lost as human workers are displaced by machines.


“The number of robots in use worldwide multiplied three-fold over the past two decades, to 2.25 million,” said Oxford Economics’ CEO and chief economist Adrian Cooper. “Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030, with 14 million in China alone. The implications are immense, and the emerging challenges for governments and policymakers are equally daunting their scale.”
In the manufacturing sector alone, the report states, worldwide job losses are set to reach 20 million.


This figure is 8.5 per cent of the global manufacturing workforce. The jobs most at risk are those in low-skill areas and those with lower productivity. According to economic modelling by Oxford Economics, recent improvements in New South Wales’ manufacturing productivity mean that the impact of future robot densification in the state will be more or less muted. South Australia, on the other hand, is much more vulnerable. The state is Australia’s most intensive in terms of manufacturing, but it also has low levels of manufacturing productivity.
Manufacturing is already an intensely automated sector, currently accounting for around 86 per cent of the total global operational stock of robots according to the International Federation of Robotics. The Oxford Economics report suggests that there are three main drivers behind the adoption of robotics in manufacturing: price, innovative applications, and consumer demand. The continued exponential growth in the processing power


of microchips and the increased capacity of networks mean that the per-unit cost of many technological components has been dropping. And, with developments in AI, robots and machines are making more informed decisions from the data that is, in ever greater volumes, gathered and stored across industrial sectors and systems. It is these developments, too, that are helping drive the adoption of robotics and automation across a broader swathe of manufacturing sectors.
In recent years, collaborative robots, or cobots, enabled by AI and cloud technologies, have begun to emerge, bridging the divide between manual assembly performed by skilled human workers and automated production. This has the potential to deeply transform the way work is performed in the manufacturing sector. Speaking earlier this year at AUSPACK 2019 in Melbourne, Universal Robots’ Peter Hern made the case that collaborative robots were, in fact, enabling production to be focussed back towards the human workforce. “When we talk about robots, a lot of people ask, ‘Are we losing our jobs to robots?’ Absolutely not. In fact, what we find is that the human robot collaboration is actually 85 per cent more productive that humans or robots alone,” he said. “It enables companies to reposition their staff, their workers, from dull, dangerous, and mundane roles into more productive roles and higher value roles.”








The Oxford Economics report itself states that it would be “simplistic” to characterise robotisation and the adoption of advanced automation as merely a “destroyer” of jobs. It will instead lead to a “robotics dividend”, characterised by lower prices for manufactures, higher real incomes, and higher tax revenues. A one per cent increase in the stock of robots per worker in the manufacturing sector leads to a 0.1 per cent growth in output per worker.
“This confirms our hypothesis,” the report’s authors state. “[By] displacing automatable jobs in manufacturing, robots free up many workers to contribute productively elsewhere in the economy, as they meet the demands generated by lower prices for manufactured goods.”
A July talk at Deloitte Australia in Sydney on the future of the workforce saw the consulting company’s chief data scientist Gavin Whyte attempting to calm fears, propelled by the media, that the adoption of AI would lead to the disappearance of jobs. “Yes, AI will impact business, permeate industry and affect your roles, but in a good manner,” Whyte said.
According to Whyte, as AI continues to permeate the economy, it will transform the way work is carried out – not by displacing the workforce, but by freeing workers from mundane tasks and activities to carry out higher-order tasks.
Drawing attention to the way the internet has transformed economic activity since 1995, Whyte said that as the adoption of computers and the internet intensified, the cost of search and of digital transfers dropped dramatically. Similarly, as the processing power of computers expands, the cost of what Whyte calls “arithmetic” – algorithmic processing – drops. “And what happens when the cost of an item drops? We use more of it. The cost of search has dropped drastically, so we use more of it – we use Google search for so many of our activities today – and the cost of arithmetic has dropped tremendously, so we use more of it in areas like demand forecasting, and in using computers to record and transfer ever-larger volumes of data.”


Moving more directly on to the topic of AI, Whyte said that the AI the cost of prediction had dropped dramatically in recent years. “It has plummeted to a point where prediction is now cheaper, quicker, faster. And, when something becomes cheaper – like the internet, like arithmetic – we start using more of it for a whole range of purposes,” he said. Prediction is essentially the use of information to generate information that you don’t currently have. If you start applying AI to prediction problems, you get a better outcome with the resulting information, and we can start utilising the power of prediction in areas that have, historically, not been problems of prediction at all.”




And, according to Whyte, that means AI is making our jobs, and our lives, more convenient. “We require convenience. And convenience comes at a cost.” If we use AI to make life and work more convenient, said Whyte, it will impact some roles; but as with every other industrial revolution, where more advanced techniques boosted productivity and opened up new roles in production, the development of AI will open up the potential for new roles along with the means of helping and improving workers in their existing roles.
“The idea pushed in the media today is that ‘AI is going to come and automate your roles and thousands are going to lose their jobs’. But if you really look into the heart of the matter, this is not the case,” he said.
According to Whyte, as the cost of machine prediction drops, enabling more and greater volumes of data to be processed, it also enables better further, better human judgement. “A machine makes predictions. But who is going to use those predictions? Humans. We need to make judgements from them,” he said. Whyte argued that the speed, quality, volume, soundness and accuracy of human judgement would increase as machine prediction is applied to more spheres of work, making AI a complement to human workplace roles. “AI is not going to replace you – AI is going to improve your judgement and improve outcomes.”



Getting on board with the AI revolution, however, will require training that prepares the workforce for jobs of the future. In September last year, the Australian Industry (Ai) Group released a report on its survey of 300 businesses, 75 per cent of which reported skills shortages. Among the most serious gaps were in skills utilising data, automation and AI.
Federal industry, science and technology minister Karen Andrews recently attended G20 meetings in Japan regarding the spread and adoption of AI. Speaking about the meetings, Andrews said that AI was increasingly seen as the “petroleum of the twenty-first century”, with all member countries regarding AI as a critical issue for the future.








“I think it’s fair to say that the impact of AI will make a significant difference to the way we work and the way we live, and it’s important that we make sure that we get the policy settings right,” Andrews said.
The adoption and development of machine learning and AI by industry is being encouraged via the federal government’s Taking Local Businesses Global initiative, $29.9 million will support Australian businesses and workers to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This includes co-funding for Cooperative Research Centre grants for industry-led research.
Andrews said that is important that workers’ fears and concerns that AI adoption will lead to a reduction in job opportunities, or even make them redundant, be taken into account
in the development of policy, which should focus on training people to help them transition to other jobs.


In a submission to the federal government’s Senate Select Committee on the Future of Work and Workers last year, University of Adelaide researchers indicated that over the period of increasing automation, unemployment has not been correlated with the increase, while worker productivity, their corresponding income and the broader gross domestic product has risen sharply over the same period.
“While automation reduces the need for some occupations, it creates the need for new ones, which are often higher paid,” the submission states. “The car industry uses the largest number of industrial robots in the world. But there was little correlation between automation and the change in labour share in the car industry between 2004 and 2014.”
While AI has the potential to increase Australia’s productivity, the submission indicated that, currently, two thirds of Australian organisations are having difficulties in finding suitable staff to lead AI technology integration and 75 per cent of IT decision makers feel that the executive team in their organisation needs formal training on the implications of AI technologies.


The researchers said that Australia is peculiarly well placed to capitalise on the current situation, but, also, that it needs to do so quickly, as other countries are investing heavily in these areas.
“As AI-driven automation lowers the cost of production, Australia could once again become competitive in manufacturing goods that are currently produced cheaply elsewhere because of low wages in other countries,” the submission states. “But we will need to encourage investment in new-generation automation to take advantage of this new trade opportunity, and ensure we have the education, training and research in place to capitalise.”
CSIRO’s data innovation group Data61 is currently leading the development of an AI roadmap and ethics framework on behalf of the federal government.
Chief executive of CSIRO, Dr Larry Marshall, in a presentation last year at the AFR Innovation Summit, said that AI was going to transform the future of work, and that staying ahead in AI investment, research and training would ensure Australia stays at the forefront of job creation in new industries, predicting and preparing for them before they emerge.


“To ensure a long and prosperous future for Australian industries, we need to ensure Australia grows its pipeline of AI-literacy – which is really STEM literacy,” Marshall said.
“I’ve heard people say that coding is all kids will need to know in the future, but I disagree. What is most important is to instil our children with the ability to learn how to learn. That is the beauty of science. It teaches you how to tackle problems and gives you a toolkit to approach any problem.
“The most important thing to remember, in the face of all of the hype, is that for machine learning technology to work well, it needs to ‘learn’, and it is our role to help give this technology real intelligence.”

It’s no surprise that the artificial intelligence talent market is white-hot right now. The business value created by AI will reach $3.9 trillion in 2022, according to Gartner. IDC says worldwide spending on cognitive and artificial intelligence systems will reach $77.6 billion during the same year. And cognitive capabilities are poised to have an impact on nearly every corporate IT function.
AI and machine learning have the potential to create an additional $2.6 trillion in value for marketing and sales by 2020 and as much as $2 trillion in manufacturing and supply chain planning, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.
The number that matters most to IT leaders who increasingly will need AI professionals on their teams, however, is how much they are going to have to pay to bring these scarce, highly skilled individuals into the fold.

We gathered some of the more telling figures related to AI salaries, including which skills are seeing the biggest paydays, the most in-demand roles, shifts in supply and demand dynamics, hot hiring geographies, and the net number of jobs AI may create.
$142,858: Average for highest-paying AI job title of 2019
That’s the average salary for machine learning engineers, the highest-paying AI job title of 2019, according to job-posting site Indeed. That role came in third place last year. The salaries for these AI pros are up 5.8 percent over last year – well above the average 2.9 percent expected by human resources consultancy Mercer. Rounding out the top five highest-paying AI roles were data scientist ($126.927), computer vision engineer ($126,399), data warehouse architect ($126,008), and algorithm engineer ($109,313).
#2 in-demand AI job: Deep learning engineer
Deep learning didn’t even appear on the same list last year. 
Deep learning engineers rank second on Indeed’s list of the top roles in job listings seeking AI or machine learning skills. The headline here is that deep learning didn’t even appear on the same list last year.
These engineers are expert in that subset of machine learning in which algorithms are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. They are in high demand in areas like autonomous driving, advanced robotics, and facial recognition systems. Deep learning could account for $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in annual value, according to McKinsey Global Institute.

The machine learning engineer title came in first, while numbers three through five were senior data scientist, computer vision engineer, and data scientist.
29 percent AI job listing growth
The number of AI jobs listed on Indeed from May 2018 to May 2019 grew 29 percent – still significant growth, but down from the 58 percent increase in the previous 12-month period and 36 percent two years prior. At the same time, Indeed saw a 15 percent decrease in candidate searches for AI roles, suggesting a potential shortage of AI experts for companies looking to hire them. During the previous 12-month period, those candidates searches jumped 32 percent.
New York, San Francisco, Washington D.C., San Jose, Seattle: Top AI job markets
The top metro areas for AI job openings were largely unchanged from Indeed’s 2018 analysis. As Indeed’s blog pointed out, “New York’s top position may surprise you, until you consider that it’s the home of diverse industries, from financial services to publishing — many of which are now adopting AI. Many West Coast-based tech companies (such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google) have a significant presence in the region. And New York has its share of AI-related tech startups, such as AlphaSense, Clarifai, Persado, and x.ai.”
The nation’s capital rose one position, while San Jose came down a notch. Similarly, Seattle was up for sixth, while Boston slipped one ranking down into that spot this year. Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas-Ft. Worth came in seventh, eighth, and ninth. Atlanta, which didn’t even rank last year, came in tenth, knocking Philadelphia off the list.

40 percent say they’re adding jobs due to AI
Forty percent of respondents from Global 2000 organizations say they are adding more jobs as a result of AI adoption, according to a 2019 Dun & Bradstreet report, while only eight percent are cutting jobs because of the new technology. Just eight percent of the 100 business executives surveyed said that their companies were planning to eliminate jobs as a result of implementing AI capabilities. Around one-third (34 percent) reported that there was no change in HR needs as a result of AI.
133 million new jobs created by AI by 2022
That's the number of new jobs that will be created as a result of AI-enabled automation by 2022, according to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 2018 Future of Jobs report. That’s nearly twice as many as the 75 million roles that the WEF research predicts will be displaced.

With a collapsed economy and hyperinflation, ""people don't have enough money to afford a dentist and have to worry about food, education and other things"", she adds.Two years ago she swapped her dental practice for online work as part of the global army of hidden ""microworkers"" - performing tasks that machines alone cannot.Think of a day in your ""digital life"". Whether it's your phone's search engine recommending relevant restaurants or a music app's suggested playlist - none of this would be possible without microworkers.Microworkers like Michelle from Venezuela undertake simple, repetitive tasks online - such as drawing round a face to help train artificial intelligence systems to recognise peopleThey help provide data for machine learning algorithms that are the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) by adding the human element. They might draw bounding boxes around footage of roads to teach driverless cars what a tree, obstacle or a moving person look like, or tag content with feelings so algorithms can learn what a ""sad"" song sounds like or whether a text or word is ""worrying.""This work often gets a bad press as it's seen as poorly paid, but for many it is a solution. Michelle says microworking has been her only way of earning an income: ""I do much better with this than as a dentist.""She tells the BBC of a good day when she earned about $80, which she used to buy the smartphone she now uses to work. Getty ImagesThe 18th Century Mechanical Turk fooled chess players into thinking they were competing against a machineBack in 2005, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos called crowdsourced microwork the ""artificial artificial intelligence"" when he set up the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) the world's first crowdsourcing marketplace. It was named after an 18th Century hoax that fooled chess players into thinking they were competing against a machine, instead of the chess master hiding inside a large wooden box with a dummy on top.Amazon first used it to weed out millions of duplicate pages as computers could not notice subtle differences. But as no one person could do this, they broke it down into small tasks that could be completed by thousands of workers.There are no official numbers for how many microworkers there are, but tens of thousands are estimated to work on Amazon's MTurk every month, with up to 2,500 being active at any given time - mostly in the US and India. An International Labour Organisation (ILO) survey of 3,500 microworkers in 75 countries found the average age was 33 and a third were women, though this dropped to a fifth in developing countries. Microworkers are also educated: fewer than 18% had a high-school diploma or less, 37% had a graduate degree, 20% a postgraduate degree; more than half specialised in science and technology, 23% in engineering and 22% in IT.For those in countries in crisis, microwork can be especially useful.Yahya: ""This allows you to work without having to apply and send a CV""Yahya Ayoub Ahmed is a Syrian who fled the civil war and is now in the Darashakran refugee camp in Erbil, Iraq. In the camp, an organisation called Preemptive Love taught him the English and IT skills allowing him to become a microworker.""You can use it remotely and generate income. Over here applying for a job is quite difficult, it's not like you can just Google a job,"" he says. ""This allows you to work without having to apply and send a CV.""But there is an extra hurdle for workers in countries like Iraq, as tasks are mainly aimed at developed countries, says Allen Ninous of Preemptive Love. ""Most online crowdsourcing services restrict Iraqis from registering, and even if one could magically do so, there's no method of cashing out the wages since all withdrawals take place through a third party online banking system such as PayPal.""So they have to resort to special agreements with firms to overcome this.It is even harder for people who work on their own from home. Venezuelan microworker Rafael Pérez describes a similar situation of being filtered out of many tasks he sees being posted.Microworkers provide data for machine learning used in technology like driverless carsHe has also lost money many times from unscrupulous requesters who didn't pay him: ""Once I earned $180 in 15 days - a lot of money - and they never paid. I emailed, I called - but you don't have anyone to complain to.""Michelle says at the beginning she too fell for scams, but she now puts websites through a test period before working with them. Microwork has come under scrutiny because of poor pay: the ILO found workers earned an average of $4.43 an hour. And while US workers earnt an average of $4.70 (still lower than the minimum wage) workers in Africa got just $1.33 an hour. BBCWhat microworkers earnPer hour of paid and unpaid workUS$4.70Northern AmericaUS$3.00EuropeUS$2.22Asia and the PacificUS$1.33AfricaSource: ILO survey of crowdworkers, 2017And these figures don't take into account workers spending an average of 20 minutes on unpaid activities for every hour of paid work.This includes searching for tasks and answering test questions set by the requester for quality control. ""I spend most of the day looking for tasks. Once one comes in, I have to sit down and do it,"" says Rafael.Rafael says on a good day he can make about $8-10 a day. It means he can buy a small box of eggs, a kilo of cornflour and a kilo of beans. ""You will not live very well, but you will eat well,"" he says.BBCMicrowork is invisible to the many, and has attracted little public attentionPaola TubaroSenior research scientist, Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueProfessor Paola Tubaro of CNRS, France's national scientific research centre, says microworking is not a temporary phenomenon but structural to the development of new technologies like AI.""Even if machines learn, say, how to recognise cats and dogs, you still need to feed them more details to recognise."" As these technologies expand so will the need for people to feed in the data, she says.Currently there is no government regulation of microwork platforms, though the ILO has called for better regulation of the sector to ensure minimum wages and better payments transparency, are met.

If people work under the same conditions as 19th Century factories that's not something that our society would accept as right.""Back in Venezuela, Michelle agrees. She says there should be more ""support and recognition"" for microworkers. She says its the platforms that make the money from their work.

What are the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Answer by Emile Contal, Co-Founder of Crossing Minds, on Quora:
There’s a lot of misinformation about the risks and opportunities surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). It’s a complicated topic, but I’ll try to unpack a few key points here.
PROMOTED
Let’s start with a quick definition: AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. Example of AI systems used regularly in developed countries include Amazon’s Alexa, smart replies in Gmail, Chatbots, predictive searches in Google, and recommendations. At a baseline level, AI helps improve our everyday lives by solving pain points, streamlining processes, and advancing human knowledge.

It’s understandable why many consumers find the idea of AI intimidating or unsettling – science fiction movies have been obsessed with robot takeovers for years and recent movies like I am Mother portray AI as contributing to a post-apocalyptic world. But the concern isn't just from Hollywood writers obsessed with the fantastical, world-renowned minds like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have also rung the AI warning bell.
To be fair, they raise some important points. But instead of getting defensive, AI researchers should consider feedback and ask themselves: just because I can advance a particular technology, should I? This isn’t a knock on AI (we are AI researchers after all)–but rather a question scientists and researchers in every field should ask themselves when advancing technologies with unknown consequences (ping Google, Facebook). This is particularly true for AI more than other technologies because AI takes part in the decision making. It is easy to know who is responsible for pushing the red button sending missiles to an enemy; it is far more complex when the decision was made by an AI. Any system taking decisions based on data will propagate and amplify human biases. Anyone using AI cannot hide behind this fact and act as if data was a source of absolute truth, they need to take full responsibility for the decision made with their system.
We do think is worth keeping an eye on is AI’s impact on wealth inequalities. As with any advanced technology, AI has the power to increase the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, especially if monopolies are formed. Our vision of work is rooted in the fact that we need people to work to keep the society growing. But with technological progress, this is less and less true. Indeed “AI is taking over jobs,” because machines can do things that used to require humans. Many authors in science-fiction foresee a world where no one needs to work anymore, and all the basic needs are provided by fully autonomous systems. This future is sustainable only by deep restructuration of how wealth from autonomous systems is distributed. Researchers and politicians should continue exploring the feasibility of a universal basic income (UBI). Although considered radical by some, the idea behind UBI was first floated in the 1600s by Sir Thomas More and was even considered by President Richard Nixon.
Yes, there are some areas we need to keep an eye on, but remember, we’re still far from achieving what most consumers consider true AI – technology with consciousness. Instead, over the next few years, you’ll see more of the following AI advancements:
Smarter weather predictions and agriculture
Accurately predicting weather can be difficult, and errors have the potential to hurt businesses, disrupt travel, and endanger lives, especially for those who lack transportation or the ability to quickly seek shelter when needed. Thankfully, AI offers solutions by analyzing data and making future predictions. According to the American Meteorological Society, AI is a game-changer for improving real-time decision making with high-impact weather. This will allow us to predict more accurately natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods but even earthquakes and tsunamis. AI is also starting to be used toward more sustainable agriculture. By employing such software to optimize crops yield, we can reduce the space required without having to resort to damaging techniques like pesticides.
Energy optimization
From micro-architectures to heavy industries, the progress of AI had a significant impact in engineering. The challenges we face today are far more complex than they were a few years ago. Both tiny systems like smart devices and huge structures like buildings need to be more and more energy-efficient. These problems cannot be solved by only traditional engineering science. Today AI and data science help crunching numbers to design green buildings or green energy production for instance.
Self-driving cars everywhere
Sure, if you live in Silicon Valley you routinely come across self-driving cars, especially by the Googleplex. But for the majority of U.S. residents, self-driving driving cars not only seem out of reach, they also seem untrustworthy. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, half of U.S. residents believe driverless cars are more dangerous than cars driven by people, and nearly two-thirds of respondents said they would not buy a fully autonomous vehicle. This is a mindset that will quickly change, and there will be a tipping point over the next three to five years. As people interact more with cars that have driverless features (automatic breaks, evasive steering, and pre-safe nudging), there comfort level increase. It’s a matter of when, not if, driverless cars become mainstream and dominate American highways.
AI in healthcare
Recent years have witnessed striking advances in the ability of machines to understand and manipulate images, language, and speech, largely fueled by an explosion of research in a subfield of machine learning known as deep learning. Despite the prodigious amounts of machine-readable data generated in healthcare (150 exabytes or 1018 bytes in US alone growing 48% annually), including medical images, clinical notes, and sensor data, the field has been slow to fully benefit from advances in deep learning because the data are subject to important patient privacy laws and the algorithms are subject to regulatory oversight. As deep learning researchers, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies continue to work together towards making data more accessible, deep learning will enhance the abilities of healthcare providers, resulting in more affordable, accessible, and personalized care.
On-demand language translation
The days of awkward hand pointing are about to be over. Tourists can now depend on sophisticated language translators while traveling internationally. In 2018, Microsoft unveiled neural machine translation (NMT), which provides high-quality translations for both the written word and text that appears in images, such as traffic signs or menus. This advancement will help increase communication, decrease petty misunderstandings, and contribute to a more open and cosmopolitan world where people have a deeper understanding and appreciation for others.

 The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 05 August 2019
 How can artificial intelligence impact the workplace of the future? At the Ayco InnerCircle conference, which brings together practitioners and thought leaders in the human resources industry, Goldman Sachs’ Joe LeRoy of Ayco’s Institutional Business Solutions, spoke with Richard Hughes of UnitedHealth Group, Jeffrey Howell of Panasonic Industrial Devices Sales Company of America and Brian Marcotte of the National Business Group on Health, about the role of AI in their businesses.
 Joe LeRoy: AI is having an outsized impact on companies’ human resources departments. According to PwC, about 63% of companies are rethinking the role of their HR department in light of AI’s impact. Just how pervasive is it?
 Jeffrey Howell: From a standpoint of AI, I think the best word that comes to mind would probably be “inevitability.” It is coming whether we like it or not. In 2019, according to one industry stat, an estimated $30 billion to $40 billion will be spent on AI technology in 2019 – that’s up about 40% from last year.
 Richard Hughes: In its current state, AI would be better described as “augmented” intelligence where human engagement is still needed in order for AI to reach its potential. AI is not currently capable of the creative, imaginative thinking we associate with the human mind. Rather, we see it as a system for ingesting human engagement and driving outcomes based on observations.
 Brian Marcotte: When I think about AI, it’s more of an umbrella term that encompasses machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and other methods to reach smart decisions. It’s behind a lot more of what we do and see. In healthcare, for example, it’s everywhere. AI is being used in back-end administration, wearables and are helping to steer people to the right physicians. It will revolutionize how healthcare is delivered. But having said that, the level of change in health care is far outpacing the localized and fragmented delivery system’s ability to keep up. While there are emerging remedies to integrate these fragmented services, including better data integration and more predictive analytics and actionable messaging to patients, we are in the early stages and they are far from mature solutions.
 Joe LeRoy: Given AI’s ubiquity, can you talk about how it’s affecting your recruiting and people strategies?
 Richard Hughes: AI is already helping our HR professionals at UnitedHealth with employee selection and advancement. We’ve been using AI for more than three years in our recruiting practice to help connect an applicant’s profile with job openings. But we’re seeing more potential in applying AI to understand our own workforce. For example, we’re applying AI algorithms and leveraging the science of our leadership database to identify the characteristics and profiles that make a great leader. This will allow us to identify and groom future potential leaders earlier in their career. We’ve also developed methods for assessing flight risk potential through the data points that trigger turnover, giving us time to introduce proactive solutions to help mitigate attrition.
 Joe LeRoy: Jeff, as head of Panasonic’s industrial sales business, how is AI impacting the business side?
 Jeffrey Howell: The amount of data that we’re getting is permeating every aspect of our business relationships. And data is what’s driving the core of AI by giving us the ability to project, interpret and predict. We’ve been using AI with some of our business partners to obtain more cost transparency and fine-tune our pricing models. We’re also using similar predictive analytics to enhance our ability to introduce new products to the market. Historically, we’ve introduced about 20 new products a year. Next year, we’ll launch 140 new products because of AI.
 Joe LeRoy: And we can’t talk about AI without addressing its ability to replace jobs. How are you viewing the impact of AI on the future workforce?
 Brian Marcotte: In the future, AI will significantly transform many job functions, particularly in the administrative space. Some people are going to lose their jobs in the short term, but over the long term, AI has the potential to create more jobs. We need to reskill and redeploy those people who will be negatively impacted by AI and focus on ways to upskill and develop future workers in the necessary skill sets. 
 Jeffrey Howell: AI is not only automating many of the manual processes, but it’s also reducing operational efficiencies. If you want to look at ways to take advantage of AI, my advice is to put someone in place to take advantage of your data – such as a chief data officer.

A new Turing Test may have the answerAug 2, 2019This article is published in collaboration with The Conversation.How close to perfection are we?Image: REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Carl StrathearnPhD Candidate, , Staffordshire UniversityShare:Our ImpactWhat's the World Economic Forum doing to accelerate action on Fourth Industrial Revolution?The Big PictureExplore and monitor how Fourth Industrial Revolution is affecting economies, industries and global issuesCrowdsource InnovationGet involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at scaleStay up to date:Emerging TechnologiesFollowAlan Turing was recently announced as the face of the new £50 note for his code breaking contributions in World War II and laying the foundations of computer science. However, Turing’s work still challenges and inspires many people working today, especially those in robotics and artificial intelligence.In 1950 he asked, “Can machines think?”, and came up with a test that researchers still turn to as a way of judging whether a computer could be considered truly intelligent in the same way as humans. But, coming from an age where autonomous robots were only just in their infancy, the Turing Test was only designed to assess artificial brains, not a complete artificial person.Now that we have increasingly realistic looking androids, we need a 21st-century version of the test. My colleagues and I have designed a “Multimodal Turing Test” to judge a machine’s appearance, movement, voice and what we call embodied artificial intelligence (EAI). This is a measure of how well artificial intelligence is integrated with a robotic body in order to expresses a personality.This means we can systematically compare a humanoid robot to a living counterpart. In this way, we can ask the question: “Can we build robots that are perceptually indistinguishable from humans?”Not there just yet. Image: Carl Strathearn,Author providedTuring argued that if a computer program could deceive more than 30% of humans into believing it was sentient in real-world conditions, then it is effectively indistinguishable from the human mind – it can think. A computer was able to pass this test in 2014. That doesn’t mean there’s no work to do to create true artificial intelligence. Far from it. But the Turing Test gives us a benchmark to judge our progress.Many scholars think creating a humanoid robot that is indistinguishable from a real human is the ultimate goal of robotics. Yet there’s currently no standard way of evaluating how lifelike androids are, so it’s impossible to benchmark this development.Like Turing, we’re not arguing that a robot transforms into an organic being when it can replicate the conditions of a human. But if a robot appears, behaves and functions in a way that is indistinguishable from a human being in real-world conditions, then it can effectively be thought of as the same as a human.One of the biggest challenges for lifelike robot builders is overcoming what’s known as the “uncanny valley”. This refers to a stage of development when robots become closer in appearance to humans but are actually more offputting to people because they are not quite right. The issue is that conventional methods of assessing the problem aren’t nuanced enough to determine exactly why a robot makes people uncomfortable.The test breaks down the robot building process. Image: Carl Strathearn,Author providedThese approaches tend to compare the robot as a whole with a human, rather than breaking it down into its component features. For example, a slight miscalculation in the movement of the eye of an otherwise realistic looking robot can give the whole game away. High quality features of other facial areas then become part of that failure.Our idea is to evaluate each area step by step. As long as each feature is designed to look like it is part of the same body (same gender, age and so on), then if an eye and mouth can individually pass the test then they should also pass it together. This would allow a robot builder to assess progress as they go to ensure each body part is indistinguishable from a that of human and to prevent ending up with something that falls into the uncanny valley.Have you read?Robotic health care is coming to a hospital near youThis robotic Icelandic farm has made its cows much happier - with dramatic resultsThis is what the ancient Greeks had to say about robotics and AIOur test is also organised into four stages, each more difficult than the last, representing what we call the “hierarchy of human emulation”. First, the robot has to simply look real when still. Second, it has to move in a naturally looking way. Third, it has to produce a realistic simulation of physical speech in both appearance and the way it moves.Finally comes the test of embodied artificial intelligence, assessing whether the robot can respond to the world by realistically expressing emotions so it can interact naturally with humans. If a humanoid robot can simultaneously pass all four levels of the test, then it is perceptually indistinguishable from humans.Passing for human? Image: Carl Strathearn,Author provided“We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done”. This statement is as accurate today as the day Turing said it in 1950. However, robotic engineers are closer than ever before to achieving their goal of a realistic humanlike machine, and 2017 witnessed the inauguration of the world’s first robotic citizen.Today, we have the tools to develop humanoid robots with increasingly lifelike appearance, movement, speech and EAI. But our Multimodal Turing Test gives engineers an accessible way to evaluate and so improve their work.As with Turing’s original test, our approach raises questions about what it will mean to be a person when we can no longer tell the difference between a real human and an artificial one. Trying to answer these questions too soon because we want to advance quicker than we actually are can lead to mistakes such as giving legal rights to a machine that is nowhere near lifelike. But the more we develop humanoid robots, the more we learn about our values and even our emotions.Don't miss any update on Emerging TechnologiesSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Fourth Industrial RevolutionEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is already in use in many sectors. Its contribution is expected to rise steadily, driven by advances in data storage, computer processing power and connectivity. 
Following last week’s report on AI by the Australian Council of Learned Academies (ACOLA), the Royal Society of New Zealand Te Apārangi today launches a report that focuses on the opportunities and risks the “fourth industrial revolution” might bring to Aotearoa New Zealand.  
AI, in all its applications, is predicted to contribute some US$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This represents roughly the combined GDP of China and India in 2018. 
Australia and New Zealand are yet to develop national AI strategies. The reports look 20 years ahead, which is a useful period for policy development. The explicit focus on well-being provides a helpful frame to start national conversations about how to embrace these new technologies, leading rather than passively accepting advances from offshore.

AI in New Zealand
New Zealand has started to adopt AI in the government sector, with most government agencies employing some form of it. There are advantages in New Zealand’s small size and strong legal frameworks to develop protocols for data ethics and security, and intellectual property, and to nurture a diverse AI-savvy workforce. 
Placing equity at the centre of the conversation means that we can choose to adopt AI technologies across education, government and industry in the context of public good. This would mitigate the risk of importing biases from offshore algorithms and allow us to identify areas where AI can benefit all New Zealanders, rather than a small international elite. 
Within the reports’ 20-year horizon, specialist machine learning and narrow AI (a specific type of AI that outperforms humans in a very narrowly defined task) will help us to start removing the “four Ds” – dirty, dull, difficult, dangerous – from our daily work. Instead, we will be able to use machines to free people up to use their originality, creativity and questioning abilities. 
It is unlikely that machines will challenge these skills in this time frame. Artificial general intelligence, which could compete with these more human forms of cognition, is likely many decades away. By focusing on this nearer-term future, the ACOLA report makes concrete recommendations on strategic investment, regulatory mechanisms, equity and respect for intrinsic human rights, while calling for a national strategy to bring these approaches together. 
What AI could do for New Zealand
A recent New Zealand government report signalled that AI-driven automation and optimisation could result in economic gains in productivity. Think drones applying herbicides in an orchard, identifying weeds through AI-driven vision recognition systems, then feeding the data into a central system. This could mean less herbicide use, better farm productivity and environmental outcomes, and fewer people operating herbicide sprayers (at least in the way they do currently). 
But the predicted gains in productivity are not without risks. Estimates of the proportion of jobs likely to be automated by AI vary wildly. So do estimates of the degree to which those will be replaced by new jobs. Some of these new jobs are currently difficult to imagine. Consider someone preparing for a career as a social media manager back in 2000, four years before Facebook was founded. 
Foresight will be key to building a resilient and adaptable workforce. Key skills in STEM subjects (especially maths), coupled with strong foundations in the humanities, will be important. AI experts agree that, as AI technologies are implemented at scale, the key concern is the rate at which they may disrupt work and drive inequalities in income and employment opportunities. 
Even if the former orchard sprayer is able to find another job, they are unlikely to get a direct financial payoff in the same way that the owners of the farm will. Multiplied thousands of different ways across New Zealand’s economy, these AI-driven changes threaten to widen inequities. Research related to this issue, for example at the Centre for AI and Public Policy (CAIPP), will need to feed into policy.

Other risks of AI
Economic effects are just one part of the story. The reports raise several issues, including lethal autonomous weapons, threats to democratic decision making and the disturbing gender imbalance in the rapidly growing AI workforce. The discussions fit into a wider body of recent work on AI relevant to New Zealand. This includes an analysis of the government’s use of predictive systems, establishment of the OECD principles on AI and a report on the state of the industry in New Zealand. This work identifies an urgent need for clear principles for the use of AI and state regulation for socially accepted use and standards. 
The ACOLA report discusses many aspects of AI relevant to our responsibilities under the Treaty of Waitangi. AI technologies need to be developed to augment critical thinking and social and emotional skills at all levels, and in a culturally inclusive context. An important implication, consistent with the government’s focus on well-being, is the need to closely monitor societal impacts.

The report also identifies where New Zealand could contribute to the global conversation, including in indigenous data sovereignty. Groups such as Te Mana Raraunga and Te Hiku Media actively explore how tikanga (Māori customary system of values and practices) should be applied to these emerging technologies. 
As the ACOLA report notes:

An AI strategy that places equity at its forefront will strengthen Aotearoa New Zealand’s international reputation in this arena and ensure that Aotearoa New Zealand is not left behind by some of the most important developments of the 21st century.

Overall, we see enormous potential for transformative opportunities, from intelligent tutoring systems in education through to precision agriculture. These could improve well-being across all sectors of society, government, agriculture and industry. 
Realising this potential will require addressing the substantial challenges inherent in ensuring a fair and equitable transition into an AI-enabled future, making sure that benefits also reach those at risk of being excluded.

Every minute, creators upload 300 hours of video to the platform. With this number of users, activity, and content, it makes sense for YouTube to take advantage of the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to help operations. Here are a few ways YouTube, owned by Google, uses artificial intelligence today. 
The Amazing Ways YouTube Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine LearningAdobe Stock

Automatically remove objectionable content 

In the first quarter of this year, 8.3 million videos were removed from YouTube, and 76% were automatically identified and flagged by artificial intelligence classifiers. More than 70% of these were identified before there were any views by users. While the algorithms are not foolproof, they are combing through content much more quickly than if humans were trying to monitor the platform singlehandedly. In some cases, the algorithm pulled down newsworthy videos mistakenly seeing them as “violent extremism.” This is just one of the reasons Google has full-time human specialists employed to work with AI to address violative content. 

In fact, according to Cecile Frot-Coutaz, head of EMEA, YouTube’s “number one priority” is to protect its users from harmful content. In pursuit of that, the company invested in not only human specialists but the machine learning technology to support the effort. AI has contributed greatly to YouTube's ability to quickly identify objectionable content. Before using artificial intelligence, only 8% of videos containing ""violent extremism"" (banned on the platform) were flagged and removed before ten views had occurred; but after machine learning was used, more than half of the videos removed had fewer than ten views. 

PROMOTED
One of the main drivers for YouTube's diligence in removing objectionable content is the pressure from brands, agencies, and governments and the backlash that's experienced if ads appear alongside offensive videos. When ads started appearing next to YouTube videos supporting racism and terrorism, Havas UK and other brands began pulling their advertising dollars. In response, YouTube deployed advanced machine learning and partnered with third-party companies to help provide transparency to advertising partners. 
The company also has a “trashy video classifier” in use which scans YouTube’s homepage and “watch next” panels. It looks at the feedback from viewers who might report a misleading title, inappropriate or other objectionable content.

New effects on videos 
Move over Snapchat, Google’s artificial intelligence researchers trained a neural network to be able to swap out backgrounds on videos without the need for specialized equipment. While it's been possible to do this for decades—think green screens that are replaced by digital effects—it was a complicated and time-consuming process. The researchers trained an algorithm with carefully labeled imagery that allowed the algorithm to learn patterns, and the result is a fast system that can keep up with video.

“Up Next” feature 
If you have ever used YouTube’s “Up Next” feature, you benefited from the platform’s artificial intelligence. Since the dataset on YouTube is constantly changing as its users upload hours of video every minute, the AI required to power its recommendation engine needed to be different than the recommendation engines of Netflix or Spotify. It had to be able to handle real-time recommendations while new data is constantly added by users. The solution they came up with is a two-part system. The first is candidate generation, where the algorithm assesses the YouTube history of the user. The second part is the ranking system that assigns a score to each video.

Guillaume Chaslot, a former Google employee and founder of an initiative urging greater transparency known as AlgoTransparency, explained that the metric used by YouTube’s algorithm to determine a successful recommendation is watch time. This is good for the platform and the advertisers, but not so good for the users, he said. This situation could amplify videos that have outlandish content, and the more people spend time watching it, the more it gets recommended.  
Training on depth prediction 
With so much data, YouTube videos provide a fertile training ground for artificial intelligence algorithms. Google AI researchers used more than 2,000 ""mannequin challenge"" videos posted on the platform to create an AI model with the ability to discern the depth of field in videos. The ""mannequin challenge"" had groups of people in a video stand still as if frozen while one person goes through the scene shooting the video. Ultimately, this skill of depth prediction could help propel the development of augmented reality experiences. 
With the continuing crisis of mass shootings plaguing America, President Trump requested that social media companies, ""develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike."" With the assistance of artificial intelligence, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook already work to delete terrorist content, but what's new in the President's request is that they work with the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies. There are many questions about how such a partnership would work, if social media channels could detect actual terrorists before they act and the potential to impact the civil liberties of innocent people. Whether YouTube and other social media companies could use artificial intelligence to stop terrorists while not infringing on the rights of others remains to be seen.

The following are a few hypotheses as to why Artificial Intelligence projects fail and some observations on company reactions (technical and organizational) to AI projects lack of delivered value. Please note these opinions do not reflect on any current or prior employers, but are a synthesis of conversations with data scientists, engineers, product managers and architects across industries.Hypothesis #1: Data Science initial models don’t scale or are too experimental to be used by internal or external customers.Projects often start here as companies hire on a few data scientists who build their models in Python or R, only to discover quickly that there is a difference in mindset between data scientists and engineers. In the short run this problem is often solved by having machine learning engineers or other software engineers take the code, rewrite it and follow standard dev-ops processes in order to scale and deploy the application. Given the stochastic nature of results, Quality Engineering also needs to scale to the task. During this transition period, business users (and/or their proxy product managers) can be left out of the process and the requirements or underlying data may change.Organizationally, some companies take the next step of hiring engineers into the data science group to help the data scientists learn more about scaling for production and deployments. The goal with this approach is to alleviate the handoff process. The challenges are that this research/engineering organization can become siloed away from the rest of the production support workflow. “Data Scientists don’t wear pagers on call”.Hypothesis #2: Data science/ML models while brilliant and innovative don’t meet the business requirements or are too fragile to respond to change in the supporting data.At the recommendation of consulting groups, some companies make the decision that in order to foster innovation, “innovation teams” need to be isolated from the “non-digital” cultures which surround them. But while isolated innovation teams can lead to great opportunities for experimentation and those teams can learn and develop interesting solutions, when the resultant projects then need to be “pushed” to the market or internal customers, there is often minimal adoption. While the solution may meet the specific challenge, the experience for the user is often less than optimal. Lack of a less complex model to fall back upon if the data changes can also present a challenge. On the upside, the research can be published in academic journals read by other data scientists to further overall industry knowledge.In response to this non-adoption problem, some innovation/data science teams may add product marketers to their organization to “promote” their work internally and to try to market their concepts to customers directly.Hypothesis #3: AI initiatives are driven by the company’s internal IT organizations and inherit “waterfall” challenges.As part of a “digital transformation”, some companies see AI as part of an overall data warehouse initiative or as part of an automation effort for customer management or marketing applications. The need for “labelled” (appropriately tagged) data in AI or Machine Learning means that companies will also need to have a fairly mature analytics and data capture infrastructure in place. While it may seem rational to approach AI and Machine Learning as part of an overall IT data project, without an accompanying experimental/prototyping initiative, AI projects can be buried as a consequence. Ironically, when the data is finally ready in the data pipelines, the customer needs may have changed completely (ex: optimizing around CD distribution while the company strategy moves to streaming).Hypothesis #4: Companies don’t have the patience for the time it takes to deliver on AI/ML projects.Given the uncertainty of success and timelines for many proposed AI/ML projects, they may die before they even have a chance to begin. Add to this the newness of the technology and the head-start dominance of Google, Amazon and Microsoft and the result is that non-direct consumer-oriented enterprise companies may talk AI, but start with Business Process Automation tools as their first foray and wait for things to settle (capturing data along the way for the future).Hypothesis #5: A lack of a “Product” approach to AI/ML projects is core to project failure and increased risk.The role of Product Manager/Owner in Agile software development is clear in software development. Product Managers work as part of a team including UX, Engineering, QA and Project Management. What seems to be missing in AI projects is this same “Product” mindset. Good Product Managers understand how to ask or find the highest value business questions. Experienced Product Managers are experts at managing the uncertainty of product delivery. Seasoned Analytics Product Managers understand where the data is missing or buried. So, the question of the day may not be “Where are all the data scientists we need?”, but rather “Where are all the AI Product Managers who know how to ask the right questions?”Summary:Fundamentally AI/ML projects will not succeed unless the same “Agile” “Lean” Product approach is taken up by technically savvy product managers to meet the challenges of risk, territory battles and failure to solve or answer the business questions. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers need to be integral to product development teams. Much as “Design Thinking” brought UX on board to software development teams, so “AI thinking” needs to integrate AI research into product development. AI product managers need business executive support to guide the business value evaluation process and to balance technology/data science agendas.While the shake-up continues in AI Cloud Platforms and while tooling is changing rapidly, companies who step up and train or hire AI Product Managers with the requisite technical or data skills and challenge them to find a business question to answer with a team of UX Designers, Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, Software Engineers, coordinated by a project manager who understands and can communicate uncertainty rationally will be a long ways down the road to leverage AI to success.Companies who already have tagged data streams like those in e-commerce and finance/payments have a head start and provide good models for others on how to scale, but it will be by asking the right questions and leveraging and scaling ML/NLP/AI to get the right answers that some of them will lead the pack over the next decades.",2019-08-23T11:10:42.223Z,,,,,,,,,,,,Five Hypotheses as to why Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects fail,['Alison Doucette'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7c6b2c456d41,,,,

New technology in the form of artificial intelligence guides employees during stressful customer... [+] interactions empowering them and helping with their performance.

Organizations are beginning to grasp the severity of burnout and the impact it has on your life and health in the long term. Work can be stressful, and due to many factors including a combination of hours, tasks, measurement and intensity, some jobs result in mental, physical and emotional exhaustion. If stress accumulates to a breaking point, you reach overload, fatigue and ultimately burnout.

Job Burnout On The Rise
A survey reported this month by Skye Learning found that a majority of American workers report job burnout. Gallup studied nearly 7,500 full-time employees and found that 23% reported feeling burned out at work very often or always, while an additional 44% reported feeling burned out sometimes. Recently the World Health Organization officially recognized “employee burnout” as a medical condition. Burnout costs organizations in the form of high employee turnover, increased medical and insurance costs and drops in productivity. It can be even more dangerous for you, the employee, because it puts your well-being and mental health at risk.
Your Decision-Fatigued Brain 
When you make decisions after working days on end, chances are they’ll be different from the ones you’d make after your brain has a rest period. Why? Scientists have discovered a phenomenon known as decision fatigue—which is what happens when your brain is worn out, depleted of mental energy. Decision fatigue is why many wage earners have little mental energy left over for activities outside of work. After hours of nonstop working, your brain can suffer from cognitive overload, compassion fatigue and burnout. The longer you work and the more choices you make in those extended work hours, the more difficult it is for your strained mind to make sound decisions. It becomes hard to make even ordinary choices, such as what to wear, where to eat, how much to spend or how to prioritize work projects. So you start to take short cuts, permitting your newly licensed teenager to drive the car on an icy night or opting out of responsibilities and decision making at work. You’re short with coworkers and loved ones; you eat junk food instead of healthy meals; you tell your spouse to pick the restaurant for dinner.
PROMOTED
Artificial Intelligence And Burnout Prevention
To prevent decision fatigue and burnout, your brain needs restorative rest just like your body does when you’re tired. You can change bad habits and prevent stress accumulation and burnout by engaging in certain activities such as brisk exercise, relaxing in nature, power napping and in practices such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, prayer, meditation, laughing, yoga, massage and tai chi. While these tools never go out of style, some of the world’s top companies such as MetLife and Humana are employing innovative new technology to offset burnout by enhancing employee engagement, improving customer experience and providing a more emotionally intelligent and empathetic workplace.
Dr. Skyler Place, Chief Behavioral Science Officer and Head of People at Cogito, told me, “One significant working population that is highly susceptible to burn out is call center workers, of which there are an estimated five million in the U.S. alone. Their working environment leads them to feel a lack of support and control. They are caught between customers who are often frustrated and management who is under pressure to achieve corporate goals. Performing repetitive tasks and carrying the burden of emotionally tense situations is extremely draining, even for the most seasoned professional. In the call center specifically burnout and churn are on the rise, and many organizations can experience churn of greater than 50%, according to the 2018 Contact Babel Decision Maker’s Guide.”
According to Dr. Place, some organizations are looking at new technological advancements that can help alleviate cognitive overload, compassion fatigue and employee burnout: “One such technology comes from Cogito, which leverages a foundation of behavioral science in combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to guide employees, especially during stressful customer interactions, empowering them and helping them perform better. One large insurance company has stated how employee churn has decreased by 10% amongst agents as a result of Cogito’s in-call communication guidance, more objective feedback from supervisors and better customer rapport. Cogito is unique in its application, where traditionally technology was deployed exclusively to provide insights to management and ignored the emotional state of the employee. Cogito is designed to recognize the behavioral dynamics of each individual and deliver in-the-moment coaching that helps them professionally manage a given situation. Cogito applies AI to augment an employee’s—and specifically call center agent’s—natural abilities, giving them the assistance they need to better help emotional customers and meet their performance goals.”
Cogito’s AI coach analyzes human behavior through voice and provides in-the-moment feedback during conversations. The software provides nudges to call-center agents via the display of in-the-moment cues—for example a coffee cup when energy is low or a heart when a customer’s emotional state changes, indicating a need for empathy. It guides agents during conversations to be more emotionally intelligent, which takes some of the cognitive burden off of them and helps better control conversations. It also helps them lead customers through challenging situations without taking on the emotional burden. The nudges Cogito applies lead to positive behavior change that helps the agent and the customer while driving operational value for the organization.
Dr. Place concludes that this win-win dynamic comes from applying behavioral science in a way that can reduce burnout while increasing value to the corporation, “This is the true calling for AI—augmenting humans in ways that increase their quality of life, providing in-the-moment and on-the-job training and allowing their organizations to be competitive in the market.”

            The robots. They’re coming for your jobs. All of you.
    

            Long the prediction of futurists and philosophers, the lived reality of technology replacing human work has been a constant feature since the cotton gin, the assembly line and, more recently, the computer.
    

            What is very much up for debate in the imaginations of economists and Hollywood producers is whether the future will look like “The Terminator,” with self-aware Schwarzenegger bots on the hunt, or “The Jetsons,” with obedient robo-maids leaving us humans very little work and plenty of time for leisure and family. The most chilling future in film may be that in Disney’s “Wall-E,” where people are all too fat to stand, too busy staring at screens to talk to each other and too distracted to realize that the machines have taken over.
    

            We’re deep into what-ifs with those representations, but the conversation about robots and work is increasingly paired with the debate over how to address growing income inequality – a key issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.
    

        The workplace is changing. How should Americans deal with it?


            “There’s no simple answer,” said Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley, an adjunct professor of neurological surgery at UC San Francisco and the author of a forthcoming book, “Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control.” “But in the long run nearly all current jobs will go away, so we need fairly radical policy changes to prepare for a very different future economy. “
    

            In his book, Russell writes, “One rapidly emerging picture is that of an economy where far fewer people work because work is unnecessary.”

            That’s either a very frightening or a tantalizing prospect, depending very much on whether and how much you (and/or society) think people ought to have to work and how society is going to put a price on human labor. 
    

            There will be less work in manufacturing, less work in call centers, less work driving trucks, and more work in health care and home care and construction.
    

            MIT Technology Review tried to track all the different reports on the effect that automation will have on the workforce. There are a lot of them. And they suggest anywhere from moderate displacement to a total workforce overhaul with varying degrees of alarm. 
    

            One of the reports, by the McKinsey Global Institute, includes a review of how susceptible to automation different jobs might be and finds that hundreds of millions of people worldwide will have to find new jobs or learn new skills. Learning new skills can be more difficult than it sounds, as CNN has found at car plants, such as the one that closed in Lordstown, Ohio.

        More robots means more inequality


            Almost everyone who has thought seriously about this has said that more automation is likely to lead to more inequality.

            It is indisputable that businesses have gotten more and more productive but workers’ wages have not kept pace.

            “Our analysis shows that most job growth in the United States and other advanced economies will be in occupations currently at the high end of the wage distribution,” according to McKinsey. “Some occupations that are currently low wage, such as nursing assistants and teaching assistants, will also increase, while a wide range of middle-income occupations will have the largest employment declines.”
    

            “The likely challenge for the future lies in coping with rising inequality and ensuring sufficient (re-)training especially for low qualified workers,” according to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
    

            One Democratic presidential candidate – Andrew Yang, the insurgent nonpolitician – has built his campaign around solving this problem. Yang blames the automation of jobs more than outsourcing to China for the decline of American manufacturing and draws a direct line between that shrinking manufacturing sector and the rise of Donald Trump.
    

            “We need to wake people up,” Yang recently told The Atlantic. “This is the reality of why Donald Trump is our President today, because we already blasted away millions of American jobs and people feel like they have lost a path forward.”
    

        If automation takes the jobs, should all people get a government paycheck? 


            Yang’s answer to the problem is to give everyone in the US, regardless of need, an income – he calls it a “freedom dividend” – of $1,000 per month. It would address inequality, both economic and racial, he argues, and let people pursue work that adds value to the community.
    

            It’s not a new idea. Congress and President Richard Nixon nearly passed just such a proposal in the early 1970s as part of the war on poverty. But now, after decades of the GOP distancing itself from social programs, the idea of a universal basic income seems about as sci-fi as the new “Terminator” movie (yes, they’re making another one) that’s coming out this year.

            “Ninety-four percent of the new jobs created in the US are gig, temporary or contractor jobs at this point, and we still just pretend it’s the ’70s, where it’s like, ‘You’re going to work for a company, you’re going to get benefits, you’re going to be able to retire, even though we’ve totally eviscerated any retirement benefits, but somehow you’re going to retire, it’s going to work out,’ ” Yang said in that Atlantic interview. “Young people look up at this and be like, ‘This does not seem to work.’ And we’re like, ‘Oh, it’s all right.’ It’s not all right. We do have to grow up.”
    

            He specifically points to truck driving as a profession that is key to the US economy today but could and may be fully automated in the very near future. Automating trucking will help the environment, save money and help productivity, he says. But it won’t help truck drivers.
    

            On the other hand, truck driving, while honorable work, might not be many people’s life’s ambition. In this way, robots would be taking jobs that humans might not want unless they had to do them, which they currently do. 
    

            “When you accept these circumstances, that we’re going to be competing against technologies that have a marginal cost of near zero, then quickly you have to say OK, then, how are we going to start valuing our time? What does a 21st century economy look like in a way that serves our interests and not the capital efficiency machine?” he says. And that’s how he, and a lot of liberal economists and capitalists like Elon Musk, arrive at the idea of a basic income.
    

            Yang argued at a CNN town hall this year that it’s not enough for people to organize as workers in unions to protect jobs.
    

            “I don’t think we have the time to remake the workforce in that way,” he said. “We should start distributing value directly to Americans.”
    

            Creating a population that can subsist on a basic income, without work, would end up reshaping how society works altogether.
    

            “For some, UBI represents a version of paradise. For others, it represents an admission of failure – an assertion that most people will have nothing of economic value to contribute to society,” writes Russell. “They can be fed and housed – mostly by machines – but otherwise left to their own devices.”
    

            Yang is focused more on the immediate threat he says automation poses to American jobs. And politicians aren’t talking about it honestly because they are too focused on being optimistic.
    

            “You’re a politician, your incentives are to say we can do this, we can do that, we can do the other thing and then meanwhile society falls apart.”
    

        What to do with our time?


            Not everyone thinks society would fall apart, and there’s actually been a lot of serious concern about what people will do when productivity increases to a point where they don’t have to work as much.
    

            In an important paper in 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that humans would have to grapple with their leisure in the generations to come.
    

            “To those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed-for sweet – until they get it,” he wrote, later adding that “man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”
    

            Rather than grappling with the problem of leisure, automation can often lead to unforeseen problems. The cotton gin made it so slaves in the American South did not have to remove seeds from cotton, but it also led to an explosion of slavery as cotton became more easily produced.
    

            And while it makes life easier on individual workers, managing the transition from one type of economy to the next (farmer to manufacturer, to information specialist and now beyond) has been a key long-term reality for the American worker.
    

        Is the pace of change different this time?


            No one has thought more about this than labor unions. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler agrees with Yang that automation is one of the biggest challenges we’re facing as a country and it’s not getting the attention it deserves. But she’s not yet worried about dystopia.
    

            “The scare tactics are a little extreme,” she said in an interview, arguing that reports of tens of millions of American jobs lost by 2030 are probably overstated.
    

            “Every time a technological shift has taken place in this country there have been those doomsday scenarios,” she said in an interview. 
    

            It was already an issue in the 1950s, Shuler pointed out. “You have (then-United Auto Workers President) Walter Reuther testifying before Congress talking about how automation was going to change work and people were making these wild predictions that if you brought robots into auto plants that there would be massive unemployment,” she said. 
    

            Reuther’s testimony is really interesting to read, by the way. Check it out. “The revolutionary change produced by automation is its tendency to displace the worker entirely from the direct operation of the machine,” he said. He argued that unions weren’t opposed to automation but that they wanted more help from companies and from the government for workers dealing with a changing workplace. 
    

            “What ended up happening is what they call bargained acquiescence,” said Shuler, “where the unions went to the table and said ‘OK, we get it, this technology is coming, but how are we going to manage the change? How are we going to have a worker voice at the table? How are we going to make sure that working people benefit from this and the company is able to be more efficient and successful?’ “
    

            Yang counters that argument by noting that automation has sped up, making it harder for workers, employers and the government to adjust. “Unlike with previous waves of automation, this time new jobs will not appear quickly enough in large enough numbers to make up for it,” he said on his website.
    

        Somewhere in the middle is where we’ll end up


            Shuler said American workers need to have the conversation about the future of work more urgently today.
    

            “We all have a choice to make,” she said. “Do we want technology to benefit working people, and our country, as a result, does better? Or do we want to follow a path of this dark, dystopian view that work is going to go away and people are going to have nothing to do and we’re just going to be essentially working at the whims of a bunch of robots?” 
    

            Somewhere in the middle, she argued, is where we’ll end up. 
    

            “We’re going to work alongside technology as it evolves. New work is going to emerge. We want to make sure working people can transition fairly and justly and responsibly and we can only do that if working people have a seat at the table.”
    

        The long-term future


            Shuler has an interest in workers and their rights today, but Russell writes that long-term, as automation of work becomes more tangible, the country will have to change its entire outlook on work and what we teach children and people to strive for. 
    

            “We need a radical rethinking of our educational system and our scientific enterprise to focus more attention on the human rather than the physical world,” he writes. “It sounds odd to say that happiness should be an engineering discipline, but that seems to be the inevitable conclusion. “
    

            In other words: We will have to figure out how to be happy with the robots and the automation, because they are coming.

They’re coming for your jobs. All of you. Long the prediction of futurists and philosophers, the lived reality of technology replacing human work has been a constant feature since the cotton gin, the assembly line and, more recently, the computer. What is very much up for debate in the imaginations of economists and Hollywood producers is whether the future will look like “The Terminator,” with self-aware Schwarzenegger bots on the hunt, or “The Jetsons,” with obedient robo-maids leaving us humans very little work and plenty of time for leisure and family. The most chilling future in film may be that in Disney’s “Wall-E,” where people are all too fat to stand, too busy staring at screens to talk to each other and too distracted to realize that the machines have taken over. We’re deep into what-ifs with those representations, but the conversation about robots and work is increasingly paired with the debate over how to address growing income inequality – a key issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. The workplace is changing. How should Americans deal with it? “There’s no simple answer,” said Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley, an adjunct professor of neurological surgery at UC San Francisco and the author of a forthcoming book, “Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control.” “But in the long run nearly all current jobs will go away, so we need fairly radical policy changes to prepare for a very different future economy. “ In his book, Russell writes, “One rapidly emerging picture is that of an economy where far fewer people work because work is unnecessary.” That’s either a very frightening or a tantalizing prospect, depending very much on whether and how much you (and/or society) think people ought to have to work and how society is going to put a price on human labor.  There will be less work in manufacturing, less work in call centers, less work driving trucks, and more work in health care and home care and construction. MIT Technology Review tried to track all the different reports on the effect that automation will have on the workforce. There are a lot of them. And they suggest anywhere from moderate displacement to a total workforce overhaul with varying degrees of alarm.  One of the reports, by the McKinsey Global Institute, includes a review of how susceptible to automation different jobs might be and finds that hundreds of millions of people worldwide will have to find new jobs or learn new skills. Learning new skills can be more difficult than it sounds, as CNN has found at car plants, such as the one that closed in Lordstown, Ohio.  More robots means more inequality Almost everyone who has thought seriously about this has said that more automation is likely to lead to more inequality.  It is indisputable that businesses have gotten more and more productive but workers’ wages have not kept pace. “Our analysis shows that most job growth in the United States and other advanced economies will be in occupations currently at the high end of the wage distribution,” according to McKinsey. “Some occupations that are currently low wage, such as nursing assistants and teaching assistants, will also increase, while a wide range of middle-income occupations will have the largest employment declines.” “The likely challenge for the future lies in coping with rising inequality and ensuring sufficient (re-)training especially for low qualified workers,” according to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. One Democratic presidential candidate – Andrew Yang, the insurgent nonpolitician – has built his campaign around solving this problem. Yang blames the automation of jobs more than outsourcing to China for the decline of American manufacturing and draws a direct line between that shrinking manufacturing sector and the rise of Donald Trump. “We need to wake people up,” Yang recently told The Atlantic. “This is the reality of why Donald Trump is our President today, because we already blasted away millions of American jobs and people feel like they have lost a path forward.” If automation takes the jobs, should all people get a government paycheck?  Yang’s answer to the problem is to give everyone in the US, regardless of need, an income – he calls it a “freedom dividend” – of $1,000 per month. It would address inequality, both economic and racial, he argues, and let people pursue work that adds value to the community. It’s not a new idea. Congress and President Richard Nixon nearly passed just such a proposal in the early 1970s as part of the war on poverty. But now, after decades of the GOP distancing itself from social programs, the idea of a universal basic income seems about as sci-fi as the new “Terminator” movie (yes, they’re making another one) that’s coming out this year. “Ninety-four percent of the new jobs created in the US are gig, temporary or contractor jobs at this point, and we still just pretend it’s the ’70s, where it’s like, ‘You’re going to work for a company, you’re going to get benefits, you’re going to be able to retire, even though we’ve totally eviscerated any retirement benefits, but somehow you’re going to retire, it’s going to work out,’ ” Yang said in that Atlantic interview. “Young people look up at this and be like, ‘This does not seem to work.’ And we’re like, ‘Oh, it’s all right.’ It’s not all right. We do have to grow up.” He specifically points to truck driving as a profession that is key to the US economy today but could and may be fully automated in the very near future. Automating trucking will help the environment, save money and help productivity, he says. But it won’t help truck drivers. On the other hand, truck driving, while honorable work, might not be many people’s life’s ambition. In this way, robots would be taking jobs that humans might not want unless they had to do them, which they currently do.  “When you accept these circumstances, that we’re going to be competing against technologies that have a marginal cost of near zero, then quickly you have to say OK, then, how are we going to start valuing our time? What does a 21st century economy look like in a way that serves our interests and not the capital efficiency machine?” he says. And that’s how he, and a lot of liberal economists and capitalists like Elon Musk, arrive at the idea of a basic income. Yang argued at a CNN town hall this year that it’s not enough for people to organize as workers in unions to protect jobs. “I don’t think we have the time to remake the workforce in that way,” he said. “We should start distributing value directly to Americans.” Creating a population that can subsist on a basic income, without work, would end up reshaping how society works altogether. “For some, UBI represents a version of paradise. For others, it represents an admission of failure – an assertion that most people will have nothing of economic value to contribute to society,” writes Russell. “They can be fed and housed – mostly by machines – but otherwise left to their own devices.” Yang is focused more on the immediate threat he says automation poses to American jobs. And politicians aren’t talking about it honestly because they are too focused on being optimistic. “You’re a politician, your incentives are to say we can do this, we can do that, we can do the other thing and then meanwhile society falls apart.” What to do with our time? Not everyone thinks society would fall apart, and there’s actually been a lot of serious concern about what people will do when productivity increases to a point where they don’t have to work as much. In an important paper in 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that humans would have to grapple with their leisure in the generations to come. “To those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed-for sweet – until they get it,” he wrote, later adding that “man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.” Rather than grappling with the problem of leisure, automation can often lead to unforeseen problems. The cotton gin made it so slaves in the American South did not have to remove seeds from cotton, but it also led to an explosion of slavery as cotton became more easily produced. And while it makes life easier on individual workers, managing the transition from one type of economy to the next (farmer to manufacturer, to information specialist and now beyond) has been a key long-term reality for the American worker. Is the pace of change different this time? No one has thought more about this than labor unions. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler agrees with Yang that automation is one of the biggest challenges we’re facing as a country and it’s not getting the attention it deserves. But she’s not yet worried about dystopia. “The scare tactics are a little extreme,” she said in an interview, arguing that reports of tens of millions of American jobs lost by 2030 are probably overstated. “Every time a technological shift has taken place in this country there have been those doomsday scenarios,” she said in an interview.  It was already an issue in the 1950s, Shuler pointed out. “You have (then-United Auto Workers President) Walter Reuther testifying before Congress talking about how automation was going to change work and people were making these wild predictions that if you brought robots into auto plants that there would be massive unemployment,” she said.  Reuther’s testimony is really interesting to read, by the way. Check it out. “The revolutionary change produced by automation is its tendency to displace the worker entirely from the direct operation of the machine,” he said. He argued that unions weren’t opposed to automation but that they wanted more help from companies and from the government for workers dealing with a changing workplace.  “What ended up happening is what they call bargained acquiescence,” said Shuler, “where the unions went to the table and said ‘OK, we get it, this technology is coming, but how are we going to manage the change? How are we going to have a worker voice at the table? How are we going to make sure that working people benefit from this and the company is able to be more efficient and successful?’ “ Yang counters that argument by noting that automation has sped up, making it harder for workers, employers and the government to adjust. “Unlike with previous waves of automation, this time new jobs will not appear quickly enough in large enough numbers to make up for it,” he said on his website. Somewhere in the middle is where we’ll end up Shuler said American workers need to have the conversation about the future of work more urgently today. “We all have a choice to make,” she said. “Do we want technology to benefit working people, and our country, as a result, does better? Or do we want to follow a path of this dark, dystopian view that work is going to go away and people are going to have nothing to do and we’re just going to be essentially working at the whims of a bunch of robots?”  Somewhere in the middle, she argued, is where we’ll end up.  “We’re going to work alongside technology as it evolves. New work is going to emerge. We want to make sure working people can transition fairly and justly and responsibly and we can only do that if working people have a seat at the table.” The long-term future Shuler has an interest in workers and their rights today, but Russell writes that long-term, as automation of work becomes more tangible, the country will have to change its entire outlook on work and what we teach children and people to strive for.  “We need a radical rethinking of our educational system and our scientific enterprise to focus more attention on the human rather than the physical world,” he writes. “It sounds odd to say that happiness should be an engineering discipline, but that seems to be the inevitable conclusion. “ In other words: We will have to figure out how to be happy with the robots and the automation, because they are coming.",,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,P0Y0M0DT0H9M4S,2041.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

              Plunging into the Artificial Intelligence Wave
          












The Department of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology has taken an adventurous leap into the world of artificial intelligence by offering a new bachelor’s degree in the field this fall. Applications of AI are rapidly advancing across industries. Whether it is analyzing risk management in corporate finances, finding tumors in medical images, building an autonomous vehicle to explore other worlds, or designing a horrible supervillain for the next hot video game, AI allows computer scientists to flex their creativity to solve problems in all corners of society.Illinois Tech, the only tech-focused university in Chicago, is taking a lead in cultivating talent in this expanding discipline by becoming one of just a handful of universities in the country to offer an AI bachelor’s degree, and the only one in the Midwest.“AI is the future,” says Aron Culotta, an associate professor of computer science and director of Illinois Tech’s Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence program.“We want to train a workforce that can tackle the challenges and opportunities of the future, which includes AI and machine learning.” While many schools offer courses and concentrations in AI, Illinois Tech—with its long history of preparing innovators who have changed the technology landscape—made the bold decision to create this specially designed degree program.Graduates will be well prepared to work across many sectors, including tech, medicine, finance, robotics, business intelligence, law, and insurance. In addition to software development positions at large tech firms, graduates will also be prepared for AI engineering careers in drug discovery, autonomous vehicles, and web technologies.AI has broad applications that extend far beyond robots and is used daily by anyone who shops online, uses a smartphone, or plays video games. AI technology is used to help first responders prioritize emergency calls, to improve crop yields in agriculture, and to provide virtual teaching assistants for education.“Artificial intelligence is one of the top growth areas in the tech industry and is projected to continue growing in size and importance for the foreseeable future. AI-related job openings have increased nearly five-fold over the past few years, according to various job sites,” Culotta continues.As AI continues to percolate into the daily lives of everyday people,graduates must be equipped with a strong ethical base and highly conscious of how biases can corrupt the fulfillment of AI’s promises. Illinois Tech has integrated ethical thinking into technical courses, which affords critical training in issues of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and bias.“The growing impact of AI on society demands that graduates are capable and ethical collaborators, able to ensure the safe and effective adoption of new technologies across domains,” Culotta says.Also beginning this fall, Illinois Tech is offering a Master of Artificial Intelligence degree designed for computer science professionals who want to advance their career, recent computer science graduates looking to extend their knowledge of artificial intelligence for a competitive edge in the workforce, or those without a computer science degree looking to make a career change into a growing field.

Machines are getting better at writing. They can finish our sentences. They can reply to our emails. They can write news reports and even novels. But just because they can doesn’t mean they should.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is launching a technology revolution that will transform business over the next decade. The most powerful use for AI may be in the area of decision support, where algorithms feed us streams of knowledge and advice as we go about our work. Gartner says AI augmentation alone will create $2.9 trillion (with a “t”) in business value in 2021.
AI evolution is necessary for enterprise security, too, if only because the cybercriminals will use it to build better malware. We’ll benefit from AI in manufacturing, design, transportation and in countless other areas.











 
 
 
In short, AI will prove to be a huge boost to business.

But as we embark on this partnership with artificial intelligence, it’s important that we safeguard human intelligence. And the biggest threat to human intelligence is software that writes.
The creeping takeover of business writing
The mainstreaming of AI business writing began with Google Smart Reply four years ago. Google Inbox users were offered a few colorless options for a reply to most emails. The feature still exists in Gmail, and with a single click you can respond with “Thanks!” or “I’ll send it to you” or “Let’s do Friday!”











 
 
 
Last year Google added Smart Compose, which finishes the sentences you start. You can choose Google’s words by pressing the tab key.
Using Smart Reply and Smart Compose saves time but makes replies dull. They’re dull because Google makes sure the replies are generic and designed to not annoy or offend anyone (for example, Google’s AI never uses gendered pronouns like “he” or “she”), and also because millions of other Gmail users are using the exact same wording for their replies. We all sound the same in our replies.
Google is not alone. Lightkey makes a Windows application that works like Google’s Smart Compose.











 
 
 
Quillbot is a cloud-based tool that can rephrase what you write (or what you copy and paste from others’ writing). It typically produces awkward prose. Machines have no ear for language.
StoryAI is a tool based on OpenAI that will write a whole story if you write the beginning. I tried it by pasting in the opening paragraph of this column. You can read the column StoryAI wrote and decide who did a better job.
We find ourselves in the tragicomic place where AI writes financial news stories mainly for human consumption, but other AI also reads those stories to provide input for automated trading systems. AI does the writing. AI does the reading. And at some point AI is just going to cut humans out of the trade and keep all the money.











 
 
 
Automated writing will not only get better, it will be increasingly built into the tools we use to write things. The temptation to just let the machines do the writing will only grow. What’s wrong with that?
Here’s what’s wrong with that
The main problem with letting AI write for us is that writing isn’t just writing. Writing is one component of literacy, which includes reading, writing and thinking.
Writing involves revision, which clarifies thinking. We think. We write what we think. Then by reading what we write we realize the errors in our thinking, or at least in the way we have expressed our thinking. We rewrite until our thoughts are clearly and accurately and fully expressed. This practice is at the core of our ability to analyze, create, make good decisions and make progress in our lives and in our work.











 
 
 
Literacy and thinking are connected. This was the point of George Orwell’s Newspeak idea in the novel 1984. The totalitarian government in that book used restrictions on language to make complex thought impossible. Its purpose was “to diminish the range of thought” in order to pacify and enervate the public.
Writing, even writing business emails, forces us to confront our own thoughts in black and white. And this makes us cultivate our ability to think clearly.
It’s also the foundation of our ability to talk with logic and coherence. You’ll notice that good writers tend to speak well.











 
 
 
And writing aids memory. Just letting AI communicate for us, even if we choose from a menu of options, makes it easier to forget what “we” said.
More to the point, writing ability is a use-it-or-lose-it proposition, and AI systems that write for us could make us gradually lose it.
By allowing writing tools to do the writing for us, our literacy fades, and we begin to base our decisions on superficial impressions, rather than critical or analytical thinking.











 
 
 
The critical faculty is already under siege with conventions like emoji. By using cartoons in place of words, we communicate vague impressions rather than specific thoughts. As such, it’s not necessary to think specific thoughts in the first place. Textspeak, SMS abbreviations, autocorrect, emojis —- we’re slouching toward idiocracy. AI that writes our business communication for us is the professional version of all that.
Our relationship with literacy exists on a spectrum.
At one end, we’re fully realized humans with language and literacy to think and communicate better. At the other end we’re less human. We’re “echoborgs” — meat puppets who mindlessly regurgitate the words fed to us by AI.











 
 
 
We should be trying to move toward the good end of that spectrum, not the bad one.
Fearmongering over AI is common nowadays — AI, we’re told, will take our jobs and ultimately have no use for us, other than to keep us as pets. This AI technopanic is based on the knowledge that the machines will just keep getting smarter. We should be more worried that AI will make us all dumber.
The most efficient way for AI to make us dumber is to take the task of writing away from us. Our critical and creative faculties will atrophy. Our minds will become dull. And we’ll all become so boring that the machines may not even want us around as pets.











 
 
 
If you’re concerned about AI making us all redundant, you can do something about it today and every day: Don’t let AI put words in your mouth. Reject automated writing in all its forms. Do your own writing. Think for yourself.
The risk isn’t that machines will get smarter. It’s that humans will get dumber.

The call center agent on the phone with a customer can see a speedometer icon.The conversation with the customer continues, as does the computer feedback. “Think about how the customer is feeling. Try to relate,” the artificial intelligence-powered tool interjects. The agent receives other notifications, from “extended silence” to “empathy cue,” which suggests the worker is not showing enough empathy. For about 1,700 agents at the call center of Humana Pharmacy, the software called Cogito is becoming part of their work lives. It listens to most of their phone calls with customers nationwide and guides the agents on how to better communicate by analyzing vocal cues in conversations such as pitch, tone and rhythm of voices.In recent years, global industries have seen considerable transformation brought by automation in the workplace. One-third of activities in about 60% of occupations worldwide could be automatable, according to a 2017 report by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. As the technology advances, AI has gained increasing presence. It could perform a widening range of tasks that were previously done by humans and has been used in recruiting and management processes. The increasing prevalence of AI has boosted efficiency and reduced costs for companies but has also drawn concerns about job losses and hidden discrimination. Reuters last year unveiled that Amazon abandoned an AI recruiting tool in development, as the tech giant cannot fix its bias against women. Uber’s facial recognition technology reportedly didn’t process and recognize transgender drivers. A study published by New York University's AI Now Institute in April shows how many AI systems favor white people and males. Talking about such concerns around AI, Joshua Feast, Cogito Inc.’s co-founder and CEO said its software doesn’t mean to replace anybody. “We’re a coach,” he said. “We're sort of proud as a company that we're helping workers do well on the job, helping customers have better experiences on the phone and helping our clients keep those customers.” The company, which works with call centers of large insurance companies, including MetLife and Humana, retail banks and credit card issuers, says it has more than 25,000 users. It helps to minimize bias that Cogito's algorithm analyzes biological signaling mechanism, which is largely independent on language and culture, Feast said. The company has also deployed a secondary algorithm and a human annotation team to check for bias, he added. AI comes into play when humans get tired sometimes and suffer from “compassion fatigue,'' according to Feast. “What the AI is really doing is helping somebody be more consistent in the course of the day."" The software also provides tools for supervisors to track the performance of team members and guide workers accordingly, though Feast said Cogito doesn’t function as ""a performance management system."" A customer agent at Humana handles 30 to 40 calls a day on average, according to Mark Morse, vice president of Humana Pharmacy’s service operations. “When you're tired or on any given day, what happens at home and frustrations in life can come into the contact center,” he said. But showing empathy is always important as the customers of life insurance companies are usually “in the midst of some of the most challenging moments of their lives, from going on disability to the loss of a loved one,"" said Kristine Poznanski, head of global customer solutions at MetLife. Using Cogito is not compulsory at Humana, but the company is considering integrating Cogito's assessment into its bonus mechanism to promote the software's usage, said Morse. When asked if human customer agents would one day disappear, Feast said he doesn't think so, though the trend of automation has been growing – the share of customer service interactions completely handled by AI will reach 15% by 2021, according to research company Gartner. That's a 400% increase from 2017.“I don't think they (human customer agents) will be completely replaced,"" Feast said. ""Humans will always want to talk to other humans,” Feast said. “The reason is that only other humans really understand us.”Follow Frances Yue on Twitter: @FrancesYue_.Why CVS, Walgreens allow pharmacists to deny birth control Georgia residents can claim embryo as a dependent on their state taxes As online shopping slows, Amazon closes or pauses 40 warehouses is Gen Z underestimating how much money it will need to retire?

Aditi Avasthi, Founder and CEO, Embibe TwitterAditi Avasthi’s unrelenting passion for improving the state of education in India is evident from the fact that students who have used Embibe's learning programs have gone on to achieve remarkable results in unfavourable situations. Embibe’s pilot project was with the tribal students of Rajasthan who didn't know how to use computers before Embibe’s intervention. The students were not only confident but also went on to crack the most competitive pre-engineering and pre-medical exams in India. Embibe, a deep personalisation platform, is designed to deliver learning and life outcomes for students. Aditi Avasthi was awarded 'Accenture Vaahini Innovator of The Year' at Economic Times Prime Women Leadership Awards 2019.2. Chandralika Hazarika, Co-Founder and Managing Director, Bigthinx TwitterAn MBA graduate, Chandralika has earlier worked at ITC and Space Matrix. The marketing professional, who has about 10 years of experience, was always keen on developing simple but highly intuitive tech products that could be adopted by any and everyone. Today, her company Big Thinx's flagship product, the Lyflike app, lets you create your own customised clothing by controlling materials, size, lengths, style, fit, mixing and matching, and viewing them on personalised, walkabout avatars in immersive simulation. Here, a user gets to engage in immersive shopping through real-time visual searches and virtual reality, too. 3. Ashwini Asokan, CEO, Mad Street Den TwitterAshwini Asokan's brilliant innovation can be witnessed in her company's flagship product Vue.ai. Vue.ai is the retail industry’s leading artificial intelligence platform that promises Intelligent Retail Automation. Using Image Recognition & Data Science, Vue.ai extracts product data from images, analyzes it along with user behaviour thereby helping different retail teams make better, faster decisions. The platform delivers on two primary value propositions. One, automating retail processes across catalog management, merchandising and fashion photography, significantly reducing time to market; and two, personalising the customer journey across channels through AI enabled styling, outfitting and more. The company counts marquee retailers and brands as its customers, and is rapidly becoming the preferred AI solution suite for retailers across the globe. 4. Meghna Saraogi, Founder, MirrARTwitterThanks to MirrAR, shoppers can now try on jewellery on the digital platforms of client brands, including iPads installed at various locations, without actually having to wear the pieces. Shoppers also get instant fashion advice from experts, bloggers and influencers from around the world.
