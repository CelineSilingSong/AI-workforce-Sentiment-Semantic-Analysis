Artificial Intelligence has been used for the first time as part of Exercise Spring Storm in Estonia. The AI technology exploited vast amounts of data to help soldiers, providing vital information on the surrounding terrain and environment.
The British Army has used Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the first time during Exercise Spring Storm, as part of Operation Cabrit in Estonia.
Soldiers from the 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade used an AI engine which provides information on the surrounding environment and terrain. 

    “This was a fantastic opportunity to use a new and innovative piece of technology in a deployed environment. The kit was shown to outperform our expectations.""
    
        Major James Mcevoy, 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade
    

Through the development of significant automation and smart analytics, the engine is able to rapidly cut through masses of complex data. Providing efficient information regarding the environment and terrain, it enables the Army to plan its appropriate activity and outputs. 
The Army’s Director of Information, Major General John Cole said:
“The deployment was a first of its kind for the Army. It built on close collaboration between the MOD and industry partners that developed AI specifically designed for the way the Army is trained to operate.
“The lessons this has provided are considerable, not just in terms of our support to deployed forces, but more broadly in how we inform Defence’s digital transformation agenda and the best practices we must adopt to integrate and exploit leading-edge technologies.”
This AI capability, which can be hosted in the cloud or operate in independent mode, saved significant time and effort, providing soldiers with instant planning support and enhancing command and control processes.
20th Armoured Infantry Brigade and user of the AI, Major James Mcevoy said:
“This was a fantastic opportunity to use a new and innovative piece of technology in a deployed environment. The kit was shown to outperform our expectations and has clear applications for improving our level of analysis and speed at which we conduct our planning. I’m greatly looking forward to further opportunities to work with this.
“In future, the UK armed forces will increasingly use AI to predict adversaries’ behaviour, perform reconnaissance and relay real-time intelligence from the battlefield.”
During the annual large-scale NATO exercise, soldiers from France, Denmark, Belgium, Estonia and the UK used the technology whilst carrying out live-fire drills.
Operation Cabrit is the British Army’s deployment to Estonia where British troops are leading a multinational battlegroup as part of the enhanced Forward Presence.
Artificial Intelligence has already been incorporated in a number of key military initiatives, including the Future Combat Air System, and is the focus of several innovative funding programmes through the Defence and Security Accelerator.
Announced by the Prime Minister last November, Defence has received an increase in funding of over £24 billion across the next four years, focussing on the ability to adapt to meet future threats. 
Further outlined in the Defence Command Paper, the MOD intends to invest £6.6billion over the next four years in defence research and development, focusing on emerging technologies in artificial intelligence, AI-enabled autonomous systems, cyber, space and directed energy systems.

 Get it sent to your inbox.In 2018, Liz O’Sullivan and her colleagues at a prominent artificial intelligence start-up began work on a system that could automatically remove nudity and other explicit images from the internet.They sent millions of online photos to workers in India, who spent weeks adding tags to explicit material. The data paired with the photos would be used to teach A.I. software how to recognize indecent images. But once the photos were tagged, Ms. O’Sullivan and her team noticed a problem: The Indian workers had classified all images of same-sex couples as indecent.For Ms. O’Sullivan, the moment showed how easily — and often — bias could creep into artificial intelligence. It was a “cruel game of Whac-a-Mole,” she said.This month, Ms. O’Sullivan, a 36-year-old New Yorker, was named chief executive of a new company, Parity. The start-up is one of many organizations, including more than a dozen start-ups and some of the biggest names in tech, offering tools and services designed to identify and remove bias from A.I. systems.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSoon, businesses may need that help. In April, the Federal Trade Commission warned against the sale of A.I. systems that were racially biased or could prevent individuals from receiving employment, housing, insurance or other benefits. A week later, the European Union unveiled draft regulations that could punish companies for offering such technology.It is unclear how regulators might police bias. This past week, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a government research lab whose work often informs policy, released a proposal detailing how businesses can fight bias in A.I., including changes in the way technology is conceived and built.Many in the tech industry believe businesses must start preparing for a crackdown. “Some sort of legislation or regulation is inevitable,” said Christian Troncoso, the senior director of legal policy for the Software Alliance, a trade group that represents some of the biggest and oldest software companies. “Every time there is one of these terrible stories about A.I., it chips away at public trust and faith.”Over the past several years, studies have shown that facial recognition services, health care systems and even talking digital assistants can be biased against women, people of color and other marginalized groups. Amid a growing chorus of complaints over the issue, some local regulators have already taken action.In late 2019, state regulators in New York opened an investigation of UnitedHealth Group after a study found that an algorithm used by a hospital prioritized care for white patients over Black patients, even when the white patients were healthier. Last year, the state investigated the Apple Card credit service after claims it was discriminating against women. Regulators ruled that Goldman Sachs, which operated the card, did not discriminate, while the status of the UnitedHealth investigation is unclear. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA spokesman for UnitedHealth, Tyler Mason, said the company’s algorithm had been misused by one of its partners and was not racially biased. Apple declined to comment.More than $100 million has been invested over the past six months in companies exploring ethical issues involving artificial intelligence, after $186 million last year, according to PitchBook, a research firm that tracks financial activity.But efforts to address the problem reached a tipping point this month when the Software Alliance offered a detailed framework for fighting bias in A.I., including the recognition that some automated technologies require regular oversight from humans. The trade group believes the document can help companies change their behavior and can show regulators and lawmakers how to control the problem.Though they have been criticized for bias in their own systems, Amazon, IBM, Google and Microsoft also offer tools for fighting it.Ms. O’Sullivan said there was no simple solution to bias in A.I. A thornier issue is that some in the industry question whether the problem is as widespread or as harmful as she believes it is.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Changing mentalities does not happen overnight — and that is even more true when you’re talking about large companies,” she said. “You are trying to change not just one person’s mind but many minds.”When she started advising businesses on A.I. bias more than two years ago, Ms. O’Sullivan was often met with skepticism. Many executives and engineers espoused what they called “fairness through unawareness,” arguing that the best way to build equitable technology was to ignore issues like race and gender.Increasingly, companies were building systems that learned tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, including photos, sounds, text and stats. The belief was that if a system learned from as much data as possible, fairness would follow.But as Ms. O’Sullivan saw after the tagging done in India, bias can creep into a system when designers choose the wrong data or sort through it in the wrong way. Studies show that face-recognition services can be biased against women and people of color when they are trained on photo collections dominated by white men.Designers can be blind to these problems. The workers in India — where gay relationships were still illegal at the time and where attitudes toward gays and lesbians were very different from those in the United States — were classifying the photos as they saw fit.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. O’Sullivan saw the flaws and pitfalls of artificial intelligence while working for Clarifai, the company that ran the tagging project. She said she had left the company after realizing it was building systems for the military that she believed could eventually be used to kill. Clarifai did not respond to a request for comment. She now believes that after years of public complaints over bias in A.I. — not to mention the threat of regulation — attitudes are changing. In its new framework for curbing harmful bias, the Software Alliance warned against fairness through unawareness, saying the argument did not hold up.“They are acknowledging that you need to turn over the rocks and see what is underneath,” Ms. O’Sullivan said.Still, there is resistance. She said a recent clash at Google, where two ethics researchers were pushed out, was indicative of the situation at many companies. Efforts to fight bias often clash with corporate culture and the unceasing push to build new technology, get it out the door and start making money.It is also still difficult to know just how serious the problem is. “We have very little data needed to model the broader societal safety issues with these systems, including bias,” said Jack Clark, one of the authors of the A.I. Index, an effort to track A.I. technology and policy across the globe. “Many of the things that the average person cares about — such as fairness — are not yet being measured in a disciplined or a large-scale way.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. O’Sullivan, a philosophy major in college and a member of the American Civil Liberties Union, is building Parity around a tool designed by and licensed from Rumman Chowdhury, a well-known A.I. ethics researcher who spent years at the business consultancy Accenture before becoming an executive at Twitter. Dr. Chowdhury founded an earlier version of Parity and built it around the same tool.While other start-ups, like Fiddler A.I. and Weights and Biases, offer tools for monitoring A.I. services and identifying potentially biased behavior, Parity’s technology aims to analyze the data, technologies and methods a business uses to build its services and then pinpoint areas of risk and suggest changes.The tool uses artificial intelligence technology that can be biased in its own right, showing the double-edged nature of A.I. — and the difficulty of Ms. O’Sullivan’s task.Tools that can identify bias in A.I. are imperfect, just as A.I. is imperfect. But the power of such a tool, she said, is to pinpoint potential problems — to get people looking closely at the issue.Ultimately, she explained, the goal is to create a wider dialogue among people with a broad range of views. The trouble comes when the problem is ignored — or when those discussing the issues carry the same point of view.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“You need diverse perspectives. But can you get truly diverse perspectives at one company?” Ms. O’Sullivan asked. “It is a very important question I am not sure I can answer.”Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

Conneau couldn’t read it himself. But his creation, XLM-RoBERTa, had read it many times: This was its brain matter, the code with which the machine could, in some way, learn to emulate how people speak.Share69 Comments",BreadcrumbList,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6GWTVNWUAFAQXMSAHDDQD4XBDE.jpg&w=1600&h=900', 'height': 900, 'width': 1600}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6GWTVNWUAFAQXMSAHDDQD4XBDE.jpg&w=1800&h=1800', 'height': 1800, 'width': 1800}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6GWTVNWUAFAQXMSAHDDQD4XBDE.jpg&w=800&h=600', 'height': 800, 'width': 600}]",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/01/humans-ai-language-advances-risks/,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Drew Harwell', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/drew-harwell/'}",2021-08-13T16:48:13.704Z,2021-07-01T14:10:30.147Z,Meet the scientist teaching AI to police human speech,AI researchers at Facebook and Google are teaching machines to police human speech,"{'@id': 'washingtonpost.com', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/img/wplogo_344x60_blk.png', 'width': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '344 px'}, 'height': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '60 px'}}, 'name': 'The Washington Post'}","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent', 'isAccessibleForFree': False}",,,,,,False,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Washington Post', 'productID': 'washingtonpost.com:basic', 'description': 'Breaking news and analysis on politics, business, world, national news, entertainment and more.

In this map of white voters in the 2012 presidential election, the green circles represent counties with higher gender gaps than the U.S. average, and the purple circles, gender gaps lower than the average. The brighter the color, the larger the deviation from the average. Estimates are based on a model fit to survey data. This data visualization follows the principles of exploratory data analysis but is based on a fitted model, rather than raw data, using computer-intensive methods.

If you’ve ever called on Siri or Alexa for help, or generated a self-portrait in the style of a Renaissance painter, you have interacted with deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence that extracts patterns from mountains of data to make predictions. Though deep learning and AI have become household terms, the breakthroughs in statistics that have fueled this revolution are less known. In a recent paper, Andrew Gelman, a statistics professor at Columbia, and Aki Vehtari, a computer science professor at Finland’s Aalto University, published a list of the most important statistical ideas in the last 50 years.
Below, Gelman and Vehtari break down the list for those who may have snoozed through Statistics 101. Each idea can be viewed as a stand-in for an entire subfield, they say, with a few caveats: science is incremental; by singling out these works, they do not mean to diminish the importance of similar, related work. They have also chosen to focus on methods in statistics and machine learning, rather than equally important breakthroughs in statistical computing, and computer science and engineering, which have provided the tools and computing power for data analysis and visualization to become everyday practical tools. Finally, they have focused on methods, while recognizing that developments in theory and methods are often motivated by specific applications. 
See something important that’s missing? Tweet it at @columbiascience and Gelman and Vehtari will consider adding it to the list.
The 10 articles and books below all were published in the last 50 years and are listed in chronological order.

1. Hirotugu Akaike (1973). Information Theory and an Extension of the Maximum Likelihood Principle. Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Information Theory.
This is the paper that introduced the term AIC (originally called An Information Criterion but now known as Akaike Information Criterion), for evaluating a model’s fit based on its estimated predictive accuracy. AIC was instantly recognized as a useful tool, and this paper was one of several published in the mid-1970s placing statistical inference within a predictive framework. We now recognize predictive validation as a fundamental principle in statistics and machine learning. Akaike was an applied statistician, who in the 1960s, tried to measure the roughness of airport runways, in the same way that Benoit Mandelbrot's early papers on taxonomy and Pareto distributions led to his later work on the mathematics of fractals.
2. John Tukey (1977). Exploratory Data Analysis.
This book has been hugely influential and is a fun read that can be digested in one sitting. Traditionally, data visualization and exploration were considered low-grade aspects of practical statistics; the glamour was in fitting models, proving theorems, and developing the theoretical properties of statistical procedures under various mathematical assumptions or constraints. Tukey flipped this notion on its head. He wrote about statistical tools not for confirming what we already knew (or thought we knew), and not for rejecting hypotheses that we never, or should never have, believed, but for discovering new and unexpected insights from data. His work motivated advances in network analysis, software, and theoretical perspectives that integrate confirmation, criticism, and discovery. 
3. Grace Wahba (1978). Improper Priors, Spline Smoothing and the Problem of Guarding Against Model Errors in Regression. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
Spline smoothing is an approach for fitting nonparametric curves. Another of Wahba's papers from this period is called ""An automatic French curve,"" referring to a class of algorithms that can fit arbitrary smooth curves through data without overfitting to noise, or outliers. The idea may seem obvious now, but it was a major step forward in an era when the starting points for curve fitting were polynomials, exponentials, and other fixed forms. In addition to the direct applicability of splines, this paper was important theoretically. It served as a foundation for later work in nonparametric Bayesian inference by unifying ideas of regularization of high-dimensional models.
4.  Bradley Efron (1979). Bootstrap Methods: Another Look at the Jackknife. Annals of Statistics.
Bootstrapping is a method for performing statistical inference without assumptions. The data pull themselves up by their bootstraps, as it were. But you can't make inference without assumptions; what made the bootstrap so useful and influential is that the assumptions came implicitly with the computational procedure: the audaciously simple idea of resampling the data. Each time you repeat the statistical procedure performed on the original data. As with many statistical methods of the past 50 years, this one became widely useful because of an explosion in computing power that allowed simulations to replace mathematical analysis.
5. Alan Gelfand and Adrian Smith (1990). Sampling-based Approaches to Calculating Marginal Densities. Journal of the American Statistical Association.
Another way that fast computing has revolutionized statistics and machine learning is through open-ended Bayesian models. Traditional statistical models are static: fit distribution A to data of type B. But modern statistical modeling has a more Tinkertoy quality that lets you flexibly solve problems as they arise by calling on libraries of distributions and transformations. We just need computational tools to fit these snapped-together models. In their influential paper, Gelfand and Smith did not develop any new tools; they demonstrated how Gibbs sampling could be used to fit a large class of statistical models. In recent decades, the Gibbs sampler has been replaced by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, particle filtering, variational Bayes, and more elaborate algorithms, but the general principle of modular model-building has remained.
6. Guido Imbens and Joshua Angrist (1994). Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects. Econometrica.
Causal inference is central to any problem in which the question isn’t just a description (How have things been?) or prediction (What will happen next?), but a counterfactual (If we do X, what would happen to Y?). Causal methods have evolved with the rest of statistics and machine learning through exploration, modeling, and computation. But causal reasoning has the added challenge of asking about data that are impossible to measure (you can't both do X and not-X to the same person). As a result, a key idea in this field is identifying what questions can be reliably answered from a given experiment. Imbens and Angrist are economists who wrote an influential paper on what can be estimated when causal effects vary, and their ideas form the basis for much of the later work on this topic.
7. Robert Tibshirani (1996). Regression Shrinkage and Selection Via the Lasso. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
In regression, or predicting an outcome variable from a set of inputs or features, the challenge lies in including lots of inputs along with their interactions; the resulting estimation problem becomes statistically unstable because of the many different ways of combining these inputs to get reasonable predictions. Classical least squares or maximum likelihood estimates will be noisy and might not perform well on future data, and so various methods have been developed to constrain or “regularize” the fit to gain stability. In this paper, Tibshirani introduced lasso, a computationally efficient and now widely used approach to regularization, which has become a template for data-based regularization in more complicated models.
8. Leland Wilkinson (1999). The Grammar of Graphics.
In this book, Wilkinson, a statistician who's worked on several influential commercial software projects including SPSS and Tableau, lays out a framework for statistical graphics that goes beyond the usual focus on pie charts versus histograms, how to draw a scatterplot, and data ink and chartjunk, to abstractly explore how data and visualizations relate. This work has influenced statistics through many pathways, most notably through ggplot2 and the tidyverse family of packages in the computing language R. It’s an important step toward integrating exploratory data and model analysis into data science workflow.
9. Ian Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio (2014). Generative Adversarial Networks. Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.
One of machine learning’s stunning achievements in recent years is in real-time decision making through prediction and inference feedbacks. Famous examples include self-driving cars and DeepMind’s AlphaGo, which trained itself to become the best Go player on Earth. Generative adversarial networks, or GANs, are a conceptual advance that allow reinforcement learning problems to be solved automatically. They mark a step toward the longstanding goal of artificial general intelligence while also harnessing the power of parallel processing so that a program can train itself by playing millions of games against itself. At a conceptual level, GANs link prediction with generative models.
10. Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, and Geoffrey Hinton (2015). Deep Learning. Nature.
Deep learning is a class of artificial neural network models that can be used to make flexible nonlinear predictions using a large number of features. Its building blocks—logistic regression, multilevel structure, and Bayesian inference—are hardly new. What makes this line of research so influential is the recognition that these models can be tuned to solve a variety of prediction problems, from consumer behavior to image analysis. As with other developments in statistics and machine learning, the tuning process was made possible only with the advent of fast parallel computing and statistical algorithms to harness this power to fit large models in real time. Conceptually, we’re still catching up with the power of these methods, which is why there’s so much interest in interpretable machine learning.

MELVIN was a machine-learning algorithm Krenn had built, a kind of artificial intelligence. Its job was to mix and match the building blocks of standard quantum experiments and find solutions to new problems. And it did find many interesting ones. But there was one that made no sense. “The first thing I thought was, ‘My program has a bug because the solution cannot exist,’” Krenn says.MELVIN had seemingly solved the problem of creating highly complex entangled states involving multiple photons (entangled states being those that once made Albert Einstein invoke the specter of “spooky action at a distance”). Krenn, Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna and their colleagues had not explicitly provided MELVIN the rules needed to generate such complex states, yet it had found a way. Eventually Krenn realized that the algorithm had rediscovered a type of experimental arrangement that had been devised in the early 1990s. But those experiments had been much simpler. MELVIN had cracked a far more complex puzzle. “When we understood what was going on, we were immediately able to generalize [the solution],” says Krenn, who is now at the University of Toronto.Since then, other teams have started performing the experiments identified by MELVIN, allowing them to test the conceptual underpinnings of quantum mechanics in new ways. Meanwhile Krenn, working with colleagues in Toronto, has refined their machine-learning algorithms. Their latest effort, an AI called THESEUS, has upped the ante: it is orders of magnitude faster than MELVIN, and humans can readily parse its output. While it would take Krenn and his colleagues days or even weeks to understand MELVIN’s meanderings, they can almost immediately figure out what THESEUS is saying. “It is amazing work,” says theoretical quantum physicist Renato Renner of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, who reviewed a 2020 study about THESEUS but was not directly involved in these efforts.Krenn stumbled on this entire research program somewhat by accident when he and his colleagues were trying to figure out how to experimentally create quantum states of photons entangled in a very particular manner. When two photons interact, they become entangled, and both can be mathematically described only using a single shared quantum state. If you measure the state of one photon, the measurement instantly fixes the state of the other even if the two are kilometers apart (hence Einstein’s derisive comments on entanglement being “spooky”).In 1989 three physicists—Daniel Greenberger, the late Michael Horne and Zeilinger—described an entangled state that came to be known as GHZ (after their initials). It involved four photons, each of which could be in a quantum superposition of, say, two states, 0 and 1 (a quantum state called a qubit). In their paper, the GHZ state involved entangling four qubits such that the entire system was in a two-dimensional quantum superposition of states 0000 and 1111. If you measured one of the photons and found it in state 0, the superposition would collapse, and the other photons would also be in state 0. The same went for state 1. In the late 1990s Zeilinger and his colleagues experimentally observed GHZ states using three qubits for the first time.Krenn and his colleagues were aiming for GHZ states of higher dimensions. They wanted to work with three photons, where each photon had a dimensionality of three, meaning it could be in a superposition of three states: 0, 1 and 2. This quantum state is called a qutrit. The entanglement the team was after was a three-dimensional GHZ state that was a superposition of states 000, 111 and 222. Such states are important ingredients for secure quantum communications and faster quantum computing. In late 2013 the researchers spent weeks designing experiments on blackboards and doing the calculations to see if their setups could generate the required quantum states. But each time they failed. “I thought, ‘This is absolutely insane. Why can’t we come up with a setup?’” Krenn says.To speed up the process, Krenn first wrote a computer program that took an experimental setup and calculated the output. Then he upgraded the program to allow it to incorporate in its calculations the same building blocks that experimenters use to create and manipulate photons on an optical bench: lasers, nonlinear crystals, beam splitters, phase shifters, holograms, and the like. The program searched through a large space of configurations by randomly mixing and matching the building blocks, performed the calculations and spat out the result. MELVIN was born. “Within a few hours the program found a solution that we scientists—three experimentalists and one theorist—could not come up with for months,” Krenn says. “That was a crazy day. I could not believe that it happened.” Then he gave MELVIN more smarts. Anytime it found a setup that did something useful, MELVIN added that setup to its toolbox. “The algorithm remembers that and tries to reuse it for more complex solutions,” Krenn says.Recommended StoriesCan AI Save Schrödinger’s Cat?Anil AnanthaswamyThese Are the Most Beautiful Equations in MathematicsRachel CrowellExotic Quantum ‘Bose-Einstein Condensate’ State Finally Achieved with MoleculesElizabeth Gibney & Nature magazineDoes Quantum Physics Rule Out Free Will?Dan FalkIt was this more evolved MELVIN that left Krenn scratching his head in a Viennese café. He had set it running with an experimental toolbox that contained two crystals, each capable of generating a pair of photons entangled in three dimensions. Krenn’s naive expectation was that MELVIN would find configurations that combined these pairs of photons to create entangled states of at most nine dimensions. But “it actually found one solution, an extremely rare case, that has much higher entanglement than the rest of the states,” Krenn says.Eventually he figured out that MELVIN had used a technique that multiple teams had developed nearly three decades ago. In 1991 Xin Yu Zou, Li Jun Wang and Leonard Mandel, all then at the University of Rochester, designed one method. And in 1994 Zeilinger, then at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and his colleagues came up with another. Conceptually these experiments attempted something similar, but the configuration that Zeilinger and his colleagues devised is simpler to understand. It starts with one crystal that generates a pair of photons (A and B). The paths of these photons go right through another crystal, which can also generate two photons (C and D). The paths of photon A from the first crystal and of photon C from the second overlap exactly and lead to the same detector. If that detector clicks, it is impossible to tell whether the photon originated from the first or the second crystal. The same goes for photons B and D.A phase shifter is a device that effectively increases the path a photon travels as some fraction of its wavelength. If you were to introduce a phase shifter in one of the paths between the crystals and kept changing the amount of phase shift, you could cause constructive and destructive interference at the detectors. For example, each of the crystals could be generating, say, 1,000 pairs of photons per second. With constructive interference, the detectors would register 4,000 pairs of photons per second. And with destructive interference, they would detect none: the system as a whole would not create any photons even though individual crystals would be generating 1,000 pairs a second. “That is actually quite crazy, when you think about it,” Krenn says.MELVIN’s funky solution involved such overlapping paths. What had flummoxed Krenn was that the algorithm had only two crystals in its toolbox. And instead of using those crystals at the beginning of the experimental setup, it had wedged them inside an interferometer (a device that splits the path of, say, a photon into two and then recombines them). After much effort, he realized that the setup MELVIN had found was equivalent to one involving more than two crystals, each generating pairs of photons, such that their paths to the detectors overlapped. The configuration could be used to generate high-dimensional entangled states.Quantum physicist Nora Tischler, who was a Ph.D. student working with Zeilinger on an unrelated topic when MELVIN was being put through its paces, was paying attention to these developments. “It was kind of clear from the beginning [that such an] experiment wouldn’t exist if it hadn’t been discovered by an algorithm,” she says.Besides generating complex entangled states, the setup using more than two crystals with overlapping paths can be employed to perform a generalized form of Zeilinger’s 1994 quantum interference experiments with two crystals. Aephraim Steinberg, an experimentalist who is a Toronto colleague of Krenn’s but has not worked on these projects, is impressed by what the AI found. “This is a generalization that (to my knowledge) no human dreamed up in the intervening decades and might never have done,” he says. “It’s a gorgeous first example of the kind of new explorations these thinking machines can take us on.”In one such generalized configuration with four crystals, each generating a pair of photons, and overlapping paths leading to four detectors, quantum interference can create situations where either all four detectors click (constructive interference) or none of them do so (destructive interference). Until recently, carrying out such an experiment had remained a distant dream. Then, in a March preprint paper, a team led by Lan-Tian Feng of the University of Science and Technology of China, in collaboration with Krenn, reported that they had fabricated the entire setup on a single photonic chip and performed the experiment. The researchers collected data for more than 16 hours: a feat made possible because of the photonic chip’s incredible optical stability, something that would have been impossible to achieve in a larger-scale tabletop experiment. For starters, the setup would require a square meter’s worth of optical elements precisely aligned on an optical bench, Steinberg says. Besides, “a single optical element jittering or drifting by a thousandth of the diameter of a human hair during those 16 hours could be enough to wash out the effect,” he says.During their early attempts to simplify and generalize what MELVIN had found, Krenn and his colleagues realized that the solution resembled abstract mathematical forms called graphs, which contain vertices and edges and are used to depict pairwise relations between objects. For these quantum experiments, every path a photon takes is represented by a vertex. And a crystal, for example, is represented by an edge connecting two vertices. MELVIN first produced such a graph and then performed a mathematical operation on it. The operation, called perfect matching, involves generating an equivalent graph in which each vertex is connected to only one edge. This process makes calculating the final quantum state much easier, although it is still hard for humans to understand.That changed with MELVIN’s successor THESEUS, which generates much simpler graphs by winnowing the first complex graph representing a solution that it finds down to the bare minimum number of edges and vertices (such that any further deletion destroys the setup’s ability to generate the desired quantum states). Such graphs are simpler than MELVIN’s perfect matching graphs, so it is even easier to make sense of any AI-generated solution. Renner is particularly impressed by THESEUS’s human-interpretable outputs. “The solution is designed in such a way that the number of connections in the graph is minimized,” he says. “And that’s naturally a solution we can better understand than if you had a very complex graph.”Eric Cavalcanti of Griffith University in Australia is both impressed by the work and circumspect about it. “These machine-learning techniques represent an interesting development. For a human scientist looking at the data and interpreting it, some of the solutions may look like ‘creative’ new solutions. But at this stage, these algorithms are still far from a level where it could be said that they are having truly new ideas or coming up with new concepts,” he says. “On the other hand, I do think that one day they will get there. So these are baby steps—but we have to start somewhere.” Steinberg agrees. “For now they are just amazing tools,” he says. “And like all the best tools, they’re already enabling us to do some things we probably wouldn’t have done without them.”Rights & PermissionsFrom our Archives

The GDPR and the Artificial Intelligence Regulation – it takes two to tango?
BY 
                Jenny Bergholm              - 06 July 2021






The recently adopted proposal for an AI Regulation has already been the topic for widespread discussions., and so has the GDPR. This contribution discusses how the proposed AI Regulation inadequately addresses the risks presented to privacy and data protection by AI systems, and fails to integrate the comprehensive framework of the GDPR into the most buzzing proposal for regulation in a long time.
The recently published proposal for a EU AI Regulation (also discussed here and here) is the latest addition to the European Commission’s Digital Strategy, published in April 2021. It is the first of its kind in the world and comprises many important aspects for society. This contribution will discuss the proposed AI Regulation, and in particular the relationship to the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR).
Initially, a few basic concepts of the AI Regulation will be introduced. If adopted, the regulation enjoys a broad scope: it will apply to all providers supplying AI systems within the EU internal market (Article 2 and Article 3(9) and (10)) and all users of AI systems (Article 2) for commercial purposes (Article 3 (4)).
Perhaps most importantly, the proposal distinguishes between high-risk AI systems and other AI systems. An AI system is defined as a software, which is developed with machine learning, logic- and knowledge-based or statistical approaches and which can “generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing the environments they interact with” based on set “human-defined objectives” (Article 3 (1) and Annex I). An AI system is classified as high-risk if it is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or is a product under one of various legislative pieces (Annex II), or falls under one of the specifically mentioned categories (Annex III). The categories of Annex III comprise among others, the use of biometric identification and safety components used in some critical infrastructures, AI systems used for educational purposes and in employment related circumstances.
Whereas certain artificial intelligence practices are directly prohibited, most emphasis is put on high-risk AI systems. Those are subject to purely internal market conformity procedures, with notified bodies and CE marking of conformity. Other AI systems, those that are not considered high-risk, are subject to transparency obligations (Article 52). High-risk AI systems, which make use of techniques involving the training of models with data, will need to be developed based on training, validation and testing of the data sets, to ensure that quality criteria are met.
 The approach is not only detrimentally different from an obligation perspective, but also concerning the processing of personal data of AI systems. The mentioned quality criteria concern data governance, and many of the criteria will serve data subjects. Moreover, the GDPR plays a role in bias monitoring (Art. 10(5)) and processing of biometric data. It is also directly pointed out, that even if a system is included in the scope of the AI Regulation as a high-risk AI system, it does not mean that it is lawful from a data protection perspective (Recital 41). In its joint opinion, the EDPB and the EDPS highlight this and raise criticism regarding the lack of alignment with the GDPR. The EDPB/EDPS further propose that compliance with the data protection framework in the assessment for CE conformity. The European Commission White Paper on AI already identified risks to data protection and privacy rights by e.g. using AI to retrace or de-anonymise data, even for data sets which do not, as such, include personal data. Also the High-Level Expert Group on AI highlighted the need for AI systems to guarantee privacy and data protection, especially for information provided by the user of a system but also data generated about the data subject while using AI-based tools.
It is understood that the AI Regulation is a risk assessment based approach. The scale of risk is graded from unacceptable to minimal risks. Risk-based approaches are also common in cybersecurity legislation, and hints thereof can also be found in the 2020 Cybersecurity Strategy. From a data protection perspective, it can be noted that some risk management elements also exists in the GDPR, such as the data protection impact assessments, as discussed by Gellert and the Article 29 Working Party. Also data protection law is developing in a risk-based direction, as can be seen in the recently published Standard Contractual Clauses for international data transfers, which allow a risk-based approach.
Nevertheless, the rights and obligations of the GDPR stretch further than only high-risk operations. . The issue is, that even though the AI Regulation is intended to complement the GDPR, it provides very little clarity of processing of personal data by any other AI systems than high-risk AI systems. The Proposal includes a declaration that the proposed AI Regulation does not affect the application of the GDPR, but more guidance in the legal text on how the Regulation should be applied with regards to processing of personal data is missing. The lack of clear reference to the GDPR and other data protection legislation has been raised by the EDPB and the EDPS in a joint opinion. This is especially the case for data processing of AI systems which are not considered as high-risk systems. Even for high-risk AI systems, it mainly considers special categories of personal data . A clear example is Article 10 of the draft regulation, concerning data and governance. The article is set to regulate the training, validation and testing of data sets of high-risk AI systems. It refers to the data collection, but with no reference to rights and obligations of the data subjects. Only in Article 10(5), the GDPR is mentioned, as the providers of systems may process personal data of special categories if strictly necessary for the purpose of ensuring bias monitoring, detection and corrections. In such cases, the provider of the system need to adopt appropriate safeguards, such as technical limitations on the re-use of data and privacy-preserving measures. However, read in the light of the GDPR, many of these safeguards are already per-se obligatory due to the GDPR and the principle of data minimisation and privacy by-design and by-default.
Data processing of AI systems, which are not high-risk, or related to biometrics or bias, seem to be left solely to the already existing provisions of the GDPR. This includes, among others, the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, storage limitation, integrity and accountability (Art. 5 of the GDPR). The GDPR has become a bench-mark for privacy and data protection rights, and is one of the success stories of recent EU regulation. It is clear, that the GDPR applies when personal data is processed with the help of artificial intelligence. Even if that fact is not doubted, the relation between the GDPR and the AI Regulation should be clarified. The (long term) quality of the AI Regulation would benefit from clear and strong references to the principles of the GDPR, and so would the innovation community, the internal market and the data subjects.

Following the invention of the camera in the 1850s, artists felt betrayed and threatened by technology as the end of art seemed to loom due to the camera’s ability to capture images in perfect likeness. Since the invention of the camera, technology has accelerated at an exponential rate in ways that have both benefited and disadvantaged the artist. Now with the invention of the first humanoid robot artist, Ai-Da, the lines between benefit and disadvantage have become blurry. “People don’t judge an artwork on its own merit,” Aidan Meller, gallery director and co-creator of Ai-Da, told digitaltrends while speaking about the humanoid. “They always do it through the lens of the artist, Meller continued. “When you look at a Picasso or you look at Tracey Emin, you have a very different response based on the personalities that created [the work]. That’s no different with a robot.” Ai-Da was unveiled as the first robot artist in 2019, showcasing an original skillset that allowed the humanoid to paint abstract artworks. Ai-Da’s artworks are from her ability to examine objects with a camera and then decode these objects through various machine learning algorithms, which are then translated as instructions to Ai-Da’s mechanical arm to re-create the objects. Since 2019, Ai-Da’s artistic skill set has grown and she is now able to write and recite poetry as well as create sculptural works.

Aida has travelled around the world exhibiting work on a scale that most conscious artists could never dream of. Earlier this year she had an exhibition at London’s Design Museum which showed how far she has come in evolving her skillset. The exhibition displayed a series of self-portraits— or selfies — which showed that Ai-Da had been taught to “look” at herself and create self-portraits. Ai-Da co-creator and curator Lucy Seal explained that, “Through technology, we outsource our own decisions. The work invites us to think about artificial intelligence, technological uses and abuses in today’s world.” As Ai-Da continues to be spoken about in the art world and gain so much recognition, now becoming the first humanoid to receive an artist residency, I wonder if Ai-Da herself is an abuse of technology. While I do admire this leap in technology and am impressed by the skillset and innovation Ai-Da holds, I can’t help but think that through this recognition of Ai-Da, and the possibility of the trajectory she stands for which could result in many robot artists, we could be depriving a conscious artist of the opportunity and platforms we are giving humanoids. This thinking is framed by the fact that there are thousands of Black and brown artists who still exist on the margins of the art world, not gaining recognition for the work they have done to shape modern art. It appears disheartening when the art world is now shifting to rather showcase the work of humanoids, instead of spotlighting marginalised artists who have been overlooked for so long. Apart from this, the invention and attention surrounding Ai-Da also allows us to ask ourselves how we value art these days— is it based on the method used to create the art or its underpinning concept? It is to be noted that Ai-Da did not decide to create self-portraits but rather was given instructions by her creators. This method of working is not new to the art world as it is similar to how artist Damien Hurst works. Hurst employs multiple artists to help him realise his works with many criticising that he is nothing but a puppet master with a concept, dictating what artists below him create and taking all the credit for the artworks. So perhaps Ai-Da should stand as a blueprint to how we could use artificial intelligence to our advantage as artists to help realise our own conceptual dreams in the way Hurst does.

While Ai-Da is being credited as an example of an artistic phenomenon, which now puts into question if it is possible to automate creativity, I think back to my early understandings of the works of Jackson Pollock. Pollock created abstract expressionist works which are today renowned due to their technique, scale and colour. When looking at the techniques that Pollock used it came across to me that Pollock, like Ai-da, utilised methods of working that would automate creativity. Showing again the way that Ai-Da works is similar to how other artists have previously operated. So perhaps AI in the art world is less of a threat than we previously imagined. With every wave of technological advancement, we also take a step towards aiding human efforts. Recently, AI has helped restore Rembrandt’s 1642 masterpiece, The Night’s Watch, to the painting’s original size after 300 years. In 1715, the painting was cut to size to suit the wall of Amsterdam’s Town hall. To date, the chopped-off sections of the painting have not been found. However, due to artificial intelligence, the painting has now been restored to its former brilliance, a feat that I doubt we would have been able to do without technology. Technology has also has allowed artists such as Refik Anadol to re-imagine the creation of new age media as Anadol creates surreal, abstract works constructed through data-driven machine learning algorithms. Not to mention the benefit of NFT technology providing the opportunity to democratise the art world when operating in ways seen in exhibitions such as The Digital Diaspora. 
So while a possible disadvantage of artificial intelligence in art is that someday the works of humanoids might eclipse and surpass the works that us mere mortals can create, I rest easy at night knowing that Ai-Da will never be able to truly create from a space of human experience, culture or heritage and to me those are the inspirations which add substance to art. I also embrace the fact that without the technology that Ai-Da stands for many things would not be possible in the arts and realise that if we use technology correctly a world of creative opportunity is created. Most importantly, we need to make sure that this technology does not allow for the unfair distribution of resources, such as recognition and opportunity, which ensures that previously marginalised groups are still given a seat at the table.

A Simple Blood Test to Speed Pulmonary Hypertension Diagnosis


July 1, 2021







Health Sciences researchers are using artificial intelligence to quickly identify the chemical fingerprints of pulmonary hypertension before it’s too late.






Image
 



Drs. Ruslan Rafikov and Olga Rafikova study the genetic and metabolomic biomarkers of pulmonary hypertension.






Deadly if not treated, pulmonary hypertension can be easy to miss. Shortness of breath and difficulty exercising are among its symptoms – the same as those indicating a number of other respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. 
The standard procedure to detect the disease is a pulmonary artery catheterization, an invasive test where a tube is threaded from a vein in the neck or groin to the heart’s right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery to measure pressure. High blood pressure in that area indicates pulmonary hypertension. 




Image
 




Using technology, artificial intelligence and detective work, researchers at the College of Medicine – Tucson built original algorithms to help doctors more quickly and efficiently diagnose pulmonary hypertension.




But at the University of Arizona Heath Sciences, the husband-and-wife team of Ruslan Rafikov, PhD, and Olga Rafikova, MD, PhD, is using artificial intelligence to build original algorithms and feed them to computers to more efficiently diagnose the disease.  
Working in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine – Tucson,  the two researchers have created algorithms that can detect the tell-tale metabolites associated with the condition in blood samples, speeding diagnosis, providing a quicker path to treatment and potentially adding years to patients’ lives. 
“By creating machine learning techniques or algorithms, we are teaching the computer how to separate metabolite data and determine what’s significant,” Dr. Rafikov said. “Using data, we are allowing for quicker and less invasive ways to assess patients. And that is the goal of our work as we move into the future.”
About 200,000 new cases of pulmonary hypertension are diagnosed every year in the United States, with treatment costs ranging about four to five times higher in patients with the condition than those without, according to a recent report in the American Journal of Managed Care. College of Medicine – Tucson Associate Professor Franz Rischard, DO, estimates the disease occurs at twice the national rate in southern Arizona.
Where machine learning and medicine meet
Drs. Rafikov and Rafikova’s research focuses on the expression of metabolites in cells that are under stress. Metabolites are micro-molecules that drive biochemical activities in cells, such as signaling, stimulatory and inhibitory functions in the body. These small molecules include lipids, proteins and amino and nucleic acids that are building blocks when a cell is in regeneration mode.

Franz Rischard, DO, says southern Arizona sees twice the national rate of pulmonary hypertension.




In pulmonary hypertension, the biochemical processes that create these molecules get hijacked to focus on cell regeneration. This leads to a narrowing of arteries between the heart and lungs, forcing them to work harder and leading to eventual failure.
Analyzing data from blood samples with a computer algorithm, Drs. Rafikov and Rafikova zeroed in on shifts in about a dozen metabolites that signal early diagnosis.
They then created a machine-learning algorithm – a set of instructions for the computer to scan for metabolites in the blood – to detect the presence of pulmonary hypertension, eventually developing a metabolic profile to hone in on 11 specific metabolites out of tens of thousands in the body.
“It’s similar to how our brains learn to identify a specific image,” Dr. Rafikov explained. “You may need many images before the computer recognizes what you’re teaching it to see.” 
The research partners also had to teach the computer to tell the difference between healthy and diseased samples, as well as the differences in samples for other conditions a patient might suffer from, such as diabetes, cancer or other lung and heart diseases.




Image
 




Drs. Rafikova and Rafikov hope to develop additional panels to diagnose other diseases based on their metabolic signatures.




At this stage of their research, it takes about an hour of computing time for the team to run 20 healthy and 20 diseased samples to check for the 11 metabolites connected to pulmonary hypertension. As the computer studies them, it distributes them into healthy or pulmonary hypertension baskets. Bigger sample sizes require more computing power, and Rafikov envisions eventually employing a cloud computing service to process large patient sets.
Expanding their work
After further refinements, Drs. Rafikov and Rafikova hope to provide their 11-metabolite panel to physicians to screen patients with mild pulmonary hypertension symptoms and allow earlier diagnosis. They also plan to develop metabolite panels to improve diagnoses for other diseases by identifying different metabolic signatures.
“We want to develop our own unique algorithm for a multi-level, multi-disease focus that would, from the very beginning, approach each patient as if the system understands there might be several conditions in one person,” Dr. Rafikova said.

Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn is famous for his extensive oeuvre of art, which includes sketches, prints, and paintings. Among the many masterpieces within his portfolio is a particularly ambitious piece that has impressed audiences with its scale and detail centuries after the painter's death—The Night Watch (1642). This lifesize group portrait is one of the most influential pieces from the Dutch Golden Age and, since 2019, has been the subject of an extensive restoration by the Rijksmuseum called Project Night Watch.

Last year, Project Night Watch released an extremely detailed—and completely free-to-download —44.8 gigapixel image of Rembrandt's masterpiece. Recently, the museum unveiled another incredible feat. By combining art with artificial intelligence, the team was able to add missing pieces to the original painting. “In 1715, the monumental canvas was cut down on all four sides to fit onto a wall between two doors in Amsterdam’s Town Hall,” writes Nina Siegal. “The snipped pieces were lost. Since the 19th century, the trimmed painting has been housed in the Rijksmuseum, where it is displayed as the museum’s centerpiece, at the focal point of its Gallery of Honor.”
This success of completing The Night Watch to its original form depended on a 17th-century copy of the painting that was made by Dutch artist Gerrit Lundens prior to the trimming. With this record of what The Night Watch used to look like, the museum's scientists were able to train artificial intelligence to recreate the missing portions in Rembrandt's unique style of painting. This process required a long period of tinkering with the neural network's precision. Eventually, the Rijsmuseum's senior scientist, Rob Erdmann, was able to successfully calibrate the AI technology to print a believable replica of Rembrandt's handiwork onto canvas.FEATURED VIDEOHobo nickels created by Roman Booteen.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, he taught hundreds of kids how to make Alexa do things it isn't programmed to do through webinars, camps and posts on his blog that is available online. ""In this generation, as kids are growing up, they are being exposed to technology and learning things in ways that we never thought was possible,"" said Bradley Metrock, CEO of Score Publishing, which organizes the Project Voice conference. ""Kids like Aariv are setting the expectation of having the chance to speak to technology devices first.""With several people from large companies also nominated, Aariv said he was not expecting to win. ""I was nominated with so many people who worked at big enterprises like Google, Samsung and Amazon, so I was pleasantly surprised when Bradley emailed me that I had won,"" he said.How Aariv Modi got started in artificial intelligenceAariv said he's been involved with the AI industry since he was 10-years-old. In 2019, Aariv uploaded his first YouTube video demonstrating ""How Alexa Works"", how to open the Wheel of Fun app using Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant that uses AI technology. However, he said it wasn't until the start of the coronavirus pandemic that he became inspired to teach others how to build their Alexa skills.""I was bored out of my mind and I figured a lot of people were feeling the same way, so I thought the best way to give back to the community at the time would be to help teach everybody something new,"" Aariv said. ""I worked with my dad to set up a couple of webinars where I taught kids how to create Alexa skills.""MORE: UT gets $20M to focus on AI technology and lead research instituteHe said over 500 people attended his webinars, where he taught them the technology involved in creating Alexa. His YouTube channel now has over 1,300 subscribers.""I also teach them how to create Alexa skills using code because with Alexa blueprints, you really don't need any coding experience to create them,"" Aariv said. In 2020, Aariv said he also had the opportunity to visit Chattanooga, Tenn., and speak at Project Voice's yearly conference, which brings together those in the technology and conversational artificial intelligence community, according to its website. ""My presentation was about my learnings throughout my year-long journey with Alexa,"" Aariv said. ""I had practiced my presentation maybe 50 times and was still really nervous, but as soon as I went on the stage, my butterflies in my stomach disappeared. It was really exciting and I felt lucky to have the opportunity because I'm able to share what's important and my knowledge with the artificial intelligence community."" MORE: Round Rock student awarded for education efforts on teen dating violenceHe said he is thankful for his father and the friends he has found within the AI community. ""They've always helped me so much and it's really because of them I'm able to speak at conferences,"" Aariv said. ""I truly look up to my dad because he's a really big influence in my life and has always believed I can achieve anything I really want to. He's never treated me like a kid when it comes to programming and I'm super grateful for that."" Although Aariv, 13, said he does not know what he wants to be when he grows up, he wants to be in the tech field and plans to continue sharing his knowledge with the AI community.""I hope to be TEDx speaker this year, talking about voice and AI, and I intend to continue using my YouTube channel, LinkedIn and my blog because I really enjoy teaching others and sharing everything I know,"" Aariv said.Fisher Investments7 Wealth Tips Once Your Portfolio Reaches $1 MillionHow do retirees take steps to preserve their wealth in retirement?

This revolution is labeled as the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Industrial Revolution, or 4IR in short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In developed nations, 4IR is already taking place with massive unprecedented strides in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, nano and biotechnology and more. Led by the likes of USA, Korea, Japan, China and Europe, patenting of 4IR technologies has seen an annual growth of 20% from 2010 to 2018. Its effect has reached our country as well, where automated systems and services are replacing the conventional manual processes to increase efficiency and effectiveness. With its immense potential, both positive and negative, 4IR is being introduced in the national sphere of Bangladesh, influencing the policies and industries for the coming years. And in the preparation and planning for it, academia is positioned to play a uniquely vital role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tale of the revolutions starts in the late 18th century, with the invention of the steam engine. The first industrial revolution repositioned the economic focus of the world from the greens and isolation of agriculture to the grime and hustle of factories. New jobs surfaced, masses migrated, urban societies emerged, and new societal and economic structures took shape.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;The second industrial revolution followed a hundred years later with the introduction of electricity in the industry and the opportunities for mass production. Manual labour was augmented by tools that ran on electricity, helping efficiency in production reach a greater level. This subsequently made way for engineers and specialists to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;blockquote&gt;The last revolution, 4IR, is often mistaken as a continuation of the third one due to its use of modern technologies. But with its exponential growth and unprecedented scope, 4IR has emerged as its own force to be reckoned with. What distinguishes 4IR is its use of smart technologies, artificial intelligence and the fusion of physical, technological and biological components.&lt;/blockquote&gt;. &lt;p&gt;After the mid twentieth century, a new era of digitization was introduced, namely the third industrial revolution. Electronic devices started dominating the workforce, and with their superior computational capabilities, removed human intervention in redundant tasks while creating new opportunities related to the creation and use of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last revolution, 4IR, is often mistaken as a continuation of the third one due to its use of modern technologies. But with its exponential growth and unprecedented scope, 4IR has emerged as its own force to be reckoned with. What distinguishes 4IR is its use of smart technologies, artificial intelligence and the fusion of physical, technological and biological components. Popular technologies that define 4IR include autonomous vehicles, internet of things, virtual reality, biometric identification, genetic and biomedical engineering, robotics and more. These technologies harbour the potential to disrupt the current industries and businesses by interconnecting intelligent devices and machines that can think and work exactly like, or better than, their human counterparts. By enhancing performance, 4IR will streamline production and services. It will decrease human effort by automating existing processes that require manual labor or predictable actions. While this will ease consumer use, it will most definitely replace human workers in the industries. Balancing out the contrasting effects of 4IR is the biggest challenge for policymakers, organisations and businesses in the future too near.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), first coined the term fourth industrial revolution. On the effect of 4IR, he said, “The changes are so profound that, from the perspective of human history, there has never been a time of greater promise or potential peril.”&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;WEF’s report, “Future of Jobs” estimates that about 75 million jobs will be displaced due to the technologies of 4IR. Bangladesh, where the majority of jobs situate in the low-end and manual spectrum, will be affected gravely by this force. The symptoms have already surfaced. The International Labor Organization’s (ILO) report, ‘Asia-Pacific Employment and Social Outlook-2018’ says that unemployment in Bangladesh is on the rise and has doubled in the course of seven years. The Access to Information (a2i) project of the Prime Minister’s Office states that over the past 26 years, 74% employment opportunities have dropped due to automation. In 1990, for every million dollar in export, 545 workers were employed, which dwindled to 142 in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), employment growth has decreased in the four years since 2012, with female workers decreasing in number and a 16% cut at the officer level. The CPD survey covered 2000 workers of 193 readymade garment factories, revealing that from 2005 to 2012, the increase in employment growth stood at 4.01%, which, from 2012 to 2016, became 3.3%. This decline in employment rate comes despite the economic growth the country has been enjoying in recent years. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reveals that in spite of the average annual economic growth of 6.6% from 2013 to 2017, the annual employment generation rate remained at only 0.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This situation will only grow dire in the coming years, as predicted by a government study titled “4IR: Challenge or Opportunity for Bangladesh?” The study says that at least 5.7 million people in five sectors will face job loss by 2041 and around 73 million people will need to be equipped with 4IR skills to develop a future adaptive labor force by 2041. a2i estimates that 60% of the workers in the readymade garment sector will be losing their jobs, along with 55% in the furniture sector, 40% in the agricultural products processing plants, 20% in the leather industry and 20% in the tourism and hospitality sector.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;The country’s youth are the most vulnerable demographic to the changes that will come with 4IR. BBS reveals that 34.3% of the youth are unemployed. A survey report of a local private research organisation Institute of Informatics and Development (IID) says that 84% of the youth feel that their main problem at present is lack of skills and employment, while 28% of them felt that the prevailing educational system hardly helped them in getting jobs. 8% said their education, rather than helping them in employment, became an obstacle instead. The survey was carried out on 11,658 young people in 23 districts of the country in late 2018.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s true that because of 4IR, job loss will be a main challenge but we are optimistic that it will create more job opportunities&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span class=""attribution""&gt;Md Shahidul Haque&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. &lt;p&gt;Despite the alarming statistics and estimations about job displacements and massive unemployment, a silver lining comes with 4IR, like all three of its predecessors, in the form of new jobs. Former foreign secretary Md Shahidul Haque says that, “It’s true that because of 4IR, job loss will be a main challenge but we are optimistic that it will create more job opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WEF report shows that a possible 133 million new jobs will be created. Anir Chowdhury, policy advisor of a2i, says, “We need to re-skill some 75 million people within the next 20 years and within this time frame 20 million people need to come under new skill development projects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign minister AK Abdul Momen states that, “The rate, scale, and scope of this advancement – also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution – are yet to be fully analysed and understood. But, one thing is for sure, the first wave of impact will be on our jobs. New jobs, such as medical roboticists, simulation engineers, or future forecasters will surface.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, economist Anu Muhammad states that a complete upheaval of the human workforce is not possible, since the unemployed population will not be able to afford the automated goods and services, which in turn will cease production. He recommends policies and frameworks to be established by the government, in congruence with private sector entrepreneurs, keeping a balance between automation and stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;The insurgence of automations will also not threaten jobs that require human empathy and ingenuity. Jobs where human guidance or care is needed, like that of teachers and nurses, or creative works like that of artists and authors, cannot be overtaken by smart machines, or at the very least, should not be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shamsul Alam, senior secretary of General Economics Division, Bangladesh Planning Commission, recommends a plan for transitioning to 4IR. The plan emphasises technology adaption through smart and competitive trade policies fueled by an expansive manufacturing sector and populated by workers who would be educated and trained in the technologies of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the core of 4IR lies the rise of advanced technologies, and based on the effect of prior industrial revolutions, the need for specialists and engineers adept in those technologies will rise at a similar pace. Emphasis, therefore, should be placed on strategically guiding the existing workforce to adapt while effectively nurturing the future one to excel. This is where the education system and academia steps in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle the demand for a generation adept in 4IR, the educational structure of today needs to be upgraded. Before higher studies, students should be familiarized, conceptually, with basic STEM curriculum. However, the updated curriculum should not overbear the young minds with a barrage of technical terms and techniques. A school student should not be tasked with perfecting the fundamentals of a programming or scripting language, rather be taught the interesting and fun ways logic and processes, ones they are familiar with in real life, can be structured and configured by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most drastic change in curricular structure should be implemented in universities, where the specialization of knowledge and career occurs. A common issue fresh graduates face when embarking on their careers, as seen in IID’s survey findings, is the discrepancy between what they have been taught and what is required of them in their jobs. Sometimes this discrepancy can even halt or harm their employment opportunities. To mollify this discrepancy, quantitative and digital literacy, computing skills and internship opportunities should be integrated in fields that have not conventionally required it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For integration, the teaching learning methods – syllabus, content, delivery medium – must be upgraded regularly through a continuous quality inspection. Universities must identify how new technologies transformed and evolved the respective job markets for each major or field. Moreover, blended learning should be employed on existing courses, by incorporating media beyond the conventional yet irreplaceable face-to-face one, to make these more practicable and applicable in a 4IR-centric workforce.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;For the generation already done with their education and in the workforce right now, top-up trainings should be conducted, to accommodate them with the new demand. Top-up trainings or degrees refer to schooling on a specific subject equivalent to that of the final year of undergraduate studies. This means workers in the middle of their career will spend a dedicated time for educating themselves, augmenting their skills and professional assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norms like life-long educational and skill-development practices must be cultured and embedded in both academia and professions alike. To improve their human resources in terms of technological competence, industry should collaborate with the academia. Other than providing schooling facilities, academia, through research, can instruct the industries in the technologies to learn, how best to integrate these into their current business operations and how to evolve according to the shifting waves of the fast-expanding 4IR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, as a nation, are standing at a decisive crossroads where both delaying and hastily adopting 4IR will lead to the same perilous path of missed opportunities and economic unrest. The full potential of 4IR can only be enjoyed through extensive research, smart planning and timely implementation. Conversation and collaboration among policy makers, the industry and academia is the key and very first step to our technological salvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Dr. Kazi Muheymin-Us-Sakib is a professor and former director of Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka. &lt;strong&gt;Email: muheymin@gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Syed Fatiul Huq is an alumnus graduate student at Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka and a PhD admit at the University of California, Irvine. &lt;strong&gt;Email: s.f.huq11@gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,

Philosophers often argue that knowledge is neutral, but the use we make of it can bring good or bad consequences. Seeing technology as knowledge, Thomas Ferretti considers ethical and political issues raised by the ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).

 
Technology is knowledge
We often think that acquiring more knowledge is always good. If I acquire the knowledge of calculus, I can now do some things that I could not do before.
Yet, what philosophers call a “consequentialist” perspective might propose instead that knowledge itself is neutral: we must know how I am going to use my knowledge in practice before judging whether it has good or bad consequences. If I use calculus to launch a satellite to monitor climate change, the effects are good. But the same knowledge can be used to calculate missile trajectories in an unjust war.
Because technology like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be understood as the knowledge of specific techniques, skills, and know-how, this perspective has led many to conclude that the technology itself is neutral: only the way we decide to use it in society determines whether it has good or bad effects.
On the positive side, AI and ML have already been used in science to discover new exoplanets by analysing data from telescopes, Google uses these techniques to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in its data centres, and image recognition is used in healthcare to improve diabetic retinopathy detection. But AI could also be used in autonomous weapon systems that could select and attack a human target without being instructed to.
Therefore, whether or not you subscribe to the view that technology is neutral, and setting aside technical problems in value-alignment, the question remains: How can we make sure that technologies like AI and ML are used as a force for good and how to avoid harmful effects?
Knowledge is power
In many people’s minds, AI raises the threat of work automation. Like other technologies, AI will lead to creative destruction and disrupt existing modes of production to replace them with more productive ones. There is, however, some unwarranted alarmism in this domain.
Despite more than a century of unprecedented innovation, we are nowhere near a jobless society. This is because automation has spillover effects on the whole economy: falling prices in sectors where work is automated allow customers to spend more in other sectors, and increasing demand for new goods and services keeps us working.
Yet, creative destruction always involves winners and losers. How we choose to manage these economic transformations will make a difference in the distributive impact of AI. To mitigate potentially unfair inequalities, governments should implement policies such as adequate unemployment benefits, retraining programs, and public investments to improve labour markets.
Besides automation, the increasing adoption of AI gives rise to a range of ethical issues calling for careful consideration. For example: AI coupled with facial recognition can enable widespread surveillance; AI can also threaten privacy by facilitating the analysis and exploitation of large-scale, sensitive datasets such as medical records; ML can lead to algorithmic bias and discrimination by reproducing historic injustice ; and algorithmic decision-making is often opaque, sometimes even to engineers who cannot explain how their AI system is able to produce relevant results, which is a problem for transparency and accountability in decision-making.
More generally, when investigating the potentially harmful effects of AI, it is important to remember that knowledge is power. If knowledge enables me to do things that I could not do before, this means that it increases my power. Therefore, if some people have access to new technology and others do not, and if people who are already in powerful positions can use it to further increase their power, this can exacerbate already existing power imbalances in society.
Power requires legitimacy
We need principles of AI ethics and institutional safeguards to make sure that these principles are implemented in practice. This is important to protect us all from harmful effects and potential abuses of power by the ones wielding this new technology.
Yet, in pluralistic societies, we must expect moral disagreements about the proper use of AI. Reaching a compromise between citizens requires legitimate consensus-building strategies:
AI ethics principles and institutional safeguards should be selected through legitimate decision procedures that everyone could agree on. Examples include consultations led by UNESCO, the Montreal Declaration, and government initiatives (e.g. UK, Canada, Europe) bringing together all stakeholders to deliberate on the responsible use of AI.
The use of AI in public administration and business should also be subjected to public scrutiny to make sure that agreed principles are adequately interpreted and implemented in practice and to hold decision-makers accountable when they are not.
Navigating the opportunities and complex ethical challenges of the fourth industrial revolution thus requires the collaboration of governments, businesses, and all of us.

This is the best summary of the ethics of not only artificial intelligence I have read. The insights are thorough going and deep. I especially liked the clarity Mr. Ferretti brings to war with AI. War is never an even game. But the advantages given to those with powerful robotic destroying machines combined with AI is more than unnerving. Is it possible that no humans would survive such a war? What are the consequences of one side totally annihilating the enemy army? This has always been considered to be unadvisable for many reasons. Even the most ruthless of conquerors of the past have never considered the possibility of such. They always considered that it reduced their power. Genghis Khan is a prime example. He always keep the artisans such as blacksmiths and weapons makers. He also keep the beautiful women. And not surprisingly, he kept the warriors that swore fealty to him. What is fealty to an AI machine? There are many unanswered questions from Mr. Ferretti’s post. Nothing better could result than unanswered questions.

Every day, some little piece of logic constructed by very specific bits of artificial intelligence technology makes decisions that affect how you experience the world. It could be the ads that get served up to you on social media or shopping sites, or the facial recognition that unlocks your phone, or the directions you take to get to wherever you're going. These discreet, unseen decisions are being made largely by algorithms created by machine learning (ML), a segment of artificial intelligence technology that is trained to identify correlation between sets of data and their outcomes. We've been hearing in movies and TV for years that computers control the world, but we've finally reached the point where the machines are making real autonomous decisions about stuff. Welcome to the future, I guess.
In my days as a staffer at Ars, I wrote no small amount about artificial intelligence and machine learning. I talked with data scientists who were building predictive analytic systems based on terabytes of telemetry from complex systems, and I babbled with developers trying to build systems that can defend networks against attacks—or, in certain circumstances, actually stage those attacks. I've also poked at the edges of the technology myself, using code and hardware to plug various things into AI programming interfaces (sometimes with horror-inducing results, as demonstrated by Bearlexa).Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

Many of the problems to which ML can be applied are tasks whose conditions are obvious to humans. That's because we're trained to notice those problems through observation—which cat is more floofy or at what time of day traffic gets the most congested. Other ML-appropriate problems could be solved by humans as well given enough raw data—if humans had a perfect memory, perfect eyesight, and an innate grasp of statistical modeling, that is.
But machines can do these tasks much faster because they don't have human limitations. And ML allows them to do these tasks without humans having to program out the specific math involved. Instead, an ML system can learn (or at least ""learn"") from the data given to it, creating a problem-solving model itself.
This bootstrappy strength can also be a weakness, however. Understanding how the ML system arrived at its decision process is usually impossible once the ML algorithm is built (despite ongoing work to create explainable ML). And the quality of the results depends a great deal on the quality and the quantity of the data. ML can only answer questions that are discernible from the data itself. Bad data or insufficient data yields inaccurate models and bad machine learning. Ars VideoHow The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio
Despite my prior adventures, I've never done any actual building of machine-learning systems. I'm a jack of all tech trades, and while I'm good on basic data analytics and running all sorts of database queries, I do not consider myself a data scientist or an ML programmer. My past Python adventures are more about hacking interfaces than creating them. And most of my coding and analytics skills have, of late, been turned toward exploiting ML tools for very specific purposes related to information security research.
My only real superpower is not being afraid to try and fail. And with that, readers, I am here to flex that superpower.
The task at hand
Here is a task that some Ars writers are exceptionally good at: writing a solid headline. (Beth Mole, please report to collect your award.)
And headline writing is hard! It's a task with lots of constraints—length being the biggest (Ars headlines are limited to 70 characters), but nowhere near the only one. It is a challenge to cram into a small space enough information to accurately and adequately tease a story, while also including all the things you have to put into a headline (the traditional ""who, what, where, when, why, and how many"" collection of facts). Some of the elements are dynamic—a ""who"" or a ""what"" with a particularly long name that eats up the character count can really throw a wrench into things.
Plus, we know from experience that Ars readers do not like clickbait and will fill up the comments section with derision when they think they see it. We also know that there are some things that people will click on without fail. And we also know that regardless of the topic, some headlines result in more people clicking on them than others. (Is this clickbait? There's a philosophical argument there, but the primary thing that separates ""a headline everyone wants to click on"" from ""clickbait"" is the headline's honesty—does the story beneath the headline fully deliver on the headline's promise?)
Regardless, we know that some headlines are more effective than others because we do A/B testing of headlines. Every Ars article starts with two possible headlines assigned to it, and then the site presents both alternatives on the home page for a short period to see which one pulls in more traffic.
There have been a few studies done by data scientists with much more experience in data modeling and machine learning that have looked into what distinguishes ""clickbait"" headlines (ones designed strictly for getting large numbers of people to click through to an article) from ""good"" headlines (ones that actually summarize the articles behind them effectively and don't make you write lengthy complaints about the headlines on Twitter or in the comments). But these studies have been focused on understanding the content of the headlines rather than how many actual clicks they get. 
To get a picture of what readers appear to like in a headline—and to try to understand how to write better headlines for the Ars audience—I grabbed a set of 500 of the most quickly clicked Ars headlines from the past five years and did some natural language processing on them. After stripping out the ""stop words""—the most commonly occurring words in the English language that are typically not associated with the theme of the headline—I generated a word cloud to see what themes drive the most attention.
Here it is: the shape of Ars headlines.
Enlarge / A wordcloud of the most common words that have appeared in Ars headlines over the last five years.
There is a whole lot of Trump in there—the last few years have included a lot of tech news involving the administration, so it's probably inevitable. But these are just the words from some of the winning headlines. I wanted to get a sense of what the difference between winning and losing headlines were. So I again took the corpus of all Ars headline pairs and split them between winners and losers. These are the winners:
Enlarge / These words come from headlines that won the A/B test...
And here are the losers:
Enlarge / ...and these words came from headlines that lost.
Remember that these headlines were written for the exact same stories as the winning headlines were. And for the most part, they use the same words—with some notable differences. There's a whole lot less ""Trump"" in the losing headlines. ""Million"" is heavily favored in winning headlines, but somewhat less so in losing ones. And the word ""may""—a pretty indecisive headline word—is found more frequently in losing headlines than winning ones.
This is interesting information, but it doesn't in itself help predict whether a headline for any given story will be successful. Would it be possible to use ML to predict whether a headline would get more or fewer clicks? Could we use the accumulated wisdom of Ars readers to make a black box that could predict which headlines would be more successful?
Hell if I know, but we're going to try.
All this brings us to where we are now: Ars has given me data on over 5,500 headline tests over the past four years—11,000 headlines, each with their rate of click-throughs. My mission is to build a machine learning model that can calculate what makes a good Ars headline. And by ""good,"" I mean one that appeals to you, dear Ars reader. To accomplish this, I have been given a small budget for Amazon Web Services compute resources and a month of nights and weekends (I have a day job, after all). No problem, right?
Before I started hunting Stack Exchange and various Git sites for magical solutions, however, I wanted to ground myself in what's possible with ML and look at what more talented people than I have already done with it. This research is as much of a roadmap for potential solutions as it is a source of inspiration.

A power plant that will run on “artificial intelligence” is about to get underway in West Africa. The joint venture between Swiss-based Xcell Security House and Finance and U.S.-based Beyond Limits will embed intelligence and awareness into the operations — something that will create more efficiencies, greater productivity, and increased environmental protections. 


When ordinary people hear about artificial intelligence — AI for short — they immediately think about how machines will replace humans. But as the experts explained to this reporter, AI is meant to eliminate “mundane activities” so that those running heavy industrial operations can solve problems and improve performance, which translates into healthier bottom lines.

“Nothing we build is designed to replace a person,” says Michael Krause, senior manager for oil and gas at Beyond Limits. “People need to make decisions. But AI can remove that mundane component of their work and allow managers to focus on the value-added part.” 

PROMOTED
Krause likens the exercise to a chess match: There are millions of potential strategies for humans to pursue — each one a function of intelligence and experience. But AI will provide the context so that better decisions are made. In other words, the machines will play millions of games and memorize all potential patterns — something that people cannot do. An algorithm is created that incorporates the data and that is updated in real-time. 

In the case of Xcell, humans can make adjustments to improve efficiencies. But they have limits. AI, by contrast, can monitor an entire system and account for all variables. As for power plants, the technology can help managers balance supply and demand issues, maintain their plants, and improve safety measures. When AI’s algorithms are combined with cloud computing and high-speed 5G networks, the true potential is realized: companies will have a holistic view that leverages the data, giving them a competitive advantage.

According to McKinsey & Company, AI and digitization can increase asset productivity by up to 20% while also reducing maintenance costs by 10%. And IDC, a market intelligence business, says that spending on such technologies will more than double from $50 billion today to $110 billion in 2024.

“One of the keys to power operations is handling variations in supply and demand,” says Lynnwood Farr, chief executive of Xcell. “We feel that (AI) will give us the upper hand to control costs and maintain efficient, dependable power generation for our customers.”

The same AI tools can predict weather patterns. That will allow grid operators to more accurately gauge when wind and solar resources will be available for use. Reliability is therefore bolstered.
Endless Possibilities 
To give AI a practical context, we can focus on the need to reduce CO2 emissions and specifically, President Biden’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by mid-century. According to Beyond Limits’ Krause, AI can reduce CO2 emissions between 1%-10% by improving industrial processes and reducing downtime. No, AI does not take the carbon out of fossil fuels. But AI can, for example, help power plants or oil companies decide where to bury the CO2 — a way to offset future emissions until renewable energy might replace those fuels. 
Engineers, for example, are also building three-dimensional models that allow them to test where to locate oil and gas wells. Most of that time is spent gathering data from various silos — a repetitive exercise that is time-consuming and that requires a lot of manual labor. AI allows those engineers to gather and upload that data before they receive intelligence on where to place those wells. And that has endless possibilities, which can improve drilling performance and limit environmental costs. 
Beyond Limits and NVIDIA are using AI to identify the best locations for their wells — a process that they say will improve the net present value of those assets by 10%. How? The timeline to place a well is reduced from months to hours, netting a company millions of dollars and thereby creating a quicker return on investment.
The companies say that the same actions can be used when it comes to storing CO2 underground. That is, the technology can single out the best CO2 injection points across depleted fields. “We can identify the best place to put a well and to inject CO2 underground, says Krause. “AI can’t make that decision for them. But it can provide the context they need to make those decisions for themselves.”
Artificial intelligence is not about robots doing the jobs of humans. It is about taking a holistic view of the company and gathering data to improve productivity, limit expenses, and reduce environmental costs — a process that is now possible because of bandwidth capacity and cloud technologies. AI can develop algorithms and thus eliminate repetitive tasks, allowing managers to add value: organizations that are increasing productivity while minimizing costs will be globally competitive and capable of hiring more workers.

I can’t tell you how excited I am to have you here with me, and I hope between us we can build not just a newsletter, but a news community.Sign up to TechScape, Alex Hern’s weekly tech newsletterCopilotSometimes there’s a story that just sums up all the hopes and fears of its entire field. Here’s one.GitHub is a platform that lets developers collaborate on coding with colleagues, friends and strangers around the world, and host the results. Owned by Microsoft since 2018, the site is the largest host of source code in the world, and a crucial part of many companies’ digital infrastructure.Late last month, GitHub launched a new AI tool, called Copilot. Here’s how chief executive Nat Friedman described it:
A new AI pair programmer that helps you write better code. It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously tailor a search for answers on the internet. As you type, it adapts to the way you write code – to help you complete your work faster.
In other words, Copilot will sit on your computer and do a chunk of your coding work for you. There’s a long-running joke in the coding community that a substantial portion of the actual work of programming is searching online for people who’ve solved the same problems as you, and copying their code into your program. Well, now there’s an AI that will do that part for you.And the stunning thing about Copilot is that, for a whole host of common problems … it works. Programmers I have spoken to say it is as stunning as the first time text from GPT-3 began popping up on the web. You may remember that, it’s the superpowerful text-generation AI that writes paragraphs like:
The mission for this op-ed is perfectly clear. I am to convince as many human beings as possible not to be afraid of me. Stephen Hawking has warned that AI could “spell the end of the human race”. I am here to convince you not to worry. Artificial intelligence will not destroy humans. Believe me.
CentaursIt’s tempting, when imagining how tech will change the world, to think of the future as one where humans are basically unnecessary. As AI systems manage to tackle increasingly complex domains, with increasing competence, it’s easy enough to think of them as being able to achieve everything a person can, leaving the human that used to be employed doing the same thing with idle hands.Whether that is a nightmare or a utopia, of course, depends on how you think society would adapt to such a change. Would huge numbers of people be freed to live a life of leisure, supported by the AIs that do their jobs in their stead? Or would they instead find themselves unemployed and unemployable, with their former managers reaping the rewards of the increased productivity an hour worked?But it’s not always the case that AI is here to replace us. Instead, more and more fields are exploring the possibility of using the technology to work alongside people, extending their abilities, and taking the drudge work from their jobs while leaving them to handle the things that a human does best.The concept’s come to be called a “centaur” – because it leads to a hybrid worker who has an AI back half and human front. It’s not as futuristic as it sounds: anyone who’s used autocorrect on an iPhone has, in effect, teamed up with an AI to offload the laborious task of typing correctly.Often, centaurs can come close to the dystopian vision. Amazon’s warehouse employees, for instance, have been gradually pushed along a very similar path as the company seeks to eke out every efficiency improvement possible. The humans are guided, tracked and assessed throughout the working day, ensuring that they always take the optimal route through the warehouse, pick exactly the right items, and do so at a consistent rate high enough to let the company turn a healthy profit. They’re still employed to do things that only humans can offer – but in this case, that’s “working hands and a low maintenance bill”.But in other fields, centaurs are already proving their worth. The world of competitive chess has, for years, had a special format for such hybrid players: humans working with the assistance of a chess computer. And, generally, the pairs play better than either would on their own: the computer avoids stupid errors, plays without getting tired, and presents a list of high-value options to the human player, who’s able to inject a dose of unpredictability and lateral thinking into the game.That’s the future GitHub hopes Copilot will be able to introduce. Programmers who use it can stop worrying about simple, welldocumented tasks, like how to send a valid request to Twitter’s API, or how to pull the time in hours and minutes from a system clock, and start focusing their effort on the work that no one else has done.But …The reason why Copilot is fascinating to me isn’t just the positive potential, though. It’s also that, in one release, the company seems to have fallen into every single trap plaguing the broader AI sector.Copilot was trained on public data from Github’s own platform. That means all of that source code, from hundreds of millions of developers around the world, was used to teach it how to write code based on user prompts.That’s great if the problem is a simple programming task. It’s less good if the prompt for autocomplete is, say, secret credentials that you use to sign into user account. And yet:
GitHubCopilot gave me a [Airbnb] link with a key that still works (and stops working when changing it).
And:
The AI is leaking [sendgrid] API keys that are valid and still functional.
The vast majority of what we call AI today isn’t coded but trained: you give it a great pile of stuff, and tell it to work out for itself the relationships between that stuff. With the vast sum of code available in Github’s repository, there are plenty of examples for Copilot to learn what code that checks the time looks like. But there are also plenty of examples for Copilot to learn what an API key accidentally uploaded in public looks like – and to then share it onwards.Passwords and keys are obviously the worst examples of this sort of leakage, but they point to the underlying concern about a lot of AI technology: is it actually creating things, or is it simply remixing work already done by other humans? And if the latter, should those humans get a say in how their work is used?Sign up for TechScape: Alex Hern’s weekly guide to the world of technology Read moreOn that latter question, GitHub’s answer is a forceful no. “Training machine learning models on publicly available data is considered fair use across the machine learning community,” the company says in an FAQ.Originally, the company made the much softer claim that doing so was merely “common practice”. But the page was updated after coders around the world complained that GitHub was violating their copyright. Intriguingly, the biggest opposition came not from private companies concerned that their work may have been reused, but from developers in the open-source community, who deliberately build in public to let their work be built upon in turn. Those developers often rely on copyright to ensure that people who use open-source code have to publish what they create – something GitHub didn’t do.GitHub is probably right on the law, according to legal professor James Grimmelmann. But the company isn’t going to be the last to reveal a groundbreaking new AI tool and then face awkward questions over whether it actually has the rights to the data used to train it.If you want to read more please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterArtificial intelligence (AI)FacebookGoogleProgrammingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policy‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These themes, of which artificial intelligence is one, are best thought of as “any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night”, and by tracking and combining them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels.
According to GlobalData analysis, Bayer AG is one of the artificial intelligence leaders in a list of high-revenue companies in the pharma industry, having advertised for 241 positions in artificial intelligence, made six deals related to the field, filed nine patents and mentioned artificial intelligence three times in company filings between January 2020 and June 2021.
Our analysis classified eight companies as Most Valuable Players – or MVPs – due to their high number of new jobs, deals, patents and company filings mentions in the field of artificial intelligence. An additional 10 companies are classified as Market Leaders and zero are Average Players. Three more companies are classified as Late Movers due to their relatively lower levels of jobs, deals, patents and company filings in artificial intelligence.
For the purpose of this analysis, we’ve ranked top companies in the pharma sector on each of the four metrics relating to artificial intelligence: jobs, deals, patents and company filings. The best-performing companies – the ones ranked at the top across all or most metrics – were categorised as MVPs while the worst performers – companies ranked at the bottom of most indicators – were classified as Late Movers.

AstraZeneca Plc is spearheading the artificial intelligence hiring race, advertising for 676 new jobs between January 2020 and June 2021. The company reached peak hiring in April 2021, when it listed 73 new job ads related to artificial intelligence.
Johnson & Johnson followed AstraZeneca Plc as the second most proactive artificial intelligence employer, advertising for 616 new positions. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd was third with 545 new job listings.

When it comes to deals, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co leads with seven new artificial intelligence deals announced from January 2020 to June 2021. The company was followed by Bayer AG with six deals and Novartis AG with five.
GlobalData's Financial Deals Database covers hundreds of thousands of M&A contracts, private equity deals, venture finance deals, private placements, IPOs and partnerships, and it serves as an indicator of economic activity within a sector.

One of the most innovative pharma companies in recent months was F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, having filed 17 patent applications related to artificial intelligence since the beginning of last year. It was followed by Bayer AG with nine patents and Sanofi with seven.
GlobalData collects patent filings from 100+ counties and jurisdictions. These patents are then tagged according to the themes they relate to, including artificial intelligence, based on specific keywords and expert input. The patents are also assigned to a company to identify the most innovative players in a particular field.

Finally, artificial intelligence was a commonly mentioned theme in pharma company filings. Pfizer Inc mentioned artificial intelligence six times in its corporate reports between January 2020 and June 2021. AstraZeneca Plc filings mentioned it four times and GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) mentioned it four times.

How to prepare for the AI productivity boom

Why It Matters		



After years of decline, productivity is poised to accelerate. The next challenge is preparing workers, and making sure benefits aren’t distributed unequally.

The last 15 years have brought what Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson calls the “productivity paradox.” While there’s been continuing advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence, automation, and teleconferencing tools, the U.S. and other countries have seen flagging productivity.
But a productivity boom is coming soon, Brynjolfsson said at the recent EmTech Next conference hosted by MIT Technology Review.  He pointed to advances in technology, particularly artificial intelligence programs that are as good as — or better — than humans at some things. Businesses should now focus on incorporating the technology into work processes and preparing employees, he said, and policymakers should make sure its adoption doesn’t contribute to inequality.
Brynjolfsson has been tracking the lag between introduction of artificial intelligence and corresponding productivity gains. United States productivity grew by about 1.3% in the past decade, he said, compared to more than 2.8% in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This productivity slowdown extends to other countries as well, according to research from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Brynjolfsson predicted a productivity J-curve, in which productivity declines after a technology is introduced and then rises when businesses have been able to integrate technologies into their workflow, a trajectory over time that has a J-shape.
“I think we’re near the bottom of that J-curve right now and we’re about to see the takeoff,” Brynjolfsson said.
The productivity paradox: why productivity declined despite new technology
Lagging productivity can be explained two main ways, Brynjolfsson said.
Mismeasurement. Productivity is traditionally measured using a country’s gross domestic product, which is based on things that are bought and sold. But many digital goods — teleconferencing, smartphone apps, Wikipedia — are available for free. Even though people get some benefit from these goods, they don’t show up in productivity statistics. The information sector’s share of the economy has barely budged since the 1980s, Brynjolfsson noted. “I think most of us realize that’s just not a real representation of what’s going on,” he said.
Happiness surveys also fail to capture the complete picture. Brynjolfsson suggested a new metric called GDP-B that would measure the benefit people gain from items. “I think it’s far from perfect, but it’s a lot more precise than happiness, and I think it’s a lot more meaningful than GDP,” he said.
Implementation and restructuring in businesses. It isn’t enough to just add new technology to an organization. Companies need a complete paradigm shift. “To get the full benefit, leaders need to rethink business processes, management practices, and employee skills,” Brynjolfsson said.
This “intangible organizational capital” is essential for companies to see benefit from technological advances, but many companies put misplaced focus on technology itself.  
“The complete reconceptualization of a business process takes a lot. More creativity, effort, and frankly, time, than simply plugging in new technologies into old business processes,” he said. “We just haven’t been doing that in most industries.”
The productivity boom: seeing gains from powerful technology
About a decade ago, machine learning programs had about 70% accuracy, Brynjolfsson said. They have improved rapidly, to the point that they are now better than humans at identifying some things. This makes it more likely that organizations will move to integrate this technology into their business practices as entrepreneurs and managers gravitate toward these often cheaper and more efficient approaches.
“We don’t need any additional advances in technology to be able to have enormous effects on productivity and wages,” he said. “What we do need is some significant changes in business processes. We need to rethink the way work gets done.”
There are signs more businesses are taking advantage of artificial intelligence programs. The 2021 AI Index report, which Brynjolfsson co-authored, found increases in not just the quality of artificial intelligence, but also business investment in the technology. The biggest increase was in the field of drug discovery and other biological uses of AI, with a 4.5% increase in investment in drug discovery in the last year. 
Powerful technology is available, and every organization has an opportunity to benefit from it, he said. Successful firms will be prepared with the skills needed in the future, and leaders should focus on reskilling their workforce.
The next challenge: making sure everyone benefits
Replacing labor with capital — and human work with technology — brings concerns about decreased wages and increased inequality. Brynjolfsson’s research has documented how machine learning affects different skills and occupations, and found that there isn’t one occupation where machine learning could do all the different tasks. While machine learning will likely reorganize work, it won’t mean the end of work or entire occupations, he said.
But the effects will likely be uneven. “The economic pie could get bigger, but that doesn’t mean everyone’s going to benefit,” Brynjolfsson said. There’s been some evidence of this happening, he said, with his research also indicating machine learning is more likely to affect low-wage occupations.
Inequality isn’t inevitable, though. Brynjolfsson argued that to a large extent, it is the result of tax and education policies. He suggested three measures that companies, institutions, and policymakers can take to make sure all workers benefit from the productivity boom:
Reskilling the workforce. Taking advantage of AI and other technologies require different sets of skills. “I’m not just talking about more machine learning experts. I’m talking about people who do more creative work,” Brynjolfsson said. And while machines are able to do rote, repetitive work, companies will need people who are skilled at interpersonal, emotional connections.
Adjusting tax policy. Capital is taxed at a lower rate than labor, which might push companies to favor technology over workers. Brynjolfsson suggested leveling the playing field, or introducing measures such as earned income tax credits that help subsidize work.
Focusing on technologies that augment workers instead of replace them. Brynjolfsson said he is working on research that shows how technologists are focused on creating programs that replicate human skills. “While that may be a fun goal, it actually isn’t a particularly good one in terms of helping reduce inequality. It tends to drive down wages,” he said. “I’d rather have them focused on augmenting human labor.”

U.S. Special Forces Want an Edge over China. Is Artificial Intelligence the Answer?
Artificial Intelligence utilizes computers and machine learning to simulate the human mind’s problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, easing the cognitive load on humans, enabling quicker decision-making and follow-on actions.

Artificial Intelligence is everywhere today. From Amazon’s Alexa to unmanned aerial vehicles to space crafts to health care; Artificial Intelligence enables faster and better decisions if employed properly.

The U.S. military and intelligence community have been using this technology for decades now and it’s becoming increasingly more prevalent. With the apparent return of Great Power Competition—the struggle for influence, leverage, and resources between the U.S. and its near-peer competitors China and Russia—the special operations community, the tip of the spear of the U.S. military, has been investing more in Artificial Intelligence technologies 

What is Artificial Intelligence?
In short, Artificial Intelligence utilizes computers and machine learning to simulate the human mind’s problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, easing the cognitive load on humans, enabling quicker decision-making and follow-on actions.





Nowadays, in an age of information overload, the issue the military and intelligence community have to deal with isn’t having too little data to work with as it once may have been, but rather how to process all of the available data to find and utilize what is important quickly and efficiently.

That is where Artificial Intelligence, as a filtering and selection mission-planning tool, can come in and sift out the data that is just noise to provide commanders, decision-makers, and troops with the only information they need to do their job. It’s a tall order, for sure, but doable with the right approach and priorities.

Artificial Intelligence & Special Operations
General Richard Clarke, SOCOM’s commander, has emphasized the importance of Artificial Intelligence and cyberwarfare, going as far as to suggest that the future of U.S. special operations might not be with the Delta Force operator on the ground but rather with the cyber commando behind a keyboard.
Within the Department of Defense, SOCOM has been a pioneer in the application of Artificial Intelligence. For example, the Naval Special Warfare Command (WARCOM) has been using Artificial Intelligence to find ways to make its SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators more combat effective, while the Marines Special Operations Command (MARSOC) has been implementing Artificial Intelligence to better select and assess its future cadre of Marine Raiders.

“Artificial Intelligence should assist a commander or operator to make better decisions, not make the decisions for them, and that’s where I think a lot of people get it mixed,” Herm Hasken a partner and senior operations consultant at MarkPoint Technologies, told Sandboxx News.

Hasken has several combat deployments and extensive special operations and intelligence community experience, including time with the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), National Security Agency (NSA), as well as the chief cryptologist for the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
MarkPoint Technologies provides body-worn sensors that process and distribute signals detected in the proximity of the operator to U.S. government partners. Such advanced computing introduced in the tactical domain gives an advantage to special operators and makes them more effective.
“In some cases, Artificial Intelligence might help you process and act upon very simple tasks in order to reduce the cognitive load on the operator—doing some things for you, so you won’t spend time worrying about it, receiving data and making sense of it in the midst of a deluge of data coming at you,” Hasken added.

Related: WHAT SPECIAL OPERATORS SAY ABOUT THE ARMED OVERWATCH PROGRAM
SOCOM is partnering with the private industry and academia to improve its Artificial Intelligence capabilities. An online course collaboration between SOCOM and MIT is part of this outreach effort. In the launching of the course, Clarke said that Artificial Intelligence and data-driven technology are integral parts of SOCOM’s preparation to maintain its qualitative advantage over its competitors and also to ensure that its commandos are ready for renewed Great Power Competition. 
A Precarious Edge
However, SOCOM, and indeed the Pentagon, are having trouble attracting top talent. In a recent Global SOF Foundation forum, Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Chief Technical Officer Nand Mulchandani said that pay, location, and the necessary inconveniences that come with military life—he offered a personal example of him having to fly from California to Washington D.C. to work because that is where a secured computer with access to a classified network is located—hamstring recruiting efforts. And although that has always been true about the military, it is slightly different when recruiting individuals with high-value skills and not just grunts or box kickers.
“SOCOM and JSOC need more data analytics and processing. Take for example the Iron Dome system in Israel. The only data it needs is that a missile is in the air, heading toward Israel, and where it can intercept and destroy it. That’s the only AI it needs. To detect, see, and stop it. If the AI can do the same for an operator, that’s the AI I want. I need to basically perform the same function: what’s coming after me, where do I meet it, and how do I stop it?” Hasken added.

Artificial Intelligence isn’t without vulnerabilities, both internal and external. Enemy tampering and attacks can hamper weapon systems and technology that rely on Artificial Intelligence, while a simple coding error or data oversight can have the same result, with potentially grave consequences for the troops on the ground. For example, a programmer can train Artificial Intelligence to look for specific faces of people for targeting purposes but small, intentional changes to those faces might mislead it, even if humans wouldn’t readily notice the difference.
To maintain a military edge over its near-peer competitors, the U.S. military and its special operations forces need to continue to invest in Artificial Intelligence but also have realistic aims that will translate into operational and tactical advantages on the ground.

To solve mysteries of the universe, scientists use powerful particle accelerators and detectors. These enormous machines generate millions of particle collisions and petabytes of data every second. The sheer amount of data outpaces the rate at which the detector can transfer it — a growing problem with even more advanced experiments on the horizon.

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded Fermilab engineer Farah Fahim, Ph.D., an Early Career Research Award to work on a solution. She’ll apply the $2.5 million grant to her work, which uses neural networks and machine learning to create efficient hardware for data processing at source. Converting the raw data locally into higher-level, lower-volume information overcomes the data transfer bottleneck. In addition, it enables real-time data-processing, which will accelerate discoveries.
Fahim’s efforts center on the Large Hadron Collider, the 27-kilometer particle accelerator at CERN. There, protons smash together and produce other particles that whiz through a detector. One component, the pixel detector, is the size of a shoebox. It’s layered with 65 million pixels that pick up the particles’ movements. Knowing which pixels a particle touched tells researchers about its trajectory.
But with so many pixels and particle paths to map, the issue of creating too much data too quickly to process arises. Fahim wants to see whether using neural networks in small areas within the pixel detector can help, a technique called “artificial intelligence on-chip.”
Neural networks use a series of processing “nodes,” each transmitting a tiny piece of information that builds into an informative picture. Machine learning could teach a neural network to identify shapes or patterns and help them recognize the particles as they pass through the pixel detector. The ML algorithm would allow it to send information about interesting particle paths to researchers without having to send out raw data from each pixel, overcoming the communication challenge.
“Instead of sending this voluminous amount of data even to the edge of the chip and then processing it, can we just do this right in the beginning, within the pixel where the data is generated, and get some useful information?” Fahim said.
Neural networks are often huge powerful circuits made up of hundreds of nodes. But Fahim will use several smaller, more energy-efficient networks that specialize in data classification to recognize patterns in the pixel detector. She will try different techniques for compact on-chip AI, including using nanoscale materials to add electrical components called “memristors.” Scaling down neural networks and AI technology to fit directly on a chip means adding intelligent data processing into small areas, right in the detector.
“The long-term objective is real-time particle track reconstruction,” said Fahim, though she knows that goal might be beyond the scope of the award, which funds research over five years. “We will contribute one drop of knowledge about how to locally analyze this information and how to transform the data.”
In addition to experiments at the LHC, Fahim’s research could have applications in experiments and facilities at several U.S. national labs. They include the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment hosted by Fermilab; the Electron Ion Collider hosted by Brookhaven National Laboratory; and at light sources, such as LCLS-II at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. For Fahim, the award is an acknowledgment that her work creating new, efficient data-processing hardware is becoming increasingly valuable. She is one of the first engineers to win the award in high-energy physics.
Fahim has a doctorate in electrical engineering and has worked at Fermilab for 12 years, developing pixel detectors for a variety of applications. She became the deputy head of Fermilab’s quantum science program in 2019. She is also the head of the Application Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, research and development department, which focuses on building circuits for potential application in detectors, quantum, AI and 5G/6G communication.
“I am impressed by her entrepreneurial and innovative approach, and the fact that she’s not afraid to try new things,” said Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of Fermilab’s quantum science program. “She puts in a lot of effort, and the combination of hard work, technical expertise, leadership and team-building skills, and innovative ideas is what will solve this multifaceted challenge.”
Fermilab is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy. The Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

 Operation Night Watch: How Rijksmuseum Tapped AI To Restore A Rembrandt

In 2019, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam embarked on a multiyear restoration of Rembrandt van Rijn’s 1642 masterwork, “The Night Watch.” The painting, which had weathered vandalism and a major trimming in 1715 that lopped off its top and left portions, began undergoing a restoration in public view: a glass case was constructed around the canvas in the museum’s gallery, allowing visitors and an online audience to witness restorers at work. More recently, Operation Night Watch, as it is known, turned its focus to a central facet of the conservation project: reconstructing the missing parts of the painting, long lost since the 18th century. 
To do so, the Rijksmuseum referenced a copy of the work, made by Dutch painter Gerrit Lundens between 1642 and 1655, and called on high-tech scanners and artificial intelligence (AI), training neural networks that could, quite simply, “paint like Rembrandt.” The missing segments were then printed and mounted to recompose the painting. And last month, three centuries after its debut, the Rijksmuseum unveiled the restored and reconstructed “Night Watch,” presenting a full view of the piece as Rembrandt might have painted it.

“The Night Watch,” which was altered in 1715 to fit into Amsterdam’s City Hall (above), was reconstructed by the Rijksmuseum (below) using AI and a copy of the work by Dutch painter Gerrit Lundens. Image: Rijksmuseum
The Rijksmuseum’s high-profile use of AI to study, preserve, and restore art cements the technology’s expanding role in museums’ conservation efforts. 
Art restoration is a challenging craft — practically, ethically, and theoretically. “There are two schools of thought in [art] restoration,” says Lisa Rosen, Director of Fine Art Restoration in New York City, who’s practiced the craft since 1986. “In Italy, where I learned over many years, they teach you not to falsify or recreate the missing area exactly. You have to go down a tone so that your retouching is noticeable. And here in America, the galleries and people that sell art don’t want to see the difference; they want it to be perfect, like an invisible mend.”
There’s no set methodology for restoring art, as each piece has its unique history, and has aged and been damaged in individual ways. “Each piece is so very different, and you get to know each work very intimately,” Rosen says. Technology, though, is giving the process a boost. “Lately, [art restoration professionals] have been using microbes to clean marbles in Italy,” she adds. “They set up a room, brought different samples of microbes in, and put them on top of the marbles that were filthy and stained. These microbes ate away at the stains and cleaned it perfectly.”
Museums’ in-house teams of conservation and restoration specialists are also finding themselves newly armed with an array of high-tech conservation tools. From 3D imaging and reluctance transformation imaging that virtually moves light across scanned image surfaces to infrared heating tools that enable zero-contact conservation, technology is rapidly empowering professionals in art restoration sectors.

Robert Erdmann, Senior Scientist at Rijksmuseum and Professor at the University of Amsterdam, tells Jing Culture and Commerce that restoration professionals should see these technological advancements, particularly AI, as tools, not threats, to the industry. “AI is not replacing anyone,” Erdmann says. “I’m not replacing a traditional restorer, because I’m not doing restoration. I am making tools to make them all more powerful at what they do. We’re bringing the power of the computer and the image to help museum professionals do their work better, and not replacing anyone at all.”
Below, Erdmann and Casper van der Kruit, Press Officer of Rijksmuseum, expand on the museum’s thinking behind Operation Night Watch.
Why was the restoration of “The Night Watch” important to the Rijksmuseum? And why conduct the process in public?
Robert Erdmann: The “Night Watch” is the centerpiece of the Rijksmuseum; it’s the biggest painting that we have from Rembrandt. It is probably the most important painting that we have in the Rijksmuseum. So when people go to the museum, they expect to be able to see it. We can satisfy both of these needs at the same time by doing our work in front of the public. This is an opportunity to educate the public about how much effort and expertise and how many people and amazing technologies go into the behind-the-scenes work at the Rijksmuseum. It will make them appreciate more how important these works are to us. In many cases, for young people, it will show them the possibility of additional careers in the museum related to things like science and engineering.
Casper van der Kruit: We want to be transparent on everything we do. This is the most important painting we have, and we do not want to take it away, do everything in secrecy, and then bring it back — ta-dah, here it is. No, we want the whole world to see every step we take to do the conservation of this important painting. Nothing is hidden from the public; we want to be as transparent as possible to our audience on what we are doing, especially because this is such an important painting.

“The reconstruction of the missing pieces is a public face of how artificial intelligence is being used here,” says Robert Erdmann, Senior Scientist at Rijksmuseum. Image: Rijksmuseum / Reinier Gerritsen
Could you outline how AI was used in Operation Night Watch?
Erdmann: In the Rijksmuseum, the reconstruction of the missing pieces is a public face of how artificial intelligence is being used here. For example, when we take hundreds of photographs of an artwork so they’re very high resolution, the way these photographs get fused together into one big photo, that is with the help of artificial intelligence. We take high resolution, visible photos of a painting, but we also have a number of additional techniques that we can use to look at paintings. For example, an infrared camera, can see through the paint and see what’s what’s behind the paint, because oil paint is transparent to infrared light. So we can see past versions that may have been painted over.
This gives us a large collection of different kinds of images: visible image, infrared image, ultraviolet image, macro X-ray fluorescence which tells us chemical information. And artificial intelligence helps us to fuse these together so they’re very perfectly aligned with each other, and then interpret these multiple pieces of information about every pixel into something meaningful. 
How else do you foresee AI aiding in museums’ restoration projects?
Erdmann: When it comes to the scientific side of the museum, I anticipate very rapid increase in the use of artificial intelligence to help us do our work, especially in relation to images. And in the slightly more distant future, I anticipate it being a very important tool for art historians who may help who may use artificial intelligence to help them find similar patterns of the visual visual composition that exists throughout our huge collection.
What are some initial steps a museum can take to adopt AI technology into their institutions?
Erdmann: I think academia is where this is most likely to be to be fruitful. If I were a museum professional, and I didn’t know anything about AI, but I was excited about the possibilities, I would call the computer science department of my local university and say, “Hey, here are some problems that I have. I work with a museum, would you like to collaborate?” It’s been my experience that in the academic world, people are very excited to work in the museum world, because it’s working with famous works of art. 
The biggest barrier is that these two professional worlds have completely different vocabularies. They don’t necessarily understand each other at first, so it requires a lot of effort on on both sides to learn to communicate effectively. I think both of these worlds are eager to collaborate with each other, but that communication is the most is the biggest hurdle.

The reasons are various; such people aspire for better wages, work in a comfortable environment and improve one’s social status. While these choices are understandable, this situation creates a gap in the national job supply, thus negatively affecting those industries dependent on these workers. A sector that has been grossly affected is the foodservice industry. This problem was accentuated further in countries where the dependency on tourism is relatively high. In some cases, these countries even had to import workers from abroad to sustain the sector’s demands. But while this problem was brewing, a novel idea was floated around by some organisations to use Robots instead of human workers.Some people found it absurd. There’s indeed a capital cost involved because Robots don’t come cheap but let’s not forget that Robots don’t get tired, don’t need a holiday, are not paid and are rather precise in what they do.

Melanoma is by far the most serious form of skin cancer. It’s diagnosed in about 105,000 people in the United States every year, and more than 7,000 Americans die from it annually. But when it’s caught and treated early, the disease is almost always curable. That’s why it’s important to develop more effective ways to detect melanoma in its earliest stages — a key focus of research at Memorial Sloan Kettering and elsewhere.One approach that’s showing promise is the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. For the past five years, investigators from MSK have led an annual Grand Challenge for the development of AI algorithms that can accurately distinguish between spots that are melanoma and those that are not. The event is overseen by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an industry-academia partnership based at MSK.“We have teams from around the world that participate in this event, ranging from groups of high school students to the top companies working in AI,” says Allan Halpern, Chief of MSK’s Dermatology Service, who founded ISIC in 2014. “The Grand Challenge was created to encourage the computer science community to address this particular problem. Everyone who participates shares their methodology, and that allows the entire field to grow.”
Scanning the Entire Body in 3-D



When melanoma is detected and treated early, the disease is almost always curable.


Dr. Halpern has been an international leader in applying technology to the detection of melanoma for more than two decades. He previously played a central role in the development of digital 3-D total body photography, which uses computer software and dozens of cameras to map the entire surface of the body. This approach is used at MSK to screen people who are at high risk of developing melanoma because of a personal or family history, especially those who have a large number of atypical moles.Dr. Halpern created ISIC to optimize the use of digital imaging in melanoma diagnosis. The group includes dermatologists, computer scientists, and other experts from all over the world, whose goals include standardizing the way these images are taken and collecting large databases of images that can be used in research.One of the most important requirements for the development of AI technology is large volumes of data that can be used to “train” the computer algorithms. For melanoma, that means photos of spots on the skin that are linked to additional clinical information about their diagnosis, including whether pathologists who reviewed the tissue ultimately found the spots to be melanoma or not. These photos are taken with a tool called a dermatoscope, a high-tech, lighted microscope that’s placed on the surface of the skin to get a closer look.Ashfaq Marghoob, Director of Clinical Dermatology at MSK Hauppauge on Long Island, is an internationally recognized expert in dermoscopy and has helped set the standards for how these images are taken and analyzed.

Increasing Detection and Reducing Harm







 According to MSK dermatologist Veronica Rotemberg, “The holy grail is to detect skin cancer as early as possible without causing undue harm by biopsying things that are not skin cancer.”



One of the goals of developing AI tools for melanoma detection is to not only identify everything that is, in fact, a melanoma but also determine what is not. “The holy grail is to detect skin cancer as early as possible without causing undue harm by biopsying things that are not skin cancer,” says MSK physician-scientist Veronica Rotemberg, who is also involved in the research. “Because the risks from melanoma are great, we’d rather be safe than sorry when we decide what to biopsy.” But, she says, they want to reduce the number of biopsies to save patients from undue anxiety as well as the pain and scars.One unfortunate aspect of the new AI technology is that it doesn’t appear to work with people who have darker skin. That’s largely because there are far fewer images of melanoma in people with dark skin that can be used to train the algorithm. “Diagnosis of melanoma on darker skin is challenging overall,” Dr. Halpern says. “We acknowledge that this is a problem, and it’s something we’re trying to address.”Dr. Rotemberg and MSK dermatologist Michael Marchetti are developing a study to look at how well current AI technology works. They’re planning to compare AI predictions and dermatologist opinions with the findings of the pathologists who analyze the biopsy tissue.“We think there is a potential for AI to become a valuable tool in the clinic, especially in areas where there’s a shortage of dermatologists and it’s hard for patients to get appointments,” Dr. Rotemberg says. “AI may improve the expertise of nonexperts, but it could also improve the expertise of those who are already experts.”

Support for Continued Research Advances
As investigators continue to collect more images and other data, they expect that the AI technology will continue to improve. “We think this system is also going to help with research studies about things like the evolution of moles,” Dr. Halpern explains. “The computers may be able to look at changes from year to year.”Much of the funding for research at MSK on the early detection of melanoma has come from private philanthropy. The Shore Family Fund, through its Shore Initiative for Melanoma Diagnostic Imaging, provides financial support for MSK’s Dermatology Service for ISIC and its Grand Challenges.The 2021 Grand Challenge is being planned for later this year.

State action needed on artificial intelligence 

 

Fórsa has warned that strong State measures will be required to ensure that everyone shares in the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies.
The warning came after Micheál Martin this week said AI was not a threat to jobs. An Taoiseach was launching Ireland’s first National Artificial Intelligence Strategy, which estimates that AI could double economic growth by 2035, while creating more jobs than are lost.
A 2019 Fórsa report on automation made the case for dialogue, consultation and agreement with unions when employers sought to introduce major new technologies.
Fórsa’s report, Acting On Automation, also highlighted the need for training and skills development for workers under threat of ‘job displacement’ as AI becomes more embedded in the economy. It also warned that the introduction of AI should not be used as cover for outsourcing.
The report said AI had the potential to improve work-life balance by reducing working time. This would help ensure that the productivity benefits of new technologies are shared between businesses and their staff.
In a survey of Fórsa officials, its author Craig Whelan found that almost two-thirds saw automation as an issue in the workplaces they represent. Over 40% believed their members performed tasks likely to be impacted by automation, while over 80% judged it would definitely or probably will be an issue in the future.
In the same year, a Fórsa submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said civil and public service management should work with unions to ensure that the introduction of new technologies did not lead to job losses, outsourcing or poorer services.
Fórsa’s head of civil service Derek Mullen, who penned the paper, said the union would not oppose the introduction of new technologies like AI, but added that technological advancement should not undermine services or jobs. He pointed to the experience of Revenue, where new forms of work organisation, supported by retraining, had increased the tax-take and improved audit and fraud control rather than cutting jobs.
The national AI strategy seeks to position the public service as a leader on the issue.

Pichai said in an interview with the BBC that many countries are obstructing the flow of information. Apart from this, he also told which two things will emerge as a revolution in the coming time. Let us know what these are.
'Revolution will come from artificial intelligence
According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, artificial intelligence and quantum computing will bring revolution in the coming 25 years. Now what are these two, let's also know about it. Regarding artificial intelligence, Pichai said, ""I see it as the best technology made by humans. Whatever you think about fire, electricity or the Internet, Exactly it's going to happen. I think maybe even better than that."" Artificial intelligence system is designed to work like humans, especially it is used to solve a particular type of problems.&nbsp;
'Quantum computing will bring change'
According to Sundar Pichai, quantum computing is a completely different concept. This is based on common computing binaries 0 or 1, these are called bits. Quantum computers work on qubits. This makes a possible for substances to be in multiple states at the same time.

Initiatives to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) have sprung up around the world, spearheaded by the likes of the OECD and UNESCO. It‘s time to harmonise and consolidate, a conference on AI ethics held under the auspices of Slovenia’s presidency of the EU Council heard this week.
“We are clearly at a developmental point where you’ve got a lot of actors right now contributing to this movement from principles to practice, and we simply need to work together in a multistakeholder way to harmonise these approaches,” said David Leslie, of the Council of Europe’s Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI).

For about two years, Tal Brown and Eyal Eliakim worked together at Salesforce.com Inc.
CRM
-1.7% in the cloud-computing software company’s Tel Aviv, Israel office. Brown was a product manager and Eliakim was a data analyst, with both men focusing on developing what would become Salesforce’s Einstein artificial intelligence system.


In 2017, Brown and Eliakim struck out on their own and formed Zone7, an artificial intelligence and machine learning platform focused on helping sports organizations predict the risk of injuries in players and improve their performance.

The company recently secured $8 million in a Series A funding round to help expand its reach in sports as well as other industries. Blumberg Capital, a San Francisco early-stage venture capital firm, led the round. Other investors included Resolute Ventures, UpWest, PLG Ventures and Joyance Partners, each of whom had also participated in Zone7’s seed round through which the company raised $2.5 million in early 2019.

PROMOTED
So far, Zone7 has worked with more 50 teams in numerous leagues in North America and Europe, including the English Premier League, Major League Soccer, National Football, La Liga, Serie A and Premiership Rugby.

“Industries like sports whose success relies on healthy, high-performing individuals have only scratched the surface when it comes to using data to improve human performance,” said Bruce Taragin, Blumberg Capital’s managing director. “Zone7 has the team and technology to take the data play in sports, among other industries, to a new level.”

Zone7’s system analyzes data that teams collect on athletes when they’re practicing, playing in games, working out and even sleeping. It then produces reports on each player’s fitness and other variables, forecasts their injury risk and suggests ways in which so-called “operators” such as coaches and medical personnel can help.

“What we typically find is organizations already have a ton of data,” Brown said. “The need for a central brain to analyze all the data in context is really growing.”
He added: “Without Zone7, the job of the operator is really hard. We’re like the cloud engine that will collect everything and analyze it in context.”

Brown noted that some artificial intelligence systems such as those used in stock trading or on Amazon.com are intended to replace humans and eliminate any subjectivity when making decisions. But that’s not the case with Zone7, according to Brown.
“We’re not creating an auto-pilot to get rid of coaches,” he said. “That’s exactly the opposite of what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to put out the best instrumentation in front of the most elite coaches and others out there.”
Zone7 plans on using the Series A funds to increase its staff from 10 to 25, hiring data scientists and engineers to improve the platform and sales and business development employees to complete deals with more organizations and leagues.
Although sports remains the focus of Zone7 and its largest vertical by far, the company is also looking to expand into other sectors, including health care, oil and gas companies and the military. Employees in those industries are also subject to injury risk or exhaustion and are valuable to their companies, so Brown envisions a future where employers and governments use Zone7 to make sure people are performing at their highest levels.
Brown, Zone7’s chief executive, and Eliakim, its chief technology officer, are both former members of the Israel Defense Force’s Intelligence Corps, where they worked on cybersecurity and big data projects. They now want to use their experience with big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning to help as many people as possible.
“I’m really passionate about this problem (of injuries and missed time) and the potential impact it can have on a person’s well-being,” Brown said. “Sure, we’re dealing with a lot of athletes right now. But the potential of impacting a lot of others, whether it’s doctors or line workers or first responders, that to me is a personal motivation to work on this problem.”

Jul 22, 2021, 11:00 AM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Ana KovaAI research lab DeepMind has created the most comprehensive map of human proteins to date using artificial intelligence. The company, a subsidiary of Google-parent Alphabet, is releasing the data for free, with some scientists comparing the potential impact of the work to that of the Human Genome Project, an international effort to map every human gene. Proteins are long, complex molecules that perform numerous tasks in the body, from building tissue to fighting disease. Their purpose is dictated by their structure, which folds like origami into complex and irregular shapes. Understanding how a protein folds helps explain its function, which in turn helps scientists with a range of tasks — from pursuing fundamental research on how the body works, to designing new medicines and treatments. “the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind”Previously, determining the structure of a protein relied on expensive and time-consuming experiments. But last year DeepMind showed it can produce accurate predictions of a protein’s structure using AI software called AlphaFold. Now, the company is releasing hundreds of thousands of predictions made by the program to the public. “I see this as the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind,” company CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis told The Verge. “From the beginning, this is what we set out to do: to make breakthroughs in AI, test that on games like Go and Atari, [and] apply that to real-world problems, to see if we can accelerate scientific breakthroughs and use those to benefit humanity.” Two examples of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold (in blue) compared with experimental results (in green).  Image: DeepMindThere are currently around 180,000 protein structures available in the public domain, each produced by experimental methods and accessible through the Protein Data Bank. DeepMind is releasing predictions for the structure of some 350,000 proteins across 20 different organisms, including animals like mice and fruit flies, and bacteria like E. coli. (There is some overlap between DeepMind’s data and pre-existing protein structures, but exactly how much is difficult to quantify because of the nature of the models.) Most significantly, the release includes predictions for 98 percent of all human proteins, around 20,000 different structures, which are collectively known as the human proteome. It isn’t the first public dataset of human proteins, but it is the most comprehensive and accurate. If they want, scientists can download the entire human proteome for themselves, says AlphaFold’s technical lead John Jumper. “There is a HumanProteome.zip effectively, I think it’s about 50 gigabytes in size,” Jumper tells The Verge. “You can put it on a flash drive if you want, though it wouldn’t do you much good without a computer for analysis!” “anyone can use it for anything”After launching this first tranche of data, DeepMind plans to keep adding to the store of proteins, which will be maintained by Europe’s flagship life sciences lab, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). By the end of the year, DeepMind hopes to release predictions for 100 million protein structures, a dataset that will be “transformative for our understanding of how life works,” according to Edith Heard, director general of the EMBL. The data will be free in perpetuity for both scientific and commercial researchers, says Hassabis. “Anyone can use it for anything,” the DeepMind CEO noted at a press briefing. “They just need to credit the people involved in the citation.” The benefits of protein foldingUnderstanding a protein’s structure is useful for scientists across a range of fields. The information can help design new medicines, synthesize novel enzymes that break down waste materials, and create crops that are resistant to viruses or extreme weather. Already, DeepMind’s protein predictions are being used for medical research, including studying the workings of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. “it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community”New data will speed these efforts, but scientists note it will still take a lot of time to turn this information into real-world results. “I don’t think it’s going to be something that changes the way patients are treated within the year, but it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community,” Marcelo C. Sousa, a professor at the University of Colorado’s biochemistry department, told The Verge. Scientists will have to get used to having such information at their fingertips, says DeepMind senior research scientist Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool. “As a biologist, I can confirm we have no playbook for looking at even 20,000 structures, so this [amount of data] is hugely unexpected,” Tunyasuvunakool told The Verge. “To be analyzing hundreds of thousands of structures — it’s crazy.”Notably, though, DeepMind’s software produces predictions of protein structures rather than experimentally determined models, which means that in some cases further work will be needed to verify the structure. DeepMind says it spent a lot of time building accuracy metrics into its AlphaFold software, which ranks how confident it is for each prediction. Example protein structures predicted by AlphaFold.  Image: DeepMindPredictions of protein structures are still hugely useful, though. Determining a protein’s structure through experimental methods is expensive, time-consuming, and relies on a lot of trial and error. That means even a low-confidence prediction can save scientists years of work by pointing them in the right direction for research. Helen Walden, a professor of structural biology at the University of Glasgow, tells The Verge that DeepMind’s data will “significantly ease” research bottlenecks, but that “the laborious, resource-draining work of doing the biochemistry and biological evaluation of, for example, drug functions” will remain. Sousa, who has previously used data from AlphaFold in his work, says for scientists the impact will be felt immediately. “In our collaboration we had with DeepMind, we had a dataset with a protein sample we’d had for 10 years, and we’d never got to the point of developing a model that fit,” he says. “DeepMind agreed to provide us with a structure, and they were able to solve the problem in 15 minutes after we’d been sitting on it for 10 years.” Why protein folding is so difficult Proteins are constructed from chains of amino acids, which come in 20 different varieties in the human body. As any individual protein can be comprised of hundreds of individual amino acids, each of which can fold and twist in different directions, it means a molecule’s final structure has an incredibly large number of possible configurations. One estimate is that the typical protein can be folded in 10^300 ways — that’s a 1 followed by 300 zeroes. Protein folding has been a “grand challenge” of biology for decadesBecause proteins are too small to examine with microscopes, scientists have had to indirectly determine their structure using expensive and complicated methods like nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. The idea of determining the structure of a protein simply by reading a list of its constituent amino acids has been long theorized but difficult to achieve, leading many to describe it as a “grand challenge” of biology.In recent years, though, computational methods — particularly those using artificial intelligence — have suggested such analysis is possible. With these techniques, AI systems are trained on datasets of known protein structures and use this information to create their own predictions. DeepMind’s AlphaFold software has significantly increased the accuracy of computational protein-folding, as shown by its performance in the CASP competition.  Image: DeepMindMany groups have been working on this problem for years, but DeepMind’s deep bench of AI talent and access to computing resources allowed it to accelerate progress dramatically. Last year, the company competed in an international protein-folding competition known as CASP and blew away the competition. Its results were so accurate that computational biologist John Moult, one of CASP’s co-founders, said that “in some sense the problem [of protein folding] is solved.” DeepMind’s AlphaFold program has been upgraded since last year’s CASP competition and is now 16 times faster. “We can fold an average protein in a matter of minutes, most cases seconds,” says Hassabis. The company also released the underlying code for AlphaFold last week as open-source, allowing others to build on its work in the future. Liam McGuffin, a professor at Reading University who developed some of the UK’s leading protein-folding software, praised the technical brilliance of AlphaFold, but also noted that the program’s success relied on decades of prior research and public data. “DeepMind has vast resources to keep this database up to date and they are better placed to do this than any single academic group,” McGuffin told The Verge. “I think academics would have got there in the end, but it would have been slower because we’re not as well resourced.” Why does DeepMind care? Many scientists The Verge spoke to noted the generosity of DeepMind in releasing this data for free. After all, the lab is owned by Google-parent Alphabet, which has been pouring huge amounts of resources into commercial healthcare projects.

The company, a subsidiary of Google-parent Alphabet, is releasing the data for free, with some scientists comparing the potential impact of the work to that of the Human Genome Project, an international effort to map every human gene. 

Proteins are long, complex molecules that perform numerous tasks in the body, from building tissue to fighting disease. Their purpose is dictated by their structure, which folds like origami into complex and irregular shapes. Understanding how a protein folds helps explain its function, which in turn helps scientists with a range of tasks — from pursuing fundamental research on how the body works, to designing new medicines and treatments. 

""“the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind”""

Previously, determining the structure of a protein relied on expensive and time-consuming experiments. But last year DeepMind showed it can produce accurate predictions of a protein’s structure using AI software called AlphaFold. Now, the company is releasing hundreds of thousands of predictions made by the program to the public. 

“I see this as the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind,” company CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis told The Verge. “From the beginning, this is what we set out to do: to make breakthroughs in AI, test that on games like Go and Atari, [and] apply that to real-world problems, to see if we can accelerate scientific breakthroughs and use those to benefit humanity.” 

[Image: Two examples of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold (in blue) compared with experimental results (in green). https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzj9GXDy1oHZujdcdpKT8Cgm0MU=/0x0:1280x720/1280x720/filters:focal(640x360:641x361):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22132319/AlphaFold_prediction_comparisons.gif]

There are currently around 180,000 protein structures available in the public domain, each produced by experimental methods and accessible through the Protein Data Bank. DeepMind is releasing predictions for the structure of some 350,000 proteins across 20 different organisms, including animals like mice and fruit flies, and bacteria like E. coli. (There is some overlap between DeepMind’s data and pre-existing protein structures, but exactly how much is difficult to quantify because of the nature of the models.) Most significantly, the release includes predictions for 98 percent of all human proteins, around 20,000 different structures, which are collectively known as the human proteome. It isn’t the first public dataset of human proteins, but it is the most comprehensive and accurate. 

If they want, scientists can download the entire human proteome for themselves, says AlphaFold’s technical lead John Jumper. “There is a HumanProteome.zip effectively, I think it’s about 50 gigabytes in size,” Jumper tells The Verge. “You can put it on a flash drive if you want, though it wouldn’t do you much good without a computer for analysis!” 

""“anyone can use it for anything”""

After launching this first tranche of data, DeepMind plans to keep adding to the store of proteins, which will be maintained by Europe’s flagship life sciences lab, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). By the end of the year, DeepMind hopes to release predictions for 100 million protein structures, a dataset that will be “transformative for our understanding of how life works,” according to Edith Heard, director general of the EMBL. 

The data will be free in perpetuity for both scientific and commercial researchers, says Hassabis. “Anyone can use it for anything,” the DeepMind CEO noted at a press briefing. “They just need to credit the people involved in the citation.” 

The benefits of protein folding

Understanding a protein’s structure is useful for scientists across a range of fields. The information can help design new medicines, synthesize novel enzymes that break down waste materials, and create crops that are resistant to viruses or extreme weather. Already, DeepMind’s protein predictions are being used for medical research, including studying the workings of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. 

""“it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community”""

New data will speed these efforts, but scientists note it will still take a lot of time to turn this information into real-world results. “I don’t think it’s going to be something that changes the way patients are treated within the year, but it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community,” Marcelo C. Sousa, a professor at the University of Colorado’s biochemistry department, told The Verge. 

Scientists will have to get used to having such information at their fingertips, says DeepMind senior research scientist Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool. “As a biologist, I can confirm we have no playbook for looking at even 20,000 structures, so this [amount of data] is hugely unexpected,” Tunyasuvunakool told The Verge. “To be analyzing hundreds of thousands of structures — it’s crazy.”

Notably, though, DeepMind’s software produces predictions of protein structures rather than experimentally determined models, which means that in some cases further work will be needed to verify the structure. DeepMind says it spent a lot of time building accuracy metrics into its AlphaFold software, which ranks how confident it is for each prediction. 

[Image: Example protein structures predicted by AlphaFold. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jBHd6oygRgLOTzgRv-srVfNLoI=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/filters:focal(960x540:961x541)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732723/Proteins.jpg]

Predictions of protein structures are still hugely useful, though. Determining a protein’s structure through experimental methods is expensive, time-consuming, and relies on a lot of trial and error. That means even a low-confidence prediction can save scientists years of work by pointing them in the right direction for research. 

Helen Walden, a professor of structural biology at the University of Glasgow, tells The Verge that DeepMind’s data will “significantly ease” research bottlenecks, but that “the laborious, resource-draining work of doing the biochemistry and biological evaluation of, for example, drug functions” will remain. 

Sousa, who has previously used data from AlphaFold in his work, says for scientists the impact will be felt immediately. “In our collaboration we had with DeepMind, we had a dataset with a protein sample we’d had for 10 years, and we’d never got to the point of developing a model that fit,” he says. “DeepMind agreed to provide us with a structure, and they were able to solve the problem in 15 minutes after we’d been sitting on it for 10 years.” 

Why protein folding is so difficult 

Proteins are constructed from chains of amino acids, which come in 20 different varieties in the human body. As any individual protein can be comprised of hundreds of individual amino acids, each of which can fold and twist in different directions, it means a molecule’s final structure has an incredibly large number of possible configurations. One estimate is that the typical protein can be folded in 10^300 ways — that’s a 1 followed by 300 zeroes. 

""Protein folding has been a “grand challenge” of biology for decades""

Because proteins are too small to examine with microscopes, scientists have had to indirectly determine their structure using expensive and complicated methods like nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. The idea of determining the structure of a protein simply by reading a list of its constituent amino acids has been long theorized but difficult to achieve, leading many to describe it as a “grand challenge” of biology.

In recent years, though, computational methods — particularly those using artificial intelligence — have suggested such analysis is possible. With these techniques, AI systems are trained on datasets of known protein structures and use this information to create their own predictions. 

[Image: DeepMind’s AlphaFold software has significantly increased the accuracy of computational protein-folding, as shown by its performance in the CASP competition. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/li3Hd4DnxaORTQ6I0sCUYPjxVrA=/0x0:2066x1346/2066x1346/filters:focal(1033x673:1034x674)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732721/Median_Free_Modelling_Accuracy.png]

Many groups have been working on this problem for years, but DeepMind’s deep bench of AI talent and access to computing resources allowed it to accelerate progress dramatically. Last year, the company competed in an international protein-folding competition known as CASP and blew away the competition. Its results were so accurate that computational biologist John Moult, one of CASP’s co-founders, said that “in some sense the problem [of protein folding] is solved.” 

DeepMind’s AlphaFold program has been upgraded since last year’s CASP competition and is now 16 times faster. “We can fold an average protein in a matter of minutes, most cases seconds,” says Hassabis. The company also released the underlying code for AlphaFold last week as open-source, allowing others to build on its work in the future. 

Liam McGuffin, a professor at Reading University who developed some of the UK’s leading protein-folding software, praised the technical brilliance of AlphaFold, but also noted that the program’s success relied on decades of prior research and public data. “DeepMind has vast resources to keep this database up to date and they are better placed to do this than any single academic group,” McGuffin told The Verge. “I think academics would have got there in the end, but it would have been slower because we’re not as well resourced.” 

Why does DeepMind care? 

Many scientists The Verge spoke to noted the generosity of DeepMind in releasing this data for free. After all, the lab is owned by Google-parent Alphabet, which has been pouring huge amounts of resources into commercial healthcare projects. DeepMind itself loses a lot of money each year, and there have been numerous reports of tensions between the company and its parent firm over issues like research autonomy and commercial viability. 

Hassabis, though, tells The Verge that the company always planned to make this information freely available, and that doing so is a fulfillment of DeepMind’s founding ethos. He stresses that DeepMind’s work is used in lots of places at Google — “almost anything you use, there’s some of our technology that’s part of that under the hood” — but that the company’s primary goal has always been fundamental research. 

""“There’s many ways value can be attained.”""

“The agreement when we got acquired is that we are here primarily to advance the state of AGI and AI technologies and then use that to accelerate scientific breakthroughs,” says Hassabis. “[Alphabet] has plenty of divisions focused on making money,” he adds, noting that DeepMind’s focus on research “brings all sorts of benefits, in terms of prestige and goodwill for the scientific community. There’s many ways value can be attained.” 

Hassabis predicts that AlphaFold is a sign of things to come — a project that shows the huge potential of artificial intelligence to handle messy problems like human biology. 

“I think we’re at a really exciting moment,” he says. “In the next decade, we, and others in the AI field, are hoping to produce amazing breakthroughs that will genuinely accelerate solutions to the really big problems we have here on Earth.”

Summary
Every day it is more common to hear the term Artificial Intelligence in different aspects of human life and it is normal to imagine that it is a new concept, which is a mistake. This concept has been developing for many years and looking for a place in the solution of different social, economic, military, medical, commercial, etc. needs.
In this paper we will show a little about the origin and the main concepts surrounding AI and that sometimes are not clear generating misinformation or a misunderstanding of the subject. Subsequently, we will name some countries in different continents that to date have made advances in AI with applications in the defense sector and how they have managed to do so.
 After examining this international context, we will discuss how AI technologies have a place in the National Army, to finally explain how the different elements of combat power can be strengthened and enhanced with disruptive technologies that will undoubtedly change the way our nation is defended and attacked.

Introduction
The term Artificial Intelligence has become a boom in society in recent years. There are many things that can come to a person’s mind when they hear these two words.
The first one is “intelligence” which is related to humans and the evolution of the human race. On the other hand, there is the term “artificial”, which we immediately relate to something that was not created by nature but by man, and with this the first thing we think of when we hear artificial intelligence is Hollywood creations.
The means to produce information, how it is collected and the large amount of data that is stored have been the breeding ground to allow the entry and the boom that AI has had. For example, a network like Facebook, which in 2017 reached 2 billion users which on average per day connect 58 minutes, generates about 4 pentabytes of data per day (Osman, 2019), this are figures that only 20 years ago were unthinkable and intractable by the computer systems of the time, in addition, many did not see the importance that these data could have to influence the lives of people.

Artificial Intelligence is nowadays present in many of the things we see and use, and in most of them we do not even know that they are impregnated with this concept, since we usually relate the term to highly developed things; however, the reality is different, many of the things we employ work with AI such as Apple’s SIRI, Google Now, email servers, Amazon, customer service chat of many companies, google Translate, Facebook, the cameras of some smartphones, navigation systems such as Waze or Maps, etc. 
A major concern is the number of people out of work that the industrial revolution 4.0. One of them is the study conducted by the World Economic Forum where Colombia does not appear but countries in the area such as Mexico and Brazil, where they show that the main strategies to avoid this phenomenon of unemployment will be to invest in training current employees and hiring female talent; likewise, it raises as barriers the lack of understanding of disruptive changes and the pressure of investors for profits in the short time (World Economic Forum, 2016).
The rise of AI will generate what is known as creative destruction2 , which produces the disappearance of some jobs and gives way to new ones thanks to the innovation that occurs in a production or business model. This type of change usually puts the most vulnerable populations, who base their work and income on jobs that require little added value, in the worst situation.
Digitalization has brought benefits for many entrepreneurs; in countries such as Finland, in 2013 there were 152,000 self-employed people aged 15-64 years old. In 2000 this figure was only 120,000, the numbers skyrocketed after the 2008 crisis. The above, also lets us to glimpse that technology does nothing by itself, it needs people at all times, for its design, learning, taking and giving information. The tools are created by and for man or whoever he decides should be their beneficiary.
Artificial intelligence can be compared to telecommunications, electricity and some other technologies that have been developed and eventually permeated the life of living beings.
Just as electricity transformed the way industries functioned in the last century, artificial intelligence, the science of programming cognitive abilities into machines, has the power to substantially change society in the next 100 years (Wharton School, 2017).
The discourse on the importance of AI has been on the agenda of the greatest world leaders such as Obama, Trump, Xi and Puting for some years now. In an address concerning the future of the world order Putin in 2017 said “whoever leads AI will rule the world” when he opened the Russian school year in front of thousands of students.
Currently just over 20 countries have announced their national strategies concerning Artificial Intelligence.
Comparing AI, from the military side, with the most important deterrent capability of a few nations which is nuclear power, we can see that the latter is only accessible to a few considered powers and others that are not but face major prohibitions and blockades for their developments in this field. AI, on the other hand, is accessible to all states and even to non-state entities and, to say the least, to anyone with sufficient knowledge, hardware equipment and software.
doctrine. Additionally, it is in an effort to ratify and reinforce its ethical values at all levels in order to maintain the high degrees of legitimacy it has had for many years in the eyes of the civilian population. This environment makes it propitious to be able to look to the future and seek international references in order to enter early into the wave of artificial intelligence.
Colombia is a world reference in counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, fight against transnational crime and drug trafficking, as expressed in the Security and Defense Policy of President Iván Duque, and if it wants to maintain that status it must adopt technological capabilities that help it to maintain it.
 For this it is important to start strengthening the investment made in research and development in the country, below is a graph of how much some countries invest in this:
Figure 1: Leading R&D Countries: Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (% of GDP) in 2017Graph: Merino (2019)/Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2017)
For many it is a surprise to see Israel at the top of the list, however, given its historical conditions of regional conflict and the permanent threat that falls on it are powerful explanations for them to invest a significant portion of GDP in R&D. China, despite being at the bottom of the list, with that percentage of GDP is above most of the other countries in terms of real money, since it is the country with the highest GDP in the world, while Colombia invests less than 0.5% of its GDP in this area.
 Methodology
 In the research, primary and secondary sources were consulted in order to obtain the data and information that would shape the research. A qualitative approach was used, with an exploratory scope. It was developed in a descriptive way since an explanation was given to a social phenomenon that becomes relevant with the passage of time and at the same time a proposal was generated at the end on the application and use of the topic in question. Finally, the deductive method allowed the work to go from the general to the particular.
Artificial Intelligence
Results
The concept began to be coined thanks to the English mathematician Alan Turing, creator of the Turing machine and father of computation. He was able to demonstrate that with the basic operations performed by his machine any algorithm could be encoded. In his 1950 article Computing Machinery and Intelligence he established that if a machine could act like a human then it is intelligent, and this ability of the machine was validated with the Turing Test.
Before Turing, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943 proposed an artificial neural network, capable of learning and solving logical functions. But it was not until 1958 when the term Artificial Intelligence was coined thanks to John McCarthy, starting the development of this discipline as a science.
The rational model establishes that the machine is intelligent if it behaves rationally, basing its logic on the concept of Agents3. This means that an agent is intelligent based on the reasoning it makes according to the information it possesses. The Agent makes a suitable decision based on data and the time it has to analyze it. Currently, work is being done on multi-agent systems, which are different agents, with different capabilities, working together to solve a problem (Garcia, 2016, p. 5). 
The father of intelligence John McCarthy defined that “Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs” AI is the science of imitating human intelligence using computers. It is making a machine capable of learning, making decisions and solving problems. AI allows a machine to learn from the information it receives, adapt to changes, identify questions and/or problems, and finally make corrections and return to the first point, closing these steps and turning them into a continuous cycle.

Artificial intelligence is helping to solve “problems”, understanding that a “problem” is something that is difficult to solve, requires effort and has no trivial solution. 
For a machine to solve a problem it is necessary to create a model that allows it to analyze the information and this in turn must have a clear objective to achieve. Likewise, this model must have an evaluation function that serves as a criterion to evaluate as “good” the possible solutions and to be able to choose among them the most convenient, not necessarily the best. Nowadays, and thanks to the large amount of information that a system can collect, there are commonly problems called intractable, which for any current computer are almost impossible to analyze in a reasonable time.
 The Encyclopedia Britannica stated that “artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings”. Intelligent beings are those that can adapt to changing circumstances (Geetha & Reddy, 2018). This definition would fall short of what AI really is, since a computer is capable of solving multiplications, memorizing texts and recalling them when required, remembering events, and not because of this we can say that it is endowed with AI capabilities.
Another definition is that of Elaine Rich who says “Artificial intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things that, at the moment, people are better at” (Rich, 1983). It is a simple definition which was put forward by the author in 1983 and as can be seen it has been what those working on the evolution of AI have been working on forever and will continue to do for many years to come, making this definition timeless.
Artificial intelligence systems use agents that are in continuous evolution and learning, which in order to achieve “intelligent” behaviors must interact with each other and share information, hence the importance given to the connectivity that exists and the speed of response, which led to convert the internet and the concept of internet of things in the spinal cord of all this. Likewise, processors have become strategically important for the countries that design and develop them, and the bidding and competition for 5G networks has become a geopolitical struggle between the most powerful nations.
Artificial intelligence is classified into four main approaches:

System mechanism that acts as the

“The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people” (Kurzweil, 1990).

System mechanism that thinks like people.

Machines with AI capabilities are in the capacity to “think” as a human would by performing the actions in Figure 1.

Mechanism of the thinking system

Artificial intelligence is “the study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act” (Winston, 1992).

Mechanism of the acting system

Artificial intelligence is the branch of computer science concerned with the automation of intelligent behavior” (Luger & Stubblefield, n.d.).
Likewise, three types of human-machine relationships are distinguished which are:

Human in the loop (semi-autonomous systems).
Human on the loop (supervised autonomous systems)
Human out of the loop (autonomous systems).

Currently the most common developments operate under the first two types of relationships (Shkurti Ozdemir, 2019, p. 9).
Trends in the Use of Artificial Intelligence in the International Military Domain.
 Industry 4.0 components include autonomous robots, systems integration, internet of things (IoT), simulation, additive manufacturing, cloud computing, augmented reality, big data, and cybersecurity. Artificial Intelligence is closely related to Industry 4.0 (Wan Ibrahim & Hassan, 2019).
The adoption of automation, robotics and AI is accelerating exponentially, according to the 2018 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends report, through surveys established that 41% of those asked consider this topic important, 47% say their companies are running processes with these technologies, 24% use robots and AI for routine tasks, 16% to augment human skills and 7% to restructure jobs completely (Deloitte, 2018).
United States of America.

In 2014 the Secretary of Defense under the title of “The Defense Innovation Initiative” was launched for the third time what this country knows as “Offset strategy” or offset strategy, with which this the North Americans seek to promote new technologies from the military field that guarantee them to maintain supremacy in this field for the next 20 years against Russia and China. 
This third strategy also bets on advanced technology and AI systems that include robotics and automatic systems, miniaturization, big data and advanced manufacturing and 3D printing (Dombrowski, 2015). This gave rise to the entire military organization adapting to these new guidelines and creating the necessary organizations in order to meet this requirement, accompanied by a strong political bet. The Pentagon created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center JAIC in 2018.
Likewise, In January 2019, the Joint AI Center was founded. In February, the Executive Order to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence was issued, and the Department of Defense published the unclassified summary of the artificial intelligence strategy.
 For its part, the White House established the Select Committee on AI which was established by action of the National Science and Technology Council (National Science and Technology Council, 2018). 
Army Futures Command was created. Charged with “leading a continuous transformation and modernization of the Army to provide future warfighters with the concepts, capabilities, and organizational structures they need to dominate a future battlefield” (Army Futures Command, n.d.). 
The U.S. is the world’s leading power in terms of Armed Forces and the country with the largest defense budget, followed by Russia, China and India (Forbes Staff, 2019). Hence, it is not illogical that they are also the pioneers in the use of AI within their military capacity, although this country has maintained the slogan that “humans will always have the final decision on the firing to avoid any lethal action by machines through a veto” (BBC News, 2019).
They have developed projects such as ATLAS (Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System) with which armored vehicles could, with the use of AI, identify and engage targets three times faster than the current human process.
Another application is simulation and war games. With this it has been possible to start detecting hidden targets thanks to reconnaissance photos obtained through the open skies treaty signed in 2002 by 34 mostly European states. In June 2020, the DEFENDER – Europe 20 war games will be held. Another application that plans to be used in these war games is the MAVEN Project, in which Google, Clarifai, Amazon and Microsoft collaborated, which seeks to use AI to interpret images and videos in order to refine the orientation of drone attacks (Yúbal, 2018).
Another initiative being developed by DARPA is Squadron X. This project seeks to equip soldiers and Marines in dismounted units with tools; to design, develop and validate prototype autonomous systems, equipped with new detection tools and standard technologies (Root, n.d).
These systems allow the warfighter to have better situational management and control over the development of multi-domain operations4 by the military.
 Artificial intelligence depends on the data it analyzes and the speed and ease of access to it. For this reason, the DoD has also developed the JEDI (Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure) project. This consists of a cloud computing or cloud computing program, which allows to be hyper-connected and disconnected, either by will or by force, to any combat unit that is in the multi-domain theater of operations or to an intelligence analyst behind his desk in Washington (Freedberg, 2019).
Work is underway at the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) on prototypes to enable preventive maintenance solutions (Department of Defense, 2018).
 On the other hand are drone swarms, in 2016 the U.S. Army conducted tests where it launched a swarm of 103 unmanned aircraft or mili-drones from F/A-18 Super Hornets. The drones launched are Perdix drones that have the capability to even evade air defense systems and perform surveillance and reconnaissance functions. Each of these drones communicates with each other and adapts to the removal of some and the addition of new Perdix (Baraniuk, 2017).
The Navy and DARPA with a prototype called the Sea Hunter. Which is an unmanned anti-submarine vessel which in its deployment stage would be in the capability to navigate in the open ocean, perform weapons delivery to targets, coordinate missions with other naval, land and air units both manned and unmanned and maintain underwater coverage for extended time. It is estimated that the operation of this daily could be over USD 20,000 while a destroyer with similar capabilities could cost nearly USD 700,000 (Turner, 2018).
European Union.
The European Union countries have the European Defense Agency (EDA) which is an intergovernmental body of the EU Council. This groups 26 of the 27 members of the EU the only one not included is Denmark. Its mission is basically to support the member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defense capabilities (European Defence Agency, n.d.). In order to carry out the studies this agency was divided into CapTechs (Capability Technology Group) dedicated to specific defense oriented study areas.
One of the projects developed by the agency is the “Hybrid Manned Unmanned Platooning (Hy-MUP)”. This demonstrated the feasibility of coordinating and operating unmanned ground systems together with regular manned vehicles, furthermore it allowed the familiarization of the military with unmanned ground platforms (European Defence Agency, 2017).
Another project is the Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) program or UMS – European Unmanned Maritime Systems for Mine-Counter-Measures and other Naval Applications. The object of this program is to enhance European capabilities in naval applications mainly related to mine counter measures (MCM) (R&T Initiatives, 2014).
The MUROC (Multi Robot Control in Support of the Combatant) project was led by France, Germany and Spain. Robotic technologies have been identified as one of the critical gaps to be addressed for the development of future European land systems (R&T Initiatives, 2013). This project demonstrated how military forces can benefit from robot systems working cooperatively in different scenarios (DIEHL Defence, 2015). 
The ASIMUT project (Aid to SItuation Management based on MUltimodal, MUltiUAVs, MUltilevel acquisition Techniques) aims to decrease the operator workflow during a surveillance mission led by swarms of UAVs (Bouvry, et al., 2017).
EuroSWARM is a project that seeks the effective and efficient operation of unmanned swarms. It seeks for swarm UAVs to decide for themselves the optimal task allocation and resource management, self-guide, and create a network with equipped sensors so that these can operate independently with a unified brain (Cranfield University, 2016).
Additionally, the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda and CapTech SRAs Harmonisation (OSRA) was created. The creation of this agenda seeks that governmental and non-governmental actors from EDA CapTechs member countries have a shared and joint vision on the technological challenges to be addressed (European Defence Agency, 2019). 
Mexico
Approximately since 2016, Artificial Intelligence started on the rise in the Central American country. In early 2020, the first Artificial Intelligence HUB in Mexico was inaugurated at the Guadalajara Campus of the Tecnológico de Monterrey.
In 2018, the Mexican government presented its Artificial Intelligence Strategy of Mexico (IA-MX 2018). This is an important step for the country to start with solid steps that will lead it to consolidate itself as a regional power in AI. 
Likewise, the IA2030MX platform was created, which defines itself as “a multi-sector coalition made up of professionals, academic institutions, companies, startups, public agencies and other key players in the digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI) ecosystem in Mexico” (IA2030MX). In which they seek to integrate efforts for the use and application of AI for the benefit of Mexicans, strengthen cooperation between sectors and provide accessibility of AI to people.
In this country there is also the Mexican Society of Artificial Intelligence, which promotes the application of AI in Mexican society. Additionally, the Mexican International Congress of Artificial Intelligence (MICAI) is organized annually. 
The Intercultural Center for the Study of Deserts and Oceans (CEDO) with the use of machine learning determined how climate change behaves in the Gulf of California, in order to predict and take government actions to take the necessary measures to avoid catastrophes in this region.
 As can be seen in the development of this research, there has been no information on military applications that are being given to AI in Mexico. Perhaps one of the reasons is the ethical burden that has been placed on this issue by the international community not only to governments but also to private companies seeking to create developments or generate research in this regard, thus generating that although they are open technologies to any actor or state regardless of their category or size, are only a few powers and large companies that in the end end up doing it.
In 2018, the Future of Life Institute (FLI), published an act where more than 160 companies and 2400 people related to artificial intelligence committed not to create LAWS (Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems), as they are doing in countries such as France, Israel, Russia, South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom. Likewise, the FLI expressed that 26 countries including Mexico and Colombia; have expressed their support for the prohibition of the manufacture and use of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (Restrepo, 2018).
South Korea
This Asian country is one of the great pioneers of Artificial Intelligence and especially in the military field. This was one of the countries that in 2015 motivated the continuation of LAWS research and showed the importance for defense of the use of autonomous systems.
In December 2018, the South Korean military launched the Artificial Intelligence (AI) research institute, for its part the armed service opened the AI Research and Development Center, all with the aim of consolidating technologies applicable to future combat operations. The members of these institutes are experts in big data, AI, Machine learning, Deep learning, among others (Yonhap News Agency, 2018).
One of the projects developed by the Koreans is the Super Aegis 2. This turret can distinguish and shoot at a target 3 kilometers away, equipped with complex software for thermal vision and cameras, it can be configured as a semi-autonomous or autonomous system (Parkin, 2015). Similar to this system is the Samsung SGR-A1, a high-tech system with surveillance, tracking, firing and voice recognition capabilities. This allows Korean soldiers to be available for other operations where their presence and human intelligence is critical. 
Another project developed are robots that mimic the movement and capabilities of some animals. The Defence Acquisition Programme Administration (DAPA), which oversees the acquisition and development of military weaponry, has stated the plan for the construction of these biometric devices. These robots are known as biobots, which in addition to supporting military requirements, having characteristics of birds, fish and snakes will be able to participate in search and rescue work (Ryall, 2019).
The aim is to develop autonomous robots by 2024, which with the help of sensors and artificial intelligence can scan underground for human remains, with an estimated 135,000 still to be recovered. The robots could be equipped with family DNA information to enable rapid identification (Si-young, 2020). 
The work and communion between state and private companies have enabled this country to become stronger in AI. In 2020 the companies KT, LG Electronics and LG Uplus announced that they will make an open innovation platform called “AI One Team” to take their AI technologies to what they called a higher level supported by the 5G network. These new AI applications are not only focused on the conventional military domain but also on other problems affecting the nation’s security and defense such as pandemics like COVID-19 (Su-hyun, 2020).
 The South Korean military also announced in 2017 its intention to establish a specialized unit, called Dronebot Jeontudan, to operate unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.
To prevent and counter cyber attacks, South Korea is employing AI-based means for early detection and response to cyber threats. Finally, it has worked on predicting cyber threats based on known information (sipri, 2019).
 Artificial Intelligence Technologies Applicable to the Colombian National Army.
In the vision of the National Army is to be a modern army. Likewise, within its strategic roles it mentions that “the Army cannot depend only on its reputation, but must make understand what it is capable of doing now and in the future… to deter is necessary rigorous and realistic training, expert leaders, modern equipment…” (CEDOE, 2016).
As already seen in the international experience the development of applied technologies with AI support is almost in most cases possible thanks to alliances and research produced by civil-military agreements. Hence the importance that the topic begins to develop in parallel in a virtuous triangle that includes government, private enterprise and the security and defense sector.

Colombia is starting to work on AI projects to solve many problems and optimize processes that used to be more complex. Many, if not all of these applications have a place in the military field since the military works like many other companies in different aspects. 
This effort must come from the highest political and government levels so that it can permeate the whole society, which is why Colombia in 2019 in Paris, France, signed the “Recommendation of the Council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Artificial Intelligence (AI)”. In this context, President Iván Duque stated that one of his goals is the publication of a public policy that provides guidelines with a view to being regional pioneers in these technologies (Presidency, 2019).
Today and in the future, wars will be less and less likely to be fought on battlefields and between men. In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, threats take advantage of and employ asymmetric, less sophisticated tactics, with high economic, social, military and media impact, using the state’s own resources and those of the population that will be their target. They take advantage of a population and media susceptible to be deceived and manipulated in their beliefs, feelings, opinions and principles. 
A current combatant generates information and the AI helps him to know what is the situation of his environment and even how is his health and physical condition better than he can know it himself. This stream of data quickly analyzed by an algorithm reduces the uncertainty curve that a commander has to make decisions.
At the same time that this data helps to speed up one’s own decisions, it can and should also serve to delay the adversary’s, hence the importance of AI in the disinformation operations that it can support, as well as to identify one’s own vulnerabilities to counter them. In the concept of conflict and hybrid threat5 , a conflict can be fought perfectly through social networks, information and disinformation, statements, tweets, fake news, information concealment, etc., and thus attack critical sectors of the adversary.
Data Collection
People: In this particular case it is the combatants who are in the areas of operations and are the primary source of data needed by the system to collect useful information. These sensors can capture both physiological and environmental information.
Useful data can be extracted from the human body such as: blood pressure, electrocardiogram, body temperature, sweating, blood oxygen level, pupil dilation, encephalogram, voice pickups, stress, breathing status, calories burned, hours of rest.
Likewise, the military can wear sensors that help capture their environment and activity such as: barometer, altimeter, accelerometer, video camera, microphone, smart glasses, fingerprint reader, gyroscope, GPS, iris reader, pedometer, WiFi connection.
A hybrid threat is the diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular forces, terrorist forces, and/or unified criminal elements to achieve mutually beneficial effects (CEDOE, 2017)
Vehicles and Machines: the use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) as it is commonly known or ART (Remotely Manned Aircraft) as it has been preferred to call in Colombia constitute the spear points in terms of vehicles equipped with AI tools this given the increasingly important autonomous operation capabilities that these aircraft have.
Over the years, this capability has been strengthened by all the forces, as is the case of the FAC, which has Israeli and American aircraft. The Army has RQ-11B-Raven aircraft (Padilla, 2016), and finally the Navy has SCAN EAGLE. This industry has been boosted by CIAC who has started to develop ART for the defense sector; they have developed the mini UAV-Coelum, ART- Quimbaya and the Atlante Plus the latter in agreement with Airbus (Dinero, 2019). 
These systems can be equipped with cameras, microphones, thermal sensors, facial recognition systems, intelligent armament, interception and/or signal blocking equipment, with a flight autonomy, for Colombians, from 1 to 30 hours.
They are systems capable of capturing terrain data, topography, weather conditions, target confirmation, location and conditions of critical infrastructures of the troops themselves or the enemy.
Similar to the previous ones but in a different environment such as river and maritime are the USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) or unmanned surface vehicles. It should be noted that some Army units have river boats and carry out tasks in the country’s rivers, which in many territories are the main means of mobility, and since the Army does not have the capacity of military divers, these vehicles could be used for the inspection of vessels in submerged areas, In many occasions and places the troops must watch from the banks of the river the vessels that pass by and that they are certain are committing illicit acts but do not have the resources to neutralize them. 
COTECMAR in its report of Science, Technology and Innovation Activities Report of 2019 within the project management presented the beginning of the development of a USV type vehicle, of which it said it was framed within the strategic direction of the entity through the development of research projects in alternative energies, artificial intelligence and unmanned vehicles (COTECMAR, 2020). 
On the other hand, there are the Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). Currently in the Army, remote-controlled robotic platforms are used mainly to respond to threats with explosive devices. The machine employed has been the robot the TALON robot, equipped with a payload that includes three infrared illumination cameras, a color zoom camera, as well as several optional cameras and a Q-Tray (fuerzasmilitares.org, 2017).
 
These types of initiatives have already begun to be developed with Colombian labor and development as in the case of some students from the Universidad Industrial de Santander with other young entrepreneurs who in 2016 developed the prototype of a hybrid platform (air-ground) equipped with sensors capable of “sniffing” explosives and locating them on the ground, a device that was tested in conjunction with the 17th Brigade (Díaz, 2016). On the other hand, there is the development carried out by INDUMIL and the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada of the VALI robot (Light Anti-Explosive Vehicles) (FAC, n.d.).
Fixed Points: The Army has hundreds of fixed points where troops are located throughout the national territory, a capacity that no other company or organization has in the country. Many of these locations have the capacity to install different types of sensors that allow the capture of meteorological and/or geological information so that commanders and civilian authorities in ADAC operations can make decisions thanks to the predictions that can be made. The knowledge of environmental conditions allows knowing the necessary equipment for the soldiers, optimizing mobility and maneuver conditions with the possible use of aircraft, the feasibility of descents due to the weather, visibility, among other multiple factors that can affect the actions in the objective of an operation that takes months of planning. 
Data Integration
As it could be evidenced previously, there are many ways to collect data, so the large amount of information becomes intractable for a human being and the use of machines and big data is necessary.
Within the DAMASCO doctrine, information appears as an important element in different areas and aspects. In the MFE 3-0 Operations manual, the operational variables appear which are: political, economic, military, social, information, time, infrastructure and physical environment (PEMSITIM). These along with the mission variables describe a commander’s theater of operations. These operational environments are never the same and do not remain static, they vary with the passage of time and new situations, hence the importance of keeping the information that feeds each of these variables updated.
In this whole process it is important to differentiate three terms that are usually treated without any discrimination: data, information and knowledge. Data are objective factors of a real fact, they have no relevance in themselves as they do not explain the reason for something, and sometimes they are not related to each other. Information can be understood as a message between a source and a receiver that has the capacity for the latter to change his or her perception of something. Then knowledge, for Davenport and Prusak (1999) knowledge is a mixture of experience, values, information and “know-how” that serves as a framework for the incorporation of new experiences and information, and is useful for action. And finally intelligence, which is given thanks to the knowledge, filtering and analysis of information and knowledge; this allows making predictions of something future with a higher level of certainty (INNOVA-T, n.d.).
The analysis of the data and their visualization is what the commander needs in the end to make the decision and proceeds to do what is more difficult for the machine to do, which are the tasks of reasoning, perception and interpretation of the information. This is why the commander must always be at the center of the whole model so that he can know the state of the troops, the available means and resources, the enemy situation, the state of development of the situation, critical requirements, decision making points, etc., known as D2D (data to decision).
Information and Disinformation
Many other state entities have become targets of attacks through social networks with the sole objective of creating a climate of disinformation and destabilization, delegitimizing state institutions, the government, leaders and others, thus endangering the constitutional regime legally established and respected by the majority of Colombians.
This type of threat is considered as hybrid since it combines in a coherent and coordinated manner irregular forces, criminal acts and fifth generation warfare elements6 against different vulnerabilities of the Force which have increased and are more exposed due to technological developments and their massification; however, this can be countered with the proper use of AI tools. 
These hybrid threats, with the chaos and disinformation they generate, seek to make decision makers so saturated with adverse situations that they do not have time to deal with fundamental problems or comply with established plans and goals that affect those armed or criminal groups that generate chaos. These elements are intended to affect people’s cognitive environment, influencing their judgment and the decisions they make.
At this point, another AI capability is applied, which is to create information and content to support the campaign that is taking place. A clear example of this and the impact it could generate is the video of former U.S. President Barack Obama, created by researchers at the University of Washington, in which he speaks in his voice about many of his presidential achievements. All this thanks to the creation of an artificial neural network (BBC, 2017).
Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Combat Power Elements in the National Army.
The National Army develops different types of operations, offensive, defensive, stability and ADAC, in which it must apply its combat power in different ways. As defined by the MFRE 3-0 “Combat power is the total means of destructive, constructive and information capabilities that a unit or military formation can apply at a given time”, this combat power is made up of some elements among which we highlight the six functions of war conduction: mission type command, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, support and protection; and we add leadership and information.
In this chapter, it will be mentioned how the first six elements of combat power can be covered and supported by Artificial Intelligence, the last two elements will not be taken into account since they are considered transversal to the FCG.
Mission Type Command
The mission type command (MTM) allows the application of commanders’ leadership.
In turn, this is fed with information to allow commanders at all levels to understand, visualize, describe and direct operations (CEDOE, 2017). 
It should be noted that technology is not above being human, this obviously includes commanders. On the contrary, they are tools that help him complement and reinforce his good judgment, situational awareness, values, and leadership in order to lead his troops to success.
The use of AI allows commanders from the strategic to the tactical level to have a bigger picture.
Commanders, with the support of their staff, use PRODOP to conduct the conceptual and detailed planning necessary to understand, visualize and describe their operational environment, make and articulate decisions, and direct, lead and evaluate military operations.
Now analyzing each of the activities of the PRODOP with the support of AI, the following can be said:

Plan: here we seek to understand the situation, visualize a desired end state and chart the route to.
Prepare: here the units and personnel improve their own capabilities before starting the execution. It is at this point where AI enters to perform some actions with applications mentioned above such as UAV, UGV, USV, cybernetic intelligence, simulation software, logistic activities, location of tools and units in critical points, information tasks for own units and disinformation tasks for the
Execute: That the commander can employ his combat power and exploit it effectively is one of the fundamental purposes of AI by provisioning him with the information and projections he needs to make decisions with awareness of the present situation and future scenario.
Evaluate: This activity is strengthened by AI thanks to tools that enable situational awareness, gathering and permanent feedback not only on what is happening on a battlefield when facing an armed threat but also in the

It is in the power of the command, based on its analysis and information provided by its E.M., and depending on what is to be achieved to determine what degree of autonomy is employed at each level of planning. In the article “A model for types and levels of human interaction with automation” (Parasuraman et al., 2000), levels of automation are proposed that should be applied according to the needs and the level of planning and execution in which the AI will take part.
These levels serve to determine when a commander can automate at level 10 something; for example, alarms and orders for logistical resupply which must be fulfilled regardless of the situation; or level 2 where an attack on a target is required and the AI system simply offers alternatives for the man to make the decision and give the order for action.
Movement and Maneuver
The AI affects not only in this element of combat power, but in all the combatant who is directly who takes the position, obeys orders, faces and confronts the enemy to take advantageous positions on the ground to achieve the objective. 
One of the elements with which the combatant is strengthened and supported by the AI is in terms of medical care and the protection of his health in the combat field. Robotic surgical systems could be incorporated to perform care directly or remotely support care in the field. 
Sensors equipped on the combatants, equipment and infrastructure allow to collect and compress everything in a single image for the commander and his E.M. to facilitate decision making. The development of projects at the national level that seek to emulate the capabilities of the MAVEN project would provide an immense capacity to combat the internal threats that currently substantially affect Colombia.
Another employment that would support movement and maneuver capabilities, and which relates to the sustainment combat element, is the ability to predict breakdowns and failures in air and ground troop transport elements. 
Devices that power AI systems or contain AI that soldiers can carry into the combat area are becoming more accessible, convenient and tailored. In the military, there has been talk of the Soldier of the Future project, which is equipped with smart glasses that help him identify and align targets, or send that information to fire units that are right for certain targets. The use of portable systems for jamming enemy communications, GPS that provide real-time location information, smart watches that measure vital signs, smart clothes with ballistic and/or thermal protection, boots with AEI protection, etc. For this it is important the connectivity that the combatant has in the area of operations, so that the information reaches him and sends it on time, which requires a commitment not only from the Ministry of Defense, but also from the Ministry of ICT. 
Intelligence
This FCG supported by AI tools is one of the most strengthened, since in the tasks it performs, it stops having a few sources that were only analyzed by a few analysts to have countless sources analyzed in a few minutes by machines; additionally, with advantages such as the reduction of the risks involved for an intelligence agent in the collection of the same, and the subjectivity and bias that people may have according to their beliefs, customs and culture.
The army has been characterized by adapting to the threat it has been facing over time, an example of this was the creation of mobile brigades, or the conformation of energy and road battalions, up to the new E.M. structure of the Army Command with the three Chiefs of E.M. The new strategies used by the Force will have the need to face hybrid threats with the use of techniques and tactics that until recently did not seem to fit in the traditional military doctrine and methods.
AI, with the use of its tools, allows the constantly changing information, and even more so when we are talking about hybrid threats, to be updated and the E.M. to provide timely recommendations and accurate assessments for the commander to decide on the direction of the battle.
By using DL in military operations, it would be possible to differentiate a military objective from a non-military one, to distinguish a combatant from a civilian, to differentiate a recently traveled road or trail from a disused one, thanks to the interpretation, digitalization and analysis of images taken by army intelligence aircraft, by drones that are carrying out surveillance activities or helicopters transporting cargo and/or personnel in an area that are equipped with tools that allow the proper capture of images.
In a battlefield of the future, knowing not only the military weapons, planes, rifles and bombs that the adversary has will not be enough; it will become preponderant and definitive to know the networks, systems, connections, hubs, sensors and all those technological components that make the adversary combat power can be applied, to start a process of neutralization, interruption of systems and services, and generate wear and uncertainty about the reliability of the same before starting any war confrontation that will always be the last resource to want to be used. 
Fires
 The use of AI improves tasks such as fire delivery and integration, target selection and prioritization, and the conduct of air and missile defense.
The selection and prioritization of precise targets (PSPB) and on time is fundamental for fire support, a bad decision can end in catastrophes as in 1988 when an Iranian passenger plane was shot down by the US, or in 2014 when a Russian missile shot down a Malaysia Airlines plane, or the most recent event in January 2020 when after tensions between the US and Iran, the latter ended up shooting down a Ukraine International plane near Tehran airport, this in a mixture of technological and human failures (Gonzalez, 2020).
The centralization of information and the PSPB task allows the integration of all forms of both military, joint and multinational fires. The lack of joint information can lead to fratricide between troops, while maintaining the balance of fires delivered to each target according to military need.
Air and ground reconnaissance systems with image digitizing and analysis capabilities play a critical role in this task. It is important that the target is differentiated if it is a field or rocket battery, if the missiles are ground-to-air, ground-to-ground, etc., since the capacity that the army must employ for its neutralization with another fire unit or by means of maneuver units depends on this.
In the case of fires, an important application that could occur with the use of AI is simulation. In this topic China has been a pioneer in the development of war-games that have become famous around the world in which systems such as Prophet 1.0 developed by the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are employed (Kania, 2019).
As the destructive capability of artillery is so significant, AI must equally ensure collateral damage reduction thanks to the precision that the systems provide.
Sustainment 
The use of AI allows the principles of sustainment to be met more effectively; such as integration by keeping information updated and centralized making coordination easier; anticipation, which is one of the strengths of machine learning as seen above making the logistics commander able to anticipate with more or less time the requirements of the theater of operations; responsiveness, since having intelligent, robotic and other elements enabled by AI makes responses to changing situations more agile, avoiding the use of personnel who should be on the front lines in support activities and keeping the commander focused on the battle and not on the logistical, personnel and health requirements of the battle; economy, which is improved and strengthened by using only what is necessary thanks to systems that make better decisions avoiding duplication of functions and tasks that are developed in addition to prioritizing the allocation of resources according to needs; survival, the troops may have better equipment to protect them in the combat field with the use of intelligent textiles, external or internal sensors that capture vital information of the combatant with which decisions are made to ensure that this can survive in hostile situations that threaten his life and therefore the fulfillment of the mission; continuity, by having an integrated information network that integrates all sustainment issues and that with ML, DL, data analytics and, in general, predictive analysis tools, allows the commander to optimize his sustainment lines and expand his operational scope.
Likewise, the maintenance processes and availability of spare parts for vehicles, facilities and other real estate that need to be maintained over time and guarantee their life cycle in an adequate manner. The sensors installed in these elements keep informed in this case the logistic units in charge of planning such as the JEMPP and executing units such as the Logistic Command COLOG allowing that the spare parts, maintenance and manpower necessary for this purpose can arrive in the time, way and place required thus avoiding that functions such as mobility, maintenance and others are affected.
AI not only contributes to sustainment with information but also with the incorporation of robotic machinery that allows the replacement of operator labor, which is increasingly difficult to obtain and maintain in institutions such as the Army.
Likewise, the provisioning with machines or drones is a reality that today is applied in large armies and in companies that distribute products with these elements.
Protection
Protection complies with some principles, among which is that of being multilevel, this thanks to the use of AI tools and human operators can be strengthened by ensuring the detection and reaction of the force protection mechanisms according to the level of penetration that an enemy threat has had and the type of decision that is required to be taken in response to it.
For effective and timely protection, it is important to have knowledge not only of the enemy but also of the entire operational environment, which has already been mentioned on several occasions how knowledge of it is strengthened thanks to AI.
Likewise, with regard to the principle of durability in protection, which proposes its duration in the future with material and human resources, it is much simpler, more economical and durable to place a set of sensors that detect some type of substance and explosive than to place a shift of guards with support animals that inspect person by person.
The use of cameras with facial recognition capabilities can analyze thousands of faces and identify people in a way that a human cannot, an example of which is the FacePRO facial system with DL technology manufactured by Panasonic (Panasonic, n.d.).
Conclusions
Although it may seem contradictory, the most important thing for the development of artificial intelligence is the development of human intelligence through training and scientific and human development. It is necessary that these elements are accompanied by technological advances that are incorporated into the daily life of the commanders and executors of the operations carried out by the army. It is also important that the country and its armed forces continue with cooperation and defense agreements with other states, or organizations that bring together several of them, as well as non-state actors, which have made significant progress on the subject and that technology transfer can be carried out and reach the Forces.
In Central and South America there is still no important reference in the subject, which opens an opportunity for our country to become a regional reference with the leverage of the Armed Forces and private enterprise. For this reason, the National Army should begin to take its first steps in this effort by addressing the following recommendations, as follows:

Creation of an organizational structure within the Force that starts with the research work on AI.
Generate a technological modernization strategy that includes Artificial Intelligence for the Army.
Promote training and learning within the force.
Recruit professionals with high development and innovation capabilities that contribute to the generation of AI-based solutions.
Generate incentives for personnel who are trained and carry out projects on the subject in order to motivate the permanence in the Force and not the escape of new personnel.
Generate doctrine and framework
Create networks and knowledge communities within the force, with other national and international forces and with civilian companies, in order to maximize the benefits of shared knowledge.
Create lines of development and research in AI and its technologies.

Finally, it should be taken into account that human beings are imperfect creatures, and that imperfection is transferred in one way or another to everything that creates and gives life; AI is no stranger to this.
2 Creative destruction is the process by which an innovation changes the prevailing business model of an industry. Creative destruction requires two elements: creation and destruction. That is to say, the new invention necessarily replaces and makes the existing one disappear. The dissemination of the term creative destruction was the work of Joseph Schumpeter (Westreicher, n.d.).
3 Agent denotes in general a system that processes information and produces an output from an input. (Ertel, 2017, pp. 17-18) agent is intelligent based on the reasoning it makes according to the information it possesses. The Agent makes a suitable decision based on data and the time it has to analyze it. Currently, work is being done in multi-agent systems, which are different agents, with different capabilities, working together to solve a problem (Garcia, 2016, p. 5).
4 Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) describes how the U.S. Army, As part of the joint force, can counter and defeat a near adversary capable of competing with the U.S. In all domains, both in competition and in armed conflict.(U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, 2018).
5 A hybrid threat is the diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular forces, terrorist forces, and/or unified criminal elements to achieve mutually beneficial effects (CEDOE, 2017)
6 The term fifth generation warfare, did not take long to begin to be mentioned in the fields of defense and security, this is nothing more than taking advantage of the massive use of cybernetic means, through which it is possible to obtain, “the dominion of the mind” ( Suazo Molina, 2017).

Yet, You’re Not WrongJuly 30, 2021Credit...Illustration by Nicholas Konrad/The New York Times; photograph by Hamster3d/Getty ImagesShare full articleRead in appBy Frank Pasquale and Gianclaudio MalgieriMr. Pasquale and Mr. Malgieri are law professors. Mr. Pasquale is the author of “New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI.”Americans have good reason to be skeptical of artificial intelligence. Tesla crashes have dented the dream of self-driving cars. Mysterious algorithms predict job applicants’ performance based on little more than video interviews. Similar technologies may soon be headed to the classroom, as administrators use “learning analytics platforms” to scrutinize students’ written work and emotional states. Financial technology companies are using social media and other sensitive data to set interest rates and repayment terms.Even in areas where A.I. seems to be an unqualified good, like machine learning to better spot melanoma, researchers are worried that current data sets do not adequately represent all patients’ racial backgrounds.U.S. authorities are starting to respond. Massachusetts passed a nuanced law this spring limiting the use of facial recognition in criminal investigations. Other jurisdictions have taken a stronger stance, prohibiting the use of such technology entirely or requiring consent before biometric data is collected. But the rise of A.I. requires a more coordinated nationwide response, guided by first principles that clearly identify the threats that substandard or unproven A.I. poses. The United States can learn from the European Union’s proposed A.I. regulation.In April, the European Union released a new proposal for a systematic regulation of artificial intelligence. If enacted, it will change the terms of the debate by forbidding some forms of A.I., regardless of their ostensible benefits. Some forms of manipulative advertising will be banned, as will real-time indiscriminate facial recognition by public authorities for law enforcement purposes.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe list of prohibited A.I. uses is not comprehensive enough — for example, many forms of nonconsensual A.I.-driven emotion recognition, mental health diagnoses, ethnicity attribution and lie detection should also be banned. But the broader principle — that some uses of technology are simply too harmful to be permitted — should drive global debates on A.I. regulation.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.The proposed regulation also deems a wide variety of A.I. high risk, acknowledging that A.I. presents two types of problems. First, there is the danger of malfunctioning A.I. harming people or things — a threat to physical safety. Under the proposed E.U. regulation, standardization bodies with long experience in technical fields are mandated to synthesize best practices for companies — which will then need to comply with those practices or justify why they have chosen an alternative approach.Second, there is a risk of discrimination or lack of fair process in sensitive areas of evaluation, including education, employment, social assistance and credit scoring. This is a risk to fundamental rights, amply demonstrated in the United States in works like Cathy O’Neil’s “Weapons of Math Destruction” and Ruha Benjamin’s “Race After Technology.” Here, the E.U. is insisting on formal documentation from companies to demonstrate fair and nondiscriminatory practices. National supervisory authorities in each member state can impose hefty fines if businesses fail to comply.To be sure, Europe’s proposal is far from perfect, and the E.U. is not alone in considering the problems of artificial intelligence. The United States is starting to grope toward basic standards of A.I. regulation as well. In April, the Federal Trade Commission clarified a 2020 guidance document on A.I., stating that U.S. law “prohibits the sale or use of … racially biased algorithms.”However, the problems posed by unsafe or discriminatory A.I. do not appear to be a high-level Biden administration priority. As a remarkable coalition of civil rights and technology policy organizations complained this month: “Since assuming office, this administration has not pursued a public and proactive agenda on the civil rights implications of A.I. In fact, the Trump administration’s executive orders and regulatory guidance on A.I. remain in force, which constrains agencies across the federal government in setting policy priorities.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThings are somewhat better on the state level. A more robust proposal is now under discussion in California to regulate public contracts for the provision of A.I.-based products and services. Legislators in Washington State are discussing a similar proposal. The proposed California law has some elements in common with the European approach and with the Canadian model of “Algorithmic Impact Assessment,” designed to mitigate bias and unfairness in emerging A.I. for public administration. Despite its limited scope, the California proposal would require tech companies that provide A.I. to state agencies to prepare a detailed data management plan, to make algorithms explainable even to a nonexpert audience and to prevent discriminatory biases.The states can accomplish a lot on their own. However, the real challenge now is national leadership. The Biden administration should harmonize the U.S. approach with that of Europe, committing to require “high quality data, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness” for high-risk A.I. systems, as the proposed European A.I. Act puts it. For example, if a machine is going to decide whether or not you are hired for a job, at the very least you deserve regulatory oversight to ensure that it is using proper data, that it has actually performed well and in a nondiscriminatory way in the past and that you can appeal to someone if you can demonstrate it has made a mistake. And if the system is based on pseudoscientific claptrap, you should not be judged by it at all.Federal agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can either address these problems under existing law or propose statutory language to grant them the authority to do so. But they need to act more aggressively now, while the technology is still developing. The White House needs to bring agency leaders together to learn from experts about best practices, and solicit comments from those affected by A.I. This approach would both democratize and professionalize U.S. technology policy in crucial areas.A.I. developers should not simply “move fast and break things,” to quote an early Facebook motto. Real technological advance depends on respect for fundamental rights, ensuring safety and banning particularly treacherous uses of artificial intelligence. The E.U. is now laying the intellectual foundations for such protections, in a wide spectrum of areas where advanced computation is now (or will be) deployed to make life-or-death decisions about the allocation of public assistance services, the targets of policing and the cost of credit. While its regulation will never be adopted verbatim by the United States, there is much to learn from its comprehensive approach.Frank Pasquale is a professor at Brooklyn Law School and the author of “New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI.” Gianclaudio Malgieri is an associate professor at the EDHEC Augmented Law Institute in France.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The AlphaFold machine-learning tool can predict 3D structures of full protein chains for 98% of human proteinsCredit: Karen Arnott/EMBL-EBI


“I didn’t think we would get to this point in my lifetime.” That’s how one research leader in structural biology responded to last week’s publication of research in which artificial intelligence (AI) was used to predict the structure of more than 20,000 human proteins, as well as that of nearly all the known proteins produced by 20 model organisms such as Escherichia coli, fruit flies and yeast, but also soya bean and Asian rice. That is a combined total of around 365,000 predictions1.The data, publicly accessible for the first time (see https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk), were released online on 22 July by researchers at DeepMind, a London-based AI company owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and the European Bioinformatics Institute, based at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EBI-EMBL) near Cambridge, UK.

DeepMind’s AI predicts structures for a vast trove of proteins
The DeepMind team developed a machine-learning tool called AlphaFold. The team trained this program on DNA sequences, including their evolutionary history, and the already-known shapes of tens of the thousands of proteins contained in a public-access database of proteins hosted by the EBI-EMBL researchers. A week earlier, DeepMind also released the source code for AlphaFold and detailed how it was constructed2, at the same time that researchers from the University of Washington, Seattle, published details of another protein-structure prediction program — inspired by AlphaFold — called RoseTTAFold3.The unveiling of this catalogue of predicted structures would not be nearly such good news were the data and the methodology not open and freely available. Structural biologists and other researchers are already starting to use AlphaFold to obtain more-accurate models for proteins that have been difficult or impossible to characterize by current experimental methods.Speeding up structure predictionPredicting the 3D shape that proteins fold into has been one of biology’s unsolved ‘grand challenges’ since the discovery in 1953 of the structure of DNA itself. Before AI, structure prediction from sequence was an intensely time-consuming, not to say labour-intensive, process with little guarantee of getting an accurate result. The new data will still need to be validated and experimentally verified. But the AI tools can accurately predict protein structures in minutes to hours — compared with the months, or years, that it used to take to determine the structure of just one or two proteins. And that opens up possibilities for applications, for example in the engineering of enzymes to break down environmental pollutants such as microplastics.

Read the paper: Highly accurate protein structure prediction for the human proteome
Last week’s breakthrough depended not just on the sharing of open data, but on advances in fundamental science and technology. Since the 1960s, structural biologists have worked on parallel approaches to understanding the science of protein folding. One involves piecing together the structures of proteins by understanding the underlying physical forces. Another attempts to predict the shapes by making comparisons with closely related proteins, using an organism’s evolutionary history. And then there’s been the all-important role of imaging technologies, starting with X-ray crystallography and now cryo-electron microscopy.In the basic science of structural biology, key problems remain to be solved. Although AI in science and technology is good at producing accurate results, it doesn’t (at least for now) explain how, or why, those results happened. The teams at DeepMind, EBI-EMBL, the University of Washington and elsewhere should be congratulated for crucial breakthroughs. But there is still work to be done to unlock the science — the essential biology, chemistry and physics — of how and why proteins fold.Public and privateIn terms of significance, some are comparing the latest advances to the first draft human genome sequence 20 years ago. And it’s true that there are comparisons to be made. Both the Human Genome Project and DeepMind’s catalogue of human protein-structure predictions equip their fields with a tool that is set to markedly accelerate discovery.The human genome’s first draft was the result of a race. Solving protein folding has also benefited from a kind of competition — an annual event called the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (or CASP), which has been essential to getting a result.

Read the paper: Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold
Today’s research teams — just like those involved in early genome sequencing — needed open access to data. In making the data and the methodology openly available to all, DeepMind now sets a benchmark that will make it harder for other corporations in this space, such as Facebook and Microsoft, to continue arguing for proprietary data.And so, what of the future? Over the past week, Nature interviewed nearly a dozen researchers in the field. The consensus is that it’s too early to predict exactly what impact the application of AI in the life sciences will have, except that any impact will be transformative.Accurately predicting how AI will change biology needs good training data, which we don’t yet have. But in AI, the structural-biology research community — and its collaborators in other fields — have a vast trove of fresh data. In addition to its research and data, AI provides a window into models for research organization and management that universities should study. For today’s researchers, and those in future generations, there is much work to follow up on.

According to a recent study, physicians devote 62 percent of their time per patient reviewing electronic health records (EHRs), with the most time-consuming portion being clinical data review. To increase efficiency, researchers studied the development of an artificial intelligence system to assist with reviewing patient information.







As EHRs became increasingly common, physicians have spent more time studying these data bases to review clinical data. With more data being stored in EHRs, users could experience a type of information overload. By incorporating artificial intelligence technology to work with these EHRs, physicians will avoid burnout and improve the patient experience.
In this prognostic study, researchers created an AI system to organize patient records and improve data retrieval. To ensure that the system was fast and accurate, a nonblinded, prospective study took place at Stanford University.
Recruitment emails were sent to all physicians in the gastroenterology division, and 12 of them agreed to participate in the study.
“Each of the clinicians participating in the study received 2 referral records: 1 AI-optimized patient record and 1 standard (non–AI-optimized) patient record. For each record, clinicians were asked 22 questions requiring them to search the assigned record for clinically relevant information,” the study stated.
The clinicians reviewed records from June 1 to August 30, 2020. Researchers compared the time and accuracy of the AI-optimized patient record and the standard patient record. Physicians were then asked to assess their overall satisfaction with the AI system, their preferred method of review, and other topics to evaluate clinical utility.
Compared to the standard patient record review, the artificial intelligence system saved physicians 18 percent of the time used to answer clinical questions. Additionally, there was no significant change in accuracy when physicians retrieved the data with the AI system vs without.
Eleven of the 12 physicians indicated that they preferred the AI record review to the standard review.
“Despite a learning curve pointed out by respondents, 11 of 12 physicians believed that the technology would save them time to assess new patient records and were interested in using this technology in their clinic,” the study stated.
Through the study, the AI system was able to help physicians extract relevant patient data in a shorter amount of time while remaining accurate.
“This finding is particularly germane to the ever-increasing amounts of medical data and increased stressors on clinicians. Increased user familiarity with the AI system, along with further enhancements in the system itself, hold promise to further improve physician data extraction from large quantities of patient health records,” the study stated.
When artificial intelligence is integrated into the healthcare system, physicians can use it as a tool to provide better and more efficient patient care. Not only does it improve the productivity of healthcare, but AI can also lighten the load for physicians.

So why are they rolling out across the country?Supported byAbout this contentVirginia Eubanks and Alexandra MateescuWed 28 Jul 2021 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 Jul 2021 06.01 EDTShareFor years, LeDanté Walker set aside what little extra cash he could find so no matter the issue with his health insurance coverage, his caregiver was always taken care of.Walker, who sustained a spinal cord injury when he was ejected from the back seat of a car in a 1997 accident, relies on a home care worker for many day-to-day functions, from moving from his bed to his wheelchair every morning, to helping him shower, get dressed, go to the bathroom and prepare meals.But earlier this year, Walker abruptly had to dip deeper into his rainy day fund than ever before, after his caregiver’s paychecks fell $900 short of what she was owed. Walker offered her every spare dime he had saved, preferring to pay out-of-pocket to maintain the freedom and stability his worker provided than see her left in a financial lurch.“I want to be independent,” he says. “That’s my right.”The missing wages were caused by flaws in a new digital tool called electronic visit verification (EVV), an app downloaded to a home care worker’s smartphone that tracks their daily work output, physical location and hours.Tech companies and lawmakers promise that EVV will increase efficiency and accountability in home care and will reduce fraud, waste and abuse in government-funded programs. But the tool has been a catastrophe for many in Arkansas, like Walker, and thousands of others across the nation. Advocacy groups and people with disabilities warned from the start that EVV systems would erode clients’ autonomy, make home care more difficult and threaten the progress of the disability rights and independent living movements.At the heart of these disagreements are clients and workers – often women of color or immigrants – who feel as if they are constantly surveilled and under suspicion.The Obama administration passed legislation requiring that EVV be implemented to manage all in-home personal care services paid for by Medicaid, the program that helps poor and working families in the US with healthcare costs. And on 1 April, under a federal deadline to implement or lose a percentage of its Medicaid funding, Arkansas rolled out EVV for self-directed clients like Walker who manage their care workers directly rather than go through a home healthcare agency. Most other states are also currently unveiling EVV systems.According to Walker and dozens of other program participants in Arkansas, the implementation has been a disaster. Walker didn’t get official notification of the state’s digital transformation until four days before the EVV rollout. He called and texted his support coordinator, but she wasn’t answering. He was eventually guided to a training video on YouTube aimed at home healthcare agencies, not self-directed clients like him. It didn’t answer his questions.Walker spent hundreds of dollars to purchase an extra cell phone for his home care worker, who asked not to be named in this story. She downloaded the state’s EVV app, called AuthentiCare, and began to use it. But it was frequently glitchy. Her 13-26 April timesheet was denied for “insufficient funds,” which made no sense to Walker, who carefully reconciles his worker’s schedule with the care hours the state allows him.She was out $900 for two weeks’ work. Walker’s cash helped her keep groceries in the fridge and the lights on in her house, but it wouldn’t last long.“It was chaos,” Walker says.He adjusts his mask and pushes his waist-length dreadlocks out of his face. “I’ll be okay, because I worked out a system with my caregiver,” he says. But there are more than 2,000 people like him who receive self-directed services through ARChoices, a waiver program intended to help disabled and older Arkansans receive Medicaid-funded care in their own homes. He knows that few of them have the resources to underwrite their home care workers’ paychecks.“We’ve been together 10-plus years,” Walker says. “If we were new, she’d be gone.”View image in fullscreenLeDanté Walker: ‘They need to listen to people with disabilities. Ask. The. People.’ Photograph: Rory Doyle/The GuardianThe care crisis is especially acute in Arkansas. Pay here is notoriously low: after a decade, Walker’s caregiver still makes just $12.08 an hour, barely more than Arkansas’ $11 minimum wage. The cost of in-home care in Arkansas is 17% lower than the national average, in part because of low pay and high turnover. If Palco, the contractor that provides financial management services for self-directed clients in Arkansas, doesn’t pay his worker regularly, Walker knows, she might find work elsewhere through an agency or leave the industry altogether.In a 18 June joint statement, Palco and Arkansas DHS conceded: “When we went live April 1 with the EVV system for self-direction clients, there were more issues than we anticipated.”But self-directed clients and their advocates have been warning that the roll-out would fail for years. The state and its contractor, they say, were just not listening.As far back as April 2019, Brenda Stinebuck, the executive director of Spa Area Independent Living Services, worried that the system would be a catastrophe. Arkansas did not include self-directed clients or live-in caregivers in pilot testing. DHS had no communication about EVV with her office. “The ability to direct your own care is getting harder and harder and harder,” she said at the time.‘She’s with me 24/7. I don’t get overtime’The move to EVV has also made the jobs of family and live-in caregivers more difficult.Nancy Morell, 60, rises at 4am every day to bring her older sister Carolyn her coffee, bathe her, dry her hair and dress her. She sets her up to watch TV in the living room, with its broad windows overlooking the Ozark mountains outside Eureka Springs. Carolyn, who has cerebral palsy, can’t talk or move much, but they’ve found other ways to communicate.Morell, a slender woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, is a natural planner, running a complicated multigenerational household with grace and focus. She does Carolyn’s shopping and laundry, prepares her meals, carries her to the bathroom and shifts her between a beanbag, recliner and sofa to keep her comfortable. In good weather, she takes her to the back porch and they watch the hummingbird feeders together. She trims Carolyn’s nails, puts on her deodorant and lotion, and takes care of any other personal needs that come up before her sister goes to bed – she shares a room with her 85-year-old mother– at about 8pm.Morell attends Carolyn 16 hours a day, seven days a week – and she’s always available if there is an emergency in the night. “She’s with me 24/7. I don’t get overtime,” Morell said. Even so, the Arkansas department of human services (DHS) has determined that Carolyn’s needs can be met with 8 hours of care a day, so Morell is paid about $550 a week after taxes.Before the EVV rollout, Morell attended one of only two trainings offered by Palco. She downloaded the 43-page manual. She watched the YouTube video.She’s with me 24/7. I don’t get overtimeNancy MorellDespite all her efforts, Morell couldn’t access the system for two weeks. When she finally succeeded, her paycheck was three weeks late. She logged on to the website to find out why it was delayed, and saw the system had red-flagged all 16 of her shifts. In the 13 years she’s worked for her sister, she’s had just two shifts red-flagged by Palco, and the problems had been quickly resolved. Now, like Walker, she couldn’t get through to a support coordinator on the phone.But for Morell, the real problem is that EVV’s inflexibility adds new and seemingly arbitrary responsibilities to an already demanding job. Morell has to clock in and out of the app as often as four times a day, and on a fixed schedule, even though Carolyn gets care whenever she needs it, not at predetermined times. She sets alarms on her phone, terrified she’ll miss a clock-in because she is preparing meals or helping Carolyn to the bathroom. Her mother, who is Carolyn’s legal representative, has to sign the app at the end of every day.The 2016 federal law that paved the way for EVV – the 21st Century Cures Act – requires that the systems be “minimally burdensome.” But Arkansas, like many other states, appears to have implemented an approach with burdens galore.As Morell wrote in an 11 June letter to Arkansas DHS: “What took a total of 15 seconds – to sign a timesheet and submit to Palco – now takes many hours; hours that should be given to the client for care.”What happened when a ‘wildly irrational’ algorithm made crucial healthcare decisions Read moreEVV vendors promise their solutions will save states money by cutting down on what they claim is pervasive fraud and waste. A 2016 federal report claimed that EVV use across the country would eventually lead to $290m in cost savings over a ten year period, in part by reducing improper billing.But in practice there is little evidence to suggest fraud is either widespread or significant. Only seven people were charged with fraud in self-directed personal care services in Arkansas in 2020, out of a workforce of more than 4,500, according to data collected by Applied Self-Direction, a Boston-based consultancy. The state secured three convictions, recovering $1,930 total – $643 per case. The EVV system has cost the state $5.7m so far.And its human costs continue to mount.Recent complaints to Arkansas’s DHS, acquired through a public records request, illustrate the life-altering consequences of the widespread delays in payment. DHS made the following note about a voicemail the agency received from a home care worker: “She said she cannot buy groceries, her utilities are being shut off and she has an eviction notice.”In their statement, Palco and the Arkansas DHS say that “the EVV system is working and caregivers are getting paid. There is a very low error rate for submitted claims – just 2 percent.” Since Palco processes approximately 25,000 claims every two weeks, a 2% error rate affects the lives of 500 caregivers each pay period. And a single missed paycheck can quickly spell catastrophe for a low-wage worker.“There are, to this day, still beneficiaries trying to get their caregivers paid back to early April,” said Trevor Hawkins, staff attorney at Legal Aid of Arkansas, in an email. “There were no accommodations made to cover them while the bugs were worked out.”Digital timesheet or ankle monitor?For some, the new system feels like being under house arrest. The EVV app incorporates GPS to verify a home care worker’s location and a feature called “geofencing”. It establishes a maximum distance around a client’s home inside which a care worker is allowed to clock in or out without getting flagged as noncompliant.“The metal building down there, we know we can go that far,” says Melissa Harville, 46, standing near her front porch in rural Greenbrier, about 40 miles north of Little Rock. “And to the end of the driveway.”Harville used the EVV app to map out how far away from her home she is allowed to go without triggering an “unauthorized location” alert that will have to be resolved by her agency before she can be paid. In May, Harville and her partner Kevin Hoover, 57, were sitting outside their simple log home as bees buzzed loudly in the early summer sun. She was pointing out the boundaries of what the couple characterize as an invisible dog fence for humans. “It’s like living in a box,” she says.EVV has eroded both her and Hoover’s autonomy.View image in fullscreenLeDanté Walker uses his electronic visit verification app at his home in Hot Springs. Photograph: Rory Doyle/The GuardianBefore the home care agency she works for started using the AuthentiCare app in November 2020, she and Hoover, who has used a manual wheelchair since he lost the use of his legs in 2009, were always on the go. She could take him to therapy, grocery shopping, to see friends. “And now we can’t. You have to be at home to clock in and clock out,” Harville says.The intentions behind using GPS to verify a home care worker’s location might be to keep workers accountable and clients safe, but the implications are digital borders that undermine the philosophy behind independent living, advocates say.For more than six decades, disability activists have asserted the right to autonomy over one’s life and the ability to live, work and receive services within the broader community. Geo-fencing in EVV is built on a premise that contradicts this: it assumes that people like Kevin Hoover, who loves to fish, work on cars and play music with his friends, are homebound, not living active and vibrant lives.The state and Palco say that federal law requires them to log the location at which services are provided, and that the exception notices that caregivers and agencies perceive as errors are simply “informational geofencing messages” and “do not mean that time outside of the home will not be paid.”But the National Council on Independent Living conducted a survey of home care recipients and their care providers across 36 states in 2020, and found that one-third of respondents said that they “stay at home more often than prior to EVV use, due to fear that geofencing limitations will flag a visit as fraud or cause delay in or loss of provider wages.”What’s more, because workers and clients tend to be nearby when care services are delivered, “what EVV is doing is unintentionally tracking the recipient of care,” says Kendra Scalia, director of policy for the grassroots campaign Stop EVV.Karin Willison, disability editor at the digital health blog The Mighty, has argued that “electronic visit verification is the equivalent of putting an ankle monitor on people with disabilities and telling us where we can and can’t go.”‘We don’t deserve this’The EVV rollout tells a wider story about misplaced priorities. State Medicaid programs face perennial pressures to patch budget deficits by restricting eligibility, slashing benefits and suppressing worker wages.In this environment, tech solutions that promise cost savings appear appealing. But the human costs of EVV, whether financial or personal, may well exceed any gains in efficiency.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that home health and personal care aides will be among the fastest growing occupations in the coming years. But on top of low wages, these jobs typically do not come with standard workplace benefits like health insurance, paid sick leave, vacation or disability insurance. This leads to chronic labor shortages, which will only be worsened if care workers feel forced to abandon the profession because of delayed paychecks and digital surveillance.“Just stop,” says Nancy Morell, the woman who cares for her sister in Eureka Springs. “That app on your phone? It doesn’t guarantee that the work is being done any more than a paper timesheet does. Go back to the way it was before. That will attract people back into the job they signed up for. This job takes people with heart. We don’t deserve this.”‘They need to listen to people with disabilities’From the start, disability and labor advocates have been vocal about their concerns, providing input on ways to design systems that are less onerous and invasive. In California, the labor union United Domestic Workers and Disability Rights California collaborated with clients, workers and state officials to design an in-house web portal that did not collect GPS data or require workers to log their hours in real-time.However, the federal government said that this system would not be compliant, stating that web-based timesheets alone do not provide auditable confirmation of data submitted.Palco and the Arkansas DHS insist that EVV is inescapable.But the federal mandate is not inflexible. The state of Virginia chose to exempt live-in caregivers from EVV requirements entirely.

By Sara Zaske, WSU News
PULLMAN, Wash. – With a new $20 million federal grant, Washington State University will lead a multi-institutional research institute to develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to tackle some of agriculture’s biggest challenges related to labor, water, weather and climate change.
The new institute is one of 11 launched by the National Science Foundation and among two funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture in 2021. It’s called the AgAID Institute, which is short for USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support.
While traditional AI development involves scientists making tools and delivering them to end-users, the AgAID Institute will involve the people who will use the AI solutions—from farmers and workers to policy makers—in their development, said Ananth Kalyanaraman, a WSU computer science professor and the lead principal investigator for the Institute.
“People are very much part of the agricultural ecosystem. It’s not just plants growing. Humans manipulate crops on a daily basis and make complex decisions, such as how to allocate water or mitigate the effects of an incoming storm,” said Kalyanaraman, who also holds the Boeing Chair in WSU’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “We aim to partner human knowledge with AI tools in a way that amplifies the end outcomes where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”
Ananth Kalyanaraman
The AgAID Institute will be a multi-disciplinary, collaborative effort involving faculty and scientists with expertise on a diverse range of areas in computer science, agriculture and agricultural outreach.
In addition to WSU, the Institute members include Oregon State University; University of California, Merced; University of Virginia; Carnegie Mellon University; Heritage University; Wenatchee Valley College; and Kansas State University. Private sector partners include IBM Research and the start-up innov8.ag.
The AgAID Institute will take an “adopt-adapt-amplify” approach, Kalyanaraman said. This means first the Institute will design AI solutions in partnership with the people who use the tools, so they are practical and more likely to be adopted. The researchers will also work to make solutions that can adapt to changing environments and that amplify productivity by combining human skills and machine capabilities to be more effective than either would be alone. For instance, pruning trees is a highly skilled task, but a beginner-level worker could benefit from an AI tool that provides expert guidance to help decide which is the best branch to prune. The task is done better, and the worker starts to learn from the feedback, and with a shortage of skilled labor, AI can benefit both the orchard and the worker, said Kalyanaraman.
“It’s a partnership. AI can help us basically bridge the divide between high-skilled and low-skilled workers,” he said.
Educating the workforce at all levels is central to the AgAID Institute not just to encourage AI adoption but as a matter of equity, according to the Institute leaders. The Institute plans multiple education programs from K-12 through higher education and worker training. The goal is to raise AI skill levels and open new career paths, which can improve pay and quality of life for agricultural workers. It can also attract more people to agriculture and computing professions.
The AgAID Institute will undertake several challenging test cases involving specialty crops, many of which grow in the Western United States, such as apples, cherries, mint and almonds. These crops encompass several major challenges: they require intensive labor and irrigation. They are also vulnerable to weather events and climate change. Specialty crops account for 87% of the U.S. agricultural workforce, and about 40% of these crops are perennial, requiring long-term management and resource planning.
The difficult challenges posed by these cases would mean AgAID Institute’s solutions would be rigorously tested before being transferred to other regions in the country, said Kalyanaraman.
“We know that AI has a serious potential to make groundbreaking discoveries and transform our decision-making capabilities in a data-informed way, but the technology needs to be developed in a very careful manner,” he said.
This award is part of a significant investment by the federal agencies in state of Washington AI leadership, noted U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell. Two of the 11 funded institutes will be headed by universities in the state: in addition to the WSU-led AgAID Institute, the University of Washington will be leading the NSF AI Institute for Dynamic Systems.
“The state of Washington is already a leader in artificial intelligence,” said Cantwell. “From the University of Washington’s Tech Policy Lab that studies the grand challenges around artificial intelligence to Washington State University’s work in precision agriculture, we are more than ready for these two grants to help us understand more artificial intelligence applications. The UW will work in the area of complex systems to improve fields like manufacturing and WSU will work on improvements in farming.”
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers expressed her support for the new AgAID Institute.
“Washington State University has long been a leader in agriculture, innovation and technology,” said McMorris Rodgers. “I was proud to be a part of the conversation at the university’s Agriculture AI Summit in October 2020 and am pleased to see that WSU received designation as the USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support today. This institute, also known as AgAID, will integrate AI methods into agriculture operations for prediction, decision support and robotics-enabled agriculture to address the complex agricultural challenges facing Eastern Washington and the nation. I look forward to seeing the innovative work that will come out of this Institute to support our state’s agricultural industries.”

KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 29, 2021 – Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) announced a $220 million investment in 11 new NSF-led Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes. USDA-NIFA and other agencies and organizations have partnered with NSF to pursue transformational advances in a range of economic sectors and science and engineering fields — from food system security to next-generation edge networks.  
 
The new investment builds on the first round of seven Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institutes funded in 2020, totaling $140 million.
 
“In the tradition of USDA-NIFA investments, these new institutes leverage the scientific power of U.S. land-grant universities informed by close partnership with farmers, producers, educators and innovators to provide sustainable crop production solutions and address these pressing societal challenges,” said USDA-NIFA Director Dr. Carrie Castille. “These innovation centers will speed our ability to meet critical needs in the future agricultural workforce, providing equitable and fair market access, increasing nutrition security and providing tools for climate-smart agriculture.”
 
NSF’s investment will result in AI-based technologies that bring about a range of advances: helping older adults lead more independent lives and improving the quality of their care; transforming AI into a more accessible “plug-and-play” technology; creating solutions to improve agriculture and food supply chains; enhancing adult online learning by introducing AI as a foundational element; and supporting underrepresented students in elementary to post-doctoral STEM education to improve equity and representation in AI research.
 
To achieve investment goals, NSF partnered with USDA-NIFA, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Google, Amazon, Intel and Accenture.
 
“I am delighted to announce the establishment of new NSF National AI Research Institutes as we look to expand into all 50 states,” said National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “These institutes are hubs for academia, industry and government to accelerate discovery and innovation in AI. Inspiring talent and ideas everywhere in this important area will lead to new capabilities that improve our lives from medicine to entertainment to transportation and cybersecurity and position us in the vanguard of competitiveness and prosperity.”
 
Building on the seven awards funded in 2020, this second round of awards expands the reach of the AI Institutes to include a total of 37 states. The new awards, each at about $20 million over five years, will support 11 institutes spanning seven research areas in AI: Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration, AI for Advances in Optimization, AI and Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, AI in Computer and Network Systems, AI in Dynamic Systems, AI-Augmented Learning, and AI-Driven Innovation in Agriculture and the Food System.

Artificial intelligence can help.Matt AldertonPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:000:58AD0:10SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenEducators are at the ends of their ropes. So suggests a fall 2020 survey by RAND Corp., which found that a quarter of all teachers were thinking about leaving education.Remote learning and COVID-19 are partly to blame: More than half (57 percent) of teachers said they worked more hours per week during the pandemic than they did before it, according to RAND, and 80 percent reported feelings of burnout as a result. Even before COVID-19, however, former public-school teachers were struggling, and reported finding better pay, better work/life balance, more resources and a more manageable workload in jobs outside of education.“Part of the problem is that teachers spend a lot of time doing things that ... in their view are not the best and highest use of their time,” says former teacher Jake Bryant, now a partner at management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., where he serves the company’s education practice. “Nobody becomes a third-grade teacher because they love collecting permission slips and filling out attendance sheets. What motivates you to get into the profession is interacting and engaging with students, and helping them learn.”Technology might be the remedy, according to Bryant, who cites McKinsey research finding that teachers currently spend as much as 40 percent of their time on activities that could be automated. That’s hours every week that could be reallocated from administration to education.To be clear, robots won’t replace teachers. By deploying artificial intelligence (AI) in the classroom, however, experts like Bryant believe schools can remake education in ways that make teachers happier and students smarter.Building BandwidthBecause teachers are stretched so thin, AI can make a significant difference by streamlining administrative tasks.“The strongest use cases for AI in education are those that automate the more tedious aspects of the educator workload,” says Eric Wang, senior director at education technology company Turnitin AI. Take grading, for instance: Turnitin’s Gradescope platform uses AI to analyze students’ work. It finds and groups similar answers, then creates an automated rubric that helps teachers grade assignments in half the time.“The advantage of artificial intelligence is its ability to scale complex tasks or reduce time spent on redundant tasks,” Wang continues. “AI-powered learning products give faculty more time to focus on teaching and the interpersonal aspects of their interactions with students.”In 2016, Georgia Institute of Technology computer science professor Ashok Goel used AI to create a time-saving solution of his own: a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson that’s available 24/7 to answer routine questions posed by graduate students, such as when exams will take place.“Having an AI agent available to answer basic questions allows students to get help any time, any place, and reduces the load on teachers,” Goel explains. “Teachers spend so much time on mundane activities. Freeing them up would allow them to engage more deeply with learners, which is what teachers should be doing in the first place.”The Power of PersonalizationNo matter how much of it they have, AI can maximize teachers’ time by way of personalized and adaptive learning.“The typical classroom is incredibly diverse in terms of where students are starting from, what things they understand, what motivates them and how they feel engaged,” Bryant says. “Technology creates an opportunity for teachers to give instruction that’s more personalized with less effort.”Knewton’s Alta and Thinkster Math are two examples of adaptive learning. The former is an adaptive courseware system that uses AI to create personalized learning experiences in college-level math, science and economics. As students complete assignments inside the system, AI automatically recognizes knowledge gaps and retrieves content to address them. Students who understand the material can breeze through and move on, while those who don’t will receive extra, targeted instruction. All the while, the system feeds data to instructors to inform subsequent instruction.“The technology accelerates students through pieces where they don’t need help and spends more time with them in areas where they do,” explains Matthew Leavy, executive vice president and general manager of education publishing at Wiley, Knewton’s parent company. “And for instructors looking over large classrooms, it helps them understand where they should focus their teaching and where they don’t need to spend as much time.”Thinkster Math is a tutoring platform for K-12 students. First, learners take an online assessment that determines their knowledge in a given domain. Then, the system builds a personalized learning plan and assigns custom worksheets to complete. AI captures students’ work, provides video tutorials when learners get stuck and isolates learning opportunities that human instructors can focus on during subsequent live tutoring sessions.“We’ve married man with machine,” says Thinkster Math founder and CEO Raj Valli, who likens the technology to a swimming coach who watches his swimmers’ every stroke. “If you tell me to jump in the pool and swim back and forth, I’m never going to be a good swimmer. But if you jump in the pool with me and point out that I’m not kicking my right leg or using my left arm, then you can make me better. That’s the kind of observations our tutors are able to make using our technology.”Reading Progress, a brand-new tool from Microsoft, applies AI and speech recognition to reading fluency. Teachers assign reading level-appropriate passages that students read on camera and submit for review; with the help of AI, instructors can then assess performance and identify reading errors.“Everything Reading Progress does, a teacher could do if they were able to sit next to each of their students all day and coach them on every single word they read. But in a classroom of 20 or 30 students that’s often not possible,” says Anthony Salcito, Microsoft vice president of worldwide education. “Reading Progress helps teachers quickly assess how students are progressing so they can coach them where they need help.”Education EvolutionAI in the future might optimize not only individual curriculums, but also entire classrooms. For example, Goel says AI could be used for “matchmaking” — pairing students with the teachers and schools that are best suited to them based on their learning style. Meanwhile, Sean Ryan, president of the School Group at McGraw-Hill, says there’s an opportunity to organize students into classes based on aptitude instead of age. “For the most part, today we sort students chronologically no matter what. But AI gives us the ability to group students based on what they’re ready to learn next,” says Ryan.  McGraw-Hill’s ALEKS adaptive learning program uses AI to create personalized learning paths for students in kindergarten through college. “That can be hard to embrace because of social components. But with more education taking place in hybrid and online environments, there’s no reason not to put an eighth grader in a pre-calculus class if they’re cognitively ready,” Ryan says.It’s the beginning of a new era wherein learning is a journey instead of a destination. That makes teachers navigators — which is precisely what most of them want to be.“Teachers become teachers to help children maximize their potential,” Ryan concludes. “By allowing them to focus more on the social components of learning, technology helps them have the kind of impact they got into the profession to have.”CompareCredit.com2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee & no interest for 18 months, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoYiffanyThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsYiffany|AdAdLearn MoreUndoBetterBuckI'm a massive savings nerd: Here are 15 tricks that saved me money this year.How to copy-and-paste my favorite money-saving hacks from the past year, and how much you could potentially save (it's probably more than you'd think).BetterBuck|AdAdUndoHealth Insight JournalNew Edema Device Leaves Experts Speechless (It's Genius!)Health Insight Journal|AdAdLearn MoreUndoBarestepThese New Shoes Are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarestep|AdAdUndoCar Insurance DiscountVirginia Launches New Coverage for Cars Used Less Than 50 Miles/DayCar Insurance Discount|AdAdRead MoreUndo3SkipAds by HomeBuddyHere's an Estimated Cost for a One-Day Walk-in ShowerHomeBuddy|AdAdUndoHomebuddy.comRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards...Here's What They DiscoveredMore Than 410,000 Homeowners Have Already Done it.

The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has announced the establishment of the AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA), one of 11 new NSF National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes that will work to advance AI technologies and their associated benefits to society. The AIIRA will be led by Iowa State University (ISU) and feature collaboration across eight institutions, including the University of Missouri.
While the 11 AI Institutes will cover a wide range of AI technology and applications, the AIIRA will focus on a simulation technology that can create “digital twins” of real-world crops and farms, an approach that would provide specific, detailed information for better-informed crop management, technological development and agricultural policies. Using sensors to send real-time data about weather, soil composition and other factors to the digital twin, researchers plan to create a system that can accurately predict the outcome of a variety of “what-if” scenarios.
Michelle Segovia's research focuses on behavioral and experimental economics.
“Agricultural industries are facing a number of challenges in the coming years, including concerns about a more variable climate, growing population numbers and less available cropland,” said Michelle Segovia, an assistant professor of agricultural and applied economics at the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources. “This technology would allow researchers to test how those scenarios would impact food resources, and at MU, our job is to determine whether such a technology would be adopted by potential users.”
MU’s team, including Segovia and Corinne Valdivia, will conduct surveys, participatory workshops and economic experiments to identify the social, behavioral and business catalysts, and barriers to adoption of the digital twins. Insights gained from these efforts will directly inform the development and deployment of the technology, providing crucial information about the values, concerns and practices of decision makers — i.e. farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders — resulting in digital twins innovations that are salient, trusted and actionable.
Through collaboration among each of the eight AIIRA institutions, the institute will not only develop the AI technology and investigate the keys to its successful adoption, but will involve a wide variety of associated efforts, including education and workforce development in Native American communities, the development of cyberinfrastructure, robotics and rural outreach.
Corinne Valdivia is a professor of agricultural and applied economics in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources.
“The institute is collaborative by design, and the relationships between the researchers and institutions have been years in the making,” Segovia said. “MU’s expertise in social sciences, economics and translational research in innovations for agriculture will focus on AI innovation pathways that  create a feedback process among all actors and institutions in the Ag ecosystem. This is the case for each of the AAIRA institutions, and the result is a diverse cooperative process that allows us to cover many different angles of research and development at once.”
With a five-year, $20 million grant, the AAIRA is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA), one of several organizations funding the 11 new national institutes; others are funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, NSF and companies such as Google, Amazon, Intel and Accenture. In total, the 11 institutes represent an investment of about $220 million.
“In the tradition of USDA-NIFA investments, these new institutes leverage the scientific power of U.S. land-grant universities informed by close partnership with farmers, producers, educators and innovators to provide sustainable crop production solutions and address these pressing societal challenges,” said USDA-NIFA Director Carrie Castille. “These innovation centers will speed our ability to meet the critical needs in the future agricultural workforce, providing equitable and fair market access, increasing nutrition security and providing tools for climate-smart agriculture.”
In addition to MU and ISU, the partner institutions in the AIIRA are Carnegie Mellon University, New York University, the University of Arizona, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, George Mason University and the Iowa Soybean Association.

By Lorena Anderson, UC Merced, and Sara Zaske, Washington State UniversityJuly 29, 2021A machine developed in Professor Reza Ehsani's lab improves almond harvests by reducing the amount of dust stirred up as the nuts are gathered from the ground.With a new $20 million federal grant, UC Merced becomes part of a multi-institutional research collaborative to develop artificial intelligence — or AI — solutions to tackle some of agriculture’s biggest challenges related to water management, climate change and integration of new technology into farming.
The new institute is one of 11 launched this year by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and among two funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The newly announced AgAID Institute is shorthand for the collaborative USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support.
The AgAID Institute features four core institutions: UC Merced; Washington State University (WSU), the lead campus; Oregon State University; and the University of Virginia. The AgAID Institute bolsters UC Merced’s already strong focus on ag-tech solutions for sustainable food systems in California and beyond.
Professor Joshua Viers“This is only the second round of AI centers the NSF has funded, so we’re really honored to be contributing to this important and cutting-edge research effort,” environmental engineering  Professor Joshua Viers  said. Viers is the lead principal investigator from UC Merced and the campus director of the  Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute, which has been advancing ag-tech solutions for the San Joaquin Valley broadly. “We’ll be working to leverage computational knowledge to arrive at actionable decisions for farmers and water managers, and we’ll be the application test beds for much of what is developed at the other core institutions.”
Much of that testing will be done at UC Merced’s new experimental smart farm, a 40-acre site adjacent to campus that is in the planning stages.


""Not only are we building the future in the heart of California, but we are doing it in a way that speaks to our commitment to innovation in research and education that uplifts our region and results in a new generation of leaders for the Valley.""
UC Merced Chancellor Juan Sánchez MuñozWhile traditional AI development involves scientists making tools and delivering them to end-users, the AgAID Institute will involve the people who will use the AI solutions — from farmers and workers to policy makers — in their development. This “adopt-adapt-amplify” approach ensures solutions are practical and more likely to be adopted. The researchers will also work to create solutions that can adapt to changing environments and that amplify productivity by combining human skills and machine capabilities to be more effective than either would be alone.
“People are very much part of the agricultural ecosystem. It’s not just plants growing. Humans manipulate crops on a daily basis and make complex decisions, such as how to allocate water or mitigate the effects of an incoming storm,” said Ananth Kalyanaraman, a WSU computer science professor and AgAID Institute director. “We aim to partner human knowledge with AI tools in a way that amplifies the end outcomes where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”
Professor Jian-Qiao SunThe AgAID Institute will be a multi-disciplinary, collaborative effort involving faculty and scientists with expertise in a diverse range of areas in computer science, agriculture and agricultural outreach. In addition to the four core institutions, the collaborative includes Carnegie Mellon University and Kansas State University, and in an effort to train the next generation of educators and farm managers, UC Merced will work closely with other minority-serving institutions such as Heritage University and Wenatchee Valley College. Private sector partners include IBM Research and the start-up innov8.ag.
At UC Merced, School of Engineering professors Reza Ehsani, Jian-Qiao Sun,  John Abatzoglou  and  Josué Medellín-Azuara  will all be co-investigators and part of the Institute, as will social scientist Leigh Bernacchi, Ph.D., the CITRIS program director.
With this grant, NSF has made a $220 million investment in AI-based collaborations, building on the first round of seven AI Institutes funded in 2020.
The goal is to develop AI-based technologies that bring about a range of advances: helping older adults lead more independent lives and improving the quality of their care; transforming AI into a more accessible “plug-and-play” technology; creating solutions to improve agriculture and food supply chains; enhancing adult online learning; and supporting underrepresented students from elementary to post-doctoral STEM education to improve equity and representation in AI research.
Professor Reza EhsaniLed by NSF and in partnership with USDA-NIFA, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Google, Amazon, Intel and Accenture, the AI Institutes will act as connections in a nationwide network pursuing transformational advances in a range of economic sectors, and science and engineering fields — from food-system security to next-generation edge networks.
“AI is an enabling technology that can help us develop the next generation of intelligent farm equipment and implements. These machines could potentially be more efficient, easier to operate and could reduce production costs,” Ehsani said.
For instance, pruning trees is a highly skilled task, but a beginner-level worker could benefit from an AI tool that provides expert guidance to help decide which are the best branches to prune. The task is done better, and the worker starts to learn from the feedback. With a shortage of skilled labor, AI can benefit both the orchard and the worker, bridging a divide between high-skilled and low-skilled workers.


“AI is an enabling technology that can help us develop the next generation of intelligent farm equipment and implements. These machines could potentially be more efficient, easier to operate and could reduce production costs.""
Professor Reza EhsaniProfessor Josué Medellín-AzuaraEducating the workforce at all levels is central to the AgAID Institute not just to encourage AI adoption but as a matter of equity, Institute leaders said. The Institute plans multiple education programs from K-12 through higher education and worker training. The goal is to raise AI skill levels and open new career paths, which can improve pay and quality of life for agricultural workers. It can also attract more people to agriculture and computing professions.
The AgAID Institute will undertake several challenging test cases involving specialty crops, many of which grow in the western United States, such as almonds, pistachios, apples, cherries and hops. These crops encompass several major challenges: They require intensive labor and irrigation. They are also vulnerable to weather events and climate change. Specialty crops account for 87% of the U.S. agricultural workforce, and about 40% of these crops are perennial, requiring long-term management and resource planning.
Professor John Abatzoglou“AgAID seeks to apply advances in computational technology to the long-standing wicked challenge of agricultural lands in the semi-arid West that are constrained by climate, land and people,” Abatzoglou said. “This support will help develop tech-based solutions for ameliorating the cascading impacts of water scarcity in agricultural systems we’ve experienced recently and will continue to face.”
Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz, Ph.D., who champions UC Merced’s leadership in sustainability and its strong integration into the future of the San Joaquin Valley and its communities, addressed the importance of the AgAID Institute for students and the Valley.
“This artificial intelligence institute for transforming workforce and decision support in agriculture speaks to our increasing national and global recognition for cutting-edge research,” Muñoz said. “Sustaining the future of agriculture — the primary economic activity in our region — is paramount. Not only are we building the future in the heart of California, but we are doing it in a way that speaks to our commitment to innovation in research and education that uplifts our region and results in a new generation of leaders for the Valley.""

Washington State University will lead a new federally funded research institute to take the agriculture industry further into the future via artificial intelligence.
The USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support – also known as the AgAID Institute – will look at how AI can help tackle farming challenges related to climate change, weather, water supply and labor.
To that end, WSU researchers will lead a coalition of colleges and universities as well as private sector partners through the AgAID Institute, which will be funded through a five-year, $20 million U.S. Department of Agriculture grant.
“We also know that agriculture has entered in some ways a new era. It’s what some people talk about as Agriculture 4.0,” said WSU professor Ananth Kalyanaraman, director of the AgAID Institute. “It’s almost an evolution that is needed in agriculture to tackle some of the 21st century challenges.”
AgAID is one of 11 new AI research institutes announced Thursday by the National Science Foundation.
The University of Washington will lead another: The NSF AI Institute for Dynamic Systems will focus on AI innovations with real-time learning and control of complex dynamic systems, which describe chaotic situations caused by constantly shifting conditions, according to the university.
“Some of our specific questions include: Can we develop better machine-learning technologies by baking in and enforcing known physics, such as conservation laws, symmetries, etc.?” institute associate director Steve Brunton, a UW associate professor of mechanical engineering, said in a statement. “Similarly, in complex systems where we only have partially known or unknown physics – such as neuroscience or epidemiology – can we use machine learning to learn the ‘physics’ of these systems?”
Kalyanaraman, a professor with WSU’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, will lead the AgAID Institute.
Partners with the institute include Oregon State University; University of California, Merced; University of Virginia; Carnegie Mellon University; Heritage University; Wenatchee Valley College; Kansas State University; IBM Research and the start-up innov8.ag.
Kalyanaraman said WSU first formed an internal team of computer science researchers and agricultural stakeholders a few years ago to look into the perceptions and practical applications of AI with farming. The team then grew with external partners, including a number of the institute’s partnering universities.
These partnerships incidentally put the coalition in prime position when the National Science Foundation put out a call for proposals with the research institute initiative last year, Kalyanaraman said.
One of the focuses of the institute will be education programs from K-12 through higher education and worker training. Kalyanaraman also said much of the institute’s initial years will be spent working directly with stakeholders in the agricultural industry – essentially the end users of these systems – to determine their needs and practical restraints.
“It’s one thing to have AI tools and design AI tools to work in lab settings,” he said, “but it’s a completely different beast when we talk about transferring AI to work while in the field.”
AI, Kalyanaraman said, can help farm managers better forecast the availability of water and allocate that supply in smart ways to prevent significant losses. He said such innovations can also help farmers better predict the weather and plan for extreme weather .
“How can you take the data that is being generated and convert that into some kind of actionable knowledge to make real-time decisions?” Kalyanaraman said. “That is where AI comes in.”
Labor, meanwhile, is another challenge particularly with specialty crops – such as apples, cherries, mint and almonds – that require skill-intensive processes. Specialty crops account for 87% of the U.S. agricultural workforce, according to the university; many are grown in the Western U.S.
As an example, Kalyanaraman said an AI-driven device could  guide a farm worker with pruning crops with adroitness.
But don’t expect robots to manage these specialty crops anytime soon.
“A machine simply can’t substitute the human on the farm,” Kalyanaraman said. “Farmworkers are an integral part of the chain, and they will continue to be. Except now with machines, we can help train them better and also have some degree of automation in the sense that guidance is possible.”
U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray lauded Thursday’s announcement.
Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement the investments involving both WSU and UW “will be critical to ensuring that the state of Washington remains a leader in innovation, research and scientific achievement.”
“From the University of Washington’s Tech Policy Lab that studies the grand challenges around artificial intelligence to Washington State University’s work in precision agriculture, we are more than ready for these two grants to help us understand more artificial intelligence applications,” Cantwell, D-Wash., said in a statement.

The possibilities of technology are leaving everyone in awe. Truly, the worldly applications of artificial intelligence are arming up to automate anything and everything. At a time when artificial intelligence is at its peak, we are bound to discuss its adverse side. Although technology is minimizing human workload, in some cases, it is stealing the job from humans. In the worst-case scenario, AI is taking over data science jobs from mankind in 2021..While artificial intelligence is moving all the heavy rocks, it still induces an array of fear among people. One reason for this is because of the scary sci-fi movies we have come across. Many of them portray technology and automation as human enemies. Besides, people are also terrified of the fact that machines are replacing their stance in the workforce. Today, many of the heavy machinery works in manufacturing houses, factories, and the shipping industry is being carried out by machines. But originally, despite the hardship, human laborers did the work and were getting paid for it. What initially started as a wipeout move to replace time-consuming jobs, is now taking over intellectual works like data processing. Data science is a vast field that employs and sorts many big data-related issues. Technology has been spearheaded to be the core of many business decisions in the 21st century. Owing to its hype, the demand for data science jobs has also drastically surged. For over a decade now, being a data scientist is the hottest job in the tech sphere. Maybe, not anymore. AI is taking over data science jobs by carrying out whatever big data-related works they do. Without much effort, automation can process, sort, and analyze data, and make well-informed business decisions..WHY IS IT NECESSARY FOR ENGINEERS TO LEARN DATA SCIENCE IN 2021?DATA SCIENCE IS HERE TO SPEARHEAD ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH TOUGH COMPETITIONBEST DATA SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS TO DISCOVER CAREER OPPORTUNITIES.The Routine of Data Scientists.In order to learn how artificial intelligence is slowly replacing data scientists, we need to take a look at the routines of data scientists. Data scientists are professionals who take data from their repository in order to design, build, and test advanced models, based on machine learning algorithms. Their frequent tasks include preparing data, cleansing, checking for correctness, identifying outliers, and empty records. Besides, data scientists also detect prediction features and represent them, identify obsolescence of models, build basic models through intuitive interfaces, etc..What are the Tasks that AI is Automating?.As the influence of artificial intelligence has spiraled in the digital world, it leads us to a debate on how automation will take over human jobs. Because of the recent advancements, we don't even have a choice to think of 'how,' but are moving towards 'what' jobs profiles will be filled by AI in 2021. One thing that stands first in the line is data science. Yes, to be precise, companies are paying a fortune for data scientists today. Although data scientists play a big role in business decision-making and problem shooting, organizations still prefer to look for an alternative that could cost them less..Already, emerging AI algorithms are used to analyze data and provide solutions similar to those provided by data scientists. Automating the data processing tasks is more likely to surge in the coming years as it is easy for data professionals to get what they need without requiring human intervention. According to a Gartner report, around 40% of data science work was anticipated to be automated by 2020. As a result of this, the demand for data scientists has fallen flat. On a general scale, AI is taking over data science jobs without much hesitation. It can surely outperform data scientists in terms of speed and risk management. However, one thing that still keeps automation away from certain data science tasks is human intelligence. Although machines can take over the programmed routine tasks, troubleshooting and sorting a problem would be difficult for artificial intelligence..While we talk about the critical points that keep the machine from becoming human competition, let's also look at some of the data science routines that AI can effortlessly take over. Artificial intelligence and data science work in accord to improve each other's efficiencies. A dynamic, multi-faceted decision process obtained through automation will outperform any single algorithm, no matter how advanced, by automatically testing, iterating, and monitoring data quality. In a nutshell, automation can genuinely take over lower-level tasks without any hesitation. Besides, if we move out of the job replacement bubble, artificial intelligence could even stand by data scientists' side in a supportive way. They can function as intelligent assistants to data scientists, allowing them to run more complex data simulations than ever before..Machines are Pumping up the Skill Demand.The AI transformation is introducing a quest for special skills in the job market. Even in the data science field, the wave of automation has spiked the demand for specialized skills that data scientists need to possess in order to sustain this storm. They are openly keeping the bar of expectation high for many data science professionals with companies adding up more skill demands to their hiring process..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The CDC also revised its school recommendations, calling for universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to schools, regardless of their vaccination status.


Dr. Gregory A. Franklin, who has been superintendent of the Tustin Unified School District for the last decade, announced that he’ll retire on Dec. 31, capping a career in education that has spanned more than 35 years.


State data shows that charter school enrollment in Orange County climbed to 4.6 percent in the 2020-21 school year from 2.4 percent in 2014-15. Meanwhile, some are expressing concerns about a lack of oversight, the Voice of OC reports.


The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified school board voted 3-2 in favor of a resolution asking the California Department of Public Health to give schools the option of having students wear face coverings while indoors.


The California State University system says it will require students, faculty and staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to its 23 campuses for the fall semester. The Los Angeles Times reports that medical and religious exemptions will be permitted, but unvaccinated students will have to be tested regularly.


Meanwhile, Californians are split over whether the COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory for students and teachers in public schools, KTLA channel 5 reports.


And finally, parents of high school students have the right to request a grade change — to pass or no-pass — for courses they took in 2020-21 under new legislation signed by the governor on July 1, EdSource reports. The idea is not to punish students for the impacts of the pandemic.

Artificial intelligence is the most disruptive technology of our time, transforming business processes and the world we live in. Companies are using artificial intelligence to extract its full potential and improve the overall customer experience. Artificial intelligence trends for 2021 are moving in the direction of innovation. The results are already visible in the form of algorithms. For example, Google’s BRET transformative neural network is a new algorithm that promises to revolutionize NLP. Similarly, new tools are being developed for businesses to automate machine learning tasks and accelerate innovation and solution development. Artificial intelligence is also moving towards conceptual models, smaller devices and multi-model applications. It is therefore important for technology organizations to keep abreast of available technological developments.
1.Machine learningAutoML will provide enhanced tools to improve data labelling and neural network architectures. Data tagging is an essential component of industries, which is now outsourced to countries such as India, Central and Eastern Europe and South America. Because of the pandemic-related business disruption, companies are now looking for extra days to avoid or minimize this part of the process. The advantage of automating the work of selecting and tuning a neural network model is that AI will become available at a low cost and therefore more new solutions can be created.
Conceptual design using AITraditionally, the main applications of artificial intelligence have been in optimizing processes related to data, image and language analysis. Sectors such as finance, retail and healthcare have used the technology to automate repetitive tasks. Recent developments in OpenAI will change this mindset. Known as DALL E and CLIP, these models will combine language and images to generate new visual models by understanding textual descriptions.Supporting multiple learning domainsDue to frequent advances, the ability of artificial intelligence to support multiple modalities within a single ML model is improving. The technology can now leverage data from text, vision, speech and IoT sensors. Developers are also taking advantage of this capability and innovating in various ways to improve common tasks. In healthcare, patient data collected by health systems includes visual labs, clinical trial reports and other documents. With the right layout and presentation style, this can help doctors better understand the situation. Artificial intelligence models that can work with multimodal techniques can do the job of presenting reports and improving medical diagnosis.Miniature MLMiniature or tiny machine learning is being developed. These tiny models will work on devices that don’t use much hardware, such as microcontrollers to power machines. Tiny ML algorithms can be used for local analysis of voice commands or simple gestures to identify sounds such as a gunshot or a baby crying.AI for employee experienceEvery time a new development in artificial intelligence emerges, there is concern that it will threaten people’s jobs. Leaders combat this concern by improving the employee experience with artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence will help offload human tasks, for example in sales and customer service teams. With RPA, artificial intelligence can automate tedious tasks and free up human effort for better work.Quantum machine learningQuantum computing can create powerful AI and ML models. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and IBM have started working on this technology to make quantum computing more accessible via the cloud. With this potential, organizations can solve critical problems and pursue quantum applications across industries.AI for allThe constant evolution of artificial intelligence is making things easier for everyone. Democratized AI will improve AI development, making it faster and more accurate. Industry experts and other frontline workers will also be able to work with AI when needed.

Are data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence and data science capable of achieving this – or will the bias that already drives real-world outcomes eventually overtake the digital world, too?Bias represents injustice against a person or a group. A lot of existing human bias can be transferred to machines because technologies are not neutral; they are only as good, or bad, as the people who develop them. To explain how bias can lead to prejudices, injustices and inequality in corporate organizations around the world, I will highlight two real-world examples where bias in artificial intelligence was identified and the ethical risk mitigated. In 2014, a team of software engineers at Amazon were building a program to review the resumes of job applicants. Unfortunately, in 2015 they realized that the system discriminated against women for technical roles. Amazon recruiters did not use the software to evaluate candidates because of these discrimination and fairness issues. Meanwhile in 2019, San Francisco legislators voted against the use of facial recognition, believing they were prone to errors when used on people with dark skin or women.Have you read?How to use AI hiring tools to reduce bias in recruitingAI is showing signs of serious pro-male bias, study findsAI has a bias problem. This is how we can solve itThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted research that evaluated facial-recognition algorithms from around 100 developers from 189 organizations, including Toshiba, Intel and Microsoft. Speaking about the alarming conclusions, one of the authors, Patrick Grother, says: ""While it is usually incorrect to make statements across algorithms, we found empirical evidence for the existence of demographic differentials in the majority of the algorithms we studied.”Ridding AI and machine learning of bias involves taking their many uses into consideration Image: British Medical JournalTo list some of the source of fairness and non-discrimination risks in the use of artificial intelligence, these include: implicit bias, sampling bias, temporal bias, over-fitting to training data, and edge cases and outliers. Implicit biasImplicit bias is discrimination or prejudice against a person or group that is unconscious to the person with the bias. It is dangerous because the person is unaware of the bias – whether it be on grounds of gender, race, disability, sexuality or class.Sampling bias This is a statistical problem where random data selected from the population do not reflect the distribution of the population. The sample data may be skewed towards some subset of the group.Temporal biasThis is based on our perception of time. We can build a machine-learning model that works well at this time, but fails in the future because we didn't factor in possible future changes when building the model.Over-fitting to training dataThis happens when the AI model can accurately predict values from the training dataset but cannot predict new data accurately. The model adheres too much to the training dataset and does not generalize to a larger population.Edge cases and outliers These are data outside the boundaries of the training dataset. Outliers are data points outside the normal distribution of the data. Errors and noise are classified as edge cases: Errors are missing or incorrect values in the dataset; noise is data that negatively impacts on the machine learning process.How to identify fairness and non-discrimination risksAnalytical techniquesAnalytical techniques require meticulous assessment of the training data for sampling bias and unequal representations of groups in the training data. You can investigate the source and characteristics of the dataset. Check the data for balance. For instance, is one gender or race represented more than the other? Is the size of the data large enough for training? Are some groups ignored?A recent study on mortgage loans revealed that the predictive models used for granting or rejecting loans are not accurate for minorities. Scott Nelson, a researcher at the University of Chicago, and Laura Blattner, a Stanford University economist, found out that the reason for the variance between mortgage approval for majority and minority group is because low-income and minority groups have less data documented in their credit histories. Without strong analytical study of the data, the cause of the bias will be undetected and unknown.Test the model in different environmentsWhat if the environment you trained the data is not suitable for a wider population? Expose your model to varying environments and contexts for new insights. You want to be sure that your model can generalize to a wider set of scenarios. A review of a healthcare-based risk prediction algorithm that was used on about 200 million American citizens showed racial bias. The algorithm predicts patients that should be given extra medical care. It was found out that the system favoured white patients over black patients. The problem with the algorithm’s development is that it wasn't properly tested with all major races before deployment.Strategies for mitigating fairness and non-discrimination risksInclusive design and foreseeabilityInclusive design emphasizes inclusion in the design process. The AI product should be designed with consideration for diverse groups such as gender, race, class, and culture. Foreseeability is about predicting the impact the AI system will have right now and over time.Recent research published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reviewed more than 70 academic publications based on the diagnostic prowess of doctors against digital doppelgangers across several areas of clinical medicine. A lot of the data used in training the algorithms came from only three states: Massachusetts, California and New York. Will the algorithm generalize well to a wider population?A lot of researchers are worried about algorithms for skin-cancer detection. Most of them do not perform well in detecting skin cancer for darker skin because they were trained primarily on light-skinned individuals. The developers of the skin-cancer detection model didn't apply principles of inclusive design in the development of their models.Perform user testingTesting is an important part of building a new product or service. User testing in this case refers to getting representatives from the diverse groups that will be using your AI product to test it before it is released. STEEPV analysisThis is a method of performing strategic analysis of external environments. It is an acronym for social (i.e. societal attitudes, culture and demographics), technological, economic (ie interest, growth and inflation rate), environmental, political and values. Performing a STEEPV analysis will help you detect fairness and non-discrimination risks in practice.DiscoverWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about diversity, equity and inclusion? Show moreThe COVID-19 pandemic and recent social and political unrest have created a profound sense of urgency for companies to actively work to tackle inequity.The Forum's work on Diversity, Equality, Inclusion and Social Justice is driven by the New Economy and Society Platform, which is focused on building prosperous, inclusive and just economies and societies. In addition to its work on economic growth, revival and transformation, work, wages and job creation, and education, skills and learning, the Platform takes an integrated and holistic approach to diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice, and aims to tackle exclusion, bias and discrimination related to race, gender, ability, sexual orientation and all other forms of human diversity. The Platform produces data, standards and insights, such as the Global Gender Gap Report and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 4.0 Toolkit, and drives or supports action initiatives, such as Partnering for Racial Justice in Business, The Valuable 500 – Closing the Disability Inclusion Gap, Hardwiring Gender Parity in the Future of Work, Closing the Gender Gap Country Accelerators, the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality, the Community of Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officers and the Global Future Council on Equity and Social Justice. It is very easy for the existing bias in our society to be transferred to algorithms. We see discrimination against race and gender easily perpetrated in machine learning. There is an urgent need for corporate organizations to be more proactive in ensuring fairness and non-discrimination as they leverage AI to improve productivity and performance. One possible solution is by having an AI ethicist in your development team to detect and mitigate ethical risks early in your project before investing lots of time and money.Don't miss any update on Data ScienceSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesEconomic GrowthEquity, Diversity and InclusionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

That is the moment when — as AI’s boosters dream — machines reach the ability to reason and perform at human or superhuman levels in most activities, including those that involve judgment, creativity and design.Sign up for the Prompt 2024 newsletter for opinions on the biggest questions in politicsAI detractors have focused on the potential danger to human civilization from a super-intelligence if it were to run amok. Such warnings have been sounded by tech entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Elon Musk, physicist Stephen Hawking and leading AI researcher Stuart Russell.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWe should indeed be afraid — not of what AI might become, but of what it is now.Almost all of the progress in artificial intelligence to date has little to do with the imagined Artificial General Intelligence; instead, it has concentrated on narrow tasks. AI capabilities do not involve anything close to true reasoning. Still, the effects can be pernicious.Narrow AI is already displacing workers. My research, with David Autor, Jonathon Hazell and Pascual Restrepo, finds that firms that increase their AI adoption by 1 percent reduce their hiring by approximately 1 percent. And of course narrow AI is powering new monitoring technologies used by corporations and governments — as with the surveillance state that Uyghurs live under in China. It is also being used in the U.S. justice system for bail decisions and, now increasingly, in sentencing. And it is warping public discourse on social media, hampering the functioning of modern democracies.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe labor-market effects of AI may be the most ominous. The U.S. economy once created plentiful good jobs — paying decent wages and providing job security and career-building opportunities — for workers with all kinds of backgrounds and skills. From the end of World War II to the mid-1970s, the United States witnessed not just robust employment growth but also rapid wage growth for both high-education and low-education workers.This growth stopped long before AI. From the 1980s onward, median wages stagnated. Men with less than a college degree started experiencing sharp declines in their real earnings.During that period, automation and corporations’ off-shoring jobs to other countries drove the declines. But now AI is accelerating the trend, approaching or sometimes even exceeding human productivity in some very specific tasks in offices, warehouses and elsewhere. Many employers, focused on cost-cutting, will jump at any opportunity to eliminate jobs using these nascent technologies.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSome economists think fears of automation and AI displacing workers are overblown. They argue that as work becomes more AI-automated, the resulting productivity gains will spearhead labor demand in other parts of the economy, and sometimes even in the same firms doing the AI-driven automation.Share this articleShareIf AI technologies were truly spectacular in the tasks they performed today, the argument would have some validity. Alas, current AI technologies are not just far from general intelligence; they are not even that good at things that are second nature to humans — such as facial recognition, language comprehension and problem-solving. This means a double whammy for labor, because AI technologies displace labor and don’t generate any of the labor-demand boost that would have resulted if the technology had delivered more meaningful productivity gains.Other applications of AI are likely to exacerbate the growing power of corporations and capital over labor, adding to these troubling trends. AI enables much better monitoring of workers — for example, in warehouses, fast-food restaurants and the delivery business.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe applications of AI in government decision-making, most importantly in the criminal justice system, are no less worrying. Existing evidence suggests that algorithms are inheriting and sometimes intensifying existing biases and inequities.Then there is AI’s damage to democratic discourse and politics. This is not only because of algorithmic misinformation in social media but also because the growing ability of companies and governments to monitor and manipulate the behaviors of millions of people, which is fundamentally inconsistent with true democracy.Every new technology creates challenges, necessitating critical decisions that determine who benefits and who loses out, and whether the benefits justify the damage.Story continues below advertisementThis is doubly true for AI, and not just because of its pervasive effects throughout society and impacts on areas typically untouched by other technologies, such as human judgment. It is also because there are many different ways in which the future of AI can be shaped: Will AI be allowed to work increasingly to displace and monitor humans, or steered toward complementing and augmenting human capabilities, creating new opportunities for workers?AdvertisementThese choices need oversight from society and government to prevent misuses of the technology and to regulate its effects on the economy and democracy. If the choices are left in the hands of AI’s loudest enthusiasts, decisions that benefit the decision-makers and impose myriad costs on the rest of us become more likely.The best way to reverse this trend is to recognize the tangible costs that AI is imposing right now — and stop worrying about evil super-intelligence.Story continues below advertisementRead more:The Post’s View: The United States can’t let other countries write AI policy for itAriel Procaccia: It’s time for AI to outgrow gamingLeana S.

Will it soon create diverse characters we can talk to instead of just shoot?Keith StuartMon 19 Jul 2021 04.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 19 Jul 2021 06.26 EDTShare149149In May, as part of an otherwise unremarkable corporate strategy meeting, Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida made an interesting announcement. The company’s artificial intelligence research division, Sony AI, would be collaborating with PlayStation developers to create intelligent computer-controlled characters. “By leveraging reinforcement learning,” he wrote, “we are developing game AI agents that can be a player’s in-game opponent or collaboration partner.” Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning in which an AI effectively teaches itself how to act through trial and error. In short, these characters will mimic human players. To some extent, they will think.Sign up to Alex Hern’s weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.This is just the latest example of AI’s evolving and expanding role in video game development. As open world games become more complex and ambitious, with hundreds of characters and multiple intertwined narratives, developers are having to build systems capable of generating intelligent, reactive, creative characters and emergent side quests.For its Middle-earth games, developer Monolith created the acclaimed Nemesis AI system, which lets enemies remember their fights against the player, creating blood feuds that flare up throughout the adventure. The recent Watch Dogs: Legion generates life stories, relationships and daily routines for every London citizen you interact with – so if you save a character’s life one day, their best mate may well join you the next. The experimental text adventure AI Dungeon uses OpenAI’s natural language modeller GPT-3 to create new emergent narrative experiences.View image in fullscreenMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Photograph: Warner BrosBut the field of AI has a problem with diversity. Research published by New York University in 2019 found that 80% of AI professors speaking at major events were men, while just 15% of AI researchers at Facebook were women and only 10% at Google. Statistics for people of colour in tech are worse: just 2.5% of Google’s workforce are black; 4% at Facebook. The risk of such a homogeneous working culture is that gender and racial biases can feed unchecked into AI algorithms, producing results that replicate entrenched imbalances and prejudices. There have been numerous examples over the past five years, from facial recognition systems that discriminate against people of colour to AI recruitment tools that favour male applicants.Now that the games industry is exploring many of the same AI and machine learning systems as academia and the big tech giants, is the diversity problem something it should be tackling? We know that video game development has presented similar issues with homogeneity, both in its work force and in its products – it is something the industry claims it is keen to address. So if we’re going to see AI-generated characters and stories about diverse backgrounds and experiences, don’t developers need to be thinking about diversifying the teams behind them?We’ll see new forms of play that leverage feelings of creativity, love and joy more so than triumph or dominationUma Jayaram, general manager of SEED, the innovation and applied research team at Electronic Arts, certainly thinks so. As a tech entrepreneur she has worked in cloud computing, VR and data-at-scale as well as AI, and says she has sought to comprise her global team – based in Sweden, the UK, Canada and the US – of different genders, ethnicities and cultures.“A diverse team allows for multiple points of view to coalesce and creates possibilities for a more representative outcome and product,” she says. “It also enhances opportunities to create awareness, empathy and respect for individuals who are different from us. A video game is in a way an extension of our physical world, and a place where people spend time and form rich experiences that loop back into the collective sense of self and community. As such, it is a great opportunity to bring in diversity in two ways: in the teams designing and architecting these worlds, and in the worlds being created and the denizens that inhabit them.”Electronic Arts is currently looking into developing systems that can use machine learning to replicate facial expressions, skin types and body movements from video and photos, rather than having to bring actors into a mo-cap studio. In theory, this should expand the range of genders and ethnicities that can be produced in games, and Jayaram says EA is committed to using diverse data in its R&D projects. The company is also looking at employing user-generated content in games, and allowing players to make a unique avatar by capturing their own likeness and expressions on a smartphone or webcam and uploading it into the game.View image in fullscreenCaves of Qud is a ‘roguelike’ fantasy game with deep simulation and AI components. Photograph: Freehold GamesThe emphasis on diverse data is important, because it highlights a misconception about AI: that it is somehow objective because it is the result of computation. AI algorithms rely on data, and if that data is coming from a single demographic, it will reflect that group’s biases and blind spots. “We’re used to thinking about AI like physics engines or multiplayer code – something technical that happens behind the scenes,” says AI researcher and game developer Michael Cook. “But AI today is a part of the whole creative work. It controls how little AI people behave and treat each other in The Sims; it generates cultures and religions in games like Caves of Qud and Ultima Ratio Regum; it’s part of political statements in Watch Dogs: Legion. AI engineers have as much responsibility to the player as the writers and designers. They create part of the experience, and they have a huge capacity to harm. We’ve seen recently how AI Dungeon is generating stories that are potentially traumatic for the player, without warning.”At Microsoft, the company’s AI research team in Cambridge have several ongoing studies into machine learning and games, including Project Paidia, which is investigating the use of reinforcement-learning in game AI agents that can collaborate with human players. The company’s recent virtual summit included several talks on ethical considerations in games AI.View image in fullscreenMicrosoft’s research team in Cambridge is using the game Bleeding Edge to investigate reinforcement learning. Photograph: Microsoft“AI agents can be built to develop, grow and learn over time, and are only as good as what you are putting in,” says Jimmy Bischoff, director of quality at Xbox Game Studios. “Being culturally appropriate in terms of dialogue and content comes down to how it is trained. We want to build games that everyone wants to play and that everyone can relate to, so we need to have people that can represent all our players.”Microsoft also sees potential in player modelling – AI systems that learn how to act and react by observing how human players behave in game worlds. As long as you have a wide player base, this is one way to increase the diversity of data being fed into AI learning systems. “Next will be characters that are trained to provide a more diverse, or more human-like range of opponents,” says Katja Hofmann, a principle researcher at Microsoft Cambridge. “The scenario of agents learning from human players is one of the most challenging – but also one of the most exciting directions.“At the same time, I want to emphasise that AI technologies will not automatically give rise to diverse game experiences. Technology developers and creators need to make choices on how to use AI technologies, and those choices determine whether and how well the resulting characters and experiences reflect different genders and heritages.”Amanda Phillips, the author of Gamer Trouble: Feminist Confrontations in Digital Culture, is similarly cautious about placing the impetus for change solely on diverse people in AI teams. “Having a diverse team is absolutely necessary for ensuring more design angles are being considered, but I think it’s important not to fetishise underrepresented and marginalised individuals as the solutions to problems that often have very deep roots in company and industry practices,” says Phillips. “It puts a tremendous amount of pressure on folks who often have less job security, clout and resources to educate their peers (and supervisors) about issues that can be very personal. This is what is popularly called an “add diversity and stir” approach, where companies bring in “diverse” individuals and expect them to initiate change without any corresponding changes to the workplace.“Teams need to diversify, but they also need to hire consultants, audit their own practices, make organisational changes, shake up the leadership structure – whatever is necessary to ensure that the folks with the perspectives and the knowledge to understand diversity and equity in a deep way have the voice and the power to influence the product output.”One of the most fundamental elements set to unconsciously shape AI is the games industry’s inclination to think about video games purely as adversarial systems, where AI’s role is to create allies or enemies that are more effective in combat. But if we look outside the mainstream industry, we do see alternatives. Coder and NYU professor Mitu Khandaker set up her studio Glow Up Games with technologist Latoya Peterson to make social narrative games for diverse audiences. The team is currently working on Insecure: The Come Up Game, a smartphone life sim based around the hit HBO series, which explores the relationships between characters.“What I’m really interested in as a designer is, how do we build tools that let players construct fun AI systems or AI agents for other people to play with?” says Khandaker. “I’ve been saying this for ages – there’s a broader cultural point around how important it is to create a legibility of AI – creating a way for people to understand how AI even works – and we can do that by exposing them to it in a playful way. It’s effectively just computers doing some calculations and trying to predict stuff it should do. It’s not magic, but certainly what it produces can be delightful.”The development studio Tru-Luv, which created the hugely successful Self-Care app, is working on AI technologies that reflect the company’s own diverse, progressive and supportive studio culture. “Our company is currently one-third BIPOC [black, indigenous and people of colour] and two-thirds women,” says studio founder Brie Code. “Our executive team is 100% women, and our board is one-third BIPOC and two-thirds women. We work with consultants and partner organisations from emerging development communities such as those in Pakistan, Tunisia, and Morocco.”View image in fullscreenSelfCare by Tru-LuvLike Khandaker, Code argues that a diverse workforce won’t just eliminate problematic biases from conventional games, it will allow for the development of new interactive experiences. “The games industry has focused on a narrow subset of human psychology for several years,” she says. “It is very good at creating experiences that help people feel a sense of achievement or dominance. Game AI created by a diverse workforce will bring life to NPCs and experiences that represent the breadth and depth of the human experience. We’ll see more non-zero-sum experiences, more compassion, more emotional resonance, more insight, more transcendence. We’ll see new forms of play that leverage feelings of creativity, love and joy more so than triumph or domination.”As developers begin to understand and exploit the greater computing power of current consoles and high-end PCs, the complexity of AI systems will increase in parallel. Developers will explore elements such as natural language processing, player modelling and machine learning to develop imaginative, reactive AI characters, facilitated by emerging AI middleware companies such as Spirit AI and Sonantic; worlds will begin to tell their own stories to augment those penned by game designers and writers. But it’s right now that those teams need to think about who is coding those algorithms and what the aim is.“[We have] a golden opportunity to create a ‘new normal’,” says Jayaram. “We can reject stereotypes in portrayal, source diverse data for the machine learning models, and ensure that the algorithms powering the games promote fairness and respect across gender and ethnicity.”Mike Cook agrees. “Right now, the field of game AI is overwhelmingly male and white, and that means we’re missing out on the perspectives and ideas of a lot of people,” he says. “Diversity isn’t just about avoiding mistakes or harm – it’s about fresh ideas, different ways of thinking, and hearing new voices. Diversifying game AI means brilliant people get to bring their ideas to life, and that means you’ll see AI applied in ways you haven’t seen before. That might mean inventing new genres of game, or supercharging your favourite game series with fresh new ideas.“But also, diversity is about recognising that everyone should be given a chance to contribute. If Will Wright were a Black woman, would The Sims have gotten made? If we don’t open up disciplines like Game AI to everyone, then we are missing out on every Black genius, every female genius, every queer genius, we’re missing out on the amazing ideas they have, the huge changes they might make.”Explore more on these topicsGamesArtificial intelligence (AI)XboxComputingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policy‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither has panned out. Now, IBM has settled on a humbler vision for Watson.Credit...Video by Maria ChimishkyanSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTShare full article293Read in appBy Steve LohrPublished July 16, 2021Updated July 17, 2021A decade ago, IBM’s public confidence was unmistakable. Its Watson supercomputer had just trounced Ken Jennings, the best human “Jeopardy!” player ever, showcasing the power of artificial intelligence. This was only the beginning of a technological revolution about to sweep through society, the company pledged.“Already,” IBM declared in an advertisement the day after the Watson victory, “we are exploring ways to apply Watson skills to the rich, varied language of health care, finance, law and academia.”But inside the company, the star scientist behind Watson had a warning: Beware what you promise.David Ferrucci, the scientist, explained that Watson was engineered to identify word patterns and predict correct answers for the trivia game. It was not an all-purpose answer box ready to take on the commercial world, he said. It might well fail a second-grade reading comprehension test.His explanation got a polite hearing from business colleagues, but little more.“It wasn’t the marketing message,” recalled Mr. Ferrucci, who left IBM the following year.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt was, however, a prescient message.IBM poured many millions of dollars in the next few years into promoting Watson as a benevolent digital assistant that would help hospitals and farms as well as offices and factories. The potential uses, IBM suggested, were boundless, from spotting new market opportunities to tackling cancer and climate change. An IBM report called it “the future of knowing.”IBM’s television ads included playful chats Watson had with Serena Williams and Bob Dylan. Watson was featured on “60 Minutes.” For many people, Watson became synonymous with A.I.And Watson wasn’t just going to change industries. It was going to breathe new life into IBM — a giant company, but one dependent on its legacy products. Inside IBM, Watson was thought of as a technology that could do for the company what the mainframe computer once did — provide an engine of growth and profits for years, even decades.Watson has not remade any industries. And it hasn’t lifted IBM’s fortunes. The company trails rivals that emerged as the leaders in cloud computing and A.I. — Amazon, Microsoft and Google. While the shares of those three have multiplied in value many times, IBM’s stock price is down more than 10 percent since Watson’s “Jeopardy!” triumph in 2011.The company’s missteps with Watson began with its early emphasis on big and difficult initiatives intended to generate both acclaim and sizable revenue for the company, according to many of the more than a dozen current and former IBM managers and scientists interviewed for this article. Several of those people asked not to be named because they had not been authorized to speak or still had business ties to IBM.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTManoj Saxena, a former general manager of the Watson business, said that the original objective — to do pioneering work that was good for society — was laudable. It just wasn’t realistic.“The challenges turned out to be far more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated,” said Mr. Saxena, who is now executive chairman of Cognitive Scale, an A.I. start-up whose investors include IBM.Martin Kohn, a former chief medical scientist at IBM Research, recalled recommending using Watson for narrow “credibility demonstrations,” like more accurately predicting whether an individual will have an adverse reaction to a specific drug, rather than to recommend cancer treatments.“I was told I didn’t understand,” Dr. Kohn said.The company’s top management, current and former IBM insiders noted, was dominated until recently by executives with backgrounds in services and sales rather than technology product experts. Product people, they say, might have better understood that Watson had been custom-built for a quiz show, a powerful but limited technology.ImageWatson, ready for its “Jeopardy!” appearance, in 2011.Credit...Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles TimesIBM describes Watson as a learning journey for the company. There have been wrong turns and setbacks, IBM says, but that comes with trying to commercialize pioneering technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Innovation is always a process,” said Rob Thomas, the executive in charge of the Watson business in the past few years. Mr. Thomas, who earlier this month was named senior vice president for global sales, sees the A.I. development at IBM in three stages: the technical achievement with “Jeopardy!,"" the years of “experimentation” with big services contracts and, now, a shift to a product business.IBM insists that its revised A.I. strategy — a pared-down, less world-changing ambition — is working. The job of reviving growth was handed to Arvind Krishna, a computer scientist who became chief executive last year, after leading the recent overhaul of IBM’s cloud and A.I. businesses.But the grand visions of the past are gone. Today, instead of being a shorthand for technological prowess, Watson stands out as a sobering example of the pitfalls of technological hype and hubris around A.I.The march of artificial intelligence through the mainstream economy, it turns out, will be more step-by-step evolution than cataclysmic revolution.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA New Wave to RideTime and again during its 110-year history, IBM has ushered in new technology and sold it to corporations. The company so dominated the market for mainframe computers that it was the target of a federal antitrust case. PC sales really took off after IBM entered the market in 1981, endorsing the small machines as essential tools in corporate offices. In the 1990s, IBM helped its traditional corporate customers adapt to the internet.IBM executives came to see A.I. as the next wave to ride.Mr. Ferrucci first pitched the idea of Watson to his bosses at IBM’s research labs in 2006. He thought building a computer to tackle a question-answer game could push science ahead in the A.I. field known as natural language processing, in which scientists program computers to recognize and analyze words. Another research goal was to advance techniques for automated question answering.After overcoming initial skepticism, Mr. Ferrucci assembled a team of scientists — eventually more than two dozen — who worked out of the company’s lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., about 20 miles north of IBM’s headquarters in Armonk.The Watson they built was a room-size supercomputer with thousands of processors running millions of lines of code. Its storage disks were filled with digitized reference works, Wikipedia entries and electronic books. Computing intelligence is a brute force affair, and the hulking machine required 85,000 watts of power. The human brain, by contrast, runs on the equivalent of 20 watts.All along, the company’s goal was to push the frontiers of science and burnish IBM’s reputation. IBM made a similar — and successful — bet with its chess-playing Deep Blue computer, which beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. In a nod to the earlier project, the scientists originally called their A.I. computer DeepJ! But the marketers stepped in and decided to name the machine for IBM’s founder, Thomas Watson Sr.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhen Watson triumphed at “Jeopardy!,” the response was overwhelming. IBM’s customers clamored for one of their own. Executives saw a big business opportunity.Clearly, there was a market for Watson. But there was a problem.IBM had little to sell.A Health Care ‘Moon Shot’Executives got to work figuring out how to turn a business out of its new star. One possibility kept coming up: health care.Health care is the nation’s largest industry and spending is rising worldwide. It is a field rich in data, the essential fuel for modern A.I. programs. And the social benefit is undeniable — the promise of longer, healthier lives.Ginni Rometty, IBM’s chief executive at the time, described the big bet on health care as the next chapter in the company’s heritage of tackling grand challenges, from counting the census to helping guide the Apollo 11 mission to the moon.“Our moon shot will be the impact we have on health care,” Ms. Rometty said. “I’m absolutely positive about it.”ImageGinni Rometty and IBM steered Watson to a focus on health care.Credit...Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIBM started with cancer. It sought out medical centers where researchers worked with huge troves of data. The idea was that Watson would mine and make sense of all that medical information to improve treatment.At the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, one of IBM’s partners, the difficulties soon became apparent. The oncologists, having seen Watson’s “Jeopardy!” performance, assumed it was an answer machine. The IBM technologists were frustrated by the complexity, messiness and gaps in the genetic data at the cancer center.“We thought it would be easy, but it turned out to be really, really hard,” said Dr. Norman Sharpless, former head of the school’s cancer center, who is now the director of the National Cancer Institute. “We talked past each other for about a year.”Eventually, the oncologists and technologists found an approach that suited Watson’s strength — quickly ingesting and reading many thousands of medical research papers. By linking mentions of gene mutations in the papers with a patient’s genetic profile, Watson could sometimes point to other treatments the physicians might have missed. It was a potentially useful new diagnostic tool.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut it turned out to be not useful or flexible enough to be a winning product. At the end of last year, IBM discontinued Watson for Genomics, which grew out of the joint research with the University of North Carolina. It also shelved another cancer offering, Watson for Oncology, developed with another early collaborator, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.Another cancer project, called Oncology Expert Advisor, was abandoned in 2016 as a costly failure. It was a collaboration with the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The aim was to create a bedside diagnostic tool that would read patients’ electronic health records, volumes of cancer-related scientific literature and then make treatment recommendations.The problems were numerous. During the collaboration, MD Anderson switched to a new electronic health record system and Watson could not tap patient data. Watson struggled to decipher doctors’ notes and patient histories, too.Physicians grew frustrated, wrestling with the technology rather than caring for patients. After four years and spending $62 million, according to a public audit, MD Anderson shut down the project.“They chose the highest bar possible, real-time cancer diagnosis, with an immature technology,” said Shane Greenstein, a professor and co-author of a recent Harvard Business School case study on the Watson project at MD Anderson. “It was such a high-risk path.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIBM continued to invest in the health industry, including billions on Watson Health, which was created as a separate business in 2015. That includes more than $4 billion to acquire companies with medical data, billing records and diagnostic images on hundreds of millions of patients. Much of that money, it seems clear, they are never going to get back.Now IBM is paring back Watson Health and reviewing the future of the business. One option being explored, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, is to sell off Watson Health.Back to RealityMany outside researchers long dismissed Watson as mainly a branding campaign. But recently, some of them say, the technology has made major strides.In an analysis done for The New York Times, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence compared Watson’s performance on standard natural language tasks like identifying persons, places and the sentiment of a sentence with the A.I. services offered by the big tech cloud providers — Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Watson did as well as, and sometimes better than, the big three. “I was quite surprised,” said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute. “IBM has gotten its act together, certainly in these capabilities.”The business side of Watson also shows signs of life. Now, Watson is a collection of software tools that companies use to build A.I.-based applications — ones that mainly streamline and automate basic tasks in areas like accounting, payments, technology operations, marketing and customer service. It is workhorse artificial intelligence, and that is true of most A.I. in business today.ImageSerena Williams talking with Watson in an ad for IBM.Credit...IBMA core Watson capability is natural language processing — the same ability that helped power the “Jeopardy!” win. That technology powers IBM’s popular Watson Assistant, used by businesses to automate customer service inquiries.The company does not report financial results for Watson. But Mr. Thomas, who now leads worldwide sales for IBM, points to signs of success.It is early for A.I. in the corporate market, he said, the market opportunity will be huge and the key at this stage is to hasten adoption of the Watson software offerings.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIBM says it has 40,000 Watson customers across 20 industries worldwide, more than double the number four years ago. Watson products and services are being used 140 million times a month, compared with a monthly rate of about 10 million two years ago, IBM says. Some of the big customers are in health, like Anthem, a large insurer, which uses Watson Assistant to automate customer inquiries.“Adoption is accelerating,” Mr. Thomas said.Five years ago, Watson, a nerdy, disembodied voice from the A.I. future, chatted and joked in advertisements with the tennis superstar Serena Williams. Today, the TV ads proclaim the technology’s potential to save time and work in offices and on factory floors.Watson, one TV ad says, helps companies “automate the little things so they can focus on the next big thing.”The contrast in ambition seems striking. That’s fine with IBM. Watson is no longer the next big thing, but it may finally become a solid business for IBM.Steve Lohr has covered technology, business and economics for The Times for more than 20 years.

Artificial Intelligence’s Impact on  Attorneys

 21 July 202123 February 2022 Business  Business Matters 





Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already had a profound impact on our society, and in many ways, this technology is still in its infancy. You might think that attorneys are exempt from the effects of Artificial Intelligence, but this is not the case.

AI tools have already been impacting the way attorneys do their jobs. While many people fear that the automation of low-level tasks will lead to job loss, automation of these tasks will lead to new job creation. For example, by automating laborious, repetitive tasks lawyers and their staff can spend more time working on complex problems, interacting with clients, and law firm marketing.
Let’s look at some of the critical ways attorneys can put Artificial Intelligence tools to use today.

Key Ways AI Can Be Used by Attorneys
App development
 projects are constantly finding new, effective ways to put AI to use. We’re not close to the point where true AI can speak, think, and make decisions for itself in the same manner that humans do, but AI has many practical applications, especially in the legal field. AI can be used to help:


Perform research
Review documents
Manage contracts
Predict the outcome of litigation

Perform Research

Legal research is an essential part of the law. Lawyers need to be able to review previous cases and the precedents set by the courts in order to present a compelling case. However, searching for applicable case law is a very tedious process. Even with the aid of online legal research tools, you could still have thousands of cases to review in order to find the precedent you are looking for.
Artificial Intelligence can be used to narrow the scope from thousands of cases to potentially a handful. Plus, once the initial results have been returned, a lawyer can have AI tools continue to search through case law.

Review Documents

Lawyers have to handle an immense amount of paperwork. Whether you are working in business litigation or criminal cases, you cannot avoid the mountain of paperwork that comes with legal proceedings.
Attorneys are obligated to review any documents that are sent to them regarding their case. This task chews up a lot of time and often requires a lot of late nights. Firms can put AI to use here by teaching these tools how they review documents. Once criteria have been set for the Artificial Intelligence tool, it can review all the documents and highlight which ones it thinks are the most important based on the criteria entered.

Manage Contracts

Managing a large volume of contracts can be a real challenge. Artificial Intelligence tools can help attorneys organize their contracts, track their outcomes, and in some cases, even aid in negotiations. The more data the AI tool can gather, the more effective it will be in future contract negotiations. These tools can also help lawyers gain valuable insights into their contract strategies.
Besides managing contracts, AI tools can also be used to predict how long it will take a contract to be accepted. While this may not seem like a big deal on the surface, if you have an accurate idea of when a contract will be accepted, this information can have a monumental impact on the strategy a business chooses to take.

Predict the Outcome of Litigation

Predicting outcomes of litigation is a skill that attorneys develop over years of practice and studying law. It is important to know if you have a winnable case. Having an idea about the potential outcome of your case has a major impact on settlement negotiations and whether plea deals are accepted.
Nobody wants to take a case to court and lose. AI can be used to analyze previous cases with similar facts and circumstances. These tools can then provide attorneys with a statistical analysis of the likely outcomes of the litigation. Having this information allows an attorney to give their clients better advice about their case.

AI Equals More Time

Artificial Intelligence provides people with more time to focus on other tasks. In the case of lawyers, there are a number of tasks that they could be focusing their energies on if they had AI tools to aid them in some of the laborious tasks mentioned above.
Some of the tasks that lawyers can spend more time doing thanks to the power of AI are:


Taking on more clients
Spending more time with clients
Doing complex analysis
Strategic planning
Writing briefs

Final Thoughts

While Artificial Intelligence is becoming more commonplace, many people still think that it can’t be effectively used in the legal field. They are wrong. Not only are AI tools already helping lawyers around the world, but AI tools are getting more adept at handling complex analyses.
Law firms should take a good look at the different AI tools available to them. This technology can make law firms more efficient and even more profitable. Artificial Intelligence will never replace a skilled attorney, but it can make their job and the job of their staff much easier.

Machine learning algorithms, the technology that powers AI, have advanced quickly in recent decades. Today, deep learning algorithms power facial recognition software and enable anyone to create realistic deepfake photos and videos in just a few minutes.
AI algorithms are also increasingly used by companies and institutions, from creating smart voice assistants to generating automatic language translations. But along with the growing adoption of AI is the problem that AI models are not well understood — much of the time, people don’t know why AI models make certain determinations.
And it’s not just the average person off the street who doesn’t understand — even the researchers and programmers creating them don’t really understand why the models they have built make the decisions they make.
“If you cannot adequately describe what your algorithm is doing, that seems problematic,” said Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.
Not being well understood by its own creator is a strange phenomenon of AI, but it’s also the reason for its power and success — using AI methods, people can create something that’s self-training and able to perform certain calculations beyond people’s capabilities.

“If you cannot adequately describe what your algorithm is doing, that seems problematic.”

This phenomenon has created a growing gap between what we’re able to do with AI techniques and our ability as humans to understand the technology we use, and it’s part of the reason some have called for a “right to explanation” when it comes to the use of AI.
Routledge and co-author Tae Wan Kim recently published an analysis on the right to explanation, concluding that the public has an ethical right to know how companies’ AI models make decisions. They reasoned that consumers should be able to demand explanations for specific AI decisions that appear biased, and also to learn about how those models make decisions so they can make informed choices about which companies to give their business to.
Routledge said AI models should be held to a similar standard as medicine, another complex field that makes important decisions about people, but whose decisions are backed up by explanations.
“Being able to explain things in a way that patients are informed is part of what it means to be a doctor,” he said. “Medicine has been dealing with this for a long time, so it’s fairly second nature. When there’s a new treatment, part of what they think about is, ‘How will we properly communicate this to patients so that they can be informed when they choose yes or no?’”

Explanations Are Important When Humans Can’t Verify AI’s Work
Not every use case for AI is equally in need of explanations, said Rayid Ghani, a machine learning professor at Carnegie Mellon University. For example, it’s usually easy to tell if an image recognition program has been mislabeling things — like if an image labeled “dog” actually depicts a cat. And some use cases are not consequential enough to require explanations.
“If you’re showing somebody an ad, I don’t really care if you have a great explanation or not,” he said. “The cost to me of seeing a good or a bad ad, there’s very little difference — I don’t care, I don’t want to see any ads.”
Ghani said AI technology is used to accomplish two categories of tasks: either tasks humans are good at doing but do slowly, or tasks humans are incapable of doing. For instance, humans are great at recognizing and labeling images. AI models can be trained to do that as well — not necessarily better than humans, but much, much faster.
On the other hand, AI models can also be used to help make predictions — something people do not do well.
“Who’s going to be involved in a shooting, or who’s going to not graduate from high school on time, or who’s going to be unemployed long term — humans are not very good at that problem,” Ghani said.
Understanding how AI models make their decisions is particularly important for those types of predictive use cases because humans aren’t able to verify whether the model is working correctly. Unlike image categorization, where humans can simply look at the images to check whether they have been labeled correctly, predictive AI gives outputs that humans can’t verify for themselves.

“It sort of helps you figure out how to separate the correct predictions from the incorrect predictions.”

“So when an explanation comes from the system, we don’t really know whether it’s correct or not because we don’t have that understanding. If we did, we wouldn’t need a computer to help us solve that problem,” Ghani said. “Because we’re not trying to be efficient — we’re trying to be better than humans.”
Ghani welcomed the idea of a right to explanation, anticipating many benefits once it’s possible to explain the decisions AI models make. Explanations could help people figure out how to change their behavior to get better results and detect if models are drawing conclusions based on faulty reasoning.
Ghani gave the example of a hypothetical medical AI model that predicts patient outcomes. If explanations of the model revealed that a significant factor behind its decision making was based on the day of the week patients are admitted, people would know to be suspicious of the accuracy of the model — or the hospital would know to investigate this unacceptable pattern in patient prognosis.
“It sort of helps you figure out how to separate the correct predictions from the incorrect predictions,” Ghani said. “It helps you sanity check.”
Perhaps most importantly, explanations might be able to satisfy that part of us that is rightfully suspicious when asked to trust things we don’t understand, and to answer our many questions: Why did the AI model make that particular prediction? Is the AI model actually answering the question we’re asking in the way that we expect? Is it reliable?

What Do We Mean by ‘Explanation’?
How did we even get here, where even the experts creating AI models don’t understand how those models are making decisions?
The way machine learning works is it uses a lot of data to refine models. The data scientist takes an AI algorithm, points it at a desired result and basically lets the algorithm run itself using some initial random values and a mountain of testing data. Eventually, the algorithm will refine the model into something that can achieve the desired result. AI algorithms take advantage of computers’ abilities to do math and calculate at great speeds.
But the outcome from this brand of problem-solving is that the interactions in the model built by absorbing so much data are too much for a person to wrap their minds around. That’s what makes many AI models black boxes — difficult or impossible to understand.
Because the way AI models work is so specific and math-based, as you dig into the topic of explainable AI, you eventually run into the fundamental question of what basic ideas like “explanation” and “understanding” really mean.

“Who decides if something is explainable? If I gave you an explanation, is that a good explanation or a bad one?”

It may seem like a silly debate over semantics, but how these concepts are defined could have real-world impacts on business and regulatory decisions if a right to explanation comes to pass. That’s because good regulation first requires precise and accurate definitions.
“‘Explainable’ and ‘accurate’ — in some ways, both of those are ambiguous concepts,” Ghani said. “Who decides if something is explainable? If I gave you an explanation, is that a good explanation or a bad one? What does it mean to be good? What does it mean to be bad?”
There’s one way of defining “explanation” that is quite simple, but doesn’t satisfy our human search for understanding: just follow the data as it flows through the model’s mathematical functions, tracing through all the paths until it finally becomes the model’s output.
That definition is rooted in the idea that algorithms are like machines — the only pure way to “understand” one is to follow the machine’s mechanism. “Why” is a human question that doesn’t apply to machines. You would never ask a car “why” — the real question is “how.” That same logic should be applied to algorithms, argues Zachary Lipton, who runs the Approximately Correct Machine Intelligence Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.

“One question you might ask is, ‘Account to me how the models arrived at the answer?’” Lipton said. “And the answer is: There is no specific answer besides the weights of the model.”
Still, that might provide some understanding for very simple models. But AI models created by algorithms like deep learning can easily take in data with thousands of attributes. You can trace inputs through those models, but it would not provide a deep-level understanding of how the model arrives at its conclusions — mostly because of human limitations.
“A deep neural network that was trained on images takes every single possible input in a 400,000-dimensional space,” Lipton said. “The full mapping is not something that you can put in your head.”
Who the audience is that’s getting an explanation can also affect how explanations should be defined because people have different levels of understanding when it comes to AI concepts. Explaining a model to an AI researcher may be very different from explaining it to a layperson, policymaker or business person.

“A deep neural network that was trained on images takes every single possible input in a 400,000-dimensional space. The full mapping is not something that you can put in your head.”

When you dig into it, it’s hard to pin down exactly what it means to make AI explainable. People are used to getting explanations from other people, such as when someone gives the reasoning behind a decision they made or an action they took. But how do we know the reasons they give are an accurate account of their true motivations? How do we know theirs is a full explanation?
When people take actions and make decisions, they’re not drawing just from pure logic, but also from personal experience, knowledge, emotion and their personalities. Most of the time, someone’s explanation is probably more of an approximation, the very top layer of a jumble of subconscious factors. Maybe they don’t even know the true motivation behind their behavior themselves.
AI models built using deep learning algorithms and large amounts of data also take on some narrow form of this complexity, mostly in terms of experience and knowledge.
So which layer of explanation do we want? Maybe what people want is for the way AI models actually reach decisions to be approximated and simplified enough so that we can wrap our minds around the whole process all at once. But is it possible to have that and still call it an explanation?
 
The (Questionable) Promise of Explainable AI
There is already a field of study known as explainable AI. Its researchers use mathematical techniques to examine patterns in AI models and draw conclusions about how those models reach their decisions. Many explainable AI techniques are “general” techniques, meant to be applicable for explaining any kind of machine learning model.
But Lipton considers the current field of explainable AI to be littered with false promises. He said the benefits of applying explainable AI techniques to any type of AI model, which makes these techniques compelling, also makes them incapable of explaining anything meaningful.
Some explainable AI techniques for labeling images, for example, black out sections of an image at a time. They then run the altered images through the original AI model to see what differences the new output has from the original.
But Lipton hypothesized that blacking out parts of images may render them so unlike natural images that it affects models’ outcomes beyond what researchers might expect. Although explainable AI methods use math to get their results, he said, those mathematical techniques have not yet been proven to offer insights into AI models.

“Many of these methods are providing something that really doesn’t tell you anything at all.”

“If there’s two equations in what you’re calling an explanation, and you’re presenting it to someone who’s mathematically illiterate, they don’t have the ability to look at that and call bullshit,” Lipton said. “Many of these methods are providing something that really doesn’t tell you anything at all.”
He said AI researchers can change explainable AI conclusions drastically by making small tweaks to AI models while retaining the same model outcomes.
“Clearly, it wasn’t an explanation in the first place, if you’re able to induce whatever explanations you want without changing what you’re actually doing,” he said.
The ambiguity of the term “explanation” is part of what concerns Lipton. Because the definition of explanation for AI models is so loosely defined, people may come to accept math-heavy “explanations” that confuse and dazzle, but don’t actually provide real answers.
“A huge fraction of the field is overrun by precisely that sort of thing,” Lipton said. “Basically what people do is they propose some algorithm and it’s just some sort of trick.”
It can also be difficult to understand the explanations offered. If an explanation of an image classifier simply highlights areas on an image, is that really an explanation? What is it really saying about how the model makes decisions?

“The problem is they’re being fooled by a cottage industry that thinks you can somehow take predictive machine learning models, kind of wave a magic wand on them, generate some images, and call that an explanation.”

It’s even possible to get into a scenario where you need another algorithm to interpret the explanation, Ghani said.
“It’s sort of this weird thing where now you have to build another system, on top of the explanation system, to sort of explain the explainer,” he said.
Though Lipton is opposed to the methods used by the current field of explainable AI, he is sympathetic to the right to explanation’s core goal of being able to understand what AI models are doing.
“People think that certain decisions should be guided by sound reasoning and you should be able to provide explanations when you make certain categories of decisions — and those people are absolutely right,” Lipton said. “The problem is they’re being fooled by a cottage industry that thinks you can somehow take predictive machine learning models, kind of wave a magic wand on them, generate some images, and call that an explanation.”
He worries that people accepting anything as an “explanation” would instead be enabling unethical uses of AI.
“The worst-case scenario is that you have the academic community be complicit in giving people the impression that they actually now have an academic seal of approval,” Lipton said.

Ask Specific Questions Instead
Instead of trying to explain an entire AI model all at once, it may be more effective to analyze models using tools specific to the questions you want to ask and to the AI model.
That’s because AI algorithms and AI models vary widely. For instance, there’s not only one way of doing deep learning — it’s actually a whole category of methods, and each use case of a method can be wildly different depending on the training data and what researchers are optimizing for.
“It’s not like you download [a] deep learning [model] and you click a button and run it,” Ghani said. “When you build these types of systems, you build hundreds of versions of them. ... You then define a performance metric that you care about, and you choose the one that’s doing well on that performance metric.”
Machine learning models output results in the form of probabilities rather than clear-cut yes and no answers. An image recognition program would predict that one image has a 40 percent chance of being a cat and another has an 89 percent likelihood, instead of saying this one isn’t a cat and this one is. It’s up to data scientists to determine what the cutoff for labeling should be.

“We need to be very deliberate in designing systems that are focused on a specific use case and a specific user in designing an explanation.”

If it’s more important that the model not miss any images with cats — even if a few non-cat images are mistaken for cats — the labeling threshold for cats should be set at a low percentage. On the other hand, if it’s expensive to review the image labels, the maker might want to set a high threshold. Each of these variations corresponds to a different AI model.
“In the explainable AI world, we’re trying to build this general-purpose, monolithic explainable AI system that’s supposed to just do everything for every type of problem, for every type of model, for every type of user — and I think that’s just wrong,” Ghani said. “We need to be very deliberate in designing systems that are focused on a specific use case and a specific user in designing an explanation, and then experimentally validating whether that explanation helps that user achieve the goal of the system.”
Some statistical methods already exist that are effective at answering very specific questions, such as ablation tests and counterfactuals, Lipton said. If a bank used AI models to determine whether to approve mortgages for clients and turned someone down, counterfactuals could give people concrete feedback on what they can improve to change the result next time.
“If they said, ‘You have four lines of credit and a late payment in the last year. But if you had six lines of credit and no late payment for at least 18 months, then you would have been approved,’” Lipton said. “So this is affording some degree of transparency and providing someone with something actionable.”
 
More Investigation Is Needed
The only thing certain about explainability in AI is that there’s still plenty of room left for investigation.
My first introduction to explainability in AI was talking to a professor about the use of AI in the insurance industry. He cautioned that AI would make insurance companies difficult to audit because questions of bias can’t be evaluated if the insurance companies themselves don’t even know how insurance decisions are made. 
Curiously, both Lipton and Ghani pushed back against the idea of using explanations in AI to help determine bias in AI models. They argued that the two concepts are not related because explaining why an AI model produced a given output doesn’t provide any insight into whether the overall model is biased.
That’s partly why some who oppose a right to explanation argue that monitoring AI models’ results over time for hints of bias, and adjusting when needed, is better than requiring explanations from AI models.
Routledge, co-author of the right to explanation analysis, said monitoring AI model results for bias over time is a good practice, but not a substitute.
“If you applied for a loan and were denied, while someone who looks similar to you got a loan, and you ask why that is, and the company’s answer is, ‘Don't worry, we adjust things as we go forward’ — that’s not very satisfying,” he said. “It doesn’t seem like it would be an adequate explanation.”
There are plenty of people who oppose explaining AI models at all. One common argument is that it limits AI’s potential by tying it down to unnecessary human constraints. Another is that a right to explanation would be impossible to enforce, especially considering how imprecise the human concept of “understanding” is.

“When you actually have real concerns about discrimination ... maybe what should actually be happening is people should be taking the technology off the table altogether.”

Lipton himself favors banning the use of AI outright for certain cases instead of using unreliable techniques to explain AI models and spending time debating the definition of “explain.”
“When you actually have real concerns about discrimination ... maybe what should actually be happening is people should be taking the technology off the table altogether,” Lipton said. “Like, ‘Algorithmic resume screening is not a mature or appropriate technology and should not be applied.’”
Whether establishing a right to explanation is viable depends in large part on whether it’s possible to develop techniques that can explain AI models in the first place, but there hasn’t been nearly enough rigorous study in this field to figure out whether that’s the case.
Ghani said a big hurdle for the field currently is using more realistic scenarios in research, which is important because AI models are built to perform specific tasks.
“One of the things that we’re working on is building these collaborations with organizations — whether it’s governments or nonprofits or companies — where things can be anchored in real problems, using real data, tested on real users, so that you can see what actually works or not,” he said.
There are some reasons for cautious optimism. When people talk about black box AI models, such as those built by deep learning algorithms, there seems to be an implication that the more powerful and successful the algorithm, the more of a black box it is. But that’s not necessarily the case.
“That concept is often used that there’s this trade-off, but we actually don’t know if there is a trade-off — it’s not a universal concept that needs to be true,” Ghani said. “I think people say that a lot, but I think people don’t say it based on empirical evidence.”
Maybe researchers can find ways to use existing techniques to explain AI models, or maybe new AI techniques can be developed that prioritizes explainability. Routledge, for one, was hopeful.
“I guess everything I’m saying is that it’s not easy, but it does not seem impossible,” he said.

Artificial intelligence was once a magical concept, the stuff of science fiction. Now, after decades of research and commercialization, it’s just another foundational tool to keep the enterprise stack running.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the world of devops, a data-rich, back-office practice that presents a perfect sandbox for exploring the power of artificial intelligence. The teams in charge of operations now have a burgeoning collection of labor-saving and efficiency-boosting tools and platforms on offer under the acronym AIops, all of which promise to apply the best artificial intelligence algorithms to the work of maintaining IT infrastructure.

AIops is among the better use cases for artificial intelligence. Servers and networks generate petabytes upon petabytes of data. We know when processes start and stop, surge and ebb, often down to the millisecond. RAM and CPU demands are often well-understood and so are the prices for renting hardware in the cloud. All are often calculated down to six or seven significant digits. Creating an autonomous car may mean struggling with a world filled with pedestrians, livestock, and shadows, but when it comes to IT infrastructure, everything is already digitized and ready for analysis.

Some of the simplest tasks for AIops involve speeding up the way software is deployed to cloud instances. All the work that devops teams do can be enhanced with smarter automation capable of watching loads, predicting demand, and even starting up new instances when the hordes descend.
Good AIops tools generate forward-looking guesses about machine load and then watch to see if anything deviates from these estimates. Anomalies might be turned into alerts that generate emails, Slack posts, or, if the deviation is large enough, pager messages. A good part of the AIops stack is devoted to managing alerts and ensuring that only the most significant problems turn into something that interrupts a meeting or a good night’s sleep.
 
 
 













 
 

These methods for watching for unusual levels or activity are sometimes deployed to bolster security, a more challenging task, making some AIops tools the purview of both security watchdogs and the devops team.
Sophisticated AIops tools also offer “root cause analysis,” which creates flowcharts to track how problems can ripple through the various machines in a modern enterprise application. A database that’s overloaded will slow down an API gateway that, in turn, freezes a web service. These automated catalogs of the workflow can often help teams spot the real problem faster by documenting and tracking the chains of troublemaking. 
Many of the tools in this survey are built on monitoring systems with a long history. They began as tools that tracked events in complex enterprise stacks and have now been extended with artificial intelligence. A few of the tools began in AI labs and grew outwards. In either case, anyone evaluating these platforms will want to look at the range of connectors that gather data. Some AIops platforms will better integrate with your stack than others. All offer a basic set of pathways to collect raw data, but some connectors are better than others. Anyone considering adopting an AIops platform will want to evaluate how well each AIops offering integrates with your particular databases and services.

Ask




AppDynamics
AppDynamics is a division of Cisco that specializes in performance monitoring. It has added machine learning to its flagship platform to watch for metrics that diverge from the historical baseline. The system can build a flowchart and learn how events can cascade until system failure, thereby helping identify root causes. AppDynamics pushes correlating these metrics with hard “business outcomes” such as sales numbers and a “self-healing mentality” for its platform by providing links that can automate the resolution of common failures.
BigPanda
BigPanda focuses on both detecting strange behavior and orchestrating the teams assigned to solve it. Its eponymous platform offers root cause analysis and event detection that integrates with the major cloud providers. Its “Level-0 Automation” handles the workload that comes after a problem appears. BigPanda simplifies the workflow by creating tickets, sending out alerts, and even starting up virtual “war rooms” for serious issues.
 
 
 













 
 

Datadog
Datadog recently added the Watchdog module to its performance management tool so devops teams can ask for automated warnings when performance begins to fail. The tool builds performance forecasts based on historical records adjusted for season and time of day. Changes in metrics such as latency, RAM consumption, or network bandwidth can trigger alerts if they depart from norms. The tool is integrated with Datadog’s security detection system, and it can work with virtual machines, cloud instances, and also serverless functions.
Dynatrace
Dynatrace is a broad, full-featured monitoring tool for tracking cloud-based VMs, containers, and other serverless solutions. It sucks up log files, event reports, and other triggers to deliver what it calls “precise, AI-powered answers.” The core is called Davis, a deterministic AI that constructs flowcharts and trees so that it can pinpoint the root cause of any anomaly or failure. If it’s properly configured, it can run autonomously by triggering changes that should fix the cause. It could be as simple as rebooting an instance, but it might happen without waiting for a human to get in the loop.
Github Copilot
Most AIops tools are designed to help software that’s already up and running. Github Copilot starts earlier in the process, helping when code is first being written. The tool watches what a programmer types and makes suggestions for how to complete it. It was trained on a gazillion lines of open source code so these ideas are grounded in some form of reality. There are still questions that are somewhat philosophical about who is the ultimate author of the new code, whether the AI can be trusted, and whether the millions of open source coders out there deserve some kind of credit or hat tip for assistance. The answer may be “perhaps.” A bigger question is how much better does Copilot understand your code and does it really do much better than autocomplete. That answer is that it probably varies.
 
 
 













 
 

IBM Watson Cloud Pak for AIops
IBM created the “Watson Cloud Pak for AIops“ by integrating its general Watson brand AI with its larger cloud presence. The tool brings automated root cause analysis to the data collected from the cloud monitoring software. When the events reach a configurable level of severity, they can trigger either basic alerts or more automated responses from the toolchain. IBM has integrated the results with its other Cloud Paks for providing Network, Business, and some Robotic Process Automation.
LogicMonitor
LogicMonitor calls its AI “LM Intelligence.” It bundles a root cause detector with an alert system based on dynamic thresholds adjusted from historical data. Its early warning system depends on a forecasting module that’s extends this historical data to compute thresholds on latency, bandwidth, and other metrics. LogicMonitor prioritizes reducing “alert fatigue” to help teams focus their efforts on truly anomalous behavior. The data collectors tap into the major clouds and watch compute resources (Kubernetes, containers, etc.), network traffic, and storage systems (databases, buckets, etc.).
Moogsoft
Moogsoft is a specialized AI engine that integrates with major performance monitoring tools such as New Relic, Datadog, AWS Cloudwatch, and AppDynamics. If your stack is running something different, such as open source or in-house solutions, Moogsoft professes the desire to integrate with “anything, anywhere and anytime.” The product moves the data through a pipeline that de-duplicates events, enriches them with contextual data from other sources, and then correlates the data before raising an alarm. The clustering algorithms and historical records help reduce the noise and produce more useful reports of problems.
 
 
 













 
 

New Relic One
New Relic added an AI engine to its performance monitoring tool One and it tracks all events ingested, including those from other tools such as Splunk, Grafana, and AWS’s CloudWatch. The tool can be configured with flexible levels of sensitivity for a variety of events of potential severity. You can tell New Relic that, for instance, a low-priority error should raise an alarm only if it occurs several times over fifteen minutes. But a high-priority event like a crashed server will generate a pager alert immediately. The issue log tracks all events and includes a Correlation Decision report that lays out the logical steps taken by the AI en route to raising an alarm.
Splunk
Splunk began as a tool for gathering log files and building a comprehensive reporting tool for tracking performance, identifying anomalies, and helping the team diagnose problems. The product integrates informational graphics with a deep indexing tool to catalog the events. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms within Splunk can anticipate problems and understand their source. These algorithms track all of the services integrated with Splunk to find the root causes. The machine learning features are deeply integrated with the platform so that service engineers skilled at tracking performance can leverage the best machine learning without much additional training. They can track the historical performance and watch for divergence through the main dashboard.

Women remain a significant minority in the scientific fields driving the digital revolution, amid a general skills shortage that’s holding back progress.

The UNESCO Science Report 2021 found that women are still under-represented in fields such as computing, digital information technology, engineering, mathematics and physics.

By the numbers: Women in STEM


Women made up a third (33%) of researchers in 2018 and have achieved parity when it comes to numbers in life sciences in many countries, the report says.


But women make up just 28% of graduates in engineering and 40% of those in computer sciences – skills vital for the jobs of the future, it added.

Female workers also account for just 22% of people working in artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide, although there are regional differences, according to UNESCO.
Countries such as Singapore, Italy and South Africa were leading the way with each having women make up about 28% of professionals with AI skills, compared to just 14% in Brazil, 15% in Mexico, and 16% in both Germany and Poland.

Gender gap at top tech companies


Women are also under-represented at the top of multinational tech companies, despite efforts to close the gender gap in technical and leadership roles, the UNESCO report warns.


Facebook leads the way with women accounting for 23% of technical roles, and 33% of leadership positions.

Apple has been implementing measures to hire more women and under-represented minorities since 2014, but women still only make up 23% of technical roles and 29% of leadership ones.

Meanwhile, Amazon has been working to correct the gender imbalance since 2018, when it realised that its AI system was not ranking women candidates for software developer and other technical roles.

The online retail giant has since committed $50m to supporting science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programmes for under-represented communities, but still only 27% of its managers around the world are women.

Women less likely to access funding


Women in science and tech are also less likely than men to access funding.

Start-ups led by women received just 2.3% of venture capital in 2020, according to a report from Harvard Business Review, citing data from Crunchbase.
Women in academia were also found to receive less grant funding despite being twice as productive.


And though women account for four in 10 academics globally, they often face an impenetrable glass ceiling, says UNESCO.

In 2015, across 69 national science academies, women made up 10% or less of members in 30 countries.

They were also considerably better represented in the social sciences, humanities and the arts (16%), biological sciences (15%) and medical and health sciences (14%), than in mathematical (6%) and engineering (5%) sciences.

Women in science and engineering were also disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with female scientists reporting at least a 5% decline in research time compared to their male counterparts.


Women ‘must not be left behind’ with jobs for the future


In a digitally driven future, advances in technologies such as AI will blur the boundaries between male and female that form the basis of the gender gap, says UNESCO.

COVID-19 prompted changes in work-life balance and these need to be translated into policies that ensure women do not spend a disproportionate amount of time as unpaid carers, educators and home-makers, it adds.

Women must be given equal access to education and information that will enable them to compete equally with men for the jobs of the future, says UNESCO.

Global gender gap increased by a generation


UNESCO’s findings echo those of the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2021, which found that the time it will take to close the worldwide gender gap has increased by a generation from 99.5 to 135.6 years.

Gender parity has only been achieved in two of eight tracked “jobs of tomorrow” clusters – people & culture, and content production, UNESCO says.
Gender gaps are more likely in sectors that require disruptive technical skills such as cloud computing (where women make up 14% of workforce); engineering (20%) and data and AI (32%), it adds.Natalie Marchant Writer, Formative Content

Scientists Are Giving AI The Ability to Imagine Things It's Never Seen Before

Tech19 July 2021By David Nield

Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving very adept at certain tasks – like inventing human faces that don't actually exist, or winning games of poker – but these networks still struggle when it comes to something humans do naturally: imagine.



Once human beings know what a cat is, we can easily imagine a cat of a different color, or a cat in a different pose, or a cat in different surroundings. For AI networks, that's much harder, even though they can recognize a cat when they see it (with enough training).



To try and unlock AI's capacity for imagination, researchers have come up with a new method for enabling artificial intelligence systems to work out what an object should look like, even if they've never actually seen one exactly like it before.



""We were inspired by human visual generalization capabilities to try to simulate human imagination in machines,"" says computer scientist Yunhao Ge from the University of Southern California (USC).



""Humans can separate their learned knowledge by attributes – for instance, shape, pose, position, color – and then recombine them to imagine a new object. Our paper attempts to simulate this process using neural networks.""



The key is extrapolation – being able to use a big bank of training data (like pictures of a car) to then go beyond what's seen into what's unseen. This is difficult for AI because of the way it's typically trained to spot specific patterns rather than broader attributes.



What the team has come up with here is called controllable disentangled representation learning, and it uses an approach similar to those used to create deepfakes – disentangling different parts of a sample (so separating face movement and face identity, in the case of a deepfake video).



It means that if an AI sees a red car and a blue bike, it will then be able to 'imagine' a red bike for itself – even if it has never seen one before. The researchers have put this together in a framework they're calling Group Supervised Learning.Extrapolating new data from training data. (Itti et al., 2021)One of the main innovations in this technique is processing samples in groups rather than individually, and building up semantic links between them along the way. The AI is then able to recognize similarities and differences in the samples it sees, using this knowledge to produce something completely new.



""This new disentanglement approach, for the first time, truly unleashes a new sense of imagination in AI systems, bringing them closer to humans' understanding of the world,"" says USC computer scientist Laurent Itti.



These ideas aren't completely new, but here the researchers have taken the concepts further, making the approach more flexible and compatible with additional types of data. They've also made the framework open source, so other scientists can make use of it more easily.



In the future, the system developed here could guard against AI bias by removing more sensitive attributes from the equation – helping to make neural networks that aren't racist or sexist, for example.



The same approach could also be applied in the fields of medicine and self-driving cars, the researchers say, with AI able to 'imagine' new drugs, or visualize new road scenarios that it hasn't been specifically trained for in the past.



""Deep learning has already demonstrated unsurpassed performance and promise in many domains, but all too often this has happened through shallow mimicry, and without a deeper understanding of the separate attributes that make each object unique,"" says Itti.The research has been presented at the 2021 International Conference on Learning Representations and can be read here.

On the technological front, Artificial intelligence has served to be no less than a savior. Right from controlling the traffic on roads, detecting frauds to assisting the doctors and surgeons in numerous medical procedures, AI has paved the way for all of this. Needless to say, how AI can be put into use to reduce the workload and to address the various issues of the organization is of utmost importance. However, what cannot be overlooked is having a fair idea about the political, social and ethical implications of artificial intelligence..Now that AI has integrated into our lives like never before, it is high time that we ensure that the technology is employed ethically and that our politics remain democratic. Ensuring that our policies are well informed is equally important as well..With both, Artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to dominate the world of technology, we have seen massive transformations over the years. Well, not just that. The possibility of this trend to continue for the years to come is high, without a doubt.  Considering the fact that these powerful new technologies like AI and machine learning stand a chance of both, improving as well as disrupting human lives, these transformations will have a deep ethical impact. Artificial intelligence offers us, in amplified form, everything that humanity already is, both good and evil. It is therefore important that we pay utmost importance pertaining to how these transitions are made..Talking about AI ethics, it is worth noting that it has turned a little problematic now. A few key reasons identified in this aspect are –.Insane increase in the size of data setsHuge increase in computing powerDrastic improvement in Machine learning algorithms and advanced human talent to write them..When it comes to AI, one of the most commonly faced questions is whether the AI systems would work as they are promised or will they fail? Issues don't arise when the AI systems work as promised. But what if they fail? On failing, what would be the results of those failures? Is it possible to survive without them if these systems fail? Though paying significant attention to this is important, what is even more important is whether AI stands true to its main purpose – to help people lead longer, more flourishing, more fulfilling lives. The fact that there are innumerable instances where AI has left a remarkable positive impact in society makes us believe how good of a technology it is..On the flip side, there are cases where a perfectly well functioning technology, such as a nuclear weapon, can, when put to its intended use, cause immense evil. What can be concluded from here is that Artificial intelligence can be used maliciously, similar to how human intelligence can be used. So what could be the conclusion then? Well, the technology itself is neutral: only the way we decide to use it in society determines whether it has good or bad effects..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Residents in east China’s Shanghai are witnessing and benefiting from the application of a good number of AI and other digital technologies catering for economic and social development, people’s livelihood and other fields.
In 2018, Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital carried out in-depth cooperation with relevant science and technology enterprises in the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. They creatively designed an AI system to assist doctors with diagnosis and formulation of treatment regimens and nursing staff in their work, helping medical workers better safeguard patients’ health and safety.
A few days ago, a 55-year-old female patient hospitalized for meniscus injury at the Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital got two different results in the assessment of her condition. She got two points in the assessment by a doctor, but three points in the assessment by the AI system.
It was found out that while assessing the patient’s health condition, the AI system automatically identified the fact that the patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As proven by further inquiries, the patient was admitted to the respiratory medicine department of the hospital a year ago.
By complementing “blind spots” in the acquisition of information through manual work, the AI system helps make diagnosis and treatment more effective and accurate.
At the beginning of 2021, Shanghai issued a guideline on comprehensively promoting digital transformation in economy, people’s life and social governance, aiming to become an internationally influential metropolis for digitization by 2035.
The city has successfully held the World Artificial Intelligence Conference for three consecutive years, and recently won the approval for the implementation of its Field Experiment Plan for AI Application. It is seeing steady progress in the construction of the country’s new-generation national AI innovative development pilot zone and national pilot zone for the innovation and application of AI.
These achievements have laid a sound foundation for developing Shanghai into a leader in AI industry and building world-class AI industrial clusters in the city during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) of China.
As of 2020, the city had 1,149 key enterprises in the AI industry and formed a relatively complete AI industrial chain. The city saw the combined annual industrial output value of its AI enterprises above designated size reach 224.6 billion yuan (about $34.68 billion) last year, up around 50 percent year on year.
Attaching great importance to the employment of AI for improving people’s livelihood, Shanghai installed intelligent water meter for elderly people who live alone. If the reading on the water meter of a house is below 0.01 cubic meter in 12 hours, the unified management platform of the subdistrict will automatically raise the alarm. Then people from the management office or the residents’ committee of the subdistrict will immediately go to the home of the elderly resident to check his/her condition.
The city also established a platform to address social problems using AI and big data technologies. For instance, if a citizen discovers disorderly parking of shared bicycles, he/she can take photos of it and post them on the platform, which will then quickly identify the problem and automatically inform relevant people of the situation.
AI and digital transformation reinforce, complement and integrate with each other, said Wu Jincheng, director of Shanghai Economy and Information Technology Commission.
According to Wu, on the one hand, AI is an important driving force for digital transformation of the city, and on the other hand, digital transformation in Shanghai provides better opportunities, a huge stage, and more application scenarios for the development of AI.
Starting from the smallest unit of the city’s governance, Shanghai has embarked upon a brand new path of social governance, trying to connect and benefit residents in the whole city with AI systems and smart technologies.
On July 7, Shanghai released the results of the second phase of its “smallest governance unit” digital governance innovation project, which suggested that the city had established 12 innovation scenarios of urban smart complex, which have involved 58 urban digital transformation ecosystem partners.

Artificial intelligence has become one of the key themes in the oil & gas sector of late, with companies hiring for increasingly more roles, making more deals, registering more patents and mentioning it more often in company filings.
These themes, of which artificial intelligence is one, are best thought of as “any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night”, and by tracking and combining them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels.
According to GlobalData analysis, Saudi Arabian Oil Co is one of the artificial intelligence leaders in a list of high-revenue companies in the oil & gas industry, having advertised for 29 positions in artificial intelligence, made zero deals related to the field, filed 34 patents and mentioned artificial intelligence one times in company filings between January 2020 and June 2021.

Our analysis classified one companies as Most Valuable Players – or MVPs – due to their high number of new jobs, deals, patents and company filings mentions in the field of artificial intelligence. An additional four companies are classified as Market Leaders and zero are Average Players. 10 more companies are classified as Late Movers due to their relatively lower levels of jobs, deals, patents and company filings in artificial intelligence.
For the purpose of this analysis, we’ve ranked top companies in the oil & gas sector on each of the four metrics relating to artificial intelligence: jobs, deals, patents and company filings. The best-performing companies – the ones ranked at the top across all or most metrics – were categorised as MVPs while the worst performers – companies ranked at the bottom of most indicators – were classified as Late Movers.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc is spearheading the artificial intelligence hiring race, advertising for 316 new jobs between January 2020 and June 2021. The company reached peak hiring in January 2020, when it listed 63 new job ads related to artificial intelligence.
Total SE followed Royal Dutch Shell Plc as the second most proactive artificial intelligence employer, advertising for 101 new positions. Exxon Mobil Corp was third with 63 new job listings.
﻿
One of the most innovative oil & gas companies in recent months was Saudi Arabian Oil Co, having filed 34 patent applications related to artificial intelligence since the beginning of last year. It was followed by China Petroleum & Chemical Corp with one patent.
GlobalData collects patent filings from 100+ counties and jurisdictions. These patents are then tagged according to the themes they relate to, including artificial intelligence, based on specific keywords and expert input. The patents are also assigned to a company to identify the most innovative players in a particular field.
﻿
Finally, artificial intelligence was a commonly mentioned theme in oil & gas company filings. Royal Dutch Shell Plc mentioned artificial intelligence three times in its corporate reports between January 2020 and June 2021. Petroleo Brasileiro SA filings mentioned it three times.

These themes, of which artificial intelligence is one, are best thought of as “any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night”, and by tracking and combining them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels.
According to GlobalData analysis, Siemens AG is one of the artificial intelligence leaders in a list of high-revenue companies in the power industry, having advertised for 1,397 positions in artificial intelligence, made zero deals related to the field, filed 81 patents and mentioned artificial intelligence one times in company filings between January 2020 and June 2021.
Our analysis classified two companies as Most Valuable Players – or MVPs – due to their high number of new jobs, deals, patents and company filings mentions in the field of artificial intelligence. An additional seven companies are classified as Market Leaders and one are Average Players. 11 more companies are classified as Late Movers due to their relatively lower levels of jobs, deals, patents and company filings in artificial intelligence.
For the purpose of this analysis, we’ve ranked top companies in the power sector on each of the four metrics relating to artificial intelligence: jobs, deals, patents and company filings. The best-performing companies – the ones ranked at the top across all or most metrics – were categorised as MVPs while the worst performers – companies ranked at the bottom of most indicators – were classified as Late Movers.

Siemens AG is spearheading the artificial intelligence hiring race, advertising for 1,397 new jobs between January 2020 and June 2021. The company reached peak hiring in February 2021, when it listed 134 new job ads related to artificial intelligence.
E.ON SE followed Siemens AG as the second most proactive artificial intelligence employer, advertising for 446 new positions. Schneider Electric SE was third with 178 new job listings.

When it comes to deals, Chubu Electric Power Co Inc leads with one new artificial intelligence deal announced from January 2020 to June 2021.
GlobalData's Financial Deals Database covers hundreds of thousands of M&A contracts, private equity deals, venture finance deals, private placements, IPOs and partnerships, and it serves as an indicator of economic activity within a sector.

One of the most innovative power companies in recent months was Siemens AG, having filed 81 patent applications related to artificial intelligence since the beginning of last year. It was followed by Vestas Wind Systems AS with three patents and Electricite de France SA with one.
GlobalData collects patent filings from 100+ counties and jurisdictions. These patents are then tagged according to the themes they relate to, including artificial intelligence, based on specific keywords and expert input. The patents are also assigned to a company to identify the most innovative players in a particular field.

Finally, artificial intelligence was a commonly mentioned theme in power company filings. Schneider Electric SE mentioned artificial intelligence four times in its corporate reports between January 2020 and June 2021. Centrica Plc filings mentioned it two times and Southern Co mentioned it two times.

Deep learning and AI are drastically changing industries such as healthcare, financial services and retail. Many companies welcome these new technologies. However, Human Resources (HR) departments are having a harder time integrating intelligent systems into their workflows.
HR departments manage organizations' employees —hiring, firing, resolving disputes, payroll, benefits and more. Many of these tasks seem ripe for automation but handing over the reins to machine learning models poses interesting ethical challenges.
AI Uses in Human ResourcesHiring and OnboardingEmployee SchedulingWorkforce Analytics
 
Hiring and Onboarding
The hiring process is laborious and expensive. From reviewing resumes, to interviewing and training new employees, onboarding new employees can carry astronomical costs to organizations—not to mention the new employee’s salary and benefits package. Making the wrong decision can cost even more money if the employee is a poor performer or the new hire isn’t a good fit for the position—then the process starts all over again. Not only will the organization incur the new-hire onboarding costs a second time, but there are also the peripheral costs of lost productivity to consider.
As a result, many companies have looked towards deep learning to reduce the cost of recruiting and hiring employees while increasing the quality of new hires. As we might expect, these attempts haven’t always gone as planned.
From 2014 to 2018, a team at Amazon built systems to review applicants’ resumes in an effort to streamline the process of recruiting top talent. In order to train their algorithm, the team compiled a training data set using resumes submitted to the organization over the previous ten years.
Amazon hoped this system would drastically reduce the time it took to identify the most competitive applicants by automatically identifying the top x number of potential employees. However, these engineers discovered the system was favoring male over female applicants. This was because more male than female job seekers submitted resumes to Amazon, creating a biased, skewed data set.
Creating unbiased automated hiring systems can be a difficult task. Since most companies rarely have exact gender parity, the model will identify factors it thinks are most telling of a good hire but are actually illegal for hiring managers to consider. If you’ve hired more men than women in the past, your algorithm will think men are more qualified hires than women. It all comes down to the data you’re feeding your model.
In order to create accurate hiring decisions and candidate ranking systems, we must take care when assembling the data sets to eliminate unwanted bias. For example, you may want to consider hardcoding your model to disregard certain features such as name, gender and race.

Employee Scheduling
HR departments (or people teams as many companies are starting to call them) that manage hourly employees have a daunting task when creating schedules. When your employees are part- or full-time shift workers, scheduling conflicts will inevitably arise. Because of the unpredictable work schedule, a key function of HR managers (and often general managers) is managing time off and shift change requests.
If you ask any restaurant or retail store manager, scheduling and it’s related tasks often take up a large portion of their work day. However, deep learning systems are starting to take on this burden.
Automated systems can analyze employees’ requests and automatically approve or deny them based on predefined business rules. For example, many organizations that employ part-time shift workers do not allow their employees to work more than 40 hours in a given week. If a shift change request puts one employee above 40 hours for the week, the system would decline the request without any human intervention.
These systems become even more powerful when combined with predicted demand information. Accurately predicting when a particular shift requires additional employees and adjusting schedules or time-off requests accordingly can improve employee management efficiency. For instance, a restaurant’s automated staffing algorithm can learn about trends in diner traffic over time. The restaurant can then save on labor costs when demand is historically low and can also ensure adequate staffing when demand is high.

Do these technologies create a new age in productivity or simply remove the human from HR?

While these systems can drastically improve employee management and reduce the workload for managers, it could hurt employee morale. Often, time off and shift change requests can be personal in nature. If an automated system denies time off for an important event, the employee may grow resentful towards the organization and begin looking for work elsewhere. In today's tight labor market, that's a cost many employers shouldn't be willing to take.
For automated scheduling systems to work, it’s important to thoroughly define business rules and ensure there’s a way for employees to appeal the model’s decision through their manager.

Workforce Analytics
Analytics teams allow organizations to harness their data in ways never before imagined, giving companies the power to make more data-informed decisions than ever before.
When we think about business data, we often picture organizations collecting data on their customers to better serve them. However, many organizations are also collecting data on their employees.

Distilling an employee into a series of metrics can dehumanize the management process and make employees feel like nothing more than a number.

Analyzing key employee metrics allows HR departments to better understand their workforce. Tracking employees’ sentiment, productivity, connection to the organization and even diversity metrics can empower HR departments to better allocate resources and improve their workforce’s efficiency. In addition, predictive analytics models can help identify employees at risk of leaving the organization or likely to be promoted.
While workforce analytics may seem like an obvious choice for HR departments, employees may not have the same perspective. Distilling an employee into a series of metrics can dehumanize the management process and make employees feel like nothing more than a number.

The Future of People Management
Machine learning and AI have promising applications in human resources. However, switching from human to machine-driven people management can cause major issues for employee relations and worker morale within an organization. Do these technologies create a new age in productivity or simply remove the human from HR? Time will tell.

The world is now at a crucial point in technology evolution. The future depends on its deployment across all industries today, including in higher education.Artificial Intelligence-based technologies are thought to promote rather than hinder democratic values including freedom, equality, and transparency. AI-based technologies can become a tool to promote equity and personalized learning.For the past 20 years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made some advances in higher education, but not enough. Although the engagement of human teachers will be required for some more years, it is likely that in a distant future the role of human educators will suffer dramatic changes when AI-powered robots enter the classroom.Yet, today, the collaboration between human teachers and Artificial Intelligence is paramount to prepare the future generations for the AI-infused work environment that awaits them.Artificial Intelligence enhances higher education at all levels. One of the most relevant tasks of AI in education is to provide personalization at scale. However, resolving what is the best way to integrate human interaction and face-to-face learning with the promise of AI technologies remains a great challenge.As a consequence, there has been a significant sluggish adoption of AI in most of the colleges and universities at global scale. Sadly, this has positioned the education sector among the late adopters of AI.However, exciting news about the University of Buckingham in England, announcing the world’s first program degree incorporating Industry 4.0 technologies has given wings to Education 4.0.According to Stanford University’s One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030, interactive machine tutors can now be matched to students for teaching science, math, language, and other disciplines. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and crowdsourcing have boosted online learning and enabled teachers in higher education to multiply the size of their classrooms while addressing individual students’ learning needs and styles.Over the next ten years, the use of AI and other technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Holograms, and Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) in the classroom as well as in the home is likely to expand significantly, provided they can be integrated with face-to-face learning.The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030 is a long-term investigation of the field of AI and its influences on people, their communities, and society. The study is periodically reviewed by experts in the field.AI in higher education and the three paradigms The development of computing and information processing techniques has brought Artificial Intelligence to a place where its many applications can be extensively applied in higher education. AI in education (AIEd) opens countless new opportunities, unmasks potentials, and challenges both educators and students in educational practices.A recent research paper by Fan Ouyang and Pengcheng Jiao from Zhejiang University entitled Artificial Intelligence in Education: The Three Paradigms, proposes that in the short history of AI in education, we can differentiate three paradigms for Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) as follows:Paradigm One: AI-directed - Learner-as-recipient AI is used to represent knowledge models and direct cognitive learning while learners are recipients of AI serviceParadigm Two: AI-supported - Learner-as-collaboratorAI is used to support learning while learners work as collaborators with AIParadigm Three: AI-empowered - learner-as-leader AI is used to empower learning while learners take agency to learnThe developing trend of AIEd has been focused toward empowering learning agency and personalization as well as enabling learners to reflect on learning and inform AI systems to adapt accordingly. The ultimate goal is toward a learner-centered, data-driven, and personalized learning experience.In preparation for more AIEd and Education 4.0, join Fierce Education and higher education executives for a ‘Business & Leadership: Summer Edition’ virtual event on July 14 to discuss immediate topics that need to be tackled this summer, and to learn what some university leaders are doing to alter their business models to excel in the Education 3.0 world, a stepping stone into the future of education.

Boiling is not just for heating up dinner. It’s also for cooling things down. Turning liquid into gas removes energy from hot surfaces, and keeps everything from nuclear power plants to powerful computer chips from overheating. But when surfaces grow too hot, they might experience what’s called a boiling crisis.
In a boiling crisis, bubbles form quickly, and before they detach from the heated surface, they cling together, establishing a vapor layer that insulates the surface from the cooling fluid above. Temperatures rise even faster and can cause catastrophe. Operators would like to predict such failures, and new research offers insight into the phenomenon using high-speed infrared cameras and machine learning.
Matteo Bucci, the Norman C. Rasmussen Assistant Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, led the new work, published June 23 in Applied Physics Letters. In previous research, his team spent almost five years developing a technique in which machine learning could streamline relevant image processing. In the experimental setup for both projects, a transparent heater 2 centimeters across sits below a bath of water. An infrared camera sits below the heater, pointed up and recording at 2,500 frames per second with a resolution of about 0.1 millimeter. Previously, people studying the videos would have to manually count the bubbles and measure their characteristics, but Bucci trained a neural network to do the chore, cutting a three-week process to about five seconds. “Then we said, ‘Let’s see if other than just processing the data we can actually learn something from an artificial intelligence,’” Bucci says.
The goal was to estimate how close the water was to a boiling crisis. The system looked at 17 factors provided by the image-processing AI: the “nucleation site density” (the number of sites per unit area where bubbles regularly grow on the heated surface), as well as, for each video frame, the mean infrared radiation at those sites and 15 other statistics about the distribution of radiation around those sites, including how they’re changing over time. Manually finding a formula that correctly weighs all those factors would present a daunting challenge. But “artificial intelligence is not limited by the speed or data-handling capacity of our brain,” Bucci says. Further, “machine learning is not biased” by our preconceived hypotheses about boiling.
To collect data, they boiled water on a surface of indium tin oxide, by itself or with one of three coatings: copper oxide nanoleaves, zinc oxide nanowires, or layers of silicon dioxide nanoparticles. They trained a neural network on 85 percent of the data from the first three surfaces, then tested it on 15 percent of the data of those conditions plus the data from the fourth surface, to see how well it could generalize to new conditions. According to one metric, it was 96 percent accurate, even though it hadn’t been trained on all the surfaces. “Our model was not just memorizing features,” Bucci says. “That’s a typical issue in machine learning. We’re capable of extrapolating predictions to a different surface.”
The team also found that all 17 factors contributed significantly to prediction accuracy (though some more than others). Further, instead of treating the model as a black box that used 17 factors in unknown ways, they identified three intermediate factors that explained the phenomenon: nucleation site density, bubble size (which was calculated from eight of the 17 factors), and the product of growth time and bubble departure frequency (which was calculated from 12 of the 17 factors). Bucci says models in the literature often use only one factor, but this work shows that we need to consider many, and their interactions. “This is a big deal.”
“This is great,” says Rishi Raj, an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology at Patna, who was not involved in the work. “Boiling has such complicated physics.” It involves at least two phases of matter, and many factors contributing to a chaotic system. “It’s been almost impossible, despite at least 50 years of extensive research on this topic, to develop a predictive model,” Raj says. “It makes a lot of sense to us the new tools of machine learning.”
Researchers have debated the mechanisms behind the boiling crisis. Does it result solely from phenomena at the heating surface, or also from distant fluid dynamics? This work suggests surface phenomena are enough to forecast the event.
Predicting proximity to the boiling crisis doesn’t only increase safety. It also improves efficiency. By monitoring conditions in real-time, a system could push chips or reactors to their limits without throttling them or building unnecessary cooling hardware. It’s like a Ferrari on a track, Bucci says: “You want to unleash the power of the engine.”
In the meantime, Bucci hopes to integrate his diagnostic system into a feedback loop that can control heat transfer, thus automating future experiments, allowing the system to test hypotheses and collect new data. “The idea is really to push the button and come back to the lab once the experiment is finished.” Is he worried about losing his job to a machine? “We’ll just spend more time thinking, not doing operations that can be automated,” he says. In any case: “It’s about raising the bar. It’s not about losing the job.”

In late June, the MIT Technology Review reported on the ways that some of the world’s largest job search sites—including LinkedIn, Monster, and ZipRecruiter—have attempted to eliminate bias in their artificial intelligence job-interview software. These remedies came after incidents in which A.I. video-interviewing software was found to discriminate against people with disabilities that affect facial expression and exhibit bias against candidates identified as women.
When artificial intelligence software produces differential and unequal results for marginalized groups along lines such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, Silicon Valley rushes to acknowledge the errors, apply technical fixes, and apologize for the differential outcomes. We saw this when Twitter apologized after its image-cropping algorithm was shown to automatically focus on white faces over Black ones and when TikTok expressed contrition for a technical glitch that suppressed the Black Lives Matter hashtag. They claim that these incidents are unintentional moments of unconscious bias or bad training data spilling over into an algorithm—that the bias is a bug, not a feature.

But the fact that these incidents continue to occur across products and companies suggests that discrimination against marginalized groups is actually central to the functioning of technology. It’s time that we see the development of discriminatory technological products as an intentional act done by the largely white, male executives of Silicon Valley to uphold the systems of racism, misogyny, ability, class and other axis of oppression that privilege their interests and create extraordinary profits for their companies. And though these technologies are made to appear benevolent and harmless, they are instead emblematic of what Ruha Benjamin, professor of African American Studies at Princeton University and the author of Race After Technology, terms “The New Jim Code“: new technologies that reproduce existing inequities while appearing more progressive than the discriminatory systems of a previous era.

Tech companies have financial and social incentives to create discriminatory products. Take, for example, Amazon Rekognition, a facial recognition created and sold by the e-commerce giant. Amazon very publicly enacted a moratorium on police use of facial recognition in June 2020 after protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. But prior to that, the company developed and sold this product despite mountains of evidence showing that the use of facial recognition by police departments amplifies harm toward Black people. Amazon did so to profit from a criminal justice system that disproportionately targets Black people for surveillance, arrest, and imprisonment and only stopped when protests against anti-Black racism brought attention to the company’s practices. Further, the development and sale of this technology helps to maintain an anti-Black social hierarchy that allows Jeff Bezos and the white men who occupy Amazon’s highest-paid positions to maintain their privilege in our society.

We should view algorithmic bias as a spillover effect from the culture of tech that has persistent racial and gender inequality in hiring and leadership and that has actively discouraged its employees from engaging in political discussions at work. Though the protests in 2020 prompted more explicit conversations about race and identity by tech companies, the culture of avoiding political discussions persists. This was evident when Basecamp CEO Jason Fried published a memo in April in which he banned employee discussions of social and political issues on company Basecamp accounts. In offering his reasoning, Fried wrote, “Today’s social and political waters are especially choppy” and that “you shouldn’t have to wonder if staying out of it means you’re complicit, or wading into it means you’re a target.” The memo sparked online backlash and led to a cascade of employee resignations.

What Fried said has long been implicit within tech companies across the country: Discussions of “choppy” issues like racism, transphobia, misogynoir, and ableism are uncomfortable for those with privilege and that tech companies would prefer to avoid them. And though these companies have, in recent years, attempted to have more explicit discussions of race, gender, and bias within their workplaces, the belief that social issues like race are insignificant to technological development pervades within the corporate culture of Silicon Valley.
By normalizing the avoidance of explicitly talking about social and political issues, tech companies are maintaining a culture that privileges the perspective of people with dominant identities, from hiring to product development. And the truth is that social and political topics are always being discussed. It’s just that people with racial, gender, and other forms of power see their identities and perspectives as the default and therefore not a part of the social and political landscape.

This is particularly true for white people, a group whose racial identity has long been treated as invisible in the United States. In research I conducted last summer, I found that the statements released by tech companies amid the racial justice protests rarely mentioned whiteness or white people. The choice to exclude white people from these statements—while hyper-focusing on Black people and other people of color—normalizes the idea that white people are raceless, and it absolves white people from their role in maintaining the racial hierarchy. In doing this, white people get to maintain their power within tech companies and avoid the feelings of fear, discomfort, and anger that may accompany discussions of racial inequality—a phenomenon sometimes known as white fragility.

It’s time for us to reject the narrative that Big Tech sells—that incidents of algorithmic bias are a result of using unintentionally biased training data or unconscious bias. Instead, we should view these companies in the same way that we view education and the criminal justice system: as institutions that uphold and reinforce structural inequities regardless of good intentions or behaviors of the individuals within those organizations. Moving away from viewing algorithmic bias as accidental allows us to implicate the coders, the engineers, the executives, and CEOs in producing technological systems that are less likely to refer Black patients for care, that may cause disproportionate harm to disabled people, and discriminate against women in the workforce. When we see algorithmic bias as a part of a larger structure, we get to imagine new solutions to the harms caused by algorithms created by tech companies, apply social pressure to force the individuals within these institutions to behave differently, and create a new future in which technology isn’t inevitable, but is instead equitable and responsive to our social realities.

Disclosure: Microsoft and Dell are clients of the author. 
Windows 11 is in early preview right now, and it is far from feature complete; this phase of the deployment is typically focused on assuring hardware and application compatibility. Most of my newest desktop machines won’t yet run Windows 11 because they weren’t configured with their 2.0 Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) turned on (an easy fix) or with Secure Boot enabled (a much more complicated fix).
I was, however, able to load the Windows 11 preview onto my Dell OptiPlex 7070 Ultra modular desktop successfully and without issues. If you decide to try out Windows 11, I suggest you load it overnight, as the upgrade takes several hours.

User interface
Windows 11’s taskbar looks like an updated blend of the Windows 10 taskbar and the macOS dock without the animations. It moves the icons to the center of the taskbar rather than the left, justifying them.
 Rob Enderle/IDG

The new Start menu is centered and shows apps in a grid rather than a list. (Click image to enlarge it.)


Opening up the index of applications is similar in practice, but the result is very different and much closer to what you would see on a smartphone: the apps you most use are presented in an alphabetized grid and not a list as in earlier versions of Windows. This change made it far faster for me to find specific applications than had been the case earlier.











 
 
 
Switching to the complete app list is quick and easy, but it is an extra step from the default app list we had before. As with the default app list, the overall effect is closer to what we are used to on a smartphone. Once you get used to this new layout, it does feel more efficient.
Settings do not immediately pop up when you hit the Windows icon, which is still on the left but now centered with the other app icons in the taskbar. The icons on my home screen and my background were unchanged. Once you open Settings, however, the layout is significantly different, and it may initially take you a while to find where the setting you want has moved.
 Rob Enderle/IDG

The Settings app’s layout is significantly different in Windows 11. (Click image to enlarge it.)


That said, the settings I look to most often, like software updates, were in view and not buried under a submenu, reducing my time to access them. As with the app lists, once you get used to the new Settings layout, you’re likely to find it more efficient to use.











 
 
 
Smartphone integration
Microsoft’s smartphone integration app, Your Phone, is working on this initial build, and it does a decent job of providing an onscreen view of some of your phone’s core features like texts and phone calls. It appears that it has a music feature as well, but currently that appears to be disabled. I did appreciate that you could drag a photo from the visible representation of your phone and into email from your PC desktop interface. The app is both easier to use and more useful than the last time I used it.
Performance
During this phase of the rollout, the platform typically isn’t optimized yet for performance. Still, I didn’t notice any individual wait states or performance degradation on the Dell PC. This lack of noticeable performance penalty suggests there may be a slight performance boost when we get closer to the product’s official release.
Wrapping up: Meh…
While there were minor improvements, there was nothing about Windows 11 that knocked my socks off at this time. But that is expected at this early phase, which is primarily focused on hardware/software compatibility and is not yet feature complete. This phase of the testing isn’t supposed to be exciting; it’s just supposed to work, and Windows 11 did work with minimal disruption or retraining.











 
 
 
The updated OS went in clean with no errors, my core apps all worked fine, and the Your Phone app showed a usability improvement, even though at least one of the newer features didn’t appear to be active yet. I’ll provide updates as the product becomes more feature complete, but, for now, I don’t see any significant problems beyond the known need for a current TPM and Secure Boot.
 Rob Enderle/IDG

Your Phone provides a handy way to see your phone’s notifications, messages, calls, and photos. (Click image to enlarge it.)


Anyone using a business PC, laptop, or desktop that’s within three years old, configured with TPM 2.0, and with Secure Boot enabled should have a similar Windows 11 experience to mine. Windows 11 may not install on many consumer or education-focused PCs if they don’t at least have a current TPM.
The TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements for Windows 11 should result in far more PCs that are secure, as many PCs support those technologies but don’t have them turned on. Other systems will need to be replaced, although not necessarily right away: Windows 10 support will continue until at least 2025.











 
 
 
With the significant increase in ransomware attacks, putting off anything that increases the security of PCs comes with inherent risk, and it may be wiser to go early rather than late on this latest Windows version. Best practice, however, is to wait at least two months after general release before deploying to make sure new problems are identified and corrected before your installation. Often a good time for an update like this is during the holiday break, where any problems will have a minimal impact on productivity.
One last note: When I checked the security features after the Windows 11 installation, they were turned off, and I had to turn them on manually. Do check these features if you load the current build of Windows 11; the irony of installing a more secure version of Windows 11 only to find security turned off is painful at best.

In India, technological progress, is the main driver of growth of GDP per capita, allowing output to increase faster than labor and capital. Technology increases productivity by decreasing the number of labor hours needed to create a unit of output. An increment in labor productivity generally translates into increases in average wages, allowing workers to cut back on work hours and to afford more goods and services. AI should be welcomed for its potential economic benefits. Those economic benefits, however, will not necessarily be evenly distributed across society..At present, it may be challenging to predict exactly which jobs will be most immediately affected by AI-driven automation. Because AI is not a single technology, but rather a collection of technologies that are applied to specific tasks, the effects of AI will be felt unevenly throughout the economy. Some tasks will be more easily automated than others, and some jobs will be affected more than others—both negatively and positively. Some jobs may be automated away, while for others, AI-driven automation will make many workers more productive and increase demand for certain skills. Finally, new jobs are likely to be directly created in areas such as the development.and supervision of AI as well as indirectly created in a range of areas throughout the economy as higher incomes lead to expanded demand..Recent research suggests that the effects of AI on the labor market in the near term will continue the trend that computerization and communication innovations have driven in recent decades. Researchers' estimates on the scale of threatened jobs over the next decade or two range from 9 to 47 percent. For context, every 3 months about 6 percent of jobs in the economy are destroyed by shrinking or closing businesses, while a slightly larger percentage of jobs are added resulting in rising employment and a roughly constant unemployment rate. The economy has.repeatedly proven itself capable of handling this scale of change, although it would depend on how rapidly the changes happen and how concentrated the losses are in specific occupations that are hard to shift from..Effect of AI Automation in Macroeconomy.Productivity.Technology increases productivity by decreasing the number of labor hours needed to create a unit of output. Labor productivity increases generally translate into increases in average wages, allowing workers to cut back on work hours and to afford more goods and services. Living standards and leisure hours could both increase, although.to the degree that inequality increases—as it has in recent decades—it offsets some of those gains..Labor Market.Recent research suggests that the effects of AI on the labor market in the decade ahead will continue the trend toward skill-biased change that computerization and communication innovations have driven in recent decades. Researchers differ on the possible magnitude of this effect. Experts declare that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI technologies and computerization in this period..The Jobs Created by AI.Four categories of jobs are likely to rise during AI-driven growth in the future. Employment in areas where humans engage with existing AI technologies, develop new AI technologies, supervise AI technologies in practice, and facilitate societal shifts that accompany new AI technologies will likely grow..Technological advancement is generated and adopted into the economy as the product of choices of entrepreneurs, workers, and firms looking to better serve a market or streamline a production process, in the context created by public investments in basic and applied research, infrastructure, and other public goods. In a process of directed technical change, incentives draw investment towards more potentially profitable innovations and so the types of technological change that are likely to occur..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
