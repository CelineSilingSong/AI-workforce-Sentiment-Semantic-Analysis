If your sense of worth comes from work—what’s left to hold on to?Photo-illustration: WIRED Staff; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveA few months ago, I was waiting for the subway with a friend, a professional editor, who had never used a large language model (LLM). Standing on the platform, she told me about an article she’d been working on. ChatGPT had come out six weeks earlier, and I input her summary into it on my phone and showed her the result. I’d been following OpenAI’s transformer-driven models since 2019 and had forgotten the effect they can have on first exposure. My friend couldn’t take her eyes off the little gray box as the article came out, line by line. It took me a minute to register the shock on her face. On the train, she said, only half-joking, “I’m going to be unemployed by the end of the year.”SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.As wave after wave of new AI capabilities have hit over the past few months, I’ve been thinking of my friend and her place in the world that’s unfolding. When GPT-4 came out in March, OpenAI’s press release included a chart of its scores on various standardized tests. The much-hyped new model scored above 80 percent on 11 AP and SAT exams, 77 percent on “Advanced Sommelier (theory knowledge),” and—most buzzed-about on Twitter—90 percent on the Uniform Bar Exam, the national test to become a lawyer. OpenAI’s previous model, GPT-3.5 (which powered ChatGPT when it debuted), had already passed the US Medical Licensing Examination, earning a grade that, were it human, would qualify it to become a doctor.Results like these seem to validate a 2019 paper by then Stanford PhD candidate Michael Webb. Though entirely speculative at the time, it upended received wisdom about who would win and who would lose as a result of AI-driven automation. Before Webb’s report, studies by Oxford and McKinsey had predicted that lower-wage, lower-skill jobs would be hardest hit, as indeed they have been throughout the entire history of automation going back to the steam-powered weaving loom.Featured VideoAstrophysicist Answers Space Questions From TwitterThe LLM era has changed all that. Now, the conventional wisdom—replicated and extended in a recent paper by researchers at OpenAI—is that higher-paid jobs and creative jobs (including mathematicians, tax preparers, quants, writers, and web designers, to name a few) are the mostly highly exposed to automation (100 percent exposure for the professions just listed). This has an interesting side effect, since, as Webb’s study spelled out, white-collar work in the US is disproportionately done by the most privileged: men, white people and Asian Americans, people in their prime working years (25-54), and people living in rich coastal cities. Many in these demographics have had it easy for a long time, but it’s looking like the AI revolution will be a bumpy ride for them. I spoke with four economists for this piece, and, though they offered good reasons to think AI won’t “take all the jobs”—indeed, as in previous waves of automation, the economy is likely to grow—none denied that some jobs will be lost. They didn’t know exactly how many, and neither do I. But what I do know is that we've never had a wave of automation in which white-collar workers are uniquely vulnerable, and we should therefore expect this one to play out differently.The crux of the difference lies in the relationship that blue-collar and white-collar workers have with work. According to one study, white-collar workers tend to feel that they “express” their “full potential” more at work than blue-collar workers do; they also experience higher levels of “developing inner self” at work.  According to another study, white-collar workers valued “interesting work (nature of the work), achievement, and appreciation of the work done (recognition)”—in contrast to blue-collar workers, whose motivators were “receiving salary, working condition, peer relations, and job security.” (And even more than other groups, men derive their self-worth from achievement and feeling useful. A dramatic illustration of this was a study of language used by suicidal men, which showed that being considered useful was core to men’s well-being, and its absence was devastating. Being rendered useless by a bot will have disproportionately bad emotional effects for a man.)Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt Kamen“Nature of the work” is one way of saying that white-collar workers care about the tasks we do. Being “recognized” and “appreciated” for “achievement” in these tasks is important to us; it is how we “express” our “full potential.” In other words, large pieces of our emotional lives and social selves are hooked into the tasks we do for work. What happens when AI does those tasks better?AdvertisementAt the furthest edge of white-collar work is a species of task where competency is so admired that it becomes a sport or an art, and competency is rewarded by society with status and esteem, over and above financial compensation. This is the category of games of logic and art. Our shock at the new wave of AI models like ChatGPT and Midjourney comes from their proficiency at the artier, more creative tasks like writing and illustration. But the more strictly logical sports of chess and Go have long since been conquered by previous waves of AI, and so it may be instructive for the left-brainers to look in on how the right-brainers have handled usurption, emotionally and practically. Go is generally considered humanity’s most complex game. In 2016, DeepMind’s AlphaGo beat two of its highest-ranked players. Lee Sedol, a Korean prodigy and the second-best player in the world at the time, took it the hardest. He became depressed, and a couple years after the match he retired from the game, citing AlphaGo. “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated,” he said.Fan Hui, the European champion but a rung below the world leaders, took it better. He was initially shocked and humbled by his defeat, and indeed tried to forget the game altogether. “I want to try to forget Go, but it’s impossible, because all the things I’ve learned in my life is with Go,” he said in AlphaGo, the 2017 documentary released by DeepMind about Lee and Fan. The game, he said, is like looking in a mirror. “I see Go; I also see myself. For me Go is real life.” Later, however, he joined DeepMind—the architect of his defeat—and helped improve its model’s capabilities. Basically, he couldn’t beat ’em, so he joined ’em.These differences seem illuminating, and it’s hard not to look for lessons. I can’t help but think that Lee’s higher ranking actually made him more vulnerable to an existential crisis, because he had more to lose. Fan was disappointed, but Lee lost very publicly in front of millions of Korean viewers. It’s hard to bounce back from that, and perhaps harder than it was for Fan to pivot.I caught up with my editor friend again recently—three months after her first exposure to ChatGPT. She seemed more concerned than ever. “I just think it’s going to be a hard fall,” she said. She felt the younger, more technically adept nipping at her heels and was worried she hadn’t been brought up to be resilient enough for this kind of challenge. I tried to offer hope in the form of a story that Gregory Clark, a professor emeritus at UC Davis, told me about aristocratic land owners during the Industrial Revolution. Tenant farmers abandoning the country to follow better wages into factories in the city caused the value of the aristocrats’ farmland to drop, causing massive losses for the aristocracy. The smart aristocrats, though, said Clark—the ones who could adapt—simply followed the farmers into the cities and became urban landlords.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenMy friend was only partly sold. What was the equivalent now, for her?That’s when I remembered a third Go champion who played AlphaGo but wasn’t included in the documentary. This is Ke Jie. In 2017, months after the Lee match, he was 19 years old and the best player in the world, having beaten Lee in three consecutive championships. Like Fan and Lee, Ke also lost to AlphaGo, after which AlphaGo had no human left to beat.But Ke’s reaction is, I think, the most interesting and also the most hopeful. Pre-AlphaGo, Ke, a teenager of world-class abilities, was also a world-class brat, famous for bucking Go’s culture of humility. When Ke challenged Lee to a match, for example, he posted a video of himself as a boxer beating up Lee and ostentatiously bragged and baited his opponents. In the aftermath of Ke’s defeat by DeepMind’s AI, however, he underwent a remarkable change. On TV appearances since then, he has affected a stance of irony, playfulness, and humility, becoming a much loved crowd-pleaser along the way. Again, looking for lessons, I can’t help but notice Ke’s extreme youth—15 years younger than Lee, 16 years younger than Fan—and wonder if he had less invested in a particular way of valuing and understanding himself. Perhaps he was therefore better able to change how he related to the world on a fundamental level. Important to this story, too, is that, unlike Fan, whose pivot to temporary AI research consultant could be seen as a demotion from European Go champion, Ke’s pivot allowed him to remain at the top of the game.The pivot from “best player in the world at humanity’s most logically complex game” to “comedian” is pretty dramatic, though, and I think the magnitude of that flip reflects the profundity of the changes coming down the pipe. And if Ke Jie has to do that, what does that mean for the rest of us? My hunch is that economic concerns will dominate in the coming years, but assuming that’s solved, where will status reemerge if the core competencies of art, design, science, law, medicine, and engineering are swallowed by GPT-7?Webb himself thought the human niche would become something closer to judgment, “where the point is that it’s a human making the decision.” For a judge or a politician or a newspaper editor, for example, “we know we could get the AI to do it for us—we could ask it to tell us what to do—but we’d rather have a human do it.”Again, the vanguard of Go and chess—“solved” by AI two decades earlier—offer us tea leaves to divine if we choose to read them. In these worlds, Ke Jie is not the only high-status genius to pivot as he did; Magnus Carlsen, the world’s best chess player, has in recent years become known for “interesting” gameplay in response to AI creating an indisputable hierarchy of opening moves. Even more heretical, players at much lower skill levels are beginning to overtake the old masters in popularity: The personable and attractive Botez sisters are the second-most-streamed chess players while having ELO ratings nowhere near the world’s best. And Zhan Ying, a Chinese Go player at a skill level considerably below Ke Jie’s, recently dethroned him, briefly, as the most-watched Go player in the world.If this trend is any indication, we should expect to see softer skills—humor, presence, personality—become the game. In this light, we may already be halfway there without quite realizing it: Perhaps the future belongs to the influencer.",BreadcrumbList,"As wave after wave of new AI capabilities have hit over the past few months, I’ve been thinking of my friend and her place in the world that’s unfolding.

Everyone is excited about generative artificial intelligence, but hype doesn't necessarily translate into solid productivity or revenue gains. Now, a study suggests that even in these early, hyped-up days of generative AI, there are gains being seen.


That’s the conclusion of a recent study out of the National Bureau of Economic Research, which tracked the results of a staggered introduction of an AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,179 customer support agents. The result is a 14% boost in issues resolved per hour. “AI assistance improves customer sentiment, reduces requests for managerial intervention, and improves employee retention.” the study’s authors, Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li Lindsey, and R. Raymond, conclude.

Overall, the greatest impact was on novice and low-skilled workers, with minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers, the co-authors find. That’s because the AI model “disseminates the potentially tacit knowledge of more able workers and helps newer workers move down the experience curve. Analyzing the text of agent conversations, we find suggestive evidence that AI recommendations lead low-skill workers to communicate more like high-skill workers.”

PROMOTED
Industry leaders concur that the impact of generative AI on productivity is just starting to be felt. ""Professionals who can adeptly harness the capabilities of large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, will undoubtedly gain a competitive advantage over those who do not embrace these cutting-edge advancements,"" says Egor Nazarov, chief marketing officer at Soter Analytics. “Progressive organizations will leverage AI to unlock their workforce's full potential, whereas regressive companies may choose to eliminate positions in response to automation.”

""Generative AI, like disruptive innovations before it, enables humans to do things faster and often better,"" says Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of global strategy for Phenom. “The line between non-technical and technical is irrevocably blurred. There are few roles where technology doesn’t or can’t play its part.”

Nazarov agrees that employees are evolving into ""software developers — as they provide instructions to AI, subsequently generating intellectual property and potential software through meticulously crafted prompts. By training employees to develop superior software through refining prompts, organizations can simplify scaling and systematizing processes by converting prompts into code. Incorporating effective prompts into pre-existing systems can automate tasks, such as summarizing meeting notes or updating CRM databases, ultimately optimizing workflows and allowing employees to concentrate on more strategic, value-added tasks.""

Professionals need to embrace generative AI “as a co-pilot or cobot,” says Jurkiewicz. “The risk of not learning the skills to drive generative AI may very well be similar to resisting a personal computer over a typewriter. At some point, this technology will become essential to one’s work. We’re not there yet, but we will be in the near-term future. Responsibly embracing it early means an advantage when the skills in using the technology become necessary.”
For example, generative AI is re-arranging the deck for marketers. “Large language models, including Google Bard and Microsoft Bing, are beginning to encroach upon organic search traffic, particularly for unbranded searches,” says Nazarov. “The dynamics of search engine optimization are changing as machine learning influences content discovery and ranking. For example, Bing consults its index and subsequently channels results through GPT-4 to generate coherent responses. OpenAI updates its model by crawling the web on an annual basis.”
Generative AI tools within enterprises “should be viewed as a co-pilot or cobot for knowledge workers,” says Jurkiewicz. “Organizations should adopt a balanced approach to implementing AI by combining the strength of the technology with human intuition, expertise, and judgment — keep humans in the loop.”

Authors: Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis, both professors at New York University. Marcus, is a professor emeritus of psychology and neural science, while Davis is a professor of computer science. Publish Date: September 10, 2019Why it's good: Rebooting AI offers an explanation of the developments around AI and what it will really take to move AI systems from narrow intelligence to genuine general intelligence. The authors argue that much of the development around AI has occurred in closed systems with fixed rules. The real world, however, is open-ended and much more complex, they say.  FirstMark's Turck, who also recommended Rebooting AI, said its interesting because it offers a more skeptical take on deep learning.Turck said that the explosion in deep learning over the past several years laid the foreground for the current revolution in generative AI. Over these years, he said the overarching belief has been that if you build systems with ""more and more and more data"" then you'll get ""better and better and better results."" Turck said that Rebooting AI pushes back against that ""brute force approach,"" offering a slightly different path to AGI.Learn more about Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust

You don’t have to necessarily belong to a tech background to be able to monetise on the rising popularity of this multidisciplinary field. If you don’t have a degree in computer science but the concept of AI fascinates you, then there is a career window for you. As long as you are willing to learn and widen your spectrum of knowledge, this field will make room for you. However, it’s imperative to have a basic understanding of AI and its major branches in order to build a successful non-technical career in it.     by Taboola by Taboola Sponsored Links Sponsored Links Promoted Links Promoted Links You May LikeSmart Lifestyle TrendsCheapest Way To Get A Walk In Tub If You're On MedicareSmart Lifestyle TrendsUndoHere are a few options. Let’s explore each one of them:1) Conversation and manual writers – As a writer, you have the freedom to be “genre-fluid” and take up various roles — creative, research, technical and more. This is probably why you can effortlessly make your way into AI. The increasing integration of chatbots on websites and social media platforms is forcing tech companies to hire writers who can bring these robots to life.AI writers are asked to write conversational scripts and include all the possible outcomes that a user might expect while interacting with a chatbot. Similarly, a tech field may employ writers for generating documents and manuals for AI systems to make them understandable and operable for non-tech users. For the technical aspect involved in this role, you are usually given proper training before assigning a project.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 51:42Loaded: 1.16%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -51:42 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

From planning to managing resources, ensuring smooth communication, collaborating with the technical teams to monitor progress, and deploying the solutions effectively, a project manager has a crucial role to play in the success of every AI project.However, enrolling in a short-term course to comprehend the technicalities associated with AI solutions can be extremely beneficial for your quick transition from a non-tech field to an area that heavily relies on technological advancements.3) Business analysts – Business analysts form another category of professionals who can truly excel in artificial intelligence. The job of a business analyst is to first define the business requirements and then suggest domain-specific AI solutions.

While it has existed for decades, its presence has become ubiquitous only recently. In addition, the widespread adoption of this high-end technology has also resulted in a host of non-tech job opportunities. Yes, you heard it right. You don’t have to necessarily belong to a tech background to be able to monetise on the rising popularity of this multidisciplinary field. If you don’t have a degree in computer science but the concept of AI fascinates you, then there is a career window for you. As long as you are willing to learn and widen your spectrum of knowledge, this field will make room for you. However, it’s imperative to have a basic understanding of AI and its major branches in order to build a successful non-technical career in it. Here are a few options. Let’s explore each one of them:1) Conversation and manual writers – As a writer, you have the freedom to be “genre-fluid” and take up various roles — creative, research, technical and more. This is probably why you can effortlessly make your way into AI. The increasing integration of chatbots on websites and social media platforms is forcing tech companies to hire writers who can bring these robots to life.AI writers are asked to write conversational scripts and include all the possible outcomes that a user might expect while interacting with a chatbot. Similarly, a tech field may employ writers for generating documents and manuals for AI systems to make them understandable and operable for non-tech users. For the technical aspect involved in this role, you are usually given proper training before assigning a project.2) Project managers – The role of a project manager revolves around coordinating with teams involved in development as well as deployment of various AI solutions. From planning to managing resources, ensuring smooth communication, collaborating with the technical teams to monitor progress, and deploying the solutions effectively, a project manager has a crucial role to play in the success of every AI project.However, enrolling in a short-term course to comprehend the technicalities associated with AI solutions can be extremely beneficial for your quick transition from a non-tech field to an area that heavily relies on technological advancements.3) Business analysts – Business analysts form another category of professionals who can truly excel in artificial intelligence. The job of a business analyst is to first define the business requirements and then suggest domain-specific AI solutions. And, to be able to execute this responsibility, you must possess skills such as idea generation capacity, creative thinking, flexibility to adopt new technologies, and the ability to embrace the changes.Besides aligning AI solutions with an organisation’s goals, a business analyst sometimes also engages with users and collects feedback in order to identify the area of improvement.4) Ethicists – There is a huge demand for AI ethicists in tech giants across the globe, and this need is only going to multiply in the coming years. The key job of an ethicist is to make sure that the AI systems are ethically, politically and socially compliant. This further allows the machines to operate in an unbiased manner. Otherwise, the companies may suffer severe consequences — including lawsuits and reputation damage.To become an AI ethicist, you must be equipped with skills such as interdisciplinary knowledge, strong communication, understanding of ethical implications of technologies and, most importantly, an unwavering commitment to social responsibility.5) Sales/marketing professionals – Every business product or technology needs to be marketed to potential clients in order to boost production. AI is no different. By working closely with technical teams, sales and marketing professionals first try to understand the features of the AI solutions produced by the company, and then use innovative marketing strategies to sell them.At the same time, sales professionals contribute in building and maintaining long-term relationships with the customers.

Generative AI systems like ChatGPT and DALL-E have been attracting media attention for their potential to cause disruption across a range of industries. In a recent report, Goldman Sachs estimated that generative AI systems could impact 300 million full-jobs globally. In the same report, Goldman Sachs found that the same AI systems could also boost global productivity and lead to a 7% increase in annual global GDP.
Generative AI systems present a number of challenges from a copyright law perspective. Two questions are particularly pressing:


Can copyright subsist in AI-generated content?


Does the use of generative AI models infringe the copyright in pre-existing works?


This post will explore these questions, with a focus on text-to-image generative AI systems, and in particular, an AI model called Stable Diffusion. However, much of what is discussed in this post will be equally applicable to text-to-text generative AI models like ChatGPT. 
What is Generative AI?
Generative artificial intelligence systems are machine learning tools which can be used to create content, including text, images, videos and software code. Generally, these AI systems learn patterns from existing data, then use this knowledge to generate new outputs based on prompts from a user.
While generative AI systems have been in existence for some time, recent breakthroughs in the field have significantly advanced their capabilities, catapulting them into the global spotlight.
Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image generative AI system developed by the start-up Stability AI, in collaboration with a number of academic researchers and non-profit organisations. The model was trained on approximately 5 billion text-to-image pairings derived from a ‘general crawl’ of the internet.
The inner workings of Stable Diffusion are quite complex. The model is trained through a process known as ‘diffusion’. Essentially, it adds a random quantum of visual noise to an image, then teaches itself to successfully ‘de-noise’ the image by predicting the original image and comparing its prediction to the actual image. This process typically requires a very large amount of computing power. However, Stable Diffusion solves this problem by creating highly-compressed, encoded (or latent) versions of these images and running the diffusion process in latent space. Through this process, Stable Diffusion teaches itself to create new images from random noise. The model also includes a text encoder, which enables it to transform text inputs into values that can be understood by the diffusion model and ‘steer’ the diffusion process based on a text prompt. The end result is that Stable Diffusion is able to produce new image outputs responsive to user text prompts.1
For example, below is an image generated by Stable Diffusion using the prompt “a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse.”

Can copyright subsist in AI-generated content
A key question is whether copyright can subsist in content created by generative AI systems like Stable Diffusion. This question has significant ramifications for the ability of businesses and individuals to commercially exploit AI-generated content. Without legal rights of ownership in such content, the ability to licence or sell it is effectively nil.
Under Australian law, copyright will only subsist in works that have been created by a human author. The key authority for this proposition is Telstra Corporation Limited v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 149, in which the Full Federal Court found that Telstra’s computer-generated telephone directory did not qualify for copyright protection in light of Telstra’s inability to identify human authors responsible for the ‘material form’ of those directories.2 This case was decided in the wake of the High Court’s decision in Ice TV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009) 239 CLR 458, where the Court found that for copyright to subsist, a work must originate with an author, from some ‘independent intellectual effort.’3
Does entering a text-based prompt into an AI model like Stable Diffusion satisfy the requirements for human authorship and ‘intellectual effort,’ such that copyright will subsist in the output of the AI model? This question is yet to be tested in Australian Courts (or, as far as the author is aware, Courts in any other jurisdiction).
The answer is likely to depend on the particular case. In circumstances where little time and effort is spent on the input provided to the AI model – for example, just typing the text prompt “cat wearing a tie” – it will be difficult to argue that the generation of the resulting artwork involved some ‘creative spark’ on the part of the human author.





Image created using Stable Diffusion and the prompt “cat wearing a tie”.
On the other hand, it’s possible to conceive of works which might require considerable creative effort on the part of the human operator: for example, works generated by an elaborate string of text prompts, or after an iterative process of trial and error. Such works may be in a stronger position to qualify for copyright protection, based on current Australian authority.
Indeed, user accounts of Stable Diffusion suggest that, at present,4 obtaining high quality output takes a lot of work. Typically, the user must refine the prompt until it is ultra-specific, generate a very large set of images and select the best option, refine this further using an image to image generator (another form of generative AI), and finally, add finishing touches using a program like Photoshop.5 Clearly, this is a labour-intensive process. However, whether the resulting artwork ultimately qualifies for copyright protection is likely to depend on the extent to which the ‘skill and labour’ of the user was directed to the actual material form of the resulting artwork.6
The upshot is that the creators of AI-generated artworks presently have little certainty regarding the legal rights in their creations.
Infringement of Third Party Copyright
Another important question is whether the use of generative AI systems amounts to an infringement of copyright in the pre-existing content used to train the AI-model.
There are at least two ways in which the use of Stable Diffusion could potentially infringe third party copyright:


First, the use of Stable Diffusion to create new images could infringe the copyright in works comprised in the AI model’s training set; and




Secondly, the training process itself could infringe the copyright in works comprised in the training set.


We will consider both in further detail below.
There are two principle questions that a Court will consider when determining infringement of copyright. First, whether the allegedly infringing work was derived (or ‘copied’) from the copyright work; secondly, whether the allegedly infringing work takes a substantial part of the copyright work. Both derivation and substantiality must be established for infringement to arise.
I. Creation of new images
Let’s start with the use of Stable Diffusion to create new images.
It should be noted that the creation of new images using the Stable Diffusion model does not involve any direct or ‘literal’ copying from the images in the model’s training dataset. Rather, new images are created from random noise, based on patterns that the model has learned from these images during its training process.
This in itself is unlikely to be fatal to derivation. Copyright law recognises that copying can occur in various forms and may be direct or indirect.7 The key question is really whether there is some causal connection between the allegedly infringing work and the copyright work.8 This requirement is likely to be satisfied where it can be shown that the copyright work forms part of an AI model’s training set.
The question of substantiality is likely to prove more challenging. It is important to remember that to establish copyright infringement in Australia, it must be shown that the allegedly infringing work reproduces a substantial part of a particular copyright work. It is not an infringement of copyright to combine a ‘non-substantial’ part of a multitude of different works. Indeed, this is arguably how the human creative process works, because all new works of art are built to some extent on what has come before them.
The difficulty here is that AI-generated works may be derived from a very large number of sources. In most cases, it is likely to be quite difficult to demonstrate that an AI-generated artwork takes a ‘substantial part’ of any one copyright work in its training set.
The case for infringement may be stronger for AIs trained on more specific data sets, or AIs that are instructed to produce images ‘in the style’ of a particular artist or artwork. In such cases, it may be easier to identify the reproduction of a substantial part of a particular work. However, there is still considerable scope for legal uncertainty.
For example, below is an artwork generated by Stable Diffusion using the prompt ‘a garden in the style of Monet.’ Underneath it is an actual painting by Monet of his garden at Giverny.





A ‘garden in the style of Monet’ created using Stable Diffusion.





The Artist’s Garden at Giverny, Claude Monet, 1900.
The first image is a passable imitation of Monet’s style, and one can see how it might be the cause of some concern to the artist (or in this case, his estate).
Assuming that the second image forms part of Stable Diffusion’s training set, then derivation ought to be established. However, whether the first image actually reproduces a ‘substantial part’ of the second image is a more difficult question.9 The works depict the same subject matter and share a distinct impressionistic style. But there are also notable differences in their composition and colour palette. In fact, it is difficult to precisely identify any particular aspect of the second image which is reproduced in the first image. In practice, where there is clear evidence of derivation, Courts may be more inclined to make a finding of substantiality. The challenge here, though, is that the first image may also be derived from a very large number of additional sources, potentially diluting the substantiality of any single instance of copying. This issue is compounded by the lack of transparency around Stable Diffusion’s image creation process and the sources relied upon to create new output in any particular case.
This exercise illustrates the challenges presently faced by copyright owners whose works are used, and in some cases imitated, by generative AI-models.
II. Training
A separate question arises as to whether the process of training generative AI-systems itself amounts to an infringement of copyright.
In Stable Diffusion’s case, this question is likely to turn on whether the training process, and in particular, the creation of latent versions of images in the training set, amounts to a reproduction in material form of those images. It is not contentious that the reproduction of a work in a non-visible, digital form may amount to an infringing reproduction under Australian copyright law.10 A key question will be whether the highly-compressed, latent images created by the Stable Diffusion system still reproduce a ‘substantial part’ of the original image – or whether the training process involves the creation of other ‘non-latent’ digital reproductions of the training images.
These question are at the core of US Court proceedings recently commenced by stock image database Getty Images against Stability AI in the District Court for Delaware. Getty alleges that Stability AI has copied at least 12 million copyright images from its websites, along with associated text and metadata in order to train its Stable Diffusion model. While the proceeding is still at an early stage, it is clear that Getty considers that Stability AI’s training process amounts to an infringement of Getty’s copyright – Getty alleges that the training process involved wide scale copying, encoding and storage of Getty’s stock images and text pairings. Getty also alleges that Stable Diffusion has violated US trade mark and copyright law by producing images which either reproduce, or distort, or remove the watermarks on Getty’s images.11 The determination of Getty’s claim is likely to entail a detailed, technical consideration of the operation of the Stable Diffusion system, and how this interacts with the conventional copyright principles of derivation and substantiality.
While there are relevant differences between Australian and US copyright law (most notably, the absence in Australia of a general ‘fair use’ defence), the proceeding is still likely to provide helpful guidance to Australian artists, businesses and intellectual property lawyers, in the absence of local case law or legislative intervention.

4 It is expected that obtaining quality output will require less work as the model continues to be developed.
5 See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33902248.
6 The High Court in Ice TV queried the relevance of ‘skill and labour’ per se to questions of copyright subsistence and infringement – the critical question is whether skill and labour is directed to the particular form of expression – see [47], [52] – [54].
7 For example, in Fred Fisher Inc v Dillingham (1924) 298 Fed 145, the Court found that copying occurred unconsciously, on the basis that the copyright work was stored somewhere in the memory of the infringer – see 147-8 per Learned Hand J.
8 See Francis Day & Hunter Ltd v Bron [1963] Ch 587 at 614.
9 The copyright in Monet’s works is, in fact, expired – but let’s assume for the purpose of this exercise that it is still current.
10 See Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) Section 10.
11 Another proceeding was commenced against Stability AI (and another generative AI called MidJourney) by a collective of artists in January this year in the US district Court for the Northern District of California, involving similar allegations.

AI could replace millions of U.S. jobs 











Artificial intelligence could replace millions of jobs in the U.S.
03:18

Love it or hate it, so-called generative artificial intelligence has proved its ability to make at least one type of worker more productive on the job. Using the enhanced AI boosted the productivity of customer service representatives at a Fortune 500 software firm by 14%, according to the first study to examine the emerging technology's use by employees in a real workplace.Notably, human support agents reported resolving more customer queries per hour when aided by a custom-built tool powered by OpenAI's GPT technology. Assistance from the AI also improved customer sentiment, reduced the volume of requests for managerial intervention, and even improved employee retention, presumably because it allowed service agents to have more pleasant interactions with customers, according to Erik Brynjolfsson, one of the paper's authors and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. 






""There was less churn once they used this tool because it seemed workers were happier and enjoyed the job more,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We wondered if it would push them harder, but it seems to be something workers liked. Customers were happier and I'm guessing as a call center operator, it's more enjoyable to interact with happy customers.""The AI revolution: Google's artificial intelligence developers on what's next in the fieldService reps interacting with customers through text chats used the custom-built AI tool to help them find answers to client questions. Specifically, the AI read interactions between customers and support agents, and generated suggested responses for the agents to use. They also had the ability to accept or reject the AI-generated text answers. 


""It basically saw both what the customers and agents were saying and would give them strategically-timed hints or suggestions,"" Brynjolfsson said.

For example, the AI tool would prompt reps to mention products or possible upgrades customers could make to solve their problems. It was also sensitive to tone, offering guidance to agents how to politely""communicate with clients. The AI was trained on thousands of client-agent interactions that were labeled as either successful or unsuccessful. ""It tended to know what worked well with customers,"" Brynjolfsson said.

The results: Agents generally solved problems faster, customers were happier, new employees got up to speed faster and the employer (which wasn't identified in the study) experienced less turnover. 


""People worry this is going to replace everything. I think by far the bigger effect is it augmenting us, like a calculator. It allows us to do things faster and more efficiently,"" Brynjolfsson said. ""I say lean in and embrace it, learn to use these tools to be more effective.""

According to a recent survey conducted by KPMG US, nearly two-thirds (65%) of the 225 US executives surveyed in March 2023 believe that generative AI will have a high or extremely high impact on their organization in the next three to five years, surpassing other emerging technologies. 
However, despite these findings, nearly the same number (60%) of respondents said they are still a year or two away from implementing their first generative AI solution, revealing a lack of preparedness among executives for immediate adoption.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
Generative AI has become a buzzword among executives and boards, as the technology has become increasingly accessible. However, organizations are struggling to keep up with its rapid development. The KPMG survey found that less than 50% of respondents believe they have the necessary technology, talent and governance to implement generative AI successfully. 
“Generative AI is moving so fast, it has executives’ heads spinning. Companies can’t keep up with dozens of new generative AI offshoots coming out each month. While they’ve bought into its overall promise, they struggle with taking the first step,” Todd Lohr, US technology consulting leader at KPMG, told VentureBeat. “As a result, they may lack the necessary technical expertise in their workforce to build and deploy generative AI solutions.”
To bridge this gap, executives plan to spend the next 6–12 months understanding how generative AI works, evaluating their internal capabilities and investing in generative AI tools. Lohr said that regulatory and ethical concerns around the use of generative AI is another reason for its slowed adoption in certain industries.
The survey polled 300 global C-suite and senior executives, of which 225 were US-based. The respondents were from businesses with revenue of $1 billion and above.
Generative AI: A competitive differentiator 
KPMG US conducted this survey as part of their generative AI research initiative. The report highlighted that generative AI has the potential to be the most disruptive technology seen to date, according to 77% of the executives surveyed. Furthermore, respondents expect the impact to be highest in enterprise-wide areas, such as driving innovation, customer success, tech investment, and sales and marketing.
However, it also revealed that executive prioritization of generative AI varies significantly by sector. While most executives in technology, media, telecommunications (71%), and healthcare and life sciences (67%) feel they have appropriately prioritized generative AI, only a small percentage of consumer and retail executives (30%) view it as a priority. 
The survey also found that organizations struggle to derive value from emerging technologies when they adopt a siloed approach. In fact, 68% of executives responded saying that they have yet to appoint a central team or person to coordinate their response to the rise of generative AI. At present, the IT function is taking the lead.
“Without a leader spearheading generative AI and steering through the hype, companies risk spinning their wheels, duplicating efforts, and having competing strategies. Companies need a generative AI North Star to confidently scale generative AI,” Lohr said. advertisement
The technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) industry is leading the way in prioritizing research on generative AI applications, with 60% of respondents considering it a high or extremely high priority over the next 3–6 months. This is the highest percentage across all industries surveyed.
Moreover, respondents from TMT and financial services industries were most likely to report that the recent emphasis on tools such as ChatGPT has significantly impacted their digital and innovation strategies. As a result, these industries are particularly receptive to the benefits of generative AI and actively seeking ways to incorporate it into their operations.
“Generative AI has the potential to be the most disruptive technology we’ve seen to date,” said Steve Chase, US consulting leader at KPMG. “It will fundamentally change business models, providing new opportunities for growth, efficiency and innovation, while surfacing significant risks and challenges.”
According to Chase, for leaders to harness the enormous potential of generative AI, they must set a clear strategy that quickly moves their organization from experimentation into industrialization. advertisement
Lohr added, “Given that the technology (generative AI) is relatively new, ROI remains hard to quantify. For a clear business case, companies need to identify specific use cases and prioritize them like a product portfolio.” 
Lack of risk management and the fear of negative consequences 
Most executives (72%) believe that generative AI is crucial in building and maintaining stakeholder trust, but almost half (45%) say that not having the right risk management tools can negatively impact their organization’s trust. Furthermore, most executives (79%) think that leveraging generative AI provides a competitive advantage in risk management compared to their peers.
Despite the expected impact of generative AI on their organizations and customers, most organizations are still in the early stages of designing and implementing risk and responsible use programs. Only 6% of the 300 surveyed have a dedicated team for evaluating risk and implementing mitigation strategies, while 25% are in the process of implementing such strategies.
In addition, nearly half (47%) are in the initial stages of evaluating risk and mitigation strategies, and 22% haven’t started evaluating them yet. Only 5% have a mature responsible AI governance program, while 49% plan to establish one in the future, and 19% have partially implemented an AI governance program. 
Interestingly, 27% said they do not currently see a need or have not yet reached enough scale to merit a responsible AI governance program.
“Beyond understanding the technology’s risks and keeping the data in-house, companies must develop a robust data governance framework that establishes clear policies, security protocols, and standard operating procedures for handling data. This ensures that data is collected, processed, and stored securely and appropriately,” added Lohr. 
He said as with any other technology or service, it’s important to do your due diligence when data moves outside the organization.
Executives predict a new era for the workforce that combines human work with generative AI. While many believe it will increase productivity, change how people work and encourage innovation, they are also concerned about potential negative impacts. 
Almost 4 in 10 executives (39%) fear decreased social interactions and human connections with coworkers, while 32% worry about increased mental health issues among their workforce due to the stress of job loss and uncertainty. 
To address this, companies are taking a hybrid approach to both hiring and capability-building across various industries and functions.
Responsible use for fruitful benefits
Executives recognize that generative AI can revolutionize businesses in various sectors, but many barriers to adoption remain. Major concerns include clear business cases and adequate technology, talent and governance. 
To stay ahead of the competition, KPMG recommended that executives prioritize the swift deployment of generative AI while ensuring ethical and responsible use. To successfully do so, KPMG said CEOs and board members must personally invest time in understanding generative AI, and they must demand the same from their teams. 
“The key to success with AI is acceptance, adoption and alignment at the leadership level within the institution. This strategy should start with literacy first. Furthermore, companies should think about new operation models, with R&D into generative AI capabilities, potential use cases and limitations,” Lohr explained. “They should get their ‘hands dirty’ and experiment with pilot projects to test the technology and better understand its potential impact.”

Yet, more companies are hiring AI professionals that do not require advanced skills like computer science. In other words, you may enter these AI careers with non-tech skills to excel in this new technological age.
You can apply for a data analytics translator job if you have excellent English language proficiency. If you have worked as a virtual assistant, you may remain competitive in the job market by learning about ChatGPT and other AI tools. Also, those passionate about video games may work as game writers because modern titles use machine learning.
I will discuss the best AI careers accessible to non-technical people, such as chatbot designers and artificial intelligence writers. Note that these roles require a basic understanding of ChatGPT and similar machine learning systems. Also, higher-paying jobs require advanced skills like data science, systematic and analytical thinking, and data modeling.

Annual salary: $90,877
We expect AI chatbots to produce content on par with manmade ones. Consequently, AI firms need humans to ensure it communicates like a person.
Chatbot designers do that by writing scripts for virtual customer service support. Also, they map the various queries customers may submit to the chatbot.
These AI professionals work with non-tech skills. However, you need role-playing, writing, and communication skills to understand how customers will use the chatbot.
4. Virtual assistant

Annual salary: $59,153
Companies have been integrating ChatGPT into their chatbots, but that does not mean they will replace human agents. Contrary to popular belief, they need virtual assistants more than ever.
AI chatbots are great at answering simple customer queries but need help with complicated ones. Moreover, some people still prefer speaking with human intelligence.

These artificial intelligence jobs cover the customer concerns chatbots couldn’t by providing a human touch. Voice assistants only need to effectively collect data and other non-technical skills.
5. Language translator

Annual salary: $76,070
Modern AI chatbots accept queries in various languages and translate them. For example, the latest large language model of ChatGPT, GPT-4, understands 26 languages.
Machine learning tools rely on language translators to build their language translation features. They translate prompts so AI editors can review and integrate them into the final product.
Nowadays, online translation services use machine learning in their workflows. As a result, working as an ordinary translator remains a viable career in the age of artificial intelligence.
You may land this job if you only have non-tech skills. However, you need to know English and a non-English language you can translate.
6. Digital artist

Annual salary: $53,013
Why would anyone hire artists if AI can produce media? These computer programs are a shortcut to creating appealing art without artistic skills.
Contrary to popular belief, generative AI images increase the demand for manmade art. Machine learning can emulate aesthetics but not human creativity.
People seek manmade art as AI images become more widespread. You do not need to know deep learning or data modeling to become a digital artist. However, you must have artistic skills and understand digital tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
7. Game writer

You may land this job with only non-tech skills like the other entries. You may need to use the company’s AI tools, but your tasks remain the same.
8. AI ethicist

Annual salary: $121,841
Machine learning sparked unprecedented ethical concerns. Specifically, AI needs regulations to ensure it will not eliminate jobs.
As a result, more businesses need guidance in navigating our growing digital world. AI ethicists promote accountability and responsibility in the use of artificial intelligence.

Annual salary: $112,398
AI companies must understand where to implement their projects. As a result, the demand for domain experts grew. Domain experts offer their understanding of various fields to check whether AI tools produce their intended results.
For example, those with an education college degree can confirm whether an AI chatbot helps with learning. As a result, they are essential for creating the most effective AI tools.
Even better, it is one of the artificial intelligence careers that require no technical AI skills. However, you should have expertise in other fields, such as healthcare, finance, or agriculture.
10. Data analytics translator

AI can be extremely advantageous as they can detect frauds, assist doctors in identifying/diagnosing a disease, personalise learning for students and teachers, monitor crop health or give weather predictions and updates and what not.  AI has certainly revolutionised the way we live, work and interact with technology. But the debate over its use or application has caused quite a commotion on social media. While some argue that AI is benefitting different sectors in various ways, others think that it could impact or dilute the existing workforces of certain industries in future. Also ReadFive career opportunities in artificial intelligence To settle the debate, we ourselves took help of the self-learning AI tool, ChatGPT, and asked what it thinks of AI&#039;s interference in the job market. And to our surprise, it came up with a list of different jobs that AI could potentially impact in the future. Here it goes: Data Entry: Automation tools powered by Artificial Intelligence can scan and extract data from various sources, which can reduce vacancies for manual data entry jobs. Customer Service: AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants have already taken over quite a few platforms. These chatbots can handle routine customer queries, reducing the need for human customer service representatives, thus impacting these jobs in future. Transportation: With the development of self-driving cars and trucks, the jobs of drivers and delivery personnel may be affected. They can easily be replaced by this high-end technology.   Manufacturing and Assembly: AI-powered robots can perform repetitive tasks faster and more efficiently than humans, leading to a reduction in the number of workers required in manufacturing and assembly jobs. Accounting and Bookkeeping: AI-powered software can automate many financial tasks, reducing the need for accountants and bookkeepers. Even the need for librarians may be reduced as AI can easily keep track of the plethora of books assembled in the library. Retail: AI-powered tools can track inventory levels, analyze consumer behavior, and automate ordering and stocking processes, reducing the need for human intervention. Also ReadWhen AI is your assistant Not to forget, AI systems require vast amounts of data to learn and improve. This dependence on data can limit the accuracy and usefulness of the system if the data used to train it is incomplete, biased, or outdated. These tools can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, and other security concerns. They require a complex infrastructure, including hardware, software, and networks, to function properly. This dependence on infrastructure can as of now limit the scalability and accessibility of AI systems. These systems not only give a peek into the After pointing out these jobs, ChatGPT also noted that while AI may replace these jobs, it will also create new opportunities and require workers with new skills, such as data analytics, programming, and machine learning. This could be the beginning of a new era which if handled responsibly can bring positive changes to the job market globally. ",,Jobs and Career,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sakshi Kuchroo', 'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/author/sakshi.kuchroo@financialexpress.com/'}]",2023-04-25T11:59:53+05:30,2023-04-25T11:59:53+05:30,Will Artificial Intelligence take your job?

 Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, can be effective, everyday assistants that help you optimize your workflow. However, whether you use it as a writing, coding, or research assistant, it's important to know they are far from perfect. 






 That said, there are a few things to keep in mind to get the best output from AI content generators and ensure you use them ethically. Here, we'll cover some common mistakes to avoid when using AI-generative tools. 


 1. Not Understanding How Generative AI Tools Work 
    

 While you don't need to be a machine learning or AI expert to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, Copysmith, etc., having a basic understanding of how they work is vital. This helps you appreciate their limitations and find ways to get better results. 

 Although these AI text generators have some differences, most use the same underlying engine, so understanding how one works can also give you a pretty accurate view of how the others work. So, how does ChatGPT work? 





 ChatGPT is a large language model trained on massive amounts of data from the internet and other sources. This AI chatbot relies on this training to generate human-sounding responses to your queries. It is worth noting that some of these AI text generators, including ChatGPT, have a training cutoff date, which means they lack knowledge of events after this date. 



 2. Not Editing Responses From AI Text Generators 
 The next big mistake to avoid when using AI-generative tools is failing to edit their responses. By editing, we don't just mean correcting spelling or grammar mistakes. You also need to fact-check the information generated and compare it to other credible sources. 

 As we have covered above, some of these tools don't have access to current information. So, while AI chatbots are effective at predicting their next words (based on their training data and your prompt) and generating plausible and human-like responses, their output is not always accurate, and that's one of the biggest problems with OpenAI's ChatGPT. 





 In addition, these tools may have been fed with biased information and could also generate biased responses. So, you should always ensure you review and edit the generated content before using it. 



 3. Over-Relying on Generative AI Tools for Your Writing Tasks 
    

 Although these AI writing tools can help you write entire articles for online publishers or write your school essays from scratch, developing an over-reliance on them is a huge mistake. There are several reasons why content writers should not rely on AI chatbots for their daily writing tasks. 






 First, as we have covered, these tools don't guarantee accuracy and may contain factual errors or biased content. In addition, these AI writing tools typically generate bland, generic, formulaic content that lacks sufficient depth and creativity. Lastly, an over-dependence on these tools will kill your creativity and make you lazy. 

 This is not to say you shouldn't use them at all, as there are several responsible ways to use AI as a content writer, including brainstorming titles or content ideas, researching, crafting catchy headlines, and more. 



 4. Failing to Write Good Prompts 
 For the most part, the quality of the responses you get from ChatGPT and similar tools depends on the quality of their training and your prompts. In the most basic terms, prompting is how humans talk to AIs, so adopting good prompting techniques is an effective way to improve your ChatGPT responses. 

 For instance, it's always good to ensure your prompts are clear and grammatically correct. Next, you want to provide enough information and context for the AI to understand your query. In addition, you can also assign it a role to get more specific and relevant responses. 





 All in all, learning how to write effective prompts is a key skill to master when using generative AI tools. You can continuously practice by interacting with the AI and adjusting your prompts as you go—you never know, you may just start a career in prompt engineering. 



 5. Trusting Generative AI Tools With Sensitive Information 
    

 Similar to other Tech Giants, OpenAI has faced criticism over its data collection practices that put user privacy and security at risk. However, this goes beyond the account information you give when signing up (name, transaction history, payment card information, etc.), as it also includes data from your conversations with the chatbot. 






 This includes everything you type into the chatbot field or file uploads. That said, you shouldn't trust ChatGPT with confidential information because it could end up in the wrong hands. This is a serious concern, as countries like Italy have already banned ChatGPT, and it's safe to assume that other AI generative tools have similar data collection practices. 

 That said, you should always remain mindful when using these tools and ensure you do not input sensitive or confidential information. 



 6. Using Generative AI Tools Unethically 
 Like most tools out there, AI content generators can be used for good and malicious purposes. For instance, some students have been using AI chatbots to cheat in school, while other malicious actors use them to write phishing emails or create malware. 

 In addition, it's also good practice to inform clients/readers when using AI-generated content in your work. This is particularly important when it comes to sensitive topics like health, politics, and finance. 





 Lastly, you also want to keep an eye on the Terms of Use of any AI content generator you use to ensure you're not violating them, as this could result in your account being suspended or banned. 



 7. Not Familiarizing Yourself With AI-Powered Tools 
    

 A lot has been said about artificial intelligence recently, and several predictions have been made as well. Whether you believe that these tools will take your job or not, what's certain is that AI will change the job market, and it's here to stay. 

 This means adaptability is more vital than ever, so ignoring these AI generative tools is a mistake you want to avoid. While you may have unique skills and talents that artificial intelligence can't replace, there's a huge chance that early adopters will gain an edge over their competition. 







 Get Better Results From Generative AI Tools by Avoiding These Mistakes 
 AI chatbots can enhance your workday in several ways, but like most tools, you need to know how to use them properly to get the best results. By avoiding these mistakes, you'll be able to make the most out of generative AI tools and ensure that your work is of the highest quality. 

 As this technology continues to evolve, it's vital to continuously refine your skills to stay ahead of the curve. And once you can use these tools effectively, make sure that you use them to their full advantage and boost your own productivity.

Learn more about the new generation of artificial intelligence and what it means for the future of knowledge work, the nature of creativity, and the origins and truthfulness of content on the internet



As published byThe Conversation













The light and dark sides of AI have been in the public spotlight for many years. Think facial recognition, algorithms making loan and sentencing recommendations, and medical image analysis. But the impressive – and sometimes scary – capabilities of ChatGPT, DALL-E 2 and other conversational and image-conjuring artificial intelligence programs feel like a turning point.
The key change has been the emergence within the last year of powerful generative AI, software that not only learns from vast amounts of data but also produces things – convincingly written documents, engaging conversation, photorealistic images and clones of celebrity voices.
Generative AI has been around for nearly a decade, as long-standing worries about deepfake videos can attest. Now, though, the AI models have become so large and have digested such vast swaths of the internet that people have become unsure of what AI means for the future of knowledge work, the nature of creativity and the origins and truthfulness of content on the internet.
Here are five articles from our archives the take the measure of this new generation of artificial intelligence.
1. Generative AI and work

A panel of five AI experts discussed the implications of generative AI for artists and knowledge workers. It’s not simply a matter of whether the technology will replace you or make you more productive.
University of Tennessee computer scientist Lynne Parker wrote that while there are significant benefits to generative AI, like making creativity and knowledge work more accessible, the new tools also have downsides. Specifically, they could lead to an erosion of skills like writing, and they raise issues of intellectual property protections given that the models are trained on human creations.
University of Colorado Boulder computer scientist Daniel Acuña has found the tools to be useful in his own creative endeavors but is concerned about inaccuracy, bias and plagiarism.
University of Michigan computer scientist Kentaro Toyama wrote that human skill is likely to become costly and extraneous in some fields. “If history is any guide, it’s almost certain that advances in AI will cause more jobs to vanish, that creative-class people with human-only skills will become richer but fewer in number, and that those who own creative technology will become the new mega-rich.”
Florida International University computer scientist Mark Finlayson wrote that some jobs are likely to disappear, but that new skills in working with these AI tools are likely to become valued. By analogy, he noted that the rise of word processing software largely eliminated the need for typists but allowed nearly anyone with access to a computer to produce typeset documents and led to a new class of skills to list on a resume.
University of Colorado Anschutz biomedical informatics researcher Casey Greene wrote that just as Google led people to develop skills in finding information on the internet, AI language models will lead people to develop skills to get the best output from the tools. “As with many technological advances, how people interact with the world will change in the era of widely accessible AI models. The question is whether society will use this moment to advance equity or exacerbate disparities.”
2. Conjuring images from words












Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley computer scientist who specializes in image forensics, explained the process. The software is trained on a massive set of images, each of which includes a short text description.
“The model progressively corrupts each image until only visual noise remains, and then trains a neural network to reverse this corruption. Repeating this process hundreds of millions of times, the model learns how to convert pure noise into a coherent image from any caption,” he wrote.
3. Marking the machine
Many of the images produced by generative AI are difficult to distinguish from photographs, and AI-generated video is rapidly improving. This raises the stakes for combating fraud and misinformation. Fake videos of corporate executives could be used to manipulate stock prices, and fake videos of political leaders could be used to spread dangerous misinformation.
Farid explained how it’s possible to produce AI-generated photos and video that contain watermarks verifying that they are synthetic. The trick is to produce digital watermarks that can’t be altered or removed. “These watermarks can be baked into the generative AI systems by watermarking all the training data, after which the generated content will contain the same watermark,” he wrote.
4. Flood of ideas
For all the legitimate concern about the downsides of generative AI, the tools are proving to be useful for some artists, designers and writers. People in creative fields can use the image generators to quickly sketch out ideas, including unexpected off-the-wall material.

Rochester Institute of Technology industrial designer and professor Juan Noguera and his students use tools like DALL-E or Midjourney to produce thousands of images from abstract ideas – a sort of sketchbook on steroids.
“Enter any sentence – no matter how crazy – and you’ll receive a set of unique images generated just for you. Want to design a teapot? Here, have 1,000 of them,” he wrote. “While only a small subset of them may be usable as a teapot, they provide a seed of inspiration that the designer can nurture and refine into a finished product.”
5. Shortchanging the creative process
However, using AI to produce finished artworks is another matter, according to Nir Eisikovits and Alec Stubbs, philosophers at the Applied Ethics Center at University of Massachusetts Boston. They note that the process of making art is more than just coming up with ideas.












The hands-on process of producing something, iterating the process and making refinements – often in the moment in response to audience reactions – are indispensable aspects of creating art, they wrote.
“It is the work of making something real and working through its details that carries value, not simply that moment of imagining it,” they wrote. “Artistic works are lauded not merely for the finished product, but for the struggle, the playful interaction and the skillful engagement with the artistic task, all of which carry the artist from the moment of inception to the end result.” – Rappler.com

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we work, learn, and interact with technology. The term AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and natural language processing. As AI technology continues to advance, it is becoming increasingly integrated into various aspects of the workplace, from automating repetitive tasks to helping professionals make more informed decisions.
The impact of AI on the future of work is a topic of much discussion and debate. Some experts believe that AI will lead to the displacement of human workers, while others argue that it will create new opportunities and lead to increased productivity and economic growth. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that AI will have a profound effect on the job market and the skills needed to succeed in the workforce.

In this context, it is crucial to understand the potential benefits and risks of AI in the workplace, as well as the ethical implications of using AI to make decisions that affect human lives. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential that individuals and organizations alike stay informed and adapt to the changing landscape of work.
AI is set to transform the future of work in a number of ways. Here are some possible angles:

The Impact of AI on Jobs: One of the biggest questions surrounding AI and the future of work is what impact it will have on employment. Will AI create new jobs or displace existing ones? What types of jobs are most likely to be affected?
The Role of AI in Workforce Development: As AI becomes more prevalent in the workplace, it’s likely that workers will need to develop new skills in order to keep up. How can companies and organizations help workers develop these skills?
The Future of Collaboration Between Humans and AI: Many experts believe that the future of work will involve collaboration between humans and AI. What might this collaboration look like? How can companies and organizations foster effective collaboration between humans and AI?
AI and Workforce Diversity: AI has the potential to reduce bias and increase diversity in the workplace. How can organizations leverage AI to improve workforce diversity?
The Ethical Implications of AI in the Workplace: As AI becomes more prevalent in the workplace, there are a number of ethical considerations that need to be taken into account. How can companies and organizations ensure that their use of AI is ethical and responsible?
AI and the Gig Economy: AI has the potential to transform the gig economy by making it easier for individuals to find work and for companies to find workers. How might AI impact the future of the gig economy?
AI and Workplace Automation: AI is likely to automate many routine tasks in the workplace, freeing up workers to focus on higher-level tasks. What types of tasks are most likely to be automated, and how might this change the nature of work?

Advantages and disadvantages of AI in the context of the future of work:
Advantages:

Increased Efficiency: AI can automate many routine tasks and workflows, freeing up workers to focus on higher-level tasks and increasing productivity.
Improved Accuracy: AI systems can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, reducing the risk of errors.
Better Decision-Making: AI can analyze data and provide insights that humans may not be able to identify, leading to better decision-making.
Cost Savings: By automating tasks and workflows, AI can reduce labor costs and improve the bottom line for businesses.
Enhanced Customer Experience: AI-powered chatbots and other tools can provide fast, personalized service to customers, improving their overall experience with a company.

Disadvantages:

Job Displacement: As mentioned earlier, AI and automation could displace many workers, particularly those in low-skill jobs.
Skill Mismatch: As AI and automation become more prevalent, workers will need to develop new skills in order to remain competitive in the workforce.
Bias and Discrimination: AI systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on, which could lead to discrimination in hiring, promotion, and other workplace practices.
Ethical Concerns: As AI and automation become more prevalent, there are a number of ethical concerns that need to be addressed, including issues related to privacy, transparency, and accountability.
Cybersecurity Risks: As more and more data is collected and processed by AI systems, there is a risk that this data could be compromised by cybercriminals.
Loss of Human Interaction: AI systems may replace some forms of human interaction in the workplace, potentially leading to a loss of social connections and collaboration between workers.
Uneven Access: As mentioned earlier, not all workers and organizations have equal access to AI and automation technology, which could widen the gap between those who have access to these tools and those who do not.

These are just a few of the advantages and disadvantages of AI and the future of work. As AI continues to evolve, it’s likely that new advantages and disadvantages will emerge as well.
In conclusion, the impact of AI on the future of work is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and planning. While AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and improve productivity, it also poses significant challenges, including job displacement and ethical concerns.

To prepare for the future of work, individuals and organizations must prioritize upskilling and reskilling to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in an AI-driven world. Additionally, policymakers must address the potential impacts of AI on employment and work towards creating policies that ensure the benefits of AI are shared equitably.
Ultimately, the successful integration of AI into the workplace will require collaboration and dialogue between industry, academia, and government to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits society as a whole. By staying informed and proactive, we can navigate the changes brought about by AI and create a future of work that is both efficient and equitable.

“The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, A.I., and the Future of Work,” Yossi Sheffi, MIT CTL Media, purports to link the two title concepts. It’s a frustrating book. Yossi Sheffi is a supply chain expert and he’s at MIT. I had hopes that this would be a great book about modern supply chains and how artificial intelligence (AI) can address the challenges of the sector. Sadly, I was only half right.

The Magic Conveyor BeltMIT Center for Transportation and Logistics


Let’s start with the fun. The first half of the book is focused on supply chains. Sheffi, as should be expected from the Director of the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics, describes both the basics and the complexity of modern supply chains in the first two of four book sections. Actually, it’s a little surprising. It’s very rare, in my experience, for an academic to be able to create explanations that don’t look as if they came from a textbook. The author, though, succeeds admirably. The first section is the basics on the supply chain and the second section talks about the complications and complexity caused by today’s global infrastructure, and it’s done at a very accessible level. This was an excellent half and created excitement for the second half.

PROMOTED
The expectation was not met. MIT is one of the centers of AI development. I figured the author could wander over to the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and get feedback from them as to how AI could address the challenges laid out so clearly in section two. That was not to be.

The second half sections are the typical, high-level platitudes we repeatedly hear about AI. Admittedly. Yossi Sheffi comes closer to admitting it will destroy jobs, but he can’t quite do that. One example is, after talking about how there’s a partnership between people and AI, he describes “an automated warehouse the size of seven football fields” that employes four people.

Another problem is the “logic” used not long after. Remember, AI is going to remove those simple tasks and leave us with the challenging ones. As mentioned in this column last Fall, if the simple tasks are automated, how are people going to learn enough to handle the complex tasks? As a hint about the book, the flawed argument is made on page 190. Not until page 277 is there a tiny segment about the flaw in that argument.

About the only tactical discussion of AI helping supply chains is a later discussion about digital twins, and that is only two-and-a-half pages.
One, almost amusing, later discussion is the glowing description of Intel providing new and exciting career paths as an example of AI creating jobs. It might eventually do that, but it looks as if the draft of this book was written before last October’s information about thousands of job cuts at that company.

What we end up with is a tale of two halves. I think this book is good for two classes of people. First, anyone who wants an excellent, non-technical explanation of the current state of global supply chains. Since I don’t focus on that, I don’t know if there’s a book solely on that subject that is as good. The second group are people who are already in AI, people who aren’t interested in the fluff in the second half but want to see the business opportunity laid out in excellent terms. They can ignore the second half and get business ideas from the first half. If, however, you’re already very knowledgeable about the sector and want to know how AI can help, this is not the book for you. I wish this had been co-authored by Yossi Sheffi and someone from CSAIL, or elsewhere, who could have helped focus the AI section on the tactical details of using the technology to help the sector. It would have made for a wonderful book.

NYC Artificial Intelligence Rule to Take Effect July 5, 2023: New York City Issues Final Rule Regulating the Use of AI Tools by Employers


By Lindsay Burke, Libbie Canter, Jennifer Johnson, Teresa Lewi, Micaela McMurrough, Carolyn Rashby, Lindsey Tonsager & Kareem Carryl on April 26, 2023
Posted in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Technology




The New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP”) recently issued a Notice of Adoption of Final Rule (“Final Rule”) relating to the implementation of New York City’s law regulating the use of automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”) by NYC employers and employment agencies.

NYC’s Local Law 144 now takes effect on July 5, 2023.  As discussed in our prior post, Local Law 144 prohibits employers and employment agencies from using certain Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) tools in the hiring or promotion process unless the tool has been subject to a bias audit within one year prior to its use, the results of the audit are publicly available, and notice requirements to employees or job candidates are satisfied. 
The issuance of DCWP’s Final Rule follows the prior release of two sets of proposed rules in September 2022 and December 2022.  The Final Rule’s most significant updates from the December 2022 proposal include an expansion of the definition of AEDTs and modifications to the requirements for bias audits.  Key provisions of the Final Rule are summarized below.

What is an Automated Employment Decision Tool?
Local Law 144 defines AEDTs as “any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.” 
Under the Final Rule, “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” is defined as a group of mathematical, computer-based techniques that:

generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on skill sets or aptitude; and
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve the accuracy of the prediction or classification.

The Final Rule clarifies which tools fall within the scope of the law by defining the phrase “to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” as:

relying “solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.) with no other factors considered”;
using the tool’s “output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted more than any other criterion in the set”; or
using the tool’s “output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making.”

Employers and employment agencies should be aware of four categories of requirements related to bias audits:

(i) Structure and Required Calculations;
(ii) Permissible Data;
(iii) Independent Auditor; and
(iv) Publication of Results.

Each category is addressed in more detail below.
Structure and Required Calculations
The Final Rule details the structure and requirements for bias audits, with new requirements following prior releases of proposed rules.  An AEDT cannot be used if more than one year has passed since the most recent bias audit.  Bias audits must adhere to the following:

Where an AEDT selects individuals to move forward in the hiring process or classifies individuals into groups, the bias audit must:

(i) calculate the selection rate for each category;
(ii) calculate the impact ratio for each category; and 
(iii) indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who are not included because they fall within an unknown category (e.g., applicants who declined to disclose demographic data). 



Categories mirror the EEO-protected categories reported on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s EEO-1 Component 1 report.  These categories include race, ethnicity, and sex.

Where the AEDT only scores individuals rather than selecting them, the bias audit must:

(i) calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;
(ii) calculate the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample’s median score in the each category/classification;
(iii) calculate the impact ratio for each category/classification; and
(iv) indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who are not included because they fall within an unknown category. 



The impact ratio must be calculated either as (i) a selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category; or (ii) a scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate of the highest scoring category.  Impact ratio calculations may exclude a category that makes up less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. 
The Final Rule also indicates that the required calculations described above must be conducted for standalone sex, race, and ethnicity categories (e.g., Male, Female, Hispanic or Latino, Black, Asian, White, etc.), as well as intersectional groupings (e.g., Black Females, White Males, etc.). 
Permissible Data
Bias audits must use “historical data,” which is defined as “data collected during an employer or an employment agency’s use of an AEDT to assess candidates for employment or employees for promotion.”  Under the Final Rule, a bias audit may rely on historical data of other employers or employment agencies, but only if the employer or employment agency (i) has provided the independent auditor with historical data from its own use of the AEDT or (ii) has never used the AEDT.
Alternatively, test data may be used if there is insufficient historical data available for a statistically significant bias audit.  If test data is used, a summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used, as well as describe how the test data was generated and obtained.
Independent Auditor
An “independent auditor” must perform bias audits.  The Final Rule clarifies that an “independent auditor” is “a person or group that is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues within the scope of a bias audit of an AEDT.”  An auditor is not independent if the auditor:

(i) is or was involved in using, developing, or distributing the AEDT;
(ii) has an employment relationship with an employer or employment agency that uses AEDT; or
(iii) has a direct or material indirect financial interest in an employer or employment agency that uses the AEDT. 

Similarly, an auditor is not independent if it has an employment relationship with or financial interest in a vendor that developed or distributes the AEDT.
Publication of Results
Local Law 144 requires that the results of a bias audit must be “made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency.”  The Final Rule clarifies that the published results — the date of the most recent bias audit, summary of results, and distribution date of the AEDT — must be posted on the employment section of the entity’s website in a “clear and conspicuous manner.” 
The summary of results must include the source and an explanation of the data used to conduct the audit; the number of individuals who fall within an unknown category; and the number of individuals, selection or scoring rates, and impact ratios for all categories.  If a category comprising less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit is excluded from the required calculations for impact ratios, the summary must include the independent auditor’s justification, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.
The published results must remain posted for at least six months after the AEDT was last used to make an employment decision.
Any changes to the notice requirements?
Local Law 144 requires that any employer or employment agency that uses an AEDT to screen an employee or a candidate who has applied for a position for an employment decision must notify individuals who reside in New York City that the AEDT will be used in connection with their assessment or evaluation, as well as the job qualifications and characteristics that the AEDT will consider.  Notice must be provided at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT and, notably, must include instructions for how to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
The Final Rule’s notice provisions remain similar to those included in the proposed rules in September 2022 and December 2022.  Importantly, the Final Rule clarifies that Local Law 144 only requires employers or employment agencies to include how an individual might request alternative selection processes or accommodation to the extent such options are “available.”  While employers or employment agencies must still comply with reasonable accommodation obligations under other laws, the Final Rule states that “[n]othing under [Local Law 144] requires [them] to provide an alternative selection process.”
Looking Ahead
As an immediate next step, employers and employment agencies should identify whether their hiring and promotion efforts leverage AI tools that fall within the scope of NYC Local Law 144 and adjust their processes accordingly in advance of the July 5, 2023 enforcement date.
While NYC’s Local Law 144 is groundbreaking, it is likely only a small part of what will become an increasingly complex regulatory environment related to AI and machine learning.  Companies should prepare to comply with more laws and regulations as federal, state, and local legislatures take stock of the use of AI in various decision-making processes.  Covington will continue to monitor developments and publish relevant updates.  In the interim, if you have any questions about the material covered above, please contact Covington members of our Employment, Data Privacy, and Technology groups.

Jobs Most Impacted by ChatGPT and Similar AI Models
On November 30, 2022, OpenAI heralded a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) by introducing ChatGPT to the world.
The AI chatbot stunned users with its human-like and thorough responses. ChatGPT could comprehend and answer a variety of different questions, make suggestions, research and write essays and briefs, and even tell jokes (amongst other tasks).
Many of these skills are used by workers in their jobs across the world, which begs the question: which jobs will be transformed, or even replaced, by generative AI in the coming future?

This infographic from Harrison Schell visualizes the March 2023 findings of OpenAI on the potential labor market impact of large language models (LLMs) and various applications of generative AI, including ChatGPT. 
Methodology
The OpenAI working paper specifically examined the U.S. industries and jobs most “exposed” to large language models like GPT, which the chatbot ChatGPT operates on.
Key to the paper is the definition of what “exposed” actually means:

“A proxy for potential economic impact without distinguishing between labor-augmenting or labor-displacing effects.” – OpenAI
Thus, the results include both jobs where humans could possibly use AI to optimize their work, along with jobs that could potentially be automated altogether.
OpenAI found that 80% of the American workforce belonged to an occupation where at least 10% of their tasks can be done (or aided) by AI. One-fifth of the workforce belonged to an occupation where 50% of work tasks would be impacted by artificial intelligence.
The Jobs Most and Least at Risk of AI Disruption
Here is a list of jobs highlighted in the paper as likely to see (or already seeing) AI disruption, where AI can reduce the time to do tasks associated with the occupation by at least 50%.

Analysis was provided by a variety of human-made models as well as ChatGPT-4 models, with results from both showing below:

Showing 1 to 10 of 17 entriesPreviousNext
Editor’s note: The paper only highlights some jobs impacted. One AI model found a list of 84 additional jobs that were “fully exposed”, but not all were listed. One human model found 15 additional “fully exposed” jobs that were not listed.
Generally, jobs that require repetitive tasks, some level of data analysis, and routine decision-making were found to face the highest risk of exposure.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, “information processing industries” that involve writing, calculating, and high-level analysis have a higher exposure to LLM-based artificial intelligence. However, science and critical-thinking jobs within those industries negatively correlate with AI exposure. 
On the flipside, not every job is likely to be affected. Here’s a list of jobs that are likely least exposed to large language model AI disruption.



Jobs Least Exposed to AI




AthletesShort-order cooks


Large equipment operatorsBarbers/hair stylists


Glass installers & repairersDredge operators


Automotive mechanicsPower-line installers/repairers


Masons, carpenters, roofersOil field maintenance workers


Plumbers, painters, pipefittersServers, dishwashers, bartenders



Naturally, hands-on industries like manufacturing, mining, and agriculture were more protected, but still include information processing roles at risk.

Likewise, the in-person service industry is also expected to see minimal impact from these kinds of AI models. But, patterns are beginning to emerge for job-seekers and industries that may have to contend with artificial intelligence soon.
Artificial Intelligence Impacts on Different Levels of Jobs
OpenAI analyzed correlations between AI exposure in the labor market against a job’s requisite education level, wages, and job-training.
The paper found that jobs with higher wages have a higher exposure to LLM-based AI (though there were numerous low-wage jobs with high exposure as well).

EducationDirect


TrainingInverse



Professionals with higher education degrees also appeared to be more greatly exposed to AI impact, compared to those without.
However, occupations with a greater level of on-the-job training had the least amount of work tasks exposed, compared to those jobs with little-to-no training.
Will AI’s Impact on the Job Market Be Good or Bad?
The potential impact of ChatGPT and similar AI-driven models on individual job titles depends on several factors, including the nature of the job, the level of automation that is possible, and the exact tasks required. 

However, while certain repetitive and predictable tasks can be automated, others that require intangibles like creative input, understanding cultural nuance, reading social cues, or executing good judgement cannot be fully hands-off yet.
And keep in mind that AI exposure isn’t limited to job replacement. Job transformation, with workers utilizing the AI to speed up or improve tasks output, is extremely likely in many of these scenarios. Already, there are employment ads for “AI Whisperers” who can effectively optimize automated responses from generalist AI.
As the AI arms race moves forward at a rapid pace rarely seen before in the history of technology, it likely won’t take long for us to see the full impact of ChatGPT and other LLMs on both jobs and the economy.

The world’s 20 biggest tech companies are worth over $20 trillion in total. To put this in perspective, this is nearly 18% of the stock market value globally.
This graphic shows which companies top the ranks, using data from Companiesmarketcap.com.
A Closer Look at The Top 20
Market capitalization (market cap) measures what a company is worth by taking the current share price and multiplying it by the number of shares outstanding. Here are the biggest tech companies according to their market cap on June 13, 2024.

Note: PDD Holdings says its headquarters remain in Shanghai, China, and Ireland is used for legal registration for its overseas business.
 
Apple is the largest tech company at the moment, having competed with Microsoft for the top of the leaderboard for many years. The company saw its market cap soar after announcing its generative AI, Apple Intelligence. Analysts believe people will upgrade their devices over the next few years, since the new features are only available on the iPhone 15 Pro or newer.
Microsoft is in second place in the rankings, partly thanks to enthusiasm for its AI software which is already generating revenue. Rising profits also contributed to the company’s value. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Microsoft increased its net income by 20% compared to the same quarter last year.
Nvidia follows closely behind with the third-highest market cap, rising more than eight times higher compared to its value at the start of 2023. The company has recently announced higher profits, introduced a higher dividend, and reported that its next-generation GPU chip will start generating revenue later this year.
AI a Driver of the Biggest Tech Companies
It’s clear from the biggest tech companies that involvement in AI can contribute to investor confidence.
Among S&P 500 companies, AI has certainly become a focus topic. In fact, 199 companies cited the term “AI” during their first quarter earnings calls, the highest on record. The companies who mentioned AI the most were Meta (95 times), Nvidia (86 times), and Microsoft (74 times).

These tools can save time and money, and are creating excitement among tech experts – but they also raise a lot of questions.     ""I started using ChatGPT in January,"" said Pierre, a communications manager in a small administrations business, talking about the now-famous conversational robot launched in November 2022 by the company OpenAI. ""At first, the results were not too impressive, but by honing my skills through YouTube videos, I've managed to automate about 30% to 40% of my workload, which consists of writing articles and social media posts."" Although the person who said this – following a public call for people's experiences put out on Le Monde's French website – was enthusiastic about the technology, they did not want their name to be published, because the boss of their small company ""struggles to think of using artificial intelligence [AI] as real work."" The trend for generative AIs – capable of creating text, like ChatGPT, or highly realistic photos, like Midjourney, from a simple written instruction – is starting to affect businesses. ""Today, all the creatives in our agency play around with this software. And particularly those under 35,"" said Bertille Toledano, president of the advertising agency BETC and co-president of the Association des Agences-Conseils en Communication (Association of Communication Consulting Agencies, AACC). But beyond these initial technophile converts, will these tools disrupt the world of work? Or will they join the list of innovations that have been the subject of farfetched hype, only to disappoint, such as the metaverse or the virtual reality headset? ""Generative artificial intelligence is having an effect on jobs that seemed immune to automation, especially in the service sector,"" said sociologist Yann Ferguson, a teacher and researcher at ICAM in Toulouse and scientific leader of LaborIA, a program to analyze the impact of AI on work launched in 2021 by the government and the Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies du Numérique (National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology). Businesses such as the investment bank Morgan Stanley and e-commerce platform Cdiscount have already started its initial rollout. Digital giants such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta are also pushing the technology.  ""Companies are mostly won over, but they also have questions,"" said Laurent Daudet, co-founder of LightOn, a French developer of large language models, the drivers behind interfaces like ChatGPT. What will generative AI really contribute? What are the risks? A February JobTeaser-Kantar survey summarized the ambivalence of feelings about this technology: Most people in employment between 18 and 27 thought that it would free up work time or create new jobs – but 61% also feared it would have an impact on their careers.

I recommend starting with the first article, which you can find here:Generative AI for Social Work Students: Part IA paradigm shifttowardsdatascience.comMastering AI tools like ChatGPT offers MSW students a range of career advantages. Proficiency in these technologies streamlines work processes, increasing efficiency and accuracy in tasks like case management, data analysis, and resource allocation. As technology becomes increasingly integrated into social work practice, organizations will value professionals who seamlessly blend traditional skills with AI’s innovative capabilities. Proficiency in AI tools demonstrates a commitment to staying current with technological advancements, making students more marketable to potential employers.The ability of AI to revolutionize social work practice depends on professionals having a solid grasp of the technology, which includes understanding how AI models function, their strengths and weaknesses, and the potential issues and biases they may introduce. Even though ChatGPT has only been publicly accessible for under six months, I have observed problematic usage among my students. Some of these issues stem from overconfidence in their abilities while lacking the required skill to effectively use these powerful tools, a phenomenon known as the Dunning-Kruger effect.As the social work curriculum has yet to incorporate this technology fully, this article serves as a stop-gap measure, offering guidance on essential knowledge, skills, and practices for working with generative AI. While not a comprehensive roadmap, this article provides a starting point that will evolve with the technology. By refining their abilities in AI applications like ChatGPT, social work students can contribute to developing novel, cutting-edge interventions and practices, positioning themselves as thought leaders. This expertise can open doors for career growth, professional recognition, and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams to effect lasting, positive change for individuals and communities.Given the swift advancements in AI technologies and abundant available resources, I refrain from offering a specific reading list, as it would quickly become outdated. Instead, I present these areas as general competency domains, which you should consistently monitor for the most up-to-date resources.Understanding how artificial intelligence worksIn today’s fast-paced technological environment, social work students must develop an understanding of artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models like ChatGPT. As AI tools become more prevalent in social work practice, professionals with expertise in this area can make well-informed decisions about their usage. This knowledge helps social workers use AI responsibly and ethically while integrating their content expertise and interpersonal skills.A key component of understanding AI is knowing the underlying training procedures and data, which can help you make informed decisions about when and how to use AI-generated content. This knowledge also enables you to identify potential inaccuracies, biases, and outdated information. Evaluating an AI model’s performance for specific use cases is essential. Disappointment with AI models often arises from using them for tasks they were not trained to perform, such as researching highly specialized topics.It is important to note that understanding AI and large language models does not require a background in math, statistics, or computer programming. While achieving proficiency involves time and effort, it is an attainable goal for any social work student committed to learning. A wealth of resources, including online courses, tutorials, and articles, is available to help students develop their AI knowledge at their own pace without requiring specialized prerequisites.By investing in this learning process, social work students can enhance their skill sets and contribute to advancing the field. In doing so, they ensure that they harness the power of AI to benefit individuals, families, and communities in a way that aligns with the principles of social work.Ethical issuesThe significance of actively engaging with and staying informed about ethical issues related to artificial intelligence cannot be overstated. Ensuring the responsible use of AI, especially large language models like ChatGPT, is critical to aligning the technology with the core values and principles of social work practice, such as social justice, the dignity and worth of individuals, and the significance of human relationships.Ethical concerns in AI use cover a wide range of issues, including:Data privacy: Safeguarding the sensitive information of clients and communities is essential to maintaining trust and upholding ethical standards in social work practice.Biases in AI systems: AI models can inadvertently perpetuate and reinforce existing biases, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes. Social workers must be aware of these biases and actively work to mitigate their impact.Potential misuse: Unintended or unethical use of AI tools can harm individuals and communities, making it vital for social workers to understand and adhere to appropriate guidelines for using such technology.Equitable distribution of AI benefits: Ensuring that the advantages of AI technology are accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status or other factors, is critical to fostering social justice and addressing systemic inequalities.As social workers, our responsibility is to continuously examine and question the effects of AI technology on vulnerable populations, ensuring that the tools we use do not contribute to harm or injustice. Cultivating a deep understanding of these ethical challenges enables social work professionals to advocate for developing and implementing policies and guidelines that support ethical AI use in their practice settings. This commitment to ethical AI integration is essential for upholding the core values of social work and promoting the well-being of individuals and communities.Prompt engineeringCurrently, “prompt engineering” is one of the most important practical skills to learn to harness the power of generative AI tools. Prompt engineering may sound complicated, but the concept is straightforward. In the context of generative AI and large language models, prompt engineering refers to crafting practical questions or input statements (i.e., prompts) to guide the AI model in generating useful, relevant, and accurate responses.Learning to write effective prompts is essential for using generative AI tools to their full potential. Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the quality of the AI-generated content, making it more focused, accurate, and applicable to the task at hand. Conversely, poorly designed prompts may lead to irrelevant, ambiguous, or misleading responses from the AI model.To engineer effective prompts, one must deeply understand the subject matter and anticipate potential pitfalls and inaccuracies that may arise in AI-generated content. In this regard, content expertise plays a significant role. Professionals with solid knowledge in a content area can design prompts that will lead to meaningful and insightful AI-generated content more effectively.The significance of subject matter proficiency in designing AI prompts emphasizes that generative AI cannot substitute for social workers. AI models depend on human experts’ insights and experiences to shape their responses and guarantee the produced content is pertinent and suitable for a particular context. Social workers’ expertise enables them to efficiently utilize AI tools to improve their work while ensuring the AI-generated content adheres to the profession’s values, principles, and ethical guidelines.As generative AI continues to play a more prominent role in various fields, including social work, prompt engineering is emerging as one of the essential AI-related skills for professionals to learn. By mastering prompt engineering, social workers can unlock the full potential of AI tools, enhancing their practice and driving more effective, efficient, and ethical outcomes for their clients and communities.Design thinkingDesign thinking is an approach that emphasizes a human-centered methodology for addressing complex problems. This approach emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and experimentation to understand the unique needs and contexts of the communities involved. We can create more effective and tailored AI-driven solutions to address intricate social issues by incorporating design thinking principles into generative AI tools.This fusion of design thinking and generative AI fosters a creative environment that encourages idea generation and exploration of diverse solutions. It also supports an iterative process of prototyping and testing, allowing for the continuous refinement and adjustment of interventions based on real-world feedback. Adopting a design thinking mindset when utilizing generative AI tools facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration and promotes a culture of continuous improvement. This enables the development of comprehensive solutions to complex social issues by drawing on a wide range of perspectives and expertise from different fields.Moreover, by learning from failures and iterating on solutions, we can ensure that AI-driven interventions are consistently refined and adapted to meet the changing needs of the target population. This approach ultimately leads to more effective, responsive, and sustainable solutions that address the root causes of social issues and improve the well-being of the communities served.Next stepsThe following two articles in this series will focus on strategies for enhancing your educational experience with AI and a concluding article on the art and science of prompt engineering. As I prepare these articles, I’m also actively examining the problems of the ASWB national social work licensing exam using large language models.

Could artificial intelligence be about to take over your job?
Two studies point out the challenges ahead for work positions in the AI era

By Elaine Burke 
April 27, 2023 at 9:01 AM















Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.
 TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust.


Preliminary research published at the end of March claimed that up to 80% of the US workforce could see at least 10% of their tasks impacted by large language models such as the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) underpinning ChatGPT.
First, note the caveats. A preprint paper has not yet been peer reviewed, though the open access ArXiv server where it was posted does have a moderation process. This particular preprint comes from OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, along with OpenResearch, a research lab chaired by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the University of Pennsylvania. And it just happens to be the case that GPT-4 technologies were even used for some of the writing and coding on this research.
That said, some of the paper's conclusions chime with an economic study issued in December 2022 by the White House and the EU, which examined the potential impact of AI on future workforces.
This report didn't just look at the roles and tasks at risk of being overtaken by AI, but also at the broader impacts this technology might have across the workforce, such as the possible increase in surveillance of workers using AI, algorithmic management of work, income loss, the evolution of worker skills and mobility across jobs.

OpenAI is in talks with Broadcom about developing AI chip 



What both reports have in common is a warning that AI is not just a threat to jobs comprising repetitive digital tasks that are easily automated. In fact, many high-skill and high-paid jobs are highly exposed to AI. The economic report also warns that this leaves older workers particularly exposed, as they have had time to accrue the education and experience that can potentially be supplanted by an AI that is cheaper to employ or incredibly speedy with results – or both.
High-risk roles
When it comes to the specifics, both reports differ as to which roles are most at risk. OpenAI's research concludes that mathematicians, tax preparers, writers, web designers, accountants, journalists and legal secretaries are those most vulnerable to an AI takeover. The US-EU study says clinical lab technicians, chemical engineers, optometrists and power plant operators are most exposed.
Really, it all comes down to what these tools are capable of doing with a level of speed and accuracy that rivals or far supersedes human workers. In terms of skills, OpenAI's report identifies programming and writing as highly susceptible to the influence of large language models.

However, it's important to note that while generative AIs continue to ""hallucinate"" (generating confident responses that are counter to facts), its outputs can only be trusted under the supervision of trained and experienced professionals capable of calling out any missteps. That is to say, AI journalism will need good editors and fact-checkers to review content before publishing, and AI coding will need thorough testing and validation before deployment.
This is the knowledge gap AI may never be able to overcome. Even the most advanced AI systems, reaching more than 90% accuracy, appear to plateau at that level, unable to reach the ideal of 100% reliability. And therein lies a conundrum. If the future needs expert oversight of AI-generated outputs to ensure accuracy and trust, where will those experts come from if a generation of workers skips the learning and experience gained from doing the groundwork over years and years?
If lower-level tasks are farmed out to AI as an assistance to workers in the long-term, their experience may not be as valuable in the long-term. This has already been flagged as an issue among pilots, a profession where much of the work has been handed over to automation.
A 2013 report from a US working group examining flight deck automation identified vulnerabilities in pilots' knowledge and skills driven by an over-reliance on computer-assisted piloting and passive training in its use. This can leave pilots unprepared to take control of a flight when things went wrong, which can have disastrous results. The working group found that more than 60% of accidents reviewed involved a manual error.
AI-proof skills
Being more hands-on with your work is certainly a major advantage amid the AI revolution. While generative AI is racing ahead with the creation of digital content, plenty of work in the physical realm is being left to the dexterity of skilled human hands and creative thinking.
The joint US-EU report also cites jobs that require interpersonal skills – such as childcare and hospitality – as having very limited exposure to AI. According to OpenAI's research, jobs with a greater need for skills in science and critical thinking are less likely to be impacted by large language models. It concludes that the jobs least likely to be impacted by GPTs overall are in graphic design, search marketing strategy and financial management.

The release of GPT-4 is a clarion call for communicators. It’s becoming increasingly critical to understand how AI can enhance our work.
Yet with so much hype surrounding AI, it’s challenging to separate buzz from brass tacks. Here are five quick tips to bring you up to speed without getting caught up in the hype cycle:

Understand what AI is—and AIn’t. “We’re going through a generative AI hype cycle,” says Web3 strategist Cathy Hackl, who keynoted PR Daily’s Social Media Conference at Disney World in March. “With all the buzz, it’s easy to get intimidated by the terms and technology.”

The solution is settling on a clear definition. She believes the World Economic Forum defines it best: “Generative AI refers to a category of AI algorithms that generate new outputs based on the data they have been trained on. Unlike traditional AI systems designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, generative AI creates new content in the form of images, text, audio, and more.”
She also suggests thinking of artificial intelligence as a pie, with generative AI as one of the slices.
“Robots, deep learning, machine learning and conversational artificial intelligence are all slices of the AI pie,” Hackl explains. “Look at it as form of automation that can help your company have more effective processes, freeing up resources to work in a more innovative way. While this is a much too simple way to reduce what AI is, it can help you and your teams start to wrap their heads around this.”

Experiment with AI—starting now. “Generative AI will transform jobs, help us process data faster and enhance tasks,” assures Hackl. “The question is, ‘Why not start experimenting now?’ Why wait if you can use generative AI to create engaging content and personalized customer experiences faster?’”

Perhaps nobody has put the AI call-to-action better than Max Penk, creative innovation director at David+Martin, who recently said: “The good news is that AI won’t replace you. The bad news is that a person using AI probably will.”
So where to start? Hackl suggests focusing in on these top generative AI benefits for brands and their communications teams:

Hyper-personalization: Increased targeting can lead to more engagement with audiences and translate to more conversions.
Greater customer choice: Improved customization can help organizations reach their audiences in new ways.
Increased innovation: Predictive modeling and analytics can help teams identity patterns and find fresh ways to interact with their communities.
Augmented creativity: Using generative AI tools for inspiration can help improve ideation, especially when a team is stuck in the creative process.


Familiarize yourself with these tools. “It can be tough to find the best AI tool for your needs, because there are so many out there,” says Hackl.  “The good news is that a lot of them have free versions.”

Here are the AI tools she believes will benefit marketers and communicators:

Chat GPT: A text generative AI tool that uses OpenAI to answer questions, write code, write poetry and posts, create summaries and outlines, etc. Upgraded via its GPT-4 release to include image processing and more.
Midjourney: An image generative AI tool. Based on a text prompt, MidJourney will create a set of images. Marketers use this tool to create graphics for blogs or prototype images for design teams.
DALL-E: Another generative AI tool based on OpenAI. It creates images based on a natural text description. Marketers can also use Dall-E to edit images that already exist.
Stable Diffusion: A latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input.
D-ID: A video generative AI tool. Marketers can create video avatars with natural language.
Hypewrite: An AI-generated document editor and browser extension can help you write better content faster.
Artifact: From the founder of Instagram, this new app offers a personalized news feed powered by artificial intelligence.

“It’s hard to keep up, since new generative AI tools are introduced every day,” Hackl concedes. “My advice is to not get overwhelmed by the volume of tools and focus instead on finding those that will enhance your current role.”

Know the risks—and check with legal. Hackl doesn’t believe AI poises an immediate threat to brands. She does, however, recommend having a plan in place to prevent copyright infringement and protect intellectual property rights.

“Also be aware that some of the data used train some of these models can be highly biased,” she warns. “Generative AI is a powerful tool and could bring forth success when used responsibly. It’ll be up to everyone using the tools to weigh out the cost and benefits of adding them to their marketing strategy.”
Hackl’s parting advice: “Engage with your legal teams and find out what your brand’s positioning is when it comes to content created and co-created with AI.”

In a few short months, generative AI has become a very hot topic. Looking beyond the hype, generative AI is a groundbreaking technology, enabling novel capabilities as it moves rapidly into the enterprise world. 
According to a CRM survey, 67% of IT leaders are prioritizing generative AI for their business within the next year and a half—despite looming concerns about generative AI ethics and responsibility. And 80% of those who think generative AI is “overhyped” still believe the technology will improve customer support, reduce workloads and boost organizational efficiencies.
In the enterprise world, generative AI has arrived (discussed in my previous CIO.com article about enterprises putting generative AI to work here).
Preserving trust
As enterprises race to adopt generative AI and begin to realize its benefits, there is a simultaneous mandate in play. Organizations must proactively mitigate generative AI’s inherent risks, in areas such as ethics, bias, transparency, privacy and regulatory requirements.
Fostering a responsible approach to generative AI implementations enables organizations to preserve trust with customers, employees and stakeholders. Trust is the currency of business. Without it, brands can be damaged as revenues wane and employees leave. And once breached, trust is difficult to regain. 
That’s why preserving trust—before it is broken—is so essential. Here are ways to proactively preserve trust in generative AI implementations.
Mitigating bias and unfairness
Achieving fairness and mitigating bias are essential aspects of responsible AI deployment. Bias can be unintentionally introduced from the AI training data, algorithm and use case. Picture a global retail company using generative AI to personalize promotional offers for customers. The retailer must prevent biased outcomes like offering discounts to specific demographic groups only. 
To do that, the retailer must create diverse and representative data sets, employing advanced techniques for bias detection and mitigation and adopting inclusive design practices. Ongoing, the continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI systems will ensure fairness is maintained throughout their lifecycle.
Establishing transparency and explainability
In addition to mitigating bias and unfairness, transparency and explainability in AI models are vital for establishing trust and ensuring accountability. Consider an insurance company using generative AI to forecast claim amounts for its policyholders. When the policyholders receive the claim amounts, the insurer needs to be able to explain the reasoning behind how they were estimated, making transparency and explainability fundamental.
Due to the complex nature of AI algorithms, achieving explainability, while essential, can be challenging. 
However, organizations can invest in explainable AI techniques (e.g., data visualization or decision tree), provide thorough documentation and foster a culture of open communication about the AI decision-making processes. 
These efforts help demystify the inner workings of AI systems and promote a more responsible, transparent approach to AI deployment.
Safeguarding privacy
Privacy is another key consideration for responsible AI implementation. Imagine a healthcare organization leveraging generative AI to predict patient outcomes based on electronic health records. Protecting the privacy of individuals is a must-have, top priority. Generative AI can inadvertently reveal sensitive information or generate synthetic data resembling real individuals. 
To address privacy concerns, businesses can implement best practices like data anonymization, encryption and privacy-preserving AI techniques, such as differential privacy. Concurrently, organizations must remain compliant with data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Complying with regulatory requirements
Finally, the evolving regulatory landscape for AI technologies demands a robust governance framework that guides ethical and responsible AI deployment. 
Organizations can refer to resources like the European Union’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) AI Principles to help define AI policies and principles. Establishing cross-functional AI ethics committees and developing processes for monitoring and auditing AI systems help organizations stay ahead of regulatory changes. By adapting to changes in regulations and proactively addressing potential risks, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI practices. 
Responsible AI deployment
At Dell Technologies, we have articulated our ethical AI principles here. We know that responsible AI use plays a crucial role in an enterprise’s successful adoption of generative AI. To realize the extraordinary potential of generative AI, organizations must continuously improve and adapt their practices and address evolving ethical challenges like bias, fairness, explainability, transparency, privacy preservation and governance.

A Generative AI Upped Worker Productivity and Satisfaction—and the Lowest-Skilled Benefited Most



By Vanessa Bates Ramirez
April 26, 2023 







Since OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT last November, the buzz around generative AI has been steadily ramping up. Some are excited about its potential to transform the way we work, create, and live, while others are wary of the dangers it poses and the nefarious ways it can be used. We know that programs like Midjourney, DALL-E, and GPT-4 are enabling millions of people to generate images and text, but not many studies have dug into the impact these tools are having, be it positive or negative.
One such study was released this month. Titled “Generative AI at Work,” the paper, by teams from Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the first times researchers take a microscope to the way generative AI is actually affecting peoples’ jobs. The team looked at how employees of a Fortune 500 company were impacted by generative AI when they started using it as part of their day-to-day work.
Tell Me What to Say
The study followed 5,179 customer service agents at a large software firm (whose name wasn’t disclosed) over the course of a year. The employees, mostly based in the Philippines, were split into two groups; one was given access to an AI whose help they could choose to integrate into their work, while the other continued as usual.
The AI was trained on data from over 5,000 successful customer service interactions, likely in the form of recordings of high-performing employees having conversations with customers and resolving their issues. The AI then monitored customer interactions in real time and gave agents suggestions of what to say. The employees could choose to use the suggestions word for word, dismiss them altogether, or use a tweaked version.
The researchers looked at how long it took for agents to solve customers’ issues and how successfully they did so. The results? Good things all around.
For one, the AI enabled customer service agents to get through calls more quickly, resolve more customer complaints successfully, and even handle multiple customer calls at once. The agents using the AI resolved 13.8 percent more issues per hour than they’d been able to without the AI.
And that’s not all. Since the AI’s suggestions skewed towards helping agents be patient and empathetic with frustrated customers, the customers treated the agents better, losing their tempers and raising their voices less (it’s not pretty, but let’s be honest, we’ve all been there). As a result, the agents were happier and more satisfied with their work.
Closing the Skills Gap?
Perhaps not surprisingly, the AI was the most helpful for the least-skilled workers and those who had been with the company for the shortest time. Meanwhile, the highest-skilled and most experienced agents didn’t benefit much from using the AI. This makes sense, since the tool was trained on conversations from these workers; they already know what they’re doing.
“High-skilled workers may have less to gain from AI assistance precisely because AI recommendations capture the knowledge embodied in their own behaviors,” said study author Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab.
The AI enabled employees with only two months of experience to perform as well as those who’d been in their roles for six months. That’s some serious skill acceleration. But is it “cheating”? Are the employees using the AI skipping over valuable first-hand training, missing out on learning by doing? Would their skills grind to a halt if the AI were taken away, since they’ve been repeating its suggestions rather than thinking through responses on their own?
It’s possible that an over-reliance on the tool could be detrimental to employees’ ability to build up and retain skills. But ideally they are learning by doing, just in a faster way, since they’re skipping over the drudgery of many unpleasant interactions with angry customers.
Where does this leave high-skilled employees, though? If their work is being used to train AIs that then freely give their skills to inexperienced employees, that could create issues around fairness and compensation. If you’ve been honing your soothing one-liners for years then a newbie comes in saying all the same things by month two on the job, you’re not going to be thrilled—especially if you’re not getting paid a lot more than the newbie.
Generating More Than Words
Finally, since the AI was essentially training newer employees, their managers didn’t need to spend as much time training them—and more of their time was thus freed up. That means managers could take on bigger teams, which means the company could ultimately hire more employees (if it’s selling enough of its products) and do more business. It seems this particular “generative AI” generated a lot more than just conversation suggestions: it generated employee satisfaction, skill acquisition, and free time.
Will the same hold true for other scenarios where these tools are implemented? Could be, but they should be introduced with caution and oversight nonetheless, as there are likely many secondary effects generative AI could have on a workplace that wouldn’t become apparent right away, and may not be wholly positive.
“We need far more research here,” said Brynjolfsson. “The impact of AI on productivity may vary over time, and adding these tools to the office could require complementary organizational investments, skills development, and business process redesign. And AI systems may impact worker and customer satisfaction, attrition, and patterns of behavior. There’s so much we don’t know.”

7 generative AI challenges that businesses should consider


The promise of revolutionary, content-generating AI models has a flip side: the perils of misuse, algorithmic bias, technical complexity and workforce restructuring.

Published: 27 Apr 2023


 
The mainstreaming of generative AI offers here-and-now-capabilities, the promise of future advances -- and more than a few pitfalls.
This form of artificial intelligence technology hit its stride in 2022 with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Dall-E 2. Those tools, and successors such as Google's Bard, make high-quality, AI-generated content an everyday reality. Each of those products is built on a language model, a type of machine learning model honed on massive amounts of training data.







Users can now tap AI models for a range of content creation chores: Text, image, video, audio and synthetic data are all in the mix. But the potential benefits of the technology come at some cost. Here are seven generative AI challenges business leaders should take into account.

1. Handling technical complexity
Generative AI models may contain billions or even trillions of parameters, making them a complex undertaking for the typical business.
""These models are impractically large to train for most organizations,"" said Arun Chandrasekaran, vice president, analyst, tech innovation, at Gartner. The necessary compute resources can make this technology expensive and ecologically unfriendly, he said, so most near-term adoption will likely see businesses consuming generative AI through cloud APIs with limited tuning.
The difficulty in creating models leads to another issue: the concentration of power in a few, deep-pocketed entities, Chandrasekaran added.


2. Tackling legacy systems
Incorporating generative AI into older technology environments could raise additional issues for enterprises. IT leaders will face decisions on whether to integrate or replace older systems.

19 of the best large language models in 2024




For example, financial institutions considering how a language model could be used to determine fraud will probably find the emerging technology at odds with how its current systems handle that task, said Pablo Alejo, partner at consultancy West Monroe.
Legacy systems ""have a very specific way of doing that, and now you've got generative AI that's leveraging way different types of thinking,"" Alejo explained. ""Organizations have to find new ways to either create integrations or adopt new capabilities, with new technologies, that enable them to reach the same outputs, or outcomes, faster and more effectively.""



Generative AI technology will engage enterprises across their core aspects.







3. Avoiding technical debt
Generative AI could end up joining legacy systems as technical debt if businesses fail to achieve significant change through its adoption.
An enterprise deploying AI models for customer support might declare an optimization victory on the grounds that human agents will handle fewer cases. But workload reduction isn't going far enough, according to Bill Bragg, CIO at enterprise AI SaaS provider SymphonyAI. A business would need to significantly reduce the number of agents in front-line support roles to justify the investment in AI, he noted.
""If you don't take something away, how have you optimized?"" Bragg said. ""All you've done is add more debt to your processes.""


4. Reshaping some of the workforce
Generative AI will likely restructure how work gets done in many fields, a prospect that raises job-loss concerns. An article on the Chinese video game industry states job opportunities for artists are vanishing as companies employ AI-based image generators.



If you don't have a team working on how to understand [generative AI's] capability and take advantage of it, you are risking obsolescence.


Pablo AlejoPartner at West Monroe




But some executives suggest it's not all doom and gloom. AI might reduce the number of agents in the customer support example, but the technology would also create other roles, Bragg said. A business would need staff to oversee and improve the AI-assisted customer experience, he reasoned. Employees who once fielded customer questions on slow laptops would instead drive the next data and technical improvements. Bragg referred to this transition as ""going from the doer to the trainer.""
Similarly, Alejo said generative AI will remove some types of jobs but also ""open up brand new types of jobs that those same people can take advantage of.""


5. Monitoring for potential misuse and AI hallucinations
AI models lower the cost of content creation. That helps businesses but also helps threat actors who can more easily modify existing content to create deep fakes. Digitally altered media can closely mimic the original and be hyperpersonalized. ""This includes everything from voice and video impersonation to fake art, as well as targeted attacks,"" Chandrasekaran said.
While threat actors are able to misuse generative AI systems, the models themselves can lead users astray: AI hallucinations provide misinformation and make up ""facts."" Hallucination rates, depending on the domain, could be 10% to 20% of the AI tools' responses, Chandrasekaran added.





6. Keeping tabs on legal concerns and algorithmic bias
The emerging technology can also bump into intellectual property issues, exposing businesses to legal action. ""Generative AI models have the added risk of seeking training data at massive scale, without considering the creator's approval, which could lead to copyright issues,"" Chandrasekaran said.
Algorithmic bias is another source of legal risk. Generative AI models, when trained on faulty, incomplete or unrepresentative data, will produce results that are systemically prejudiced. Unchecked, AI bias spreads through the systems and influences decision-makers relying on the results, potentially leading to discrimination.
Flawed AI models ""can propagate downstream bias in the data sets, and the homogenization of such models can lead to a single point of failure,"" Chandrasekaran said.


7. Providing coordination and oversight
Newer technologies often compel organizations to launch centers of excellence (CoE) to focus on effective adoption and rollout. Such centers could play an important role in generative AI.
""If you don't have a team working on how to understand this capability and take advantage of it, you are risking obsolescence,"" Alejo warned. ""Centers of excellence should be existing across every industry, across every organization.""
Such a specialized group can also craft policies for governing the acceptable use of generative AI. ""The CoE,"" Alejo advised, ""should lead policy design and decisions for how different individuals across an organization can use it."" The center, he added, should enlist the review and input of key stakeholders, including legal, IT, risk and, potentially, other departments such as marketing, HR and R&D.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



“AI is already transforming business, and generative AI has not only captured the world’s attention, but it also represents an important tipping point in bringing this powerful technology to everyone,” Joe Atkinson, chief products and technology officer at PwC, told VentureBeat. “We believe that AI, used in a responsible and trusted way, will revolutionize how we all live and work. This is why we decided to invest $1 billion over the next three years to expand and scale our artificial intelligence offerings.”
The investment will enhance the company’s internal platforms, incorporating an all-new generative AI environment that will streamline the firm’s tax, audit and consulting services.
Just last month, PwC’s global legal practice announced that it is embracing the OpenAI-based Harvey application, which helps automate and enhance various aspects of legal and tax work for clients. 
PwC has already hit the ground running, implementing advanced capabilities within Azure OpenAI Service for clients across an array of industries, from insurance to aviation, healthcare and beyond. 
Recently, the company built a custom generative language model for a pharmaceutical company that automated its drafting of safety narratives and claims that this solution resulted in over 50% savings in end-to-end processing time, enabling clinicians to focus on higher-value work.
“We are excited that PwC will utilize Azure OpenAI Service to transform the way they work, and to deliver innovative customer solutions that take advantage of the world’s most advanced AI models, backed by Azure’s trusted enterprise-grade capabilities and AI-optimized infrastructure,” said Eric Boyd, corporate vice president, AI platform at Microsoft, in a written statement. “Our collaboration with PwC and OpenAI will be a game-changer that opens the floodgates for businesses to experience generative AI applications in a safe and secure manner.”
The ambitious plan also includes a major upskilling program for PwC’s 65,000 employees, allowing them to leverage the full potential of AI tools and capabilities through the company’s proprietary My+ program.
PwC’s generative AI focus
PwC’s Atkinson said that the company is proactively working with Microsoft to implement Microsoft 365’s generative AI capabilities as they become available. 
“We believe generative AI has the potential to transform virtually every aspect of how work gets done,” Atkinson told VentureBeat. “We are building AI for ourselves and clients in a secure, enterprise environment on Azure OpenAI, and we are leveraging our responsible AI framework to ensure that we do this with sufficient focus on bias, ethical use and data privacy and to adapt to changing regulations.” advertisement
The company is now taking a bold leap forward, using generative AI to revolutionize how it serves clients. It claims that the technology is already yielding impressive results, saving time and costs while accelerating revenue growth for its clients. 
“We recently applied AI to an auto insurer’s claim estimation process and helped them realize 29% efficiency savings,” Atkinson explained. “We have also worked with a Fortune 500 telecom company to develop end-to-end data and analytic modeling to improve their tech support call center experience. Our work yielded an estimated Year 1 saving of $18 million with 2% revenue acceleration for the client.”
Talking about the upskilling program, he said that nurturing its talent through AI is integral to PwC’s current vision, and the company recognizes that the best way to ensure that its teams continue to deliver exceptional work is by equipping them with cutting-edge technology and expertise. advertisement
“Providing our team with a better understanding of AI, its continued evolution, and how it can be applied in trusted and responsible ways will be key to helping solve our clients’ most complex problems while at the same time helping our people grow professionally throughout their career,” Atkinson said.  
Streamlining business workflows through responsible AI 
While AI presents immense opportunities, it is also fraught with risks, and proper governance is crucial in mitigating these risks. PwC believes that tapping into the power of AI technology — in a responsible and trusted way — will be a key challenge for businesses across every sector and geography.  
New data from the company’s latest Trust Survey paints a fascinating picture of the current state of affairs in the tech world. The survey reveals that almost every business leader is investing in AI-related initiatives and systems in the short term, signaling a clear trend toward the integration of AI in various industries.
However, upon closer examination of the report it becomes evident that a mere 35% of executives have intentions to prioritize the improvement of governance for AI systems and reporting on AI model performance.
“Across the portfolio of services we provide our clients, we believe AI holds the power to create greater efficiency, to improve quality, and to unlock our people’s capacity, freeing them from more routine tasks and allowing them to focus on creating the value and trust our clients and stakeholders expect,” Atkinson said. “Helping our clients understand and apply this technology — not just with point solutions, but at enterprise scale — will help create competitive differentiation for organizations and help them manage their businesses more efficiently.”
In 2019, the company made waves with the launch of its Responsible AI toolkit, offering clients a customizable suite of resources to help them adopt ethical and responsible AI practices. PwC’s framework for responsible AI is centered around promoting governance and accountability for clients as they develop and deploy OpenAI’s cutting-edge generative AI technology for various use cases.
“Responsible AI at its core is good data science, governed by key guiding principles from strategy to execution,” he said. “Our Responsible AI (RAI) team helps clients build AI their stakeholders can trust from wherever they are on their AI journey.”
He emphasized that It is essential for every organization to align on an ethical AI framework and create a responsible-use policy. 
“Transparency and trust are critical to the application of any technology, but it is particularly true with AI,” he said. “The guardrails should extend beyond good intentions and policy statements — they must align on practices and actions that serve the organization and their constituents, not only in their current state, but as the technology continues to evolve.”
An AI-driven future
Atkinson believes that over the longer term, every industry will be transformed by the continued advances in AI.
“Every company will face decisions on how quickly to embrace and adopt these technologies, and they’ll face the challenges of doing that responsibly. PwC is uniquely positioned to help,” he said. 
He believes that empowering professionals to harness the full potential of emerging technologies, such as generative AI, will be the key to driving innovation and achieving organizational goals. 
“While AI will likely impact every role in some way, we believe that with the right skills and tools, the advance of these powerful technologies will create more opportunities not just for companies, but for their people,” he said. ”By unlocking the capacity of these technologies, professionals across all roles can perform their duties more effectively, paving the way for continued growth and career advancement.”

Generative AI has become the proverbial monkey wrench in the technology plans for executives who look to keep their organizations on the cutting edge. With tech companies offering full automation of various accounting processes, banking as a service (BaaS) to vendors and their customers, and even unprecedented cybersecurity initiatives, technology’s role within corporate finance becomes even more ambiguous with the emergence of technologies like ChatGPT. The value of the human element is in question now more than ever before, leading CFOs to inquire what types of benefits this type of technology can bring to their business.



















Most leaders are still learning the basics of generative AI technology. Even Google’s CEO said no one fully understands how ChatGPT works. Despite this, the notion is clear — executives want generative technology in their businesses, or at least don’t want to be the only ones without it. Whether it’s a legitimate interest in the technology or fear of missing out (FOMO), new data from a KPMG survey of 300 global executives say that nearly two-thirds (65%) of executives say this type of technology will have a high impact on their company in 3-5 years. Balancing Technology and Risk ManagementTechnology’s role, like any business investment, must be evaluated in part by the risks it brings with it. While nearly three-quarters (72%) of executives believe generative AI can play a critical role in building and maintaining stakeholder trust, nearly half (45%) say it can have a negative impact on their organization’s trust should commensurate risk management tools not be implemented. “Generative AI, like many technologies, creates great opportunities for organizations,” said KPMG U.S. trusted imperative leader Emily Frolick. “However, the ease of use and open nature of generative AI amplifies the risk. As organizations are exploring potential use cases, giving attention to the risks or exposures associated with generative AI should be equally prioritized.” Generative AI, like many technologies, creates great opportunities for organizations ... However, the ease of use and open nature of generative AI amplifies the risk. — Emily Frolick, KPMGThe risks associated with this type of technology can be extensive. Such risks include unpredictability in implementation, potential cybersecurity breach exposure, and company morale around those who are worried about generative AI’s impact on their roles and overall job security. CFOs, much like the employees who will be using generative AI, must learn how this type of technology can improve their skills, not replace them.

Development of AI GovernanceAI Governance — a set of rules, regulations, and ethical considerations that guide the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems — is being incorporated at an extremely low level. Many executives don’t have a plan to attempt to control its use in their workflows.According to KPMG, only 5% of executives say their companies have an AI governance protocol in place. While nearly half (49%) say they have plans to develop these guidelines, they have yet to do so. Executives who are looking to implement may want to create an oversight committee to manage AI’s use within the early stages. These initiatives may come with time, data suggests. According to the KPMG, more than a quarter (27%) say they do not currently see a need or have not reached enough scale that would call for the development of a responsible AI governance program.  Social Interactions at Work May FadeWhile workforces that adapt this type of technology will hybridize the human and AI elements together in some roles, executives are aware of the various impacts — some positive, some negative — it will have outside of the workflows it is attempting to improve.  According to surveyors, executives are most optimistic about the opportunities generative technology will have on how work is completed. The majority said it will increase productivity (72%) while two-thirds (66%) said it will change the way people work. Over six in 10 (62%) also said these technologies will encourage innovation in their workforce. The unclear aspects are the areas in which ChatGPT has a small direct impact. Almost four in 10 executives (39%) believe generative AI could lead to decreased social interactions and human connections between employees. With companies trying hard to get their employees to want to return to the office and have fun at work, generative AI may alienate some staff, countering the cultural effort.

Although many of the benefits that companies already provide go unused, leaders are still cognizant of the impact generative chatbots can have on an employee’s mental health. Whether it’s job security, feeling unimportant, questioning their career decisions, or more, nearly a third (32%) of executives reported a concern that they will see increased mental health issues among their workforce.

Study: Generative AI boosts productivity, retention


A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generative AI boosts productivity by 14%, reduces stress and increases employee retention in customer support roles.

Published: 26 Apr 2023


 
A study of a generative AI system used by 5,000 customer support agents found that those workers experienced an increase in productivity and retention, and a reduction in stress. But the workers who gained the most from this automation were newer and less experienced. 







Customer service work is aptly suited for generative AI, according to this just-released study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit research group based in Cambridge, Mass. 
Customer support is a stressful job. ""A key part of agents' jobs is to absorb customer frustrations while restraining one's own emotional reaction,"" the paper noted. But generative AI can act as an aide, using the customer's chats as input and providing suggestions for empathetic responses and problem solving in real time. The study found that the use of generative AI reduced the likelihood of customers wanting to escalate issues to a supervisor. 
The research paper's authors are Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the Stanford University Digital Economy Lab; Danielle Li, an associate professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management; and Lindsey Raymond, a Ph.D. candidate at MIT Sloan. 
The company that allowed researchers to study the effects of generative AI on its contact center wasn't identified, other than as a Fortune 500 that provides business process software. Customer service work generally includes everything from product support to answering employee HR questions. 



It's too soon to start making conclusions about where this will have an impact and how big that impact will be.


David CreelmanCEO, Creelman Research




The increase in productivity -- nearly 14% -- wasn't surprising to industry analysts, but it also has limits. 
David Creelman, CEO of Creelman Research in Toronto, cautioned against putting too much weight on one study. ""It's too soon to start making conclusions about where this will have an impact and how big that impact will be,"" he said.
""But it does seem reasonable to expect that it'll be easier to get these new technologies to do an average job than it will be to get them to do an excellent job,"" he added. ""This means that new or lower-performing employees who are doing an average or below-average job are more at risk than those who are doing an excellent job.""
He compared generative AI to a grammar checker, which helps someone avoid errors, ""but it won't make you a great writer. ""
The study also stated, ""the AI tool we study is meant to augment -- rather than replace -- human agents."" 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects customer service representatives to decline by 4% through 2031 because of automation. 
Ian Jacobs, a research director at Forrester Research, said the consultancy expects generative AI to increase customer team productivity. But the technology is ""not yet automating away most human-to-human interactions,"" he said, pointing to its accuracy problem. 
""The biggest boon for productivity from generative AI today comes from augmenting the humans who actually serve customers,"" Jacobs said. ""Agent augmentation is the name of the game right now.""
He said generative AI can summarize a body of text effectively, saving agents time and letting them move on to their next calls. 
Ben Eubanks, chief research officer at Lighthouse Research & Advisory, said he believes generative AI ""will make HR better and faster, just like chatbots have done.""
Generative AI plus humans can help with tier-one support requests, which are routine, common and straightforward. He said the more complex tier-two requests, which are specialized, unique and unexpected, will need to be addressed by HR professionals.

AI technology can take the place of routine or mundane processes, leading to new and possibly more enriching career paths. Cognizant, a leading global consulting firm, reported that a 2022 Economist Impact Survey of 2000 senior executives found the most business-critical priorities companies face require enhanced technology and intelligence to achieve. These priorities included “digital first business model, data-driven operations and mindset, automated and effective end-to-end business processes.”New job functions, responsibilities and titles are being created at an unprecedented pace because of the impact of AI, machine learning and other technology. The best way to take advantage of these future options is to build an understanding and comfort with how AI and other technology intersect with current business processes. There will be roles for engineers to build the AI, but there will also be many roles on how to manage, improve and use the results of the technology. For example, you do not need to know how a calculator or a spreadsheet works to be able to use its calculations to improve accuracy and speed for a report.See: The Best Jobs in America in 2024Augmentation of Your Abilities Technology makes up for areas we lack. Most of us use tools like search engines (Google or Siri) to make our research efforts more effective. Modern AI will only increase the ways technology can augment our abilities. For example, if you have writer’s block or struggle with how to frame a topic you need to write about, an AI like ChatGPT can help you get started. Provided it has been given good information, AI tools synthesize exponentially more information than most of us can imagine before providing recommendations. You still need to review and customize the suggestions for relevance, accuracy, plagiarism, specificity, incorporating your viewpoint, etc. Humans are needed to review and apply the results. The tools improve performance in areas that are not natural strengths.READ: 10 Best-Paying Tech JobsMinimize Redundant or Less Interesting Work Similar to the calculator example – where humans can make calculations, but it is accepted that a calculator does it faster and more accurately – AI tools reduce or improve the outcomes of repeatable processes or tasks.For example, DALL·E 2, another AI tool, creates “original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles,” according to its website. The benefits of it include the visual expression of what users are thinking – i.e., it can bring a unique or novel idea to life visually. Previously, if you were not an artist or a graphic designer, your options to create a visual representation would require partnership with an artist to create your idea. But now, the tool is accessible to anyone who has a computer and it's not limited to those who have an artist on staff.“As artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT become more powerful and widely available, they will likely affect labor market outcomes. Depending on the roles and industries, we can expect algorithms to either complement workers’ competencies and increase their productivity or reduce the employability of humans altogether,” notes the Brookings Institution.

Roles that include manual processes that can be easily automated will be at risk (and have been for a while now). For example, if you work at a bank and your primary role is taking deposits, digital banking will continue to decrease the number of tellers needed. However, if you are responsible for relationship management with customers, product and service recommendations for their unique banking needs, and resolving problems that are not typical, your role will only get better with automation, which can send reminders to contact people, include customized product recommendations and more. With the recent advancements in writing and visual representation brought about by ChatGPT and DALL·E 2, roles that involve research, writing summaries or templates, or creating visual designs will decline. But roles that require insights and interpretation after reviewing research summaries or weaving visual ideas together to make a campaign or create a persuasive presentation, will increase. Engineers will continue to flourish, but so will the roles that incorporate, interpret, analyze and customize the output of AI technology.The future of work has ample opportunity, provided workers embrace a growth mindset toward where technology can take us. A key to building a lasting career continues to be a balance between performing well in the roles that are available with an eye toward incorporating future trends and innovations. Those that embrace the forward momentum of technology will continue to be in demand.Careers With the Most Job SecurityView All 23 SlidesTags: careers, personal finance, money, Applying, technologyAbout On CareersOur expert contributors give their best advice on answering common interview questions, perfecting job applications, negotiating salary and more.Find savvy job advice from the brains behind top careers blogs and websites, including Robin Madell, Robin Reshwan and Hallie Crawford.RECOMMENDEDCareersHow to Be More Assertive at WorkOn Careers7 Benefits of Working From HomeCareersHow to Quit a Job You Just StartedCareers20 Best Questions to Ask an InterviewerOn CareersWrite a Goodbye Email to Co-Workers",NewsArticle,"Who isn’t a fan of learning?

But now, the tool is accessible to anyone who has a computer and it's not limited to those who have an artist on staff.“As artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT become more powerful and widely available, they will likely affect labor market outcomes. Depending on the roles and industries, we can expect algorithms to either complement workers’ competencies and increase their productivity or reduce the employability of humans altogether,” notes the Brookings Institution. Roles that include manual processes that can be easily automated will be at risk (and have been for a while now). For example, if you work at a bank and your primary role is taking deposits, digital banking will continue to decrease the number of tellers needed. However, if you are responsible for relationship management with customers, product and service recommendations for their unique banking needs, and resolving problems that are not typical, your role will only get better with automation, which can send reminders to contact people, include customized product recommendations and more. With the recent advancements in writing and visual representation brought about by ChatGPT and DALL·E 2, roles that involve research, writing summaries or templates, or creating visual designs will decline. But roles that require insights and interpretation after reviewing research summaries or weaving visual ideas together to make a campaign or create a persuasive presentation, will increase. Engineers will continue to flourish, but so will the roles that incorporate, interpret, analyze and customize the output of AI technology.The future of work has ample opportunity, provided workers embrace a growth mindset toward where technology can take us. A key to building a lasting career continues to be a balance between performing well in the roles that are available with an eye toward incorporating future trends and innovations. Those that embrace the forward momentum of technology will continue to be in demand.",,,"[{'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/1b6edd4/2147483647/crop/3274x3274+0+0/resize/300x300/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F5e%2F97%2Ff7f6573d481e860a037aee784f4f%2Frobin-reshwan.jpg', '@type': 'Person', 'jobTitle': 'Contributor', 'name': 'Robin Reshwan', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/robin-reshwan'}, {'@type': 'Person', 'jobTitle': 'Staff Writer', 'name': 'Jennifer Ortiz', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/jennifer-ortiz'}]",2023-04-28T16:29-0400,2023-04-28T15:58-0400,How AI Tools Impact Careers and the Future of Work,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '970', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/6fe572c/2147483647/crop/2119x1413+0+0/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F99%2F66%2F1640c435472d85f665b8950d7686%2Fgettyimages-1358579974.jpg', 'height': '647'}",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/803965d/2147483647/crop/1885x1414+0+0/resize/80x60/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F99%2F66%2F1640c435472d85f665b8950d7686%2Fgettyimages-1358579974.jpg,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'name': 'AI and the Future of Work', '@id': 'https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/ai-and-the-future-of-work', 'url': 'https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/ai-and-the-future-of-work'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'U.S. News & World Report', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 193, 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/static/images/usn-logo-print.png', 'height': 46}}",,,,,2023-04-28T15:58-0400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1031.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New job applicants who were randomly assigned algorithmic assistance with their resumes — that is, received help from an interface that offered suggestions to improve spelling and grammar — were 8% more likely to be hired, according to an experiment conducted by MIT Sloan PhD student Emma van Inwegen and co-researchers.

“If you take two identical workers with the same skills and background, the one with the better-written resume is more likely to get hired,” van Inwegen said. “The takeaway is that employers actually care about the writing in the resume — it’s not just a correlation.” That means that AI assistance can be a useful tool for those hoping to get hired, she said.
The results were summarized in a working paper titled “Algorithmic Writing Assistance on Jobseekers’ Resumes Increases Hires,” which was co-authored by MIT Sloan PhD student Zanele Munyikwa and MIT Sloan professor John J. Horton.
More offers and higher wages
To examine how the quality of writing on a resume affects hiring, the researchers studied new users participating in a global online labor market for contract work.
The researchers studied 480,948 job seekers who first signed on to the marketplace between June 8 and July 14, 2021. In order of frequency, applicants’ primary job categories were design and creative, writing, administrative support, and software development.





7.80%


Share
























Job seekers who had algorithmic assistance in writing their resume received 7.8% more job offers than those with no help. 
While 14% of the job seekers were based in the U.S., more than 80% lived in a country where English is not the native language, including India and Bangladesh. The labor market’s primary language is English.
The researchers intercepted job seekers at the resume-writing stage of the sign-up process and randomly offered half of them algorithmic writing assistance; the other half filled in the resume section of the site without assistance.
Applicants in the treatment group were presented with a tool that offered suggestions for fixing spelling and grammatical errors and gave advice on punctuation, word usage, phrase overuse, tone, and style.
Van Inwegen and her co-authors found that job applicants who had algorithmic assistance received 7.8% more job offers and were more likely to be hired in their first month on the platform than the unassisted control group.
And those with assistance earned wages that were 8.4% higher than the control group’s, making $18.62 per hour on average versus $17.17 per hour for those who had received no resume help.
Errors that turn employers off 
The researchers also explored the types of resume writing errors that are most likely to harm applicants’ chances.
Spelling, which the authors called “the most unambiguous measure of writing quality,” topped the list.
Job seekers with more than 99% of the words in their resume spelled correctly were hired nearly three times more in their first month on the platform than those with fewer than 90% spelled correctly. Applicants with fewer than 90% of the words in their resume spelled correctly had only a 3% chance of getting hired in their first month.





3%


Share
























Applicants with fewer than 90% of the words in their resume spelled correctly had only a 3% chance of getting hired in their first month. 
Job seekers whose resumes included commonly confused words and errors in capitalization, grammar, and typography were also less likely to receive job offers.
But when it came to style errors, specifically “flowery language” — for example, “I will give a task my 100% focus and attention and will only be satisfied once the implementation of the project is finished to your standards or higher” — employers were more forgiving. In fact, they actually preferred this type of language and tended to hire job seekers who used it.
“This implies that despite employers’ dislike of most writing errors, they forgive or even prefer this kind of flowery language,” the researchers write.
Controlling for quality 
Concerned that candidates with newly improved resumes may change their job-search behavior and skew the results of the study, the researchers compared the job-search strategies of the assisted group with the nonassisted control group.
“We find no evidence that job seekers changed their search behavior due to the treatment,” they write in their paper. “Treated workers did not send out more applications than workers in the control group, nor did they propose higher wages.
And knowing that employers often use resume writing as a “signaling tool” for the quality of a worker’s overall abilities, van Inwegen and her co-authors were curious to see whether employers ended up feeling less satisfied with the quality of the work performed by people whose resumes were burnished by algorithmic assistance.
The researchers found no evidence that employers were less satisfied with the assisted workers’ services, based on post-work employer ratings or reviews and ongoing demand for their work on the online market.
AI throughout the hiring process
For job seekers, the message is clear: It’s worth taking the extra time to eliminate spelling and grammatical errors and present a higher-quality resume. Algorithmic writing assistance may be a more affordable option than hiring a writer to help, said van Inwegen. “It scales cheaply, and it’s available to the masses,” she said.
Writing help from an algorithm can be especially useful for non-native English speakers applying for jobs, according to the researchers. For example, it could help a skilled coder who lives in Bangladesh and struggles with English spelling and grammar.

“This type of intervention has the potential to level the playing field for applicants who otherwise may not be able to present themselves as well to English-speaking employers,” van Inwegen said.
Employers, too, could benefit; clearer writing would allow them to better identify applicants’ skills, leading a wider pool of qualified applicants from which to hire. “We argue that better writing makes it easier for employers to decide to hire a particular worker,” the researchers write.
Companies could also use algorithmic writing assistance themselves to improve the hiring process. For instance, they could put AI to work writing job descriptions or generating interview questions.
“Employers could use it throughout the hiring process,” van Inwegen said, “and that could potentially make them a more attractive employer.” It’s an area for future research, she added.

LSTMs are long short-term memory networks that use (ANN) artificial neural networks in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. In contrast to normal feed-forward neural networks, also known as recurrent neural networks, these networks feature feedback connections. Unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, robot control, video gaming, speech recognition, machine translation, and healthcare are all applications of LSTM.
What is LSTM?
LSTMs Long Short-Term Memory is a type of RNNs Recurrent Neural Network that can detain long-term dependencies in sequential data. LSTMs are able to process and analyze sequential data, such as time series, text, and speech. They use a memory cell and gates to control the flow of information, allowing them to selectively retain or discard information as needed and thus avoid the vanishing gradient problem that plagues traditional RNNs. LSTMs are widely used in various applications such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.

What is RNN?
RNNs Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that are designed to process sequential data. They can analyze data with a temporal dimension, such as time series, speech, and text. RNNs can do this by using a hidden state passed from one timestep to the next. The hidden state is updated at each timestep based on the input and the previous hidden state. RNNs are able to capture short-term dependencies in sequential data, but they struggle with capturing long-term dependencies.
Types of Gates in LSTM
There are three types of gates in an LSTM: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. 
The input gate controls the flow of information into the memory cell. The forget gate controls the flow of information out of the memory cell. The output gate controls the flow of information out of the LSTM and into the output.
Three gates input gate, forget gate, and output gate are all implemented using sigmoid functions, which produce an output between 0 and 1. These gates are trained using a backpropagation algorithm through the network.
The input gate decides which information to store in the memory cell. It is trained to open when the input is important and close when it is not.
The forget gate decides which information to discard from the memory cell. It is trained to open when the information is no longer important and close when it is. 
The output gate is responsible for deciding which information to use for the output of the LSTM. It is trained to open when the information is important and close when it is not.
The gates in an LSTM are trained to open and close based on the input and the previous hidden state. This allows the LSTM to selectively retain or discard information, making it more effective at capturing long-term dependencies.
Structure of LSTM
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is a type of RNN recurrent neural network that is capable of handling and processing sequential data. The structure of an LSTM network consists of a series of LSTM cells, each of which has a set of gates (input, output, and forget gates) that control the flow of information into and out of the cell. The gates are used to selectively forget or retain information from the previous time steps, allowing the LSTM to maintain long-term dependencies in the input data.

The LSTM cell also has a memory cell that stores information from previous time steps and uses it to influence the output of the cell at the current time step. The output of each LSTM cell is passed to the next cell in the network, allowing the LSTM to process and analyze sequential data over multiple time steps.
Applications of LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a highly effective Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that has been utilized in various applications. Here are a few well-known LSTM applications:

Language Simulation: Language support vector machines (LSTMs) have been utilized for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and text summarization. By understanding the relationships between words in a sentence, they can be trained to construct meaningful and grammatically correct sentences.
Voice Recognition: LSTMs have been utilized for speech recognition tasks such as speech-to-text-to-text-transcription and command recognition. They may be taught to recognize patterns in speech and match them to the appropriate text.
Sentiment Analysis: LSTMs can be used to classify text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral by learning the relationships between words and their associated sentiments.
Time Series Prediction: LSTMs can be used to predict future values in a time series by learning the relationships between past values and future values.
Video Analysis: LSTMs can be used to analyze video by learning the relationships between frames and their associated actions, objects, and scenes.
Handwriting Recognition: LSTMs can be used to recognize handwriting by learning the relationships between images of handwriting and the corresponding text.

Explainer

 We missed this earlier: Can a person claim copyright over an AI-generated work? That’s the question Dr. Stephen Thaler asked in a recent lawsuit.
Thaler’s Creativity Machine AI—which he created—produced a piece of art called “A Recent Entrance to Paradise”. In 2018, Thaler applied to the United States Copyright Office to claim copyright over the AI-generated work. But, the copyright office repeatedly refused to grant this request—stating that copyright could only apply to “human-made work”. 
“A Recent Entrance to Paradise” | Source.
The suit followed in June 2022. Thaler disagreed, arguing that the agency had misread the purpose of US copyright laws, which would arguably protect AI-generated works. In January 2023, Thaler asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the copyright office’s decision, or allow the AI-generated work to be registered for copyright.
Why it matters: “Allowing copyright on AI-Generated Works encourages the development and use of creative AI which results in the generation of more works, and provides incentives for those works to be disseminated,” Thaler added in his petition. Paying attention to Thaler’s arguments may be necessary, especially with creative AI tools churning out more “original work” that could post legal challenges in the future. 
Thaler had previously moved the United States Supreme Court to overthrow a lower court’s ruling that patents can only be issued to human inventors, and not to the DABUS AI system he’d created. The Court declined to hear the suit last week. 
What did Thaler argue?
The copyright of this “fixed, visual artwork” would have been protected had it been created by traditional human labour: The copyright office’s refusal is based on the idea that the “creations of human authors” alone can be protected by copyright. 
Creativity Machine meets minimum standards for copyright protection: AI can’t create objectively creative or original work, the copyright office added. Thaler rebutted that the bar here is low—the only thing a work requires for copyright protection is for it to be original to an author. Here, original means that the author independently created a work with at least a “minimal” level of creativity. 
On facts alone, the AI system created a piece of art that meets these originality standards, Thaler argues. The artwork’s “origin” is the Creativity Machine system, and it also produced the work, satisfying “the small hurdle required to reach copyrightability”.
Copyright Act isn’t specific that creators should be human: The Copyright Act’s language never explicitly suggests that the author of a work should be a human being. According to Thaler, this means that the entity generating a creative work is its author—an entity could be a person, business, or machine. Just because courts typically refer to creative work in “human-centric terms” doesn’t mean that there’s a legal requirement for it. So, creative works that are uniquely produced by their creators are subject to copyright unless explicitly restricted by a law. 
Outdated precedents can’t be used to inhibit technology: The copyright office wrongly and “grandiosely” uses centuries-old court verdicts to argue that AI can’t be protected by copyright, Thaler argued, wrily adding that some of the cases it cited are from the 19th century which “greatly predate[s] even the invention of the first modern computers”.

Courts themselves realise that technology complicates copyright law: The United States Supreme Court has consistently held that copyright law needs to be balanced against technological advancements, Thaler added. It’s necessary to examine how the copyright law’s purpose can be best achieved with technological innovations—like AI-generated pieces of work. 
Ergo, AI-Generated work is constitutionally “required” to be protected by copyright law: The copyright office’s stance rewrites not just the Copyright Act, but the United States Constitution’s clauses on copyright, Thaler argues. 
What that means: the United States Constitution breathes life into the Copyright Act through its mandate promoting “the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries”. This mandate encourages creating and disseminating work to both the author’s and public’s benefit, argues Thaler citing past verdicts. 
Protecting AI works is in line with this mandate—especially given the court’s repeated reading that copyright stimulates “artistic creativity for the general public good”. Similar interpretations were followed by the United States Congress especially while drafting the Copyright Act during a time of technological transformation, the 1970s: 
The history of copyright law has been one of gradual expansion in the types of works accorded protection, and the subject matter affected by this expansion has fallen into two general categories. In the first, scientific discoveries and technological developments have made possible new forms of creative expression that never existed before. In some of these cases the new expressive forms– electronic music, filmstrips, and computer programs, for example- – could be regarded as an extension of copyrightable subject matter Congress had already intended to protect, and were thus considered copyrightable from the outset without the need of new legislation. In other cases, such as photographs, sound recordings, and motion pictures, statutory enactment was deemed necessary to give them full recognition as copyrightable works [Emphasis added]. — House of Representatives report cited in Thaler’s petition.

The copyright office interprets copyright regressively, unlike the Supreme Court: Thaler added that the Supreme Court has observed in copyright cases in the past that “[w]e must read the statutory language of 60 years ago in the light of drastic technological change.” Both the Court and US Congress have read the Copyright Act to increase the spectrum of copyrightable material under the Copyright Act—the copyright office’s narrow perspective flies in the face of this. 
The Court doesn’t need to “defer” to the copyright office’s stance: The US Supreme Court reviews any agency’s interpretations of law without deference, Thaler explains. So, if a body’s stance lacks “reasoned decisionmaking” it’s not necessarily entitled to being treated as unchallengeable by the Court. Or, as Thaler puts it in the context of the copyright office, “in this instance, relying on gilded age discussions of quasi-metaphysical creative sparks and dicta, in defiance of the agency’s mandate to promote the dissemination and generation of works, is not reasoned decisionmaking”.
Thaler owns Creativity Machine’s copyright under “common law” property principles: Thaler argued that the copyright office incorrectly held that the Creativity Machine’s hypothetical copyright cannot be transferred to him. He cites the “doctrine of increase”—where the output of any work owned by Thaler automatically belongs to him. So, in this case, if Thaler’s AI makes a painting, then Thaler owns that painting too. Or, as the petition illustrates:
For instance, if Dr. Thaler owned a fruit tree, he would own the fruit from that tree. This does not require the tree to execute a written agreement to transfer the fruit, the fruit belongs to Dr. Thaler by virtue of his relationship to the tree.
Thaler has “first possession” rights: Another important concept in common law, this means that “the first person to possess an object is its owner”. In short: finders, keepers. So, Thaler owns the copyright over the painting simply by virtue of being the first person to possess it. “Dr. Thaler possesses the machine, owns the machine, developed the machine, operated the machine, possesses the Work, and possesses every indica of ownership of the Work,” the suit notes. “In its possession he holds more than just the digital copy, but also the rights to the copyright embodied within it as well, certainly as to anyone who could bring a lawsuit to challenge him.”
The AI was ‘working’ for Thaler: Even if the Court agrees with the copyright office’s stance that copyright cannot be owned by AI, Thaler argues that the property initially vests in the party that employed the AI. Created and controlled by Thaler, Creativity Machine only works at Thaler’s command, making it “unquestionable” that he was the “person for whom the work was prepared”. Therefore, within the scope of the Work for Hire doctrine, Creativity Machine was acting as an employee. Ergo, Thaler owns the copyright.

Addressing hundreds of participants at this year’s summit underway in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, Kagame said that transforming Africa means digitizing the continent’s economies. ALSO READ: Kagame in Zimbabwe for Transform Africa Summit “Already many of the new quality jobs being created in Africa are powered by technology and connectivity. That applies even to traditional sectors like Agriculture, mining and retail” Kagame told a packed hall at Elephant Hills Resort, adding that the trend is “only going to speed up.” At the summit, he was also joined by several Heads of State including host President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Lazarus Chakwera of Malawi, His Majesty King Mswati III of the Kingdom of Eswatini, and Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia, among other high-ranked officials. To step up digital transformation on the continent, Kagame said that everyone has to be connected to affordable broadband and also be able to have a smart device. Mobile broadband penetration has been spreading rapidly, but more than 60 percent of Africans who have access don’t use it. We need to also keep reducing costs, Kagame urged participants. ALSO READ: Kagame: Broadband progress should serve as demonstration of possibilities Equally troubling, he said, is that a big piece of the puzzle is digital skill and literacy. “One reason many Africans are not taking full advantage of the internet is that they are not yet comfortable with the interface or sometimes the language barrier factor.” According to President Kagame other bottlenecks include digital identity and cyber security as well as continental integration such as the African Continental Free Trade Area or the One Africa network. “We need to make digital identities of individuals and businesses portable across borders while using technology to reduce barriers to trade.” “All of this is within our power to achieve. We just need to move faster with a sense of urgency.” Embracing AI is key President Kagame also urged African leaders to open their doors and explore the potential that artificial intelligence can have in critical sectors like agriculture, health and education. “This powerful technology has made headlines in recent weeks, for the right reasons, at most. It is still unclear how it will affect existing jobs and what safety concerns there will be, but it is also already possible seeing that Africa has the most to gain.” ALSO READ: Rwanda to use artificial intelligence in disaster management This is because AI applications can narrow productivity gaps between African firms and their competitors on other continents. “We should therefore move quickly to embrace AI and make it work for us.” Kagame’s call comes just a few days after Rwanda adopted the national Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy, that among others aims to harness AI, digital and emerging technologies to support the country’s development goals (including sustainable and inclusive growth), become an ICT and Innovation Hub, and position Rwanda as a leader on the African and global stage. Africa lagging behind For Lacine Kone, Chief Executive at Smart Africa, despite digitization having a foothold in every sector in Africa, integration remains low on the continent. This, he said, calls for a collective effort to transition and transform Africa. According to Kone, this year’s summit, which also marks 10 years of Smart Africa Alliance existence, comes at a time when Africa needs to leapfrog emerging technologies such as AI applications. “10 years is a major milestone. Our celebration is not a festivity but an occasion to look back and look ahead at the mountains we must still climb. From seven founding members to 36 members representing 1,1 billion people, we are still growing.” For instance, he said, Africa, among other factors, remains the lowest in internet penetration at roughly 38 percent–less than 60 percent of the average. “This is not the Africa we want; we need to move faster. And the 4th industrial revolution allows us to. We must redesign ourselves for the challenge and opportunity Africa faces.”",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Edwin Ashimwe'}",2023-04-26T20:34:13+02:00,2023-04-26T18:44:34+02:00,Make Artificial Intelligence work for Africa – Kagame,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/04/26/17257.jpg'}",https://www.newtimes.co.rw/thenewtimes/uploads/images/2023/04/26/17257.jpg,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/6978/news/technology/make-artificial-intelligence-work-for-africa-kagame,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/6978/news/technology/make-artificial-intelligence-work-for-africa-kagame'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The New Times', 'url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/TheNewTimesRwanda/', 'https://twitter.com/NewTimesRwanda', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuZbZj6DF9zWXpdZVceDZkg'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '/theme_newtimes/images/logo.png', 'width': 270, 'height': 57}}",,,,,2023-04-26T18:44:34+02:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The New Times', 'url': 'https://www.newtimes.co.rw/'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not these workers.,,Who’s afraid of ChatGPT? Not these workers.,,,,,,"TechnologyAI is flooding the workplace, and workers love itWho’s afraid of ChatGPT? Not these workers.by  Rani MollaApr 10, 2023, 8:00 AM EDTFacebookLink Paige Vickers for Vox/Jorm Sangsorn/Getty Imagespart ofThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedsee all  Rani Molla is a senior correspondent at Vox and has been focusing her reporting on the future of work. She has covered business and technology for more than a decade — often in charts — including at Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.FacebookLinkA lot of what Conor Grennan does as a dean of students at NYU’s Stern School of Business could be done at least in part by bots. Brainstorming and planning are prime examples of tasks that can be easily handled by generative AI tools like ChatGPT. But instead of feeling like he could be replaced by AI, Grennan has become an evangelist of this technology and its potential to make work better. He likens the opportunity to work with AI technology right now to finding material wealth.“It feels like the Gold Rush, like there’s a bunch of people getting to California and seeing little flakes of gold in the river,” he told Vox.Some of Grennan’s new AI-powered workflow is pretty simple. He drops email chains into ChatGPT or Bing or Bard — he uses them all — and asks it to quickly search for details about a student or deliverables he needs to act on. But he admits that using this technology just for menial tasks would be akin to picking up an iPhone just to use its flashlight. He prefers to use AI to research, brainstorm, and learn. “It feels like the Gold Rush, like there’s a bunch of people getting to California and seeing little flakes of gold in the river”For example, Grennan might ask an AI to give him five suggestions of a good place to hold an event for 50 students in lower Manhattan on a Tuesday night, or have it reason through how young people in Ohio could help the climate crisis, or have it explain to him what exactly an API is. He keeps asking and refining the questions until he gets good answers, and he’s constantly coming up with new things to ask. Grennan thinks talking with the AI makes him more creative, stokes his sense of wonder, and ultimately makes him better at his job and life. “Instead of the drudgery of ‘I’ve been given a task, now I’m going to solve that task,’ it’s, ‘I’ve been given a task. What are different ways of looking at it? How can this improve my life? How can I actually get smarter?’” said Grennan. He was recently granted the additional title of head of generative AI at Stern, and is helping develop an AI initiative for Stern’s MBA program so students, faculty, and administrators can become comfortable with AI tools in the workplace.A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT and its more advanced successor GPT-4 — who have a vested interest in hyping their own technology’s capabilities — found that half of workers could have more than half their tasks exposed to large language models, like ChatGPT. Exposure was the highest among high-wage jobs that require degrees and had previously felt relatively safe from the onslaught of technological erasure: financial analysts, web designers, legal researchers, and journalists, among others. While the study said tools like ChatGPT could certainly save those jobs significant time completing tasks, it stopped short of saying those jobs would be fully automated by those technologies. It’s likely, however, that it will change them.While much has been made about AI’s potential to destroy our jobs, Grennan and other American workers whose tasks overlap with capabilities of software like ChatGPT are embracing the technology to do away with drudge work, to be more creative, and to level up their skills. Marketers are using it to write better copy; programmers are using it to take on projects that were previously out of their league or read code in unfamiliar languages. And it seems like everyone’s now using it to summarize or write emails and boilerplate documents. The rise of artificial intelligence, explainedHow does AI actually work? How is AI changing our society?Is AI coming for your job?Should we be worried about AI?Who will regulate AI?Where some see a threat, these workers see possibility. And they hope their mastery of the tools, coupled with their uniquely human skills, will allow them to stay employed even as artificial intelligence gets more and more clever. Back in January, over 40 percent of Americans said they were using generative AI technology at work, and that rate has likely gotten higher. At the same time, about half of Americans think AI could negatively impact the number of jobs in the US. The truth is we don’t know exactly how artificial intelligence technologies will impact work. The fear is that if tools make existing tasks take hours instead of days, employers might hire fewer employees to get the job done or make their work part-time. The hope is that while the new technology could cause some disruption in what people do, it will ultimately lead to more and better work, much like previous technological advancements, such as the personal computer or even the internet, didn’t spell the end of white-collar jobs.For now, we know that Americans who’ve chosen to deploy this technology at work seem to like it. They certainly don’t feel like frogs boiling in a pot. Goodbye to drudgery? It’s important to remember that even the best jobs have parts of them that suck. And those parts are the first ones on which workers are bringing AI to bear. Colin McAuliffe, a filmmaker and founder of the production company Zero One Digital Media, has been using the AI software DALL-E to generate images to illustrate business pitch decks. Rather than scroll through pages and pages of stock images, he simply tells the software precisely what he wants — say, a “photograph of a lemon” — and it pops one out.“It’s something I hated doing or I would make other people do for me,” he said. “And now I do it myself easily, and it’s kind of fun.” Recently, a client gave him a script that had been written by ChatGPT, and while McAuliffe hasn’t had it write scripts yet, he wants to use AI more often to make shooting schedules and plan trips for his company.“All that other stuff just takes me away from making videos,” he said.People say they’re using these tools on tasks they hate, and that allows them to focus on what they love. Vanessa Bowen, a self-employed product designer, used to dread having to come up with the text that would go inside their app prototypes. If something was off, clients would get hung up on the text rather than critiquing the user interface design of the app, and it could derail the whole interaction. Now, Bowen feeds the AI information about the client and the product, and what type of text box they’re trying to fill; then ChatGPT generates that text. “It would leave us more time to do other things like be more creative or not work so much”“It throws out something simple and concise and takes away some of that cognitive load,” they said. That lets Bowen focus on what they really like doing: designing.“I find that we are stuck in the mundane activities of the day-to-day that could be automated, which then in turn could free up our whole lives,” they added. “It would leave us more time to do other things like be more creative or not work so much.”It’s a sentiment white-collar workers expressed over and over again, and it’s part of why companies like Microsoft are leaning into AI so heavily in their workplace tools: Not all work is good work. Soon, Microsoft says workers will be able to ask AI-powered tools to make Excel perform complex equations, to have PowerPoint build presentations, and to summarize Outlook emails — all within seconds and by talking to them like you would a person. Whether that means people will spend that time saved on the parts of their job they really like or whether they’ll simply squander those freed-up hours remains to be seen. It’s also possible that this technology just enables them to make more unnecessary work for everyone else. Take for example, this great cartoon where one person uses AI to make a bullet point into a long email, to which the email’s reader responds by asking the AI to distill the email into a single bullet point. Leveling up at work There’s a lot of doom and gloom about what generative AI will mean for computer programmers specifically. Indeed, these tools can often spin up perfectly functional code, using natural language, in an instant, so it’s fair to wonder what that means for the highly paid people who used to do the same thing more slowly. But the software engineers and developers we spoke to preferred to think of the technology as something that enables them to be better at what they do, likening it to having an incredibly smart assistant or intern at their disposal. Victor Boutté, a software engineer and tech lead manager at the video hosting company Wistia, says AI tools like GitHub Copilot make him more productive, by suggesting how to complete code he’s started so that he doesn’t have to write the whole thing. Boutté, who works remotely, considers AI tools to be a lot like sitting next to a very smart colleague who also happens to have already read through his code and has limitless time for his questions.“I’m using it essentially as I would another engineer to bounce ideas off of. It’s helping me flesh through these ideas more deeply, and the feedback is instant,” he said.“It gets the creative wheels spinning about what can I use this kind of tech to build”AI not only helps Boutté code more quickly, but also elevates what’s possible for him to code in the first place.“Throughout my career, I’ve never seen a technology as advanced as this. And it gets the creative wheels spinning about what can I use this kind of tech to build,” he said. “It’s inspiring me.”For independent developer and researcher Simon Willison, AI tools allow him to be more ambitious because he spends less time researching how to figure things out. That means he has more time to try out time-intensive projects he might have previously had to pass on. Recently, Willison helped his wife with a pottery project. She wanted to see the rate at which a kiln cooled down after being heated in a microwave, in order to estimate its peak temperature while heating. Since she couldn’t put the thermometer in the microwave, after taking the kiln out, she would have to check its temperature over the course of the 90 minutes it took to cool. Instead, Willison asked GPT-4 how to break down a video of the thermometer into 10-second JPEG intervals. He then asked it for commands that would read the temperature from the images and chart it over time. Willison is now thinking about how he could help journalists bring such knowledge to problems like analyzing police body camera footage.“Normally, when faced with challenges like this, I’d be like, ‘It’s gonna take me an hour to figure this out. Just sit down next to the microwave and write the numbers down,” he said. Even in less technical and more creative areas, workers are finding that generative AI is able to make them better at what they do. In addition to letting humans spend more time on their creative tasks, generative AI is showing off its own kind of creativity — with the right prompts. Michael Kaye, director of brand marketing and communications at the dating app OkCupid, has been asking generative AI to come up with in-app matching questions. OkCupid matches people based on how they answer these questions, so coming up with ones that illuminate what’s important to people is incredibly important to how the service functions. At any given time, OkCupid has thousands of these questions available for daters to answer, and Kaye was responsible for creating new ones. For Kaye, this was one of many tasks he does at work, so offloading some of the question creation to AI helped free him up to work on other things. More importantly, he said, the questions that the AI generated — which were based on the simple prompts of “What would you ask on a date?” and “What would you ask on a dating app?” — were actually very good.The first 10 AI-generated questions Kaye ended up adding to the dating service included “How do you balance your own needs with the needs of your partner in a relationship?” “What do you value most in a partner?” and “Are you a morning or night person?” So far, they’ve been popular, with users responding to them more than 675,000 times since the end of January. “They’re high-quality, especially given how generic the prompt was,” Kaye said. “They might sound surface-level, but I think those are things that really help connect people.”He plans to add more ChatGPT questions using more specific prompts every month this year. Why AI probably won’t take our jobs While everyone we spoke to understood that generative AI might be disruptive to some jobs, no one felt it was a real danger to theirs. A common refrain was a version of a tweet from machine learning engineer Santiago Valdarrama that said, “AI will not replace you. A person using AI will.” In other words, they felt that their mastery over generative AI tools would give them a leg up, even if that generative AI made some of what they’re paid to do obsolete. “When I first started using GPT-4, [losing my job] was my first concern. It’s very natural to feel threatened by new technology, especially technology that’s really good at what you do,” said Stephanie Yamkovenko, a group manager for the digital marketing team at Khan Academy, an education nonprofit that has partnered with GPT-4 maker OpenAI since September. “But as I’ve used it more, I’ve realized that it’s going to be a skill that’s going to be in high demand for writing and editing in the future,” she added.Yamkovenko recently was able to work on a much more robust product launch than what her small team normally would have been able to do. She used ChatGPT to write a greater volume of social media copy, which in turn snagged the company 10 times the traffic it would normally get. “It’s very natural to feel threatened by new technology, especially technology that’s really good at what you do”Others were sanguine that their skills, now boosted by their agility with generative AI, are eternally in demand.Somnath Banerjee, VP of data science at the early-stage investment firm Clear Ventures, said there will always be an abundance of work for engineers like himself. He’s been using AI to code projects more quickly and to feel more confident in his email writing as a non-native English speaker. “They will not say, ‘I paid him for two weeks and you did it in two days,’ because there’s always two years of work waiting for you,” he said.None of this, of course, is to say that work will be the same. The acceptance of using tools like ChatGPT will be the first of many changes. Even if they do keep their jobs, what these white-collar workers do and how they do it will likely be different if generative AI technology becomes widely used. That will be a loss to many who like their craft as it is.Take, for example, this 3D mobile games artist who lamented on Reddit recently: “My job is different now since Midjourney v5 came out last week. I am not an artist anymore.”The poster added, “All I do is prompting, photoshopping and implementing good looking pictures. The reason I [wanted] to be a 3D artist in the first place is gone. I wanted to create form In 3D space, sculpt, create. With my own creativity. With my own hands.”Those who’ve embraced generative AI and who are less tied to the specific tasks of their work will likely have an easier time adjusting to a world of work that’s changing in front of their fingertips.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Chatbots Like ChatGPT?Large language models are already good at a wide variety of tasks.Share full article197Read in appVideoCreditCredit...Illustrations by Mathieu LabrecqueBy Kevin RoosePublished March 30, 2023Updated April 8, 2023In today’s newsletter, the fourth in our five-part series, I’m going to try to convince you that large language models are already good at a wide variety of tasks — and they’re getting smarter every day.In the previous edition of this newsletter, my colleague Cade Metz wrote that A.I. large language models (L.L.M.s) can be erratic and unreliable — giving false information and acting strangely toward users.I’ve been using A.I. tools like ChatGPT almost daily for several months now, and I’ve seen them spit out plenty of wrong answers. (And don’t remind me about my creepy encounter with Bing.)But I’ve also seen these A.I. programs do amazing things — feats of creativity, flexibility and efficiency that took my breath away. And I worry that in an attempt to tamp down A.I. hype, skeptics are missing what’s so groundbreaking — and potentially disruptive — about this technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLarge language models write poems and screenplays. One of the latest, GPT-4, scored in the 90th percentile on the bar exam and got top scores on a number of Advanced Placement tests. And the potential productivity gains for workers are enormous. (In one study, programmers who used GitHub Copilot — an L.L.M. for coders — finished a task 56 percent faster than programmers who didn’t.)Here are six things that A.I. is especially good at, right now:Explaining concepts at multiple difficulty levelsFor the last few months, I’ve been using ChatGPT as my personal tutor every time I get curious about a new topic. If it’s, say, fractional reserve banking, I’ll start by asking ChatGPT to “explain fractional reserve banking at a high school level.” (Or, if I’m still confused, “at a middle school level.”)ChatGPT and other A.I. chatbots do well with these types of prompts, using their skills at natural language processing, as long as you don’t ask about very recent events or extremely obscure topics. Calling on an infinitely patient, zero-cost tutor to guide me through new subjects feels like a superpower. Used properly, they can be amazing teaching tools.Editing and constructive criticismI still write my columns (including this newsletter) myself. But over the past few months, I’ve enlisted ChatGPT as my assistant.When I’m stuck, I often paste in a few sentences and see if it can spark any ideas. If I’m trying to tighten an argument, I’ll ask it to poke holes in my reasoning.I’ve found that Bing is particularly good for editing, because it can look things up on the internet. (One of my favorite writing hacks is to ask it to read Strunk and White’s “The Elements of Style” and suggest edits based on the book’s principles.)You can use similar tricks to use A.I. to improve your emails, cover letters or any other writing you’re working on. As a reminder, you should always check the A.I.’s work carefully.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGetting creatively unstuckA.I. can also be a good tool for getting your creative juices flowing. Recently, I was trying to come up with questions to ask a podcast guest. I pasted the guest’s bio into ChatGPT and asked it to give me “10 thoughtful, incisive interview questions” for this person. Of the questions it generated, most were pretty good, and I wound up using a few on the show.Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, recommends using A.I. to overcome writer’s block, or get a running start on hard projects. A person who wanted to start a bakery, for example, could ask ChatGPT for a list of all the necessary equipment and permits.“It is very easy to get distracted from a task by one difficult challenge,” Mr. Mollick wrote in a recent blog post. “A.I. provides a way of giving yourself momentum.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRehearsing for real-world tasksI’ve also been using ChatGPT and other A.I. apps as a kind of rehearsal for offline tasks I find unpleasant or hard.

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.When I had to have a difficult conversation with a friend, I asked ChatGPT to take part in a role-playing exercise. “Pretend you’re my friend, and react the way you think my friend might react,” I told it. I then held a mock version of the conversation. It didn’t make the real conversation painless, but I felt more confident knowing I’d already practiced with a chatbot.Of course, A.I. chatbots can’t replace human friendships. But they can be a kind of on-demand sounding board, offering us basic feedback and advice without judgment.SparkNotes for everythingOne of the most powerful abilities of A.I. language models is quickly summarizing large amounts of text.I’ve used A.I. programs to “read” long articles for me, and summarize dense academic papers. Usually they get the broad strokes right, even if some of the details are missing.This power really shines when you combine it with other A.I. abilities, like transcribing audio and video recordings. Suddenly it becomes possible to condense a two-hour podcast into bullet points, or get a concise summary of a work meeting while you’re still in the meeting.If you’re bored of reading this newsletter, you could ask ChatGPT or Bing to summarize the rest of it for you, or to rewrite it as a jaunty limerick. I promise I won’t be offended.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCoding, even if you don’t codePeople are already using A.I. to write code, whether or not they know any programming languages.These models weren’t designed to write software. But when they were trained on vast amounts of internet text, including the contents of coding sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow, they learned how to code — a phenomenon known as emergent behavior. Now, if you type in a prompt like “Build me a Chrome extension that translates the text of any website to pirate-speak,” you might get back the code for an app that actually works.In the past few months, social media has been full of examples of astonished people who are using A.I. tools to build websites and apps faster than any human could — at a tiny fraction of the cost.What’s next?All of this raises some pretty obvious questions about the future, such as: If L.L.M.s are helping nonwriters write well, and noncoders code well, what other kinds of powers will they unlock? And how many jobs will these new A.I. abilities eliminate?Tomorrow, Cade will be back to wrap up this series with a look at where all of this progress may be headed.ImageYour homeworkWhat other chatbot skills can you discover?Think of a task that takes up a lot of your daily brainpower, like a tedious chore from work, or coming up with a weekly dinner plan to feed your family. Then work with a chatbot to see how well it can perform.(Last week, The Times spoke with people who use ChatGPT to have more productive conversations with their teenagers, concoct imaginative bedtime stories and draft love letters to their spouses. And Hard Fork, the Times podcast I co-host, featured stories from listeners who are using A.I. to negotiate their rent, understand medical results and affirm their gender identity.)As always, share your best, worst and most interesting results in the comments.

If you’ve been following tech trends lately, you’ve probably heard a lot about ChatGPT and Bard as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google have been rapidly bringing these large language models to the masses. However, tons of smaller generative AI projects have also been rolling out in the past year.


Generative AI tools have made a significant impact on various fields, including music, art, and literature. Some AI tools create images. Some draft emails. Some make videos. But all of the tools were created to save time while making the creative realm accessible to even more people. And while the jury is still out on how fast we move, the legal and ethical ramifications, and the ultimate impact that generative AI will have on work, it’s becoming apparent to most of us that generative AI is here to stay.

So, what else is out there that interested users should be checking out? The following are just a few currently available Generative AI tools that you can try right from your phone or digital device.

Though writing and art are getting the most buzz from generative AI right now, the technology can also create lifelike voiceovers from text commands. Murf AI allows users to make studio quality voice overs for things like explainer videos, podcasts, advertisements and more using text. Just choose from the 120+ voice styles available on the site, including 20+ languages and accent options.
Stockimg.AI
Honestly, there are tons of different apps for AI art generation right now, but I chose Stockimg.AI because it makes content creation for different purposes so easy. When generating an image, you let the AI know if you are looking to make a book cover, logo, icon, wall paper or stock images, and it creates visual content to suit your needs.
Heyday
Heyday calls itself an AI powered memory assistant, but it’s actually more like a research assistant. The app works with browsers, search engines, and apps like Gmail and Google Docs to help “resurface” content you may need to find once you’ve already reviewed it. For instance: if you need to find the source file for the tip, quote, or reference you know you saw somewhere, Heyday will help expedite the process.
Wordtune Read
Wordtune does offer a generative writing option, but what’s more interesting to me is its reading option. Wordtune Read summarizes lengthy documents and helps highlight key points so that users can understand more, more quickly. It can even provide different summaries based on a specific point of view, for instance what the text means for an overall industry or decision-makers within the field.
Regie AI
Yes, generative AI is even getting job-specific. For instance, if your sales team needs help creating winning messaging, try out Regi AI. This app will help research potential contacts and help sales agents create personal emails that feel authentic to your company. Regie uses a large language model to help create a voice specific to your brand. It even uses past content to create new content. Regie can even create sales sequences and publish them to the company’s sales platform.
Resume Worded
It’s never been more challenging to get past the HR bots screening incoming resumes. Luckily Resume Worded can help. The app was designed to provide instant feedback on your resume or LinkedIn profile, including scores on key criteria that real recruiters use when hiring candidates. Users can also use the app to identify keywords most relevant to the job descriptions they’re searching for.
Looka
Want to create a professional logo for your company, but lacking in graphic design skills? Looka allows you to create a beautiful logo with the click of a button. Just input your company’s name, industry type, and color palette, and you’ll have an endless range of logo possibilities at your fingertips.
While ChatGPT and Bard are two of the most popular generative AI tools at this juncture, these are several other tools that I’ve had the chance to explore and I believe are worth trying to create content, assist productivity, support sales, augment HR, and help users find the most useful information online. Generative AI is here, and it’s working overtime.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is what powers tools such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Midjourney, which are trained on human-created content and can generate images or text in response to prompts. It promises to automate a lot of tasks we now do ourselves. That sounds like a boon, but it has also caused people to fear for their jobs. Indeed, Goldman Sachs issued a report on the effects of AI on economic growth that said, ""If generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,"" estimating that 300 million jobs could be impacted.Impacted doesn’t necessarily mean terminated, though. The report goes on to say, ""Worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs"" and that 63% of current jobs would be complemented by AI—especially in fields such as customer service. The Wall Street Journal reports that the jobs for which AI can do at least 50% of the scut work include accountant, writer, mathematician, PR specialist, and blockchain engineer. Short-order cooks and motorcycle mechanics, your jobs are safe. As with any emerging tech, generative AI will also create new roles for people to fill—some that even weeks ago, no one had ever heard of. Here are just some of the job descriptions you’ll be seeing more of in the coming years.1. Prompt Engineer

(Credit: Google Bard/PCMag)

Generative AI uses natural language processing (NLP), which lets you ask for something using normal words and syntax. You don't have to be a programmer, but that doesn't mean you can't perfect what you say.Prompt is the term for what you ask of AI. A prompt engineer is someone who can compose an effective string of text that not only helps with the training of the AI but also delivers exactly the results needed and intended. A prompt engineer (PE) has to master the tricks that work on specific generative AIs—what you say to Bard may not be the right thing to say to ChatGPT, for example. Prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. The CEO of OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) says great prompt writing ""is an amazingly high-leverage skill.""
Current advertised pay rates for a PE can range from $250,000 to $335,000 per year, and the job doesn’t necessarily require a computer-science degree. Tech companies won’t be the only places that require successful prompts. Expect to see PE jobs for any business that needs AI automation, including law firms, customer support, and, well, publishing. At online marketplaces such as PromptBase, you can purchase a prompt or sell your own. This is one area of AI where the human touch will be a necessity. 2. AI TrainerAs companies implement generative-AI systems that are meant to interact with the outside world—think AI chatbots doing customer service—AI must learn a few things about the business it's a part of. That's what an AI trainer does.One job post found online as of this writing, for an insurance company that's implementing an AI platform, specifically says that the applicant will not be speaking to anyone on the phone directly; they will assist the AI platform while the AI conducts calls. Perfecting things that aren't human so they'll sound more human is what AI training is all about.3. AI AuditorIt's not enough to get cool or interesting results, the output from an AI should also be accurate and unbiased. We have heard plenty about the bias inherent in AI, and the companies powering today’s AI admit it can still happen. The job of the AI auditor is to make sure those problems are weeded out as much as possible. In some places, that is, or will be, the law—New York City, for example, has a law coming in July 2023 requiring bias audits of tech used for AI hiring.

GPT-4 vs. ChatGPT-3.5: What’s the Difference?





4. AI Ethicists/Ethics Experts

(Credit: Ascannio/shutterstock)

Bing Chat AI (powered by GPT-4) defines this role as the person ""responsible for ensuring that AI is used in a safe and ethical manner."" A recent job posting for Indeed.com says its AI ethicist (“staff data scientist”) will be ""helping all people get jobs by reducing bias and increasing fairness in our algorithmic systems."" We asked Google’s Bard AI about the job. It said, ""AI ethics experts can command high salaries, as they are in high demand by companies that want to ensure that their use of generative AI is responsible and ethical."" The high demand isn’t a given just yet, but the money isn't bad—the job mentioned above and a few others we found online topped out at $160,00 per year.5. Machine ManagersAI isn't going to be all about people typing natural language and getting back text (or pictures or video). Actual machines are going to have to learn to work with AI instructions. That's where machine managers will be needed—to oversee AI-operated hardware and systems.Because of the sophisticated requirements, these job descriptions (which are frequently placed by manufacturing industries) tend to ask for actual computer-science degrees along with commensurate experience in the field in which the AI is being used. The pay can fluctuate, with top salaries of $109K to $251K  a year. That seems a little low, though, if a pipsqueak prompt engineer commands a higher salary and doesn’t have an advanced degree. But this kind of hiring is also, apparently, as much an art as a science.Seeing a lot of overlap in these jobs? You're right. It’s Wild West time for generative AI, and no one knows which related jobs will stick around. But getting in on the ground floor with a job like any of the above is a smart move. And plenty of existing job titles—old-fashioned ones such as programmer—will still be needed, even as AI proliferates.

<p>Bing Chat AI (powered by <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-new-chatgpt-what-you-get-with-gpt-4-vs-gpt-35"" target=""_self"">GPT-4</a>) defines this role as the person ""responsible for ensuring that AI is used in a safe and ethical manner."" A recent <a href=""https://www.indeed.com/esg/joinaiethics"" target=""_blank"" title=""(Opens in a new tab)"">job posting</a> for Indeed.com says its AI ethicist (&ldquo;staff data scientist&rdquo;) will be ""helping all people get jobs by reducing bias and increasing fairness in our algorithmic systems."" </p><p>We asked Google&rsquo;s Bard AI about the job. It said, ""AI ethics experts can command high salaries, as they are in high demand by companies that want to ensure that their use of generative AI is responsible and ethical."" The high demand isn&rsquo;t a given just yet, but the money isn't bad&mdash;the job mentioned above and a few others we found online topped out at $160,00 per year.</p><hr><h2 id=""5-machine-managers"">5. Machine Managers</h2><p>AI isn't going to be all about people typing natural language and getting back text (or pictures or <a href=""https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerberg-our-ai-program-can-create-video-from-a-line-of-text"" target=""_self"">video</a>). Actual machines are going to have to learn to work with AI instructions. That's where machine managers will be needed&mdash;to oversee AI-operated hardware and systems.</p><p>Because of the sophisticated requirements, these job descriptions (which are frequently placed by manufacturing industries) tend to ask for actual computer-science degrees along with commensurate experience in the field in which the AI is being used. The pay can fluctuate, with top salaries of $109K to $251K&nbsp; a year. That seems a little low, though, if a pipsqueak prompt engineer commands a higher salary and doesn&rsquo;t have an advanced degree. But this kind of hiring is also<em>, </em>apparently, as much an art as a science.</p><hr><p>Seeing a lot of overlap in these jobs? You're right. It&rsquo;s Wild West time for generative AI, and no one knows which related jobs will stick around. But getting in on the ground floor with a job like any of the above is a smart move. And plenty of existing job titles&mdash;old-fashioned ones such as programmer&mdash;will still be needed, even as AI proliferates.</p><div class=""video-parent !mb-0"">

But who exactly will benefit?This article is more than 1 year oldLarry ElliottWith swaths of white collar jobs at risk, the clock is ticking on the development of policy to meet this huge societal challengeFri 7 Apr 2023 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Apr 2023 09.17 EDTShare937937Elon Musk is not most people’s idea of a classic technophobe, so when the owner of Twitter warns of the dangers of artificial intelligence, it is worth sitting up and taking notice. Fearful that a new generation of ever-smarter machines threatens life on Earth as we know it, Musk was one of many at the cutting edge of technological change calling for a six-month timeout in the training of new AI systems.There is nothing new in the idea that the machines are coming, and they are out to get us. Techno-optimists are right to say that the same arguments were aired by Luddites in the early 19th century. By this token, the chatbot ChatGPT is to the fourth industrial revolution what the spinning jenny was to the first – a product that symbolises the dawning of a new era.In the past, there has been a pattern to events. New technology has arrived on the scene and has offered the prospect of doing things quicker and better. Fears have been raised of mass unemployment as machines take the jobs previously done by humans. Eventually, the pessimists have been proved wrong, and the new technology has led to higher levels of employment.There is little doubt that AI will be a gamechanger that can bring to an end a long period of weak productivity and low growth common to western economies since the global financial crisis erupted 15 years ago. As was the case when tractors took the place of farm hands, a single machine will be able to do what countless workers formerly did. That’s really not in question.What is in doubt is who will benefit from the boost to productivity. What if all the gains are seized by a handful of tech giants? What if history fails to repeat itself, and AI destroys more jobs than it creates? What if AI does lead to a net increase in employment, but the new jobs are less well-paid than the old ones? Put simply, what if it is different this time? That may well be the case.Much of the debate around the impact of AI is based on conjecture. There have been studies galore that have sought to estimate the number of jobs that will be affected – potentially running into the hundreds of millions globally – but nobody knows for sure. That said, certain conclusions can be drawn with a reasonable degree of confidence.One is that the pace of technological advance will not slow down, and will probably continue to accelerate. ChatGPT was launched last November, and by March, a new version was available. The call by Musk et al for a six-month moratorium has to be seen in the context of the geopolitical struggle between the US and China. Neither superpower wants to give the other the opportunity to forge ahead. The chances of Washington and Beijing getting together and agreeing to a joint pause seem remote.Despite the speed at which the technology is advancing, a second conclusion is that there will be no immediate root-and-branch transformation of economies. Machines are expensive and workers cheap. Moreover, companies have invested heavily in their existing systems, and these sunk costs mean it will take time for the impact of AI to show up in investment, jobs and productivity figures.View image in fullscreen‘The chatbot ChatGPT is to the fourth industrial revolution what the spinning jenny was to the first – a product that symbolises the dawning of a new era.’ Photograph: Print Collector/Getty ImagesHowever, once the change does occur it is likely to be highly disruptive, because whole swaths of middle-class, white-collar jobs are at risk. This will be a break with the past, when earlier waves of technological advances made it possible for workers displaced from low-paid jobs to find better-paid employment in the new jobs created. People who were no longer needed as farm hands found work in factories.AI poses a challenge to this model because of Moravec’s paradox – the notion that for robots, the hard problems are easy and the easy problems hard. Machines can wipe the floor with chess grandmasters, but have more trouble removing and cleaning the pieces at the end of the game: tasks that involve mobility and perception skills that have evolved in humans over millions of years.But jobs that involve empathy and basic motor skills – social care work, for instance – tend to be poorly remunerated. That suggests the jobs most at risk from AI are likely to be higher paid than the ones created. There will be a boost to productivity and growth from the increased use of AI, but as things stand, the gains will be highly concentrated.The final conclusion is that policymakers need to use the limited time available to them to respond to the obvious challenges. AI has the potential to bring great benefits, but also has risks that go beyond economics into the realms of privacy and ethics.Launching the government’s white paper last week, the science and technology secretary Michelle Donelan said she wanted AI to be used to make the UK the “smarter, healthier and happier place to live and work”. All of which sounds marvellous, with echoes of an essay John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1930, predicting that within 100 years, increased prosperity would allow people to work 15-hour weeks.Keynes’s vision has yet to materialise, and nor will Donelan’s unless urgent attention is paid to the 3Rs of AI: a system of global regulation that sets common standards for the use and development of AI; retraining to prepare the workforce for the inevitable change; and redistribution to ensure that the economic benefits are spread around. As with the climate crisis, the other existential threat of our time, the clock is ticking.

Five days after its launch, ChatGPT exceeded 1 million users1. Generative AI (GenAI), the basis for tools like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard and Meta LLaMa, is a new AI technology that has quickly moved front and center into the global limelight. 
GenAI’s hallmark is the ability to answer almost any question on demand, converting text-based queries into masterful creations, such as songs, poems, art or college essays. GenAI then builds a network of related topics, generating an enormously expanded base of information, often visualized as a knowledge map. 
GenAI Meets the Enterprise
While we’ve seen initial consumer interest in GenAI tools and use skyrocket, GenAI capabilities are fast moving to the enterprise world. Today, an estimated 60% of IT leaders are looking to implement GenAI2.
At the same time, concerns exist. Most notably, for about 71% of IT leaders, angst about security creates a barrier to adoption, mandating that approaches, infrastructure, data strategies and security be appropriately aligned3. Finding the right, fit-for-use GenAI model for enterprises is the key to mitigating its risks, dispelling concerns and ushering in GenAI’s mainstream adoption in the enterprise world.
Overcoming GenAI challenges holds epic potential for enterprises. From improving customer interactions to automating complex business processes, GenAI models have the power to revolutionize the ways businesses operate, opening new possibilities for every industry in every part of the world.
Pivoting to Purpose-built GenAI
To enable that revolution, the way enterprises use GenAI will likely differ from general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Instead, enterprises are likely to use GenAI models that are trained and tuned to solve specific problems; for instance, to enable automated customer support, financial forecasting and fraud detection. Although LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used for enterprise applications, the accuracy of their results will not match that of a purpose-built model created to meet a specific need.
Other major benefits of purpose-built GenAI include:

Data security and compliance: AI’s unique capability is handling and analyzing huge datasets with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Simply put, if AI is a rocket ship, data is the fuel. The more data that a company can use to tune the purpose-built LLM, the more powerful the GenAI model becomes. Enterprises can tune their LLMs with customer purchase history, support or telesales logs, health records, financial records and other data sources. Consequently, handling this data in a secure manner will become even more important than it is today. Experienced advisors can help guide organizations size up a security strategy with minimal disruption to existing systems and approaches.Additionally, some industries, such as healthcare and finance, must comply with stringent regulations regarding data privacy and security. The privacy of data that is entered into third party LLM services is the subject of intensifying debate. Thus, enterprises that need to retain control over their data must tread carefully. 


Agility and time to market: Most enterprises will need to update their GenAI models regularly, which is easier to do with purpose-built GenAI models. The time required to train general-purpose LLMs can take months. That’s because massive amounts of data are required for training, eclipsing deployment speed and time to market, the very benefits GenAI enables. Reducing time-to-model and facilitating faster data-to-decisions can improve business efficiency.


Performance: Purpose-built models also provide performance benefits over general-purpose models. Specifically, enterprises using third party general-purpose LLMs may not be able to optimize performance and reduce the latency of their GenAI workloads. This is problematic for applications that require real-time processing or low-latency response times, a key attribute of GenAI adoption.


Cost: The smaller amounts of training data needed for purpose-built GenAI models also translate into cost savings. As a result, purpose-built LLMs often cost far less to train and re-train compared to general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT.

One works with highly organized data collected in tables — the tabular-data-focused data scientist. The other works on deep learning applications including vision, audio, large language models (LLMs), etc. For the purposes of this piece, we call the former the “tabular” or “traditional” group and the latter the “LLM” group. Each group uses its own techniques and models that have, in large part, developed separately. With the recent successes of large language models including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and others, we wanted to see if we could use modern LLM results to help make predictions on tabular datasets.In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, we submitted results to several blind Kaggle competitions (including the popular “House Prices — Advanced Regression Techniques” competition). The typical Kaggle competition supplies tabular data and is dominated by traditional ML approaches. However, we found with little background knowledge, zero data cleaning, and zero feature development required by traditional methods, LLMs were able to return results with predictive power. LLM predictions were not competitive with the leading models produced with lengthy and extensive tabular methods, but were strong enough to place well higher than the median score on the leaderboard rankings.We expect this to be the beginning of a number of techniques that use LLMs on tabular data and would not be surprised to see their use widen and compete favorably to more traditional model development processes.Included in this write up is the first approach we have seen that merges traditional tabular datasets and XGBoost models with LLMs using latent structure embeddings, allowing the tabular approaches to work off of the numerical “features” produced internally by the LLM.To date, we haven’t seen an LLM used this way to date and hope this is the beginning of something exciting.Challenges of Applying Deep Learning to Tabular DataThe typical machine learning application involves cleaning and training a narrow set of data typically collected, held, or acquired by an organization. At a high level, the process can be thought of developing a “context” for which only one specific type of questions can be asked. When that type of question arises, the ML model produces one or more predictions. Further improving models comes from three areas: adding more data, improving methods, or acquiring more and different features. The last is often the most interesting here, as the data scientist is generally always asking herself: “what different data can I get to make my predictions better?”Partitioning, boosting, and/or bagging models have been developed for and do exceedingly well in this domain. Despite much effort, deep learning has not shown to be as effective in this area. Observations show that XGBoost and cousins generalize better in production, where deep learning models tend to overfit. A large number of teams have tried to improve deep learning on tabular datasets, but these efforts have largely lagged behind established, high performing tabular approaches.The Problem of Training with Narrow DataA common deep learning approach is to apply a neural network and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to a relatively “small” dataset consisting of an organization’s data. This approach has been repeatedly shown to require more work (data scientist time), resource consumption (training time), and parameter tuning to get similar or worse performance than tabular approaches. The failure of deep learning here may be a mismatch between the approach and narrow data available to it. Deep Learning seems somewhat gated by its ability to learn from narrow data.Image by authorIn the image above, a large parameter neural network model is trained on the “small data” of a single company. Training a large model on a relatively small dataset causes the model to almost always be over-parameterized. This is because the information contained to make decisions is not that large, there are only so many “error surfaces” related to the data to optimize performance against.Applying a Large Language Model To a Tabular Dataset: Enter Prompt EngineeringLLMs have come to the fore through two innovations. The first is the transformer architecture pioneered by Google and others. The second is the application of these architectures to colossal data sets on the order of dozens or hundreds of terabytes. A reasonable hypothesis is that these LLMs are able to sidestep the “narrow” data problem that beleagures deep learning approaches. By training on Internet-scale data, LLMs have built an internal representation for the context of many applications. This is a needed step in order to have a model that can respond to any number of prompts. A happy and necessary consequence is that the LLMs may have developed the context for answering questions related to an organization’s prediction problems or those of a Kaggle competition.By way of analogy, LLMs have come to understand the context of your problem in a similar way that traditional/tabular machine learning has done in its training step. Surprisingly, this has been done using a broader source of data and not the organization’s specific data. Another way to look at it is that the LLMs has trained a model capable of predictions from all the data it acquired elsewhere. To the data scientist, this provides access to a diverse dataset and a potential treasure trove of information — or they may just provide noise.Unlocking the information in LLMs for tabular models encounters two obstacles. The first is that LLMs are accessed via prompts and not tabular data (DataFrames). The second is that LLMs primarily produce textual output.To overcome the first obstacle, we supply our tabular data through prompts. Here the prompt is created on each row of the table. The construction of the prompt is pretty simple: a paragraph comprised of sentences, one for each cell in the table row, as follows:Image by authorThe “row” prompt consists of the following:“The <column name> is <cell value>. The <column name> is <cell value>. …”Two things to note here:It is not necessary to generate prompts for training data, only the data about which the prediction needs to be made; andIt is not strictly necessary to ask what prediction will be made of the data.The second obstacle is that the LLMs produce textual responses. In some instances, LLMs can provide predictions. As of this writing, the predictions are not very good — likely because the LLMs that are not trained with specific predictions in mind. Instead of accessing LLM predictions, we find the flexibility to work with the features produced by the LLM preferable. In the parlance of LLMs, the features are latent structure embeddings or simply “embeddings.” These embeddings are accessible through LLM APIs. It is important to note that the embedding vectors are typically of values-per-row. Once we extract the embeddings, we can run them through a tabular model (XGBoost).The embeddings will be used in two examples: first, to make predictions for home prices in a Kaggle data competition (this blog); and second, to measure multivariate drift and anomaly detection using embedding drift (an upcoming blog).Workflow: Table -> Prompt -> LLM -> Embedding -> XGboost -> Prediction (Image by author)The LLM provides a great simple feature engineering tool available for use on any tabular dataset, essentially allowing performance gains with almost no feature engineering or parameterization.Towards Harnessing Big Data and Large Language ModelsIn most companies, the data you are training on is small relative to the information contained across the internet.Let’s take an example of home price prediction. Imagine the model you train learns from your data that a certain zip-code has higher priced homes. It also might learn some interesting relationships with other features, such as that homes with pools have higher selling prices. But imagine what you could say about home prices in a zip-code by gathering the entire world’s knowledge about that zip code and applying it in parallel with your current pricing model?Image by authorLarge language models are trained on an immense amount of data, and through that data they learn structure and relationships. Internally, they learn manifolds and surfaces in embedding/activation space that relate to concepts and knowledge that can be applied to almost anything.ResultsThe following approach can be applied to any pandas dataframe with no feature engineering. The results in this case was a 0.14 RLMSE, putting us in a respectable position in the results with little effort.How does it work? The data flows the model generating embeddings that represent the data in the prompt. The embeddings represent latent structure of the data that is flowing through the model. They capture the immense amount of training data that is then projected on the specific data we are looking at in the tabular data set.Image by authorThe image above shows the embedding space of a Kaggle home price data set. You can generate this view with the Colab that accompanies this blog. Here, the predictions mapped onto the UMAP view of the Kaggle Dataset.Image by authorThe embeddings of the LLM have immense structure that is represented by the UMAP view. One can see some of the information contained by mapping original features onto the predictions in the data.Final House Price PredictionIn order to make a prediction, the embedding values flow out of the LLM and to the XGBoost model that is trained on the embedding latent structure space. The XGBoost model then predicts the price of homes. This is all done with no feature engineering.Why not VAE’s?We started this journey looking at applying Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to tabular data. However, we ultimately found that VAE’s are just trained on too little data and are too sensitive to parameters to generate useful value.GPT-4We also tested pasting in the data directly to GPT-4 to see how it would fare just making predictions on the dataset directly with no training on the data directly. In many cases, the results were impressive. We expect there will be approaches to connect tabular data more directly to GPT-4 to help with these predictions directly.“The following is a set of row and column data:Id MSSubClass MSZoning …1 60 RL …”Once the rows and columns of data are pasted into the context you can ask questions about the data.Example of Lookup (image by author)It definitely understands the data, the following is a lookup on the exact ID in the dataset.Pre-Prompt (image by author)The above example is a pre-prompt prior to pasting in the data to predict.GPT-4 Prediction (image by author)The GPT-4 prediction above is a decent prediction without a model or training data. The actual value of the sales price is $130,250. It’s clear there will eventually be methods to connect data with GPT-4 and get fairly decent estimates without any training or in combination with training for state of the art (SOTA).A Look AheadGiven how little effort went into optimizing these outcomes, it is reasonable to expect LLMs to be used on tabular data in an increasingly large set of environments. It is also likely that LLMs will outperform traditional techniques, on small data sets, at some point in the near future. As LLMs and prompt engineering evolve many areas of data science, tabular data problems are not immune.",NewsArticle,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Aparna Dhinakaran', 'url': 'https://aparnadhinak.medium.com'}",2023-04-19T16:31:15.454Z,2023-04-06T14:46:29.818Z,Boosting Tabular Data Predictions with Large Language Models,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*PjLltDt8OrhLrxuIK0KZAg.jpeg'],,https://towardsdatascience.com/boosting-tabular-data-predictions-with-large-language-models-531337f834dc,,,,https://towardsdatascience.com/boosting-tabular-data-predictions-with-large-language-models-531337f834dc,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",,,,,2023-04-06T14:46:29.818Z,,,,,,,Boosting Tabular Data Predictions with Large Language Models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Aparna Dhinakaran'],,,,,,,,,,,,,531337f834dc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enterprise Connect 2023 recap



 
18:47











The rise in generative AI in the enterprise communications world is changing how organizations can make collaboration more accessible and productive to ultimately create a more positive environment for employee experience.
Industry analysts Irwin Lazar, president and principal analyst at Metrigy; Beth Schultz, vice president and principal analyst at Metrigy; and David Maldow, founder of Let's Do Video, discussed the evolution of unified communications (UC) and collaboration technology at Enterprise Connect 2023 and what hybrid work trends should be on IT buyers' radars as they plan their UC and contact center strategies.
The four-day Enterprise Connect conference focused on the latest in UC, collaboration and contact center technology. A hybrid conference, the expo opened with topics on just that -- the hybrid workplace -- as well as the latest in AI technology. The conference featured keynote speakers from Microsoft, Cisco, RingCentral, Zoom, Google Cloud and AWS.
Generative AI was the highlight of the conference, with vendors demonstrating the different ways to use the technology in the workplace. Lazar discussed the demo of Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams, for example, that showed how the generative AI-based service created meeting transcripts, notes and action items and was also able to analyze the sentiment of the meeting.
Additionally, with hybrid work becoming the new norm, companies such as Microsoft and Cisco are finding ways to keep employees engaged and productive in the workplace, no matter where everyone is working from. Schultz noted that IT buyers should pay attention to what they can do with the collaboration data available from their vendors as a way to create a more proactive environment among employees and increase productivity.
Watch this analyst recap of Enterprise Connect to get a deeper look into topics about generative AI and learn more about the advanced features supporting hybrid work trends among employees.

While concepts around machine learning have existed for years, recent advances in this technology have made it an integral part of the way we live and work. From face ID recognition, navigation maps, chatbots, voice assistants, search engines, text editors to smart home devices — AI is often a part of day-to-day lives today.This evolution has also resulted in abundant job opportunities. According to recent reports, the demand for talent in AI and machine learning has increased by almost 75% over the last few years, and it is only expected to grow. If you wish to thrive in this segment, now is the time to build a career in it.A career in AI offers you a wide range of paths. All of them demand specialisation in a specific set of skills and responsibilities. Therefore, you first need to get a basic understanding of these to find out which path aligns the best with your goals. We have curated a list of the most in-demand AI careers that you can pursue to kick-start your professional journey. 1) Machine Learning Engineer Machine learning engineers hold expertise in developing, designing and deploying self-running software. These software solutions offer machines the capacity to automate predictive models. Over time, the more a computer learns from the inserted data set, the better it predicts the outcome from new data sets. A simple example of this concept is the recommendations your streaming apps make based on the genre of shows you view the most. In addition, chatbots, virtual assistants, driverless cars, traffic predictions and search recommendations are emerging applications of this field. Educational Qualification – A strong background in computer science, data programming, mathematics and related fields.Entry-level salary – Over Rs 3,00,000 per year  2) Data Scientist The job of a data scientist involves collecting and analysing complex data by using various analytical and statistical AI tools. The main aim is to draw valuable information from the raw data and then use it to generate solutions required by business organisations to grow in a competitive market. As an example, in food delivery apps, data from your previous orders and browsing history is used to generate discount offers that you are most likely to accept. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in data science, computer science or a related field. Many employers also prefer candidates with a master’s degree in data science. Entry-level salary – over Rs 5,00,000 per year 3) AI Research Scientist A research scientist is responsible for conducting various experiments on existing models in order to create new algorithms. In simple words, their job is to improve and modify the ways in which a machine thinks and operates. The algorithms generated by them further assist in analysing data and producing patterns. As a result, the opportunities for an AI scientist are innumerable. They have a great scope in industries such as healthcare, finance, marketing, insurance, retail, manufacturing and more. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in computer science or computer programming to show that you know the basics of algorithms. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 3,25,000 4) Robotics Engineer As the name suggests, robotics engineers develop robots that can perform a plethora of tasks without human intervention. They do so by combining the elements of computer science, engineering, cognitive psychology and electronics. In addition, these remarkable creations make sure to simplify repetitive tasks and perform them with utmost precision. Drones, which are great products of this technology, are now being used in industries such as agriculture, military, entertainment and real estate to increase efficiency, accuracy, and reduce cost and time. Educational Qualification – At least a degree in computer engineering, mechanical engineering or robotics. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 3,50,000  5) AI Ethicist AI ethicists are assigned the job of instilling ethical, political and social perspectives in AI systems. This allows the systems or machines to operate in a transparent, fair and unbiased manner. In the past, many tech giants have landed in legal battles due to possible unethical use of the massive amount of data collected from users or customers. To mitigate such ethical risks associated with AI, companies are more than eager to hire expert ethicists. This is probably why there is a huge demand for AI ethicists in the job market. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in ethics, philosophy, computer science or a related field might give you a good start. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 2,00,000 6) UX designerA UX or user experience designer plays an indispensable part in assessing the way a user interacts with a product, programme or website. They design and develop products that are ultra-simple to operate by closely monitoring the expectations, behaviours, desires and triggers of the consumers. For instance, when you visit hotel booking websites, a UX designer makes sure that your entire search process is quick and user-friendly. Moreover, the smart features installed by them boost engagement and traffic. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in technology, science and engineering. Many private colleges also offer a specific UX designer course to equip you with the necessary skills. Entry-level salary – Over Rs 2,60,000 7) Business Intelligence DeveloperA business intelligence developer is responsible for developing and maintaining several software solutions which can be used to access data and support the goals of the company. In addition, they are expected to perform duties such as collecting data, analysing it, creating new solutions for data processing, fixing errors in tools and implementing improvement measures. Educational Qualification – A bachelor’s degree in IT, computer science, software development, business intelligence or mathematics.

Is this time different?Share full article277Read in app Credit...Alejandra BalagueraBy Steve LohrSteve Lohr writes about the impact of technology on work.April 10, 2023More than a decade ago, lawyers were singled out as an endangered occupational species, their livelihoods at risk from advances in artificial intelligence.But the doomsayers got ahead of themselves. While clever software has taken over some of the toil of legal work — searching, reviewing and mining mountains of legal documents for nuggets of useful information — employment in the legal profession has grown faster than the American work force as a whole.Today, a new A.I. threat looms, and lawyers may feel a bit of déjà vu. There are warnings that ChatGPT-style software, with its humanlike language fluency, could take over much of legal work. The new A.I. has its flaws, notably its proclivity to make things up, including fake legal citations. But proponents insist those are teething defects in a nascent technology — and fixable.Will the pessimists finally be right?Law is seen as the lucrative profession perhaps most at risk from the recent advances in A.I. because lawyers are essentially word merchants. And the new technology can recognize and analyze words and generate text in an instant. It seems ready and able to perform tasks that are the bread and butter of lawyers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“That is really, really powerful,” said Robert Plotkin, an intellectual property lawyer in Cambridge, Mass. “My work and my career has been mostly writing text.”But unless the past isn’t a guide, the impact of the new technology is more likely to be a steadily rising tide than a sudden tidal wave. New A.I. technology will change the practice of law, and some jobs will be eliminated, but it also promises to make lawyers and paralegals more productive, and to create new roles. That is what happened after the introduction of other work-altering technologies like the personal computer and the internet.ImageBen Allgrove, a partner and the chief innovation officer at the international law firm Baker McKenzie, tracks the impact of technology on the legal profession.Credit...Tom Jamieson for The New York TimesOne new study, by researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University, concluded that the industry most exposed to the new A.I. was “legal services.” Another research report, by economists at Goldman Sachs, estimated that 44 percent of legal work could be automated. Only the work of office and administrative support jobs, at 46 percent, was higher.Lawyers are only one occupation in the path of A.I. progress. A study by researchers at OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and the University of Pennsylvania found that about 80 percent of American workers would have at least 10 percent of their tasks affected by the latest A.I. software.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe legal profession has been identified as a ripe target for A.I. automation in the past. In 2011, one article in a longer series in The New York Times on the progress in A.I. (titled “Smarter Than You Think”) focused on the likely impact on legal work. Its headline: “Armies of Expensive Lawyers, Replaced by Cheaper Software.”But the march of A.I. in law turned out to be more measured. A.I. mainly identified, sorted and classified words in documents. The technology’s tools served more as aides than as replacements — and the same could be true this time.In 2017, Baker McKenzie, a large international law firm, set up a committee to track emerging technology and set strategy. Since then, the A.I. software has made steady inroads.“The reality is A.I. has not disrupted the legal industry,” said Ben Allgrove, a partner at the firm and its chief innovation officer.The rapid progress in large language models — the technology engine for ChatGPT — is a significant advance, Mr. Allgrove said. Reading, analyzing and summarizing, he said, are fundamental legal skills. “At its best, the technology seems like a very smart paralegal, and it will improve,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe impact, Mr. Allgrove said, will be to force everyone in the profession, from paralegals to $1,000-an-hour partners, to move up the skills ladder to stay ahead of the technology. The work of humans, he said, will increasingly be to focus on developing industry expertise, exercising judgment in complex legal matters, and offering strategic guidance and building trusted relationships with clients.Technology has eliminated large numbers of jobs in recent years, and not just robots taking over factories. Personal computers, productivity software and the internet have made office work more efficient, replacing many workers.Office and administrative support occupations, including secretaries, clerks, bill collectors and office assistants, employ 1.3 million fewer workers than in 1990, according to an analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Labor Department forecasts further decline, with 880,000 fewer jobs in those occupations by 2031.“Technology is a driver, and there are large changes, but they tend to come gradually over a decade or more,” said Michael Wolf, the division chief for occupational employment projections at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The bureau’s current outlook is that jobs for lawyers and paralegals will continue to grow faster than the labor market as a whole. Mr. Wolf is closely watching the arrival of the new A.I. software, but he said it was too early to assess what the technology’s long-term impact would be.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLawyers are mostly putting the technology through test runs. The issues of data protection and client confidentiality are critical in legal work. The legal profession resisted using email until information-handling rules were established.And the software models’ tendency to make up things confidently is alarming — and an invitation to malpractice suits — in a profession that hinges on finding and weighing facts.To help address those concerns, law firms often use software that runs on top of something like ChatGPT and is fine-tuned for legal work. The tailored software has been developed by legal tech start-ups like Casetext and Harvey.Load in a case’s documents and ask the software to draft deposition questions, for example, and in a few minutes it will spit out a list of pertinent questions, lawyers say.“For the things it can do well, it does them stunningly well,” said Bennett Borden, a partner and the chief data scientist at DLA Piper, a large corporate law firm.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSuccessfully using the A.I. requires ample relevant data and questions that are detailed and specific, Mr. Borden said. More open-ended questions, like what’s the most important evidence, or who are the most credible witnesses, are still a struggle for the A.I.Lawyers at big firms have seen significant time savings for certain jobs and view the technology as a tool to make teams of lawyers and paralegals more productive. Sole practitioners see the technology more as a partner in practice.Valdemar L. Washington, a lawyer in Flint, Mich., was selected last fall to test the software from Casetext, called CoCounsel, which works with the latest ChatGPT technology.Mr. Washington used the software in a suit against the City of Flint claiming that residents were overcharged on water and sewer rates and service fees. He loaded more than 400 pages of documents, and the software quickly reviewed them and wrote a summary that pointed him to an important gap in the defense’s case.The program did in a few minutes what would have taken him several hours, he said.“It’s a real game changer,” Mr. Washington said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut how much the legal profession will change, and how soon, is uncertain.The new A.I. is a challenge to the status quo. Higher productivity means fewer billable hours, yet hourly billing remains the dominant business model in legal work. A.I. should increase the pressure from corporate clients to pay law firms for work done rather than time spent. But top corporate legal officers — the customers — are typically former partners and associates in big law firms, steeped in the same traditions.“There is a huge opportunity for A.I. in legal services, but the professional culture is very conservative,” said Raj Goyle, an adviser to legal tech companies and a Harvard Law School graduate. “The future is coming, but it will not be as fast as some predict.”Steve Lohr covers technology, economics and work force issues.

Since the advent of the transformer architecture in 2017, we’ve seen exponential advancements in the complexity of natural language tasks that these models can tackle from classification, to intent & sentiment extraction, to generating text eerily similar to humans.From an application standpoint, the possibilities seem endless when combining LLMs with various existing technologies, to cover their pitfalls (one of my favorite being the GPT + Wolfram Alpha combo to handle math and symbolic reasoning problems).But what surprised me was that LLMs can also be used as recommendation systems, in and of themselves, without the need for any additional feature engineering or other manual processes that go into common rec systems. This capability is largely due to the nature of how LLMs are pre-trained and how they operate.Table of ContentsA Recap of LLMs and How Transformers WorkLLMs as Recommendation SystemsImplementing/Replicating P5 with Custom DataReplication Attempt 2 — ArabicBenefits and Pitfalls of LLMs as Recommendation SystemsFinal ThoughtsCodeA Recap of LLMs and How Transformers WorkLanguage models are probabilistic models that try to map the probability of a sequence of tokens (words in a phrase, sentence, etc.) occurring. They’re trained on an array of texts, and derive probability distributions accordingly. For the various tasks that they can handle (summarization, question-answering, etc.) they are iteratively selecting the most probable token/word to continue a prompt, using conditional probability. See the example below:An example of probabilities of subsequent tokens based on context (Image by author)LLMs are language models that have been trained on MASSIVE amounts of text with large architectures that utilize significant amounts of compute. These are commonly powered by the transformer architecture, which was introduced in the famous 2017 paper “Attention Is All You Need” by Google. This architecture utilizes a “self-attention” mechanism, which allows the model to learn how different tokens relate to one another during the pre-training process.After pre-training across a large enough set of texts, similar words will have similar embeddings (ex: “King”, “Monarch”) and dissimilar words will have more different ones. Additionally, with these embeddings, we’ll see an algebraic mapping of words in relation to one another, allowing the model to more powerfully determine a correct next token for a sequence.Like the classic example of “King — Man + Woman = Queen” in Word2VecThe added benefit of self-attention embeddings is that they will vary for a word depending on the words around it, making them more tailored to the meaning in that context.Stanford’s Dr. Christopher Manning gives a great high-level overview of how LLMs work.LLMs as Recommendation SystemsIn 2022, researchers from Rutger’s University published the paper “Recommendation as Language Processing (RLP): A Unified Pretrain, Personalized Prompt & Predict Paradigm (P5)” (Geng et. al). In it they introduced a “flexible and unified text-to-text paradigm” which combined several recommendation tasks in a single system: P5. This system is capable of performing the following via natural language sequences:Sequential recommendationRating predictionExplanation generationReview summarizationDirect recommendationLet’s take a look at an example of the sequential recommendation task from the paper.Input: ""I find the purchase history list of user_15466:4110 -> 4467 -> 4468 -> 4472I wonder what is the next item to recommend to the user. Can you helpme decide?""Output: ""1581""The researchers assigned the user and each item a unique ID. Using a training set with thousands of users (and their purchase histories) and unique items, the LLM is able to learn that certain items are similar to one another and that certain users have inclinations towards certain items (due to the nature of the self-attention mechanism). During the pre-training process across all these purchase sequences, the model essentially goes through a form of collaborative filtering. It sees what users have purchased the same items and what items tend to be purchased together. Combine that with an LLM’s ability to produce contextual embeddings, and we suddenly have a very powerful recommendation system.In the example above, although we don’t know what item each ID corresponds to, we can infer that item “1581” was selected due to other users purchasing it along with any of the items that “user_15466” already purchased.With regards to P5’s architecture, it “utilizes the pretrained T5 checkpoints as backbone” (Geng et. al).T5 is another LLM that Google released a few years ago. It was designed to handle multiple types of sequence-to-sequence tasks, so it makes sense to use it as a starting point for this kind of system.Implementing/Replicating P5 with Custom DataI was really impressed with this paper and wanted to see if I could replicate the sequential recommendation capability on a smaller scale. I decided to leverage an open-source T5 model from Hugging Face (T5-large) and made my own custom dataset to fine-tune it to produce recommendations.The dataset I made consisted of over 100 examples of sports equipment purchases along with the next item to be purchased. For example:Input: “Soccer Goal Post, Soccer Ball, Soccer Cleats, Goalie Gloves”Target Output: “Soccer Jersey”Of course, to make this more robust, I decided to use a more specific prompt. Which looked like this:Input: “ITEMS PURCHASED: {Soccer Goal Post, Soccer Ball, Soccer Cleats, Goalie Gloves} — CANDIDATES FOR RECOMMENDATION: {Soccer Jersey, Basketball Jersey, Football Jersey, Baseball Jersey, Tennis Shirt, Hockey Jersey, Basketball, Football, Baseball, Tennis Ball, Hockey Puck, Basketball Shoes, Football Cleats, Baseball Cleats, Tennis Shoes, Hockey Helmet, Basketball Arm Sleeve, Football Shoulder Pads, Baseball Cap, Tennis Racket, Hockey Skates, Basketball Hoop, Football Helmet, Baseball Bat, Hockey Stick, Soccer Cones, Basketball Shorts, Baseball Glove, Hockey Pads, Soccer Shin Guards, Soccer Shorts} — RECOMMENDATION: ”Target Output: “Soccer Jersey”Above you can see the specification of items purchased by the user so far, followed by a list of candidates for recommendation that haven’t been purchased yet (this is the entire inventory).After fine-tuning the T5 model using Hugging Face’s Trainer API (Seq2SeqTrainer for ~10 epochs), I got some surprisingly good results! Some example evaluations:Input: “ITEMS PURCHASED: {Soccer Jersey, Soccer Goal Post, Soccer Cleats, Goalie Gloves} — CANDIDATES FOR RECOMMENDATION: {Basketball Jersey, Football Jersey, Baseball Jersey, Tennis Shirt, Hockey Jersey, Soccer Ball, Basketball, Football, Baseball, Tennis Ball, Hockey Puck, Basketball Shoes, Football Cleats, Baseball Cleats, Tennis Shoes, Hockey Helmet, Basketball Arm Sleeve, Football Shoulder Pads, Baseball Cap, Tennis Racket, Hockey Skates, Basketball Hoop, Football Helmet, Baseball Bat, Hockey Stick, Soccer Cones, Basketball Shorts, Baseball Glove, Hockey Pads, Soccer Shin Guards, Soccer Shorts} — RECOMMENDATION: ”Model Output: “​​Soccer Ball”Input: “ITEMS PURCHASED: {Basketball Jersey, Basketball, Basketball Arm Sleeve} — CANDIDATES FOR RECOMMENDATION: {Soccer Jersey, Football Jersey, Baseball Jersey, Tennis Shirt, Hockey Jersey, Soccer Ball, Football, Baseball, Tennis Ball, Hockey Puck, Soccer Cleats, Basketball Shoes, Football Cleats, Baseball Cleats, Tennis Shoes, Hockey Helmet, Goalie Gloves, Football Shoulder Pads, Baseball Cap, Tennis Racket, Hockey Skates, Soccer Goal Post, Basketball Hoop, Football Helmet, Baseball Bat, Hockey Stick, Soccer Cones, Basketball Shorts, Baseball Glove, Hockey Pads, Soccer Shin Guards, Soccer Shorts} — RECOMMENDATION: ”Model Output: “Basketball Shoes”This is of course subjective given that recommendations aren’t necessarily binary successes/failures, but the outputs being similar to the respective purchases so far is impressive.Replication Attempt 2 — ArabicNext, I wanted to see if I could do this for Arabic, so I translated my dataset and looked for some publicly available T5 models that could handle Arabic text (AraT5, MT5, etc.). After trying out a dozen or so variants I found on the Hugging Face Hub, I unfortunately couldn’t get it to produce acceptable results.The model (after fine-tuning) would recommend the same 1 or 2 items, regardless of the purchase history — typically “كرة القدم”, a “soccer ball” (but hey, maybe it knows that Arabic speakers love soccer and are always looking for a new soccer ball). Even after trying larger versions of these models, like MT5-xl, I got the same result. This is likely due to the data paucity these LLMs have on languages other than English.For my last attempt, I decided to try using the Google Translate API in conjunction with my English fine-tuned T5 model. The process was:Take the Arabic input → Translate to English → Feed into the English fine-tuned model → Get model prediction in English → Translate back to ArabicUnfortunately, this still didn’t help much since the translator would make some mistakes (ex: “كرة القدم”, which we’re using in place of “soccer” directly translates to “foot ball”), which threw the model off and resulted in the same 1–2 items being recommended consistently.Benefits and Pitfalls of LLMs as Recommendation SystemsThe most prominent benefits of this technique revolve around the ease of which it can be implemented as a stand-alone system. Because of the nature of LLMs and pre-training techniques discussed above, we can bypass the need for heavy, manual feature engineering — the model should be able to learn the representations and relationships naturally. Additionally, we can sidestep the cold start problem for new items to an extent — the name/description of the item can be extracted and naturally related to existing items that users have already purchased/selected.There are, however, some pitfalls to this approach (don’t throw away your current rec systems just yet!) which primarily entail a lack of control on what’s recommended.Because there’s no weighting for the different actions/events that a user takes to examine, then purchase an item, we’re solely dependent on what the LLM predicts is the most probable next token(s) for recommendation. We can’t take into consideration what the user bookmarked, looked at for a period of time, put into their cart, etc.Additionally, with these LLMs, we do run the risk that most of the recommendations are similarity based (i.e. items that are semantically similar to the items purchased so far), though I do think with extensive training data of user purchase history, we can ameliorate this issue via the “collaborative filtering” approach that this method could mimic.Finally, because LLMs can produce any text theoretically, the output could be a string that doesn’t exactly match an item in the inventory (though I think the likelihood of this occurring is low).Final ThoughtsBased on the results of the P5 paper and my attempt to replicate this on a T5 model with some fine-tuning and prompting, I would infer that this technique could be used across MANY language models. Using more powerful sequence-to-sequence models could help dramatically, especially if the fine-tuning data is large enough and the prompting technique is perfected.However, I wouldn’t go as far as to recommend (no pun intended) that anyone use this method in and of itself. I would suggest that it be used in conjunction with other recommendation system techniques, so that we can avoid the pitfalls mentioned above while simultaneously reaping the rewards. How this can be done — I’m not certain, but I think with some creativity, this LLM technique can be integrated in a helpful manner (maybe with extracting embedding-based features to use in collaborative filtering, maybe in conjunction with the “Two Tower” architecture, the possibilities go on).CodeMy implementation of T5 as a recommendation system (Github Repository)My fine-tuned T5 model on Hugging Face (Hugging Face Hub)References[1] S.

Advocacy organizations have a lot on their plates, and any tool that can save them time and energy while still producing high-quality work is a valuable addition to their toolkit. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), it’s no surprise that many advocacy professionals are exploring new tools to help them with their work. 
AI can be particularly useful for writing and editing advocacy content, improving email campaigns, and creating multimedia content. As AI technology continues to advance, advocacy organizations that embrace these tools will be able to work more efficiently and effectively than ever before. Whether you’re a seasoned advocacy professional or just starting out, AI tools have the potential to revolutionize the way you work and help you achieve your goals more efficiently and effectively than ever before. 
That introduction was entirely written with the generative AI tool ChatGPT, with some light editing. Impressed? Read on to learn how generative artificial intelligence can help your advocacy efforts.
AI for Small Advocacy Teams
If you work in a small advocacy team (or if you alone are the team), having the budget or personnel needed to get it all done is often a luxury you can only dream of. With 58 percent of government affairs and advocacy professionals on teams of just 1-3 people, according to a recent FiscalNote industry report, the challenges small teams face are common to a large number of advocacy professionals. 
AI tools are one of the ways you can expand your advocacy outreach without hiring additional staff. For example, video editors like Wisecut leverage AI and voice recognition to automatically edit your videos, add captions and take out pauses. This means you can get more done with a lean team, making AI a must-have for organizations operating on a tight budget. 


 ”""Sometimes we hesitate to take the human factor out of things, but time is money."" William DevoeDirector of communications and advocacy, Cerebral Palsy Associations of New York State


Create Advocacy Content with AI Tools
Some advocacy professionals are hesitant to employ AI tools to create content, but William Devoe, director of communications and advocacy at Cerebral Palsy Associations of New York State, said they should be willing to let go of some creativity and control and allow AI to do its thing. 
“Sometimes we hesitate to take the human factor out of things, but time is money,” he advised at a recent VoterVoice advocacy event. “See if you can automate some of that stuff and free up some of your time. I would encourage [you] to play around with ChatGPT and give it some prompts and see what it does for you.”  
ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022, has many potential uses for your advocacy efforts. Generative AI tools can get you started with a press release, a template letter for advocates to send lawmakers, an email update, or an outline for a blog. 
For example, Devoe recently gave ChatGPT some prompts and asked it to write a press release for an advocacy coalition. “It was amazing,” he said. “With only very minor edits, it would have been something we could have sent out.” 
ChatGPT can also help create different versions of an advocacy message to send legislators since they can get tired of seeing an identical message many times. “Legislators catch on if they get the same five emails carbon copied,” said Rachel Coffman, president at Coffman Collaborative. “But with ChatGPT, you can ask it to rewrite the template in several different ways that you can send out to your advocates so you’re not constantly bombarding their inboxes with the same blanket template.” 
ChatGPT isn’t the only AI tool that can help with writing: other popular options are Jasper, Anyword, and INK. These tools can help your content rank higher on search engines, create effective ad copy, and get predictive metrics and insights into how your content will perform with your target audience.
In addition to helping with written content, AI tools like DALL-E can generate realistic images and art from a written description. This can save your advocacy team the cost of purchasing images for use in campaigns and communications. 
Optimize Advocacy Communications With AI Features
Another practical use for AI is to improve your emails to advocates and get them to take action. Since inboxes are flooded with hundreds of emails every day, it’s vital to use the subject lines and email text most likely to hold their attention. 
An advocacy platform like VoterVoice offers built-in AI that uses open and click rate best practices to prompt suggestions to your email copy to get the best results. This makes it easier to compose effective emails by highlighting best practices and offering suggestions as you write. You also get data-driven suggestions on subject line and message length, phrases that trigger spam filters, and the number, type, and placement of links. You can even maximize your impact by ensuring you send messages at peak open and action times with VoterVoice’s email scheduling feature.
And when it comes to making sure your emails’ spelling and grammar is on point, Grammarly is a useful tool. As you write, Grammarly supplies suggestions to fix your spelling, improve grammar, and write more concisely. 
AI as Your Personal Assistant at Work

In addition to helping directly with advocacy work, AI can help with a variety of other daily work tasks. From helping you draft a cover letter or resume to collating information on any topic, AI can act as a personal assistant to help you be more productive and effective in your job. One example is Reclaim, a smart calendar tool that helps you schedule your time. With Reclaim, you can auto-block time for tasks and routines, find the best time for one-on-one meetings, and add breaks and travel time around meetings. 
Another valuable use of AI is the notetaking tools widely available. Coffman uses Notes by Dubber to transcribe meetings as they’re happening so she can pay full attention to the conversation rather than worrying about taking notes. Then, she puts the transcription into ChatGPT and asks it to summarize the meeting in bullet points for her review. 
Pair AI With Your Advocacy Software Solution
The AI built into VoterVoice provides real-time suggestions to instantly improve your communications and campaign effectiveness. You can easily see which issues are firing up your advocates, then maximize email success using SmartCheck, an embedded tool that makes call-to-action recommendations based on the most up-to-date best practices. Plus, VoterVoice’s advocate ranking and issue tracking technology helps you understand which supporters are most active and which issues spur the most responses. 
Leverage cutting-edge technology and fuel your advocacy efforts with VoterVoice, the only AI-driven advocacy platform on the market. VoterVoice uses AI and data science for ease of information, benchmarks, and suggestions. Thanks to that injection of AI, VoterVoice makes it easier to take action with pre-populated contact details, understand your campaign successes (and opportunities for improvement) with peer benchmarking, and drive engagement with AI-powered suggestions.

YORK COUNTY, Pa. — Artificial intelligence is now becoming more sophisticated and it has basically eliminated the old red flags we used to tell you to watch out for when it comes to scams. 

Recently, a scammer tried to trick a FOX43 employee to take a new job, but she was able to spot the red flags before losing any money. 







FOX43 Finds Out how artificial intelligence is making it harder to tell if a job posting is real or fake. 

""The initial person who told me it was a scam was my mom because moms are good at that sort of thing,"" said Melanie Crisamore, who is talking about an email about a potential job. 

""I received an email from somebody named Nicholas Wolf who said he was part of the HR department at the Washington Post,"" she explained. 

Crisamore checked the email address from the sender and it seemed like the real thing. 

""I thought it was off because I never applied for this position,"" said Crisamore, but she knows companies hire recruiters, especially in today's job market. 

The job seemed like a sweet deal too: $55 dollars an hour, flexible hours, and remote work. After an initial conversation, she was told the VP of Human Resources would reach out to her. She started googling his name. 

""His LinkedIn pops up. He's worked at the Post for 17 years. At this point, this LinkedIn looks very legit. He's the VP of HR he has a picture, a person, and an address, everything to me looks legitimate,"" said Crisamore. 

When she took the call, the person kept pushing the idea that she would have to buy an iPad. That was the red flag. 

She said, ""Buy this iPad from your mobile carrier and we will put your bank information into it and give you a reimbursement. So that's their shtick."" 

At this point, she knew it was a scam. 

""They could have easily created a job description just for me enough that I thought to myself 'This is perfect!' and that's their thing,"" said Crisamore. 

Dr. Bruce Young, a cybersecurity expert at Harrisburg University, says artificial intelligence is the technology used in this scam, adding ""Artificial intelligence is able to go out and pull very specific information that's real from social media accounts.""

He says a scam like this may only take a few minutes to create, ""Somebody can go out, pull all this information together, put together a scam, or a campaign, and just target it out."" 

New ways to spot a fake email address 




Remember that email address that looked real? 

Crisamore learned a new way to double check that.  

It took several steps to eventually get the IP address of that email - which led her back to name cheap inc. which is a domain hosting site. 

""It's so scary to think that in our world you have to go through 5 or 6 steps to make sure that you are safe, but it can happen to anybody and it happens every single day,"" said Crisamore. 

Young says your best defense is finding a phone number yourself and picking up the phone to confirm everything you're being told is true.

Today, most of your workforce wouldn’t identify themselves as content creators or even knowledge workers. However, many individuals throughout your company are constantly tasked with producing and curating content. Whether they are summarizing meeting notes, conducting research for a report or preparing documentation for a new product launch, they are frequently waist deep in creating, editing and sharing information both internally and externally.


A small portion of this content is highly strategic to your business—it must be high-quality, authoritative and original. Nobody will question the time and effort that’s spent on this content to get it right. While still important to your operations, the rest of the less strategic content being produced is mostly routine, mundane and repetitive. Even though this tactical form of content doesn’t need to be the equivalent of a gourmet meal, it still needs to be tasty, healthy and safe to eat. In other words, at a minimum, the content must be on point, clear, consistent and error-free.

Creating content can be an involved process as it can span multiple steps such as planning, researching, writing, editing and publishing. To move new content through all these stages on a weekly basis can often be a tedious and time-consuming process. While companies have been able to outsource some content creation responsibilities to outside contractors, technology solutions haven’t been able to significantly lessen the burden of content creation—until recently.

PROMOTED
Enter Generative AI
Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content such as text, images, audio and other media based on prompts from users. With the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT to the general public in November 2022, a tremor was felt around the world as the power of AI was democratized to the masses. In only five days after launching, the online service surpassed one million users—something that took Instagram two-and-a-half months and Spotify five months to accomplish. Now, countless startups and software applications have begun touting their own generative AI capabilities and integrations.

Many businesses are beginning to pay closer attention to what generative AI has to offer as well. In a recently released study by Salesforce, 57 percent of senior IT leaders believed generative AI is a ‘game changer.’ Even though a third of the respondents (515 IT leaders) felt it was overhyped, 80 percent of these skeptics still felt generative AI could help their organizations better serve their customers. Goldman Sachs Research predicts generative AI “could drive a seven percent (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.”

In a recent OpenAI study, researchers predicted that generative AI could impact at least ten percent of work tasks for approximately 80 percent of the US workforce. Nineteen percent of workers could see at least 50 percent of their tasks impacted. While the emergence of generative AI may end up displacing some workers, it will fundamentally transform how most people produce content, especially with the routine, repetitive and mundane tasks. ARK Big Ideas 2023 predicts that by 2030 knowledge workers will see a more than fourfold increase in productivity by leveraging AI technologies.

How will Generative AI transform worker productivity?
We are starting to get some glimpses into the productivity gains offered by generative AI. Research analyst Joachim Klement shared a couple of early studies that reveal its promise. The first study asked a group of programmers to complete a programming task. Half of the participants were given access to a generative AI (GitHub Copilot) and were able to complete the task in 71 minutes, which was about 56 percent less time than the programmers who didn’t use AI assistance (161 minutes).

In a second study, 200 university-educated professionals were given a writing task that half could use ChatGPT to complete. The AI-assisted participants were able to complete the task in less time—17 minutes compared to 27 minutes (a 37 percent boost in productivity). Not only where they faster but when the assignments were graded by independent judges, the AI-enabled participants received a higher average grade (B versus C+). The researchers also discovered the weaker participants benefited the most from using the generative AI technology, as it essentially leveled out the performance between low and top performers.
By combining the massive processing power of algorithms with the crowdsourced knowledge and expertise contained within its training data, generative AI helps workers shorten the time it takes to complete their tasks and enhances the quality of their outputs. Every worker can benefit from a personal assistant that can help perform manual tasks, help brainstorm ideas, proofread drafts, develop sample designs and so on. Eventually, generative AI technology will provide workforces with an array of specialized AI assistants to perform a variety of common tasks. Unlike their human counterparts, they are always available, willing to help and won’t care how you leverage their suggestions.
The productivity gains from generative AI will quickly emerge from several areas. A helpful way of understanding the sources of these efficiency gains is through the perspective of the key stages in content creation:Generative AI can assist with all five steps in the content creation process. Brent Dykes


Plan. Creating a strategy for what content you need and how you will approach it is an important first step in the process. Generative AI can provide guidance on building a plan for creating, structuring and deploying content. For example, an entrepreneur could prompt for an outline for her business plan or get help in devising a content calendar with recommendations on what topics and channels to target.
Research. Until now, research has primarily involved using search engines to scour the internet for relevant and trusted information. Now, based on simple prompts, generative AI can process a massive amount of information and produce summarized key findings on a topic. For instance, a product manager could use generative AI to research the top consumer pain points in relation to his new product concept and get comprehensive results related to the problem.
Write/design. Developing a first draft of any content can often be the most time-intensive step. Generative AI can streamline the process of creating an initial draft in whatever writing style and format you desire. For example, a senior manager can provide a generative AI tool with a set of bullet points on different market trends and have it write up an entire long form marketing blog post with relevant examples optimized around specific SEO keywords.
Edit/polish. Once you’ve created an initial draft, you often need to further revise, consolidate and improve it. While generative AI doesn’t remove the responsibility for human editing—and may even require more oversight—it can also contribute to streamlining your editing process. For instance, a sales representative can use generative AI to proofread an RFP response for sentence structure and word choice as well as experiment with different tones or styles to better match the sales opportunity.
Publish. After you finalize your content, you may need to format it differently so it can be distributed across different channels. Generative AI can be used to quickly refactor content to fit different formats. For example, a designer could use the technology to rapidly create and distribute variations of a single design across multiple social media channels.


From the inception to the delivery of content, generative AI can play an integral role in simplifying and streamlining each stage of the content creation process. When you aggregate the time savings across all these stages, you start to appreciate the tremendous value this technology offers. However, at this early stage in its development, organizations still need to be cautious with how it’s applied within their businesses.
Some bumps in the road before Generative AI can be fully adopted
Recently, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said artificial intelligence was the second biggest innovation in his lifetime after the graphical user interface in 1980. However, many business leaders are not yet convinced it’s ready for primetime—with good reasons too. While early results are promising and extremely compelling, more focus and attention will be needed on the following issues:


Accuracy concerns. Generative AI can’t always distinguish between fact and fiction. It can argue confidently that cow eggs are much bigger than chicken eggs. Without proper factchecking, users can be fed bad information that sounds coherent but is complete nonsense.
Privacy and security concerns. Sensitive (HIPAA) or proprietary information should not be shared with public generative AI tools. Unfortunately, companies such as Samsung are discovering their employees have uploaded confidential source code and strategic meeting notes into non-private generative AI tools.
Bias concerns. Currently, generative AI tools are mostly trained on data collected from the Internet. Human biases that are rampant online become ingrained in these algorithms, and they end up further reinforcing prejudices based on gender, race, nationality and politics. Microsoft’s Tay—a Twitter chatbot—and Meta’s Galactica—a large learning model (LLM) based on scientific articles—were both quickly shut down (16 hours and three days respectively) after they were caught mimicking sexist and racist language.
Ethical concerns. When generative AI’s training data relies on the text and images from other people, it raises concerns about attribution and intellectual property. Getty Images recently sued Stable Diffusion for copyright infringement when the art generative AI tool copied 12 million images for training purposes without permission or attribution to the artists. In addition, generative AI can be used to create deepfakes, misinformation and propaganda.


Before organizations can fully embrace this promising technology, more work on standards, policies and guidelines must be done by vendors, governments and client organizations to help mitigate these issues. Generative AI is going to play an important but disruptive role in how we work going forward. While your organization can choose to wait until everything is figured out, it may not be the best strategy based on the accelerating pace of AI innovation.
Start experimenting with Generative AI today
After years of business intelligence consulting experience, Nick Kelly started his own analytics training and consulting business that specializes in dashboard design and adoption. Like many other entrepreneurs, he was amazed by AI’s capabilities—but the technology also made him anxious about his future.
Rather than waiting to see how things would play out, Kelly launched a bold experiment. He challenged ChatGPT to replicate his expertise in creating the requirements for enterprise dashboards. He trained the generative AI tool using more than 50,000 words from his book and other training materials.
What he then discovered was astonishing. Using ChatGPT, he was able to rapidly generate industry-specific questions and a reasonable set of starting requirements to review with his clients, which greatly shortened the discovery process by hours. In addition, with ChatGPT, he found he could generate sample metrics for his dashboard wireframes that were largely aligned with industry standards and only needed minor revisions.
Although he was impressed with these results, Kelly was still skeptical of whether generative AI could also help with dashboard UI design. In general, he has found professionals struggle the most with the design aspects. However, using Midjourney—an image-focused generative AI—Kelly discovered he was able to produce visually stunning mock designs in a fraction of the time it took him previously. The color choices and design cues from these AI-generated mock-ups inspired more appealing interfaces for his dashboards.
Prior to his experiment, Kelly felt threatened by generative AI and skeptical of how it could help his business. Now, he is adapting his skills to this transformative technology and integrating AI tools throughout his new process. The results have been impressive—greater efficiency, wowed clients and a sharpened focus on how he can deliver more value.
Author Frank Herbert said, “Technology is both a tool for helping humans and for destroying them. This is the paradox of our times which we’re compelled to face.” While your organization must be careful how it uses generative AI, you’ll benefit from the lessons your teams learn now as the technology continues to mature. The productivity stakes are too high to cling to the status quo and not explore how generative AI can enhance your existing workflows. Personally, I’m excited to test this technology within my own data storytelling business—and I hope you are too.

The seeds of a machine learning (ML) paradigm shift have existed for decades, but with the ready availability of scalable compute capacity, a massive proliferation of data, and the rapid advancement of ML technologies, customers across industries are transforming their businesses. Just recently, generative AI applications like ChatGPT have captured widespread attention and imagination. We are truly at an exciting inflection point in the widespread adoption of ML, and we believe most customer experiences and applications will be reinvented with generative AI.
AI and ML have been a focus for Amazon for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers use with Amazon are driven by ML. Our e-commerce recommendations engine is driven by ML; the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers are driven by ML; and our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are informed by ML. Prime Air (our drones) and the computer vision technology in Amazon Go (our physical retail experience that lets consumers select items off a shelf and leave the store without having to formally check out) use deep learning. Alexa, powered by more than 30 different ML systems, helps customers billions of times each week to manage smart homes, shop, get information and entertainment, and more. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to ML, and it’s a big part of our heritage, current ethos, and future.
At AWS, we have played a key role in democratizing ML and making it accessible to anyone who wants to use it, including more than 100,000 customers of all sizes and industries. AWS has the broadest and deepest portfolio of AI and ML services at all three layers of the stack. We’ve invested and innovated to offer the most performant, scalable infrastructure for cost-effective ML training and inference; developed Amazon SageMaker, which is the easiest way for all developers to build, train, and deploy models; and launched a wide range of services that allow customers to add AI capabilities like image recognition, forecasting, and intelligent search to applications with a simple API call. This is why customers like Intuit, Thomson Reuters, AstraZeneca, Ferrari, Bundesliga, 3M, and BMW, as well as thousands of startups and government agencies around the world, are transforming themselves, their industries, and their missions with ML. We take the same democratizing approach to generative AI: we work to take these technologies out of the realm of research and experiments and extend their availability far beyond a handful of startups and large, well-funded tech companies. That’s why today I’m excited to announce several new innovations that will make it easy and practical for our customers to use generative AI in their businesses.


Building with Generative AI on AWS

Generative AI and foundation models
Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. Like all AI, generative AI is powered by ML models—very large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data and commonly referred to as Foundation Models (FMs). Recent advancements in ML (specifically the invention of the transformer-based neural network architecture) have led to the rise of models that contain billions of parameters or variables. To give a sense for the change in scale, the largest pre-trained model in 2019 was 330M parameters. Now, the largest models are more than 500B parameters—a 1,600x increase in size in just a few years. Today’s FMs, such as the large language models (LLMs) GPT3.5 or BLOOM, and the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion from Stability AI, can perform a wide range of tasks that span multiple domains, like writing blog posts, generating images, solving math problems, engaging in dialog, and answering questions based on a document. The size and general-purpose nature of FMs make them different from traditional ML models, which typically perform specific tasks, like analyzing text for sentiment, classifying images, and forecasting trends.
FMs can perform so many more tasks because they contain such a large number of parameters that make them capable of learning complex concepts. And through their pre-training exposure to internet-scale data in all its various forms and myriad of patterns, FMs learn to apply their knowledge within a wide range of contexts. While the capabilities and resulting possibilities of a pre-trained FM are amazing, customers get really excited because these generally capable models can also be customized to perform domain-specific functions that are differentiating to their businesses, using only a small fraction of the data and compute required to train a model from scratch. The customized FMs can create a unique customer experience, embodying the company’s voice, style, and services across a wide variety of consumer industries, like banking, travel, and healthcare. For instance, a financial firm that needs to auto-generate a daily activity report for internal circulation using all the relevant transactions can customize the model with proprietary data, which will include past reports, so that the FM learns how these reports should read and what data was used to generate them.
The potential of FMs is incredibly exciting. But, we are still in the very early days. While ChatGPT has been the first broad generative AI experience to catch customers’ attention, most folks studying generative AI have quickly come to realize that several companies have been working on FMs for years, and there are several different FMs available—each with unique strengths and characteristics. As we’ve seen over the years with fast-moving technologies, and in the evolution of ML, things change rapidly. We expect new architectures to arise in the future, and this diversity of FMs will set off a wave of innovation. We’re already seeing new application experiences never seen before. AWS customers have asked us how they can quickly take advantage of what is out there today (and what is likely coming tomorrow) and quickly begin using FMs and generative AI within their businesses and organizations to drive new levels of productivity and transform their offerings.
Announcing Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Titan models, the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with FMs
Customers have told us there are a few big things standing in their way today. First, they need a straightforward way to find and access high-performing FMs that give outstanding results and are best-suited for their purposes. Second, customers want integration into applications to be seamless, without having to manage huge clusters of infrastructure or incur large costs. Finally, customers want it to be easy to take the base FM, and build differentiated apps using their own data (a little data or a lot). Since the data customers want to use for customization is incredibly valuable IP, they need it to stay completely protected, secure, and private during that process, and they want control over how their data is shared and used.
We took all of that feedback from customers, and today we are excited to announce Amazon Bedrock, a new service that makes FMs from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon accessible via an API. Bedrock is the easiest way for customers to build and scale generative AI-based applications using FMs, democratizing access for all builders. Bedrock will offer the ability to access a range of powerful FMs for text and images—including Amazon’s Titan FMs, which consist of two new LLMs we’re also announcing today—through a scalable, reliable, and secure AWS managed service. With Bedrock’s serverless experience, customers can easily find the right model for what they’re trying to get done, get started quickly, privately customize FMs with their own data, and easily integrate and deploy them into their applications using the AWS tools and capabilities they are familiar with, without having to manage any infrastructure (including integrations with Amazon SageMaker ML features like Experiments to test different models and Pipelines to manage their FMs at scale).
Bedrock customers can choose from some of the most cutting-edge FMs available today. This includes the Jurassic-2 family of multilingual LLMs from AI21 Labs, which follow natural language instructions to generate text in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, and Dutch. Claude, Anthropic’s LLM, can perform a wide variety of conversational and text processing tasks and is based on Anthropic’s extensive research into training honest and responsible AI systems. Bedrock also makes it easy to access Stability AI’s suite of text-to-image foundation models, including Stable Diffusion (the most popular of its kind), which is capable of generating unique, realistic, high-quality images, art, logos, and designs.
One of the most important capabilities of Bedrock is how easy it is to customize a model. Customers simply point Bedrock at a few labeled examples in Amazon S3, and the service can fine-tune the model for a particular task without having to annotate large volumes of data (as few as 20 examples is enough). Imagine a content marketing manager who works at a leading fashion retailer and needs to develop fresh, targeted ad and campaign copy for an upcoming new line of handbags. To do this, they provide Bedrock a few labeled examples of their best performing taglines from past campaigns, along with the associated product descriptions. Bedrock makes a separate copy of the base foundational model that is accessible only to the customer and trains this private copy of the model. After training, Bedrock will automatically start generating effective social media, display ad, and web copy for the new handbags. None of the customer’s data is used to train the original base models, and since all data is encrypted and does not leave a customer’s Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), customers can trust that their data will remain private and confidential.
Bedrock is now in limited preview, and customers like Coda are excited about how fast their development teams have gotten up and running. Shishir Mehrotra, Co-founder and CEO of Coda, says, “As a longtime happy AWS customer, we’re excited about how Amazon Bedrock can bring quality, scalability, and performance to Coda AI. Since all our data is already on AWS, we are able to quickly incorporate generative AI using Bedrock, with all the security and privacy we need to protect our data built-in. With over tens of thousands of teams running on Coda, including large teams like Uber, the New York Times, and Square, reliability and scalability are really important.”
We have been previewing Amazon’s new Titan FMs with a few customers before we make them available more broadly in the coming months. We’ll initially have two Titan models. The first is a generative LLM for tasks such as summarization, text generation (for example, creating a blog post), classification, open-ended Q&A, and information extraction. The second is an embeddings LLM that translates text inputs (words, phrases or possibly large units of text) into numerical representations (known as embeddings) that contain the semantic meaning of the text. While this LLM will not generate text, it is useful for applications like personalization and search because by comparing embeddings the model will produce more relevant and contextual responses than word matching. In fact, Amazon.com’s product search capability uses a similar embeddings model among others to help customers find the products they’re looking for. To continue supporting best practices in the responsible use of AI, Titan FMs are built to detect and remove harmful content in the data, reject inappropriate content in the user input, and filter the models’ outputs that contain inappropriate content (such as hate speech, profanity, and violence).
Bedrock makes the power of FMs accessible to companies of all sizes so that they can accelerate the use of ML across their organizations and build their own generative AI applications because it will be easy for all developers. We think Bedrock will be a massive step forward in democratizing FMs, and our partners like Accenture, Deloitte, Infosys, and Slalom are building practices to help enterprises go faster with generative AI. Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) like C3 AI and Pega are excited to leverage Bedrock for easy access to its great selection of FMs with all of the security, privacy, and reliability they expect from AWS.
Announcing the general availability of Amazon EC2 Trn1n instances powered by AWS Trainium and Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances powered by AWS Inferentia2, the most cost-effective cloud infrastructure for generative AI
Whatever customers are trying to do with FMs—running them, building them, customizing them—they need the most performant, cost-effective infrastructure that is purpose-built for ML. Over the last five years, AWS has been investing in our own silicon to push the envelope on performance and price performance for demanding workloads like ML training and Inference, and our AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips offer the lowest cost for training models and running inference in the cloud. This ability to maximize performance and control costs by choosing the optimal ML infrastructure is why leading AI startups, like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Grammarly, Hugging Face, Runway, and Stability AI run on AWS.
Trn1 instances, powered by Trainium, can deliver up to 50% savings on training costs over any other EC2 instance, and are optimized to distribute training across multiple servers connected with 800 Gbps of second-generation Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) networking. Customers can deploy Trn1 instances in UltraClusters that can scale up to 30,000 Trainium chips (more than 6 exaflops of compute) located in the same AWS Availability Zone with petabit scale networking. Many AWS customers, including Helixon, Money Forward, and the Amazon Search team, use Trn1 instances to help reduce the time required to train the largest-scale deep learning models from months to weeks or even days while lowering their costs. 800 Gbps is a lot of bandwidth, but we have continued to innovate to deliver more, and today we are announcing the general availability of new, network-optimized Trn1n instances, which offer 1600 Gbps of network bandwidth and are designed to deliver 20% higher performance over Trn1 for large, network-intensive models.
Today, most of the time and money spent on FMs goes into training them. This is because many customers are only just starting to deploy FMs into production. However, in the future, when FMs are deployed at scale, most costs will be associated with running the models and doing inference. While you typically train a model periodically, a production application can be constantly generating predictions, known as inferences, potentially generating millions per hour. And these predictions need to happen in real-time, which requires very low-latency and high-throughput networking. Alexa is a great example with millions of requests coming in every minute, which accounts for 40% of all compute costs.
Because we knew that most of the future ML costs would come from running inferences, we prioritized inference-optimized silicon when we started investing in new chips a few years ago. In 2018, we announced Inferentia, the first purpose-built chip for inference. Every year, Inferentia helps Amazon run trillions of inferences and has saved companies like Amazon over a hundred million dollars in capital expense already. The results are impressive, and we see many opportunities to keep innovating as workloads will only increase in size and complexity as more customers integrate generative AI into their applications.
That’s why we’re announcing today the general availability of Inf2 instances powered by AWS Inferentia2, which are optimized specifically for large-scale generative AI applications with models containing hundreds of billions of parameters. Inf2 instances deliver up to 4x higher throughput and up to 10x lower latency compared to the prior generation Inferentia-based instances. They also have ultra-high-speed connectivity between accelerators to support large-scale distributed inference. These capabilities drive up to 40% better inference price performance than other comparable Amazon EC2 instances and the lowest cost for inference in the cloud. Customers like Runway are seeing up to 2x higher throughput with Inf2 than comparable Amazon EC2 instances for some of their models. This high-performance, low-cost inference will enable Runway to introduce more features, deploy more complex models, and ultimately deliver a better experience for the millions of creators using Runway.
Announcing the general availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, free for individual developers
We know that building with the right FMs and running Generative AI applications at scale on the most performant cloud infrastructure will be transformative for customers. The new wave of experiences will also be transformative for users. With generative AI built-in, users will be able to have more natural and seamless interactions with applications and systems. Think of how we can unlock our mobile phones just by looking at them, without needing to know anything about the powerful ML models that make this feature possible.
One area where we foresee the use of generative AI growing rapidly is in coding. Software developers today spend a significant amount of their time writing code that is pretty straightforward and undifferentiated. They also spend a lot of time trying to keep up with a complex and ever-changing tool and technology landscape. All of this leaves developers less time to develop new, innovative capabilities and services. Developers try to overcome this by copying and modifying code snippets from the web, which can result in inadvertently copying code that doesn’t work, contains security vulnerabilities, or doesn’t track usage of open source software. And, ultimately, searching and copying still takes time away from the good stuff.
Generative AI can take this heavy lifting out of the equation by “writing” much of the undifferentiated code, allowing developers to build faster while freeing them up to focus on the more creative aspects of coding. This is why, last year, we announced the preview of Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI coding companion that uses a FM under the hood to radically improve developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real-time based on developers’ comments in natural language and prior code in their Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Developers can simply tell CodeWhisperer to do a task, such as “parse a CSV string of songs” and ask it to return a structured list based on values such as artist, title, and highest chart rank. CodeWhisperer provides a productivity boost by generating an entire function that parses the string and returns the list as specified. Developer response to the preview has been overwhelmingly positive, and we continue to believe that helping developers code could end up being one of the most powerful uses of generative AI we’ll see in the coming years. During the preview, we ran a productivity challenge, and participants who used CodeWhisperer completed tasks 57% faster, on average, and were 27% more likely to complete them successfully than those who didn’t use CodeWhisperer. This is a giant leap forward in developer productivity, and we believe this is only the beginning.
Today, we’re excited to announce the general availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer for Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#—plus ten new languages, including Go, Kotlin, Rust, PHP, and SQL. CodeWhisperer can be accessed from IDEs such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, AWS Cloud9, and many more via the AWS Toolkit IDE extensions. CodeWhisperer is also available in the AWS Lambda console. In addition to learning from the billions of lines of publicly available code, CodeWhisperer has been trained on Amazon code. We believe CodeWhisperer is now the most accurate, fastest, and most secure way to generate code for AWS services, including Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3.
Developers aren’t truly going to be more productive if code suggested by their generative AI tool contains hidden security vulnerabilities or fails to handle open source responsibly. CodeWhisperer is the only AI coding companion with built-in security scanning (powered by automated reasoning) for finding and suggesting remediations for hard-to-detect vulnerabilities, such as those in the top ten Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP), those that don’t meet crypto library best practices, and others. To help developers code responsibly, CodeWhisperer filters out code suggestions that might be considered biased or unfair, and CodeWhisperer is the only coding companion that can filter and flag code suggestions that resemble open source code that customers may want to reference or license for use.
We know generative AI is going to change the game for developers, and we want it to be useful to as many as possible. This is why CodeWhisperer is free for all individual users with no qualifications or time limits for generating code! Anyone can sign up for CodeWhisperer with just an email account and become more productive within minutes. You don’t even have to have an AWS account. For business users, we’re offering a CodeWhisperer Professional Tier that includes administration features like single sign-on (SSO) with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) integration, as well as higher limits on security scanning.
Building powerful applications like CodeWhisperer is transformative for developers and all our customers. We have a lot more coming, and we are excited about what you will build with generative AI on AWS. Our mission is to make it possible for developers of all skill levels and for organizations of all sizes to innovate using generative AI. This is just the beginning of what we believe will be the next wave of ML powering new possibilities for you.

The Upshot35 Ways Real People Are Using A.I. Right NowBy Francesca Paris and Larry BuchananApril 14, 2023Share full article710






	The public release of ChatGPT last fall kicked off a wave of interest in artificial intelligence. A.I. models have since snaked their way into many people’s everyday lives. Despite their flaws, ChatGPT and other A.I. tools are helping people to save time at work, to code without knowing how to code, to make daily life easier or just to have fun.


	It goes beyond everyday fiddling: In the last few years, companies and scholars have started to use A.I. to supercharge work they could never have imagined, designing new molecules with the help of an algorithm or building alien-like spaceship parts.


	Here’s how 35 real people are using A.I. for work, life, play and procrastination.





	People are using A.I. to …



	Plan gardens.


John Pritzlaff Gardener


	Mr. Pritzlaff is building a permaculture garden in his backyard in Phoenix, where he uses drought-resistant trees to give shade to other species.


	“I do these ultra-high-density planting arrangements,” he said. “And I’ve been employing ChatGPT to give me inspiration on species that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred to me, and for choosing the site for each tree: the best part of the yard with regard to the sun at different times of the year.”


	Taking into account his geographical location, it suggested, for example, that he might use a moringa tree to provide shade for a star apple.




	Plan workouts.


Louis Maddox Data scientist


	Mr. Maddox finds ChatGPT the perfect companion for his workouts. For example, one day he pasted in his workout notes and said:


	Give a concisely formatted summary of this workout and the muscle groups activated. Note any muscle groups that were missed and suggest how to cover them with extras/replacements.


	After summarizing the notes, ChatGPT said:


Missed Muscle Groups & Suggestions: Quadriceps: Add leg press, squats or lunges. Calves: Add standing or seated calf raises. Glute Activation: Consider adding glute bridges or hip thrusts for better glute focus.


	From there he asked ChatGPT what to prioritize if he didn’t have much time for the gym, and to sketch out roughly how long it might all take.


	It’s not perfect, he says, but it gets the job done. Mostly, he says, ChatGPT helps him get going under time constraints, and not let the busywork “become an excuse not to do it.”




	Plan meals.


Kelsey Szemborski Stay-at-home mother of three


	Ms. Szemborski is a busy mom who is “always on the lookout for something that will make my life easier.” So when she found ChatGPT, she tried asking it for a gluten-free meal plan. And she added:


	It needs to be both budget-friendly and also kid-friendly for kids who are picky eaters and we need to avoid peanuts. Please include a grocery list. Thank you!


	And ChatGPT obliged. Here’s the first day of a week’s meals:


	Breakfast: Gluten-free oatmeal with banana and honey  Snack: Fresh fruit (apples, bananas, oranges)  Lunch: Grilled cheese sandwich on gluten-free bread with tomato soup  Snack: Gluten-free crackers with hummus  Dinner: Slow-cooked beef stew with gluten-free biscuits


	“It completely eliminated my normal meal-planning process that involved searching for recipes, trying to think of meal ideas, configuring a list of all of those ideas, and then making a list of the ingredients I need, too.”




	Make a gift.


Matt Strain Technology and innovation consultant


	Mr. Strain used ChatGPT to create a custom book of cocktails based on the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine written in the style of the J. Peterman catalog. He took the idea further the next day, using DALL-E to generate images of the cocktails for the final book, which he gave to his girlfriend for Valentine’s Day.

	Design parts for spaceships.


Ryan McClelland NASA research engineer


	Mr. McClelland’s job is to design mission hardware that’s both light and strong. It’s a job that has always required a lot of trial and error.


	But where a human might make a couple of iterations in a week, the commercial A.I. tool he uses can go through 30 or 40 ideas in an hour. It’s also spitting back ideas that no human would come up with.



















The A.I.’s designs are stronger and lighter than human-designed parts, and they would be “very difficult to model” with the traditional engineering tools that NASA uses.
NASA/Henry Dennis



	“The resulting design is a third of the mass; it’s stiffer, stronger and lighter,” he said. “It comes up with things that, not only we wouldn’t think of, but we wouldn’t be able to model even if we did think of it.”


	Sometimes the A.I. errs in ways no human would: It might fill in a hole the part needs to attach to the rest of the craft.


	“It’s like collaborating with an alien,” he said.




	Organize a messy computer desktop.


Alex Cai College sophomore


	“I had a lot of unsorted notes lying around, and I wanted to get them sorted into my file system so I can find them more easily in the future. I basically just gave ChatGPT a directory, a list of all my folder names, and the names of all my files. And it gave me a list of which notes should go into which folders!”




	Write a wedding speech.


Jonathan Wegener Occasional wedding officiant


	Mr. Wegener and his girlfriend were officiating a friend’s wedding in December, but he procrastinated.


	“A few hours before, I said, ‘Can GPT-3 write this officiant speech?’” he recalled. “The first version was generic, full of platitudes. Then I steered it.”


	Adam is a great lover of plants


	“The speech came back with these beautiful metaphors. It nailed it.” It was just missing one important part.


	Can you add that thing about in sickness and in health?




	Write an email.


Nicholas Wirth Systems administrator


	Mr. Wirth uses ChatGPT to simplify tech jargon when he emails his bosses: “My organization specifically pays me to keep the computer’s internet online, and my own literacy is limited. I work with C-level executives, and their time is not to be wasted.”


	He also gets it to generate first drafts of long emails. He might say:


	I need a midsized summary email written pertaining to data not being given to us in time.


	He also asks for a bullet-point list of the concerns that have to be addressed in the email.


	And ChatGPT starts a reply:


	Subject: Data not received in time – Phone and internet provider informationHello [Name], I want to bring to your attention an issue we are facing with the data that was supposed to be provided to us by [Date.] As of now, we have not received the following information that is critical for our project …




	Get a first read.


Charles Becker Entrepreneurship professor


	“So I’ll have a paragraph I might be putting into a test for a student, or instructions. I say:


	Where might people have trouble with this? What’s unclear about this? What’s clear about this?


	“I generate a lot of writing both for my work and for my hobbies, and a lot of time I run out of people who are excited to give me first-pass edits.”




	Play devil’s advocate.


Paul De Salvo Data engineer


	“I use ChatGPT every day for work,” he said. “It feels like I’ve hired an intern.”


	Part of Mr. De Salvo’s job is convincing his bosses that they should replace certain tools. That means pitching them on why the old tool won’t cut it anymore.


	“I use ChatGPT to simulate arguments in favor of keeping the existing tool,” he said. “So that I can anticipate potential counterarguments.”








	Build a clock that gives you a new poem every minute.


Matt Webb Consultant and blogger



















Matt Webb



	“Yes, programmatic A.I. is useful,” he said. “But more than that, it’s enormous fun.”




	Organize research for a thesis.


Anicca Harriot Ph.D. student


	Anicca Harriott has been powering through her Ph.D. thesis in biology with the help of Scholarcy and Scite, among other A.I. tools that find, aggregate and summarize relevant papers.


	“Collectively, they take weeks off of the writing process.”




	Skim dozens of academic articles.


Pablo Peña Rodríguez Private equity analytics director


	Mr. Rodriguez works for a private equity fund that invests in soccer players. And that means reading a lot.


	“We use our own data sets and methodology, but I always want to have a solid understanding of the academic literature that has been published,” he said.


	Instead of picking through Google Scholar, he now uses an A.I. tool called Elicit. It lets him ask questions of the paper itself. It helps him find out, without having to read the whole thing, whether the paper touches on the question he’s asking.


	“It doesn’t immediately make me ‘smart,’ but it does allow me to have a very quick sense of which papers I should pay attention to when approaching a new question.”




	Cope with ADHD …


Rhiannon Payne Product marketer and author


	“With ADHD, getting started and getting an outline together is the hardest part,” Ms. Payne said. “Once that’s done, it’s a lot easier to let the work flow.”


	She writes content to run marketing tests. To get going, she feeds GPT a few blog posts she’s written on the subject, other materials she’s gathered and the customer profile.


	“Describing the audience I’m speaking to, that context is super important to actually get anything usable out of the tool,” she said. What comes back is a starter framework she can then change and build out.




	… and dyslexia, too.


Eugene Capon Tech founder


	Imagine yourself as a copywriter that I just hired to proofread documents.


	“Because I’m dyslexic, it takes me a really long time to get an article down on paper,” Mr. Capon said. “So the hack I’ve come up with is, I’ll dictate my entire article. Then I’ll have ChatGPT basically correct my spelling and grammar.


	“So something that was taking like a full day to do, I can now do in like an hour and a half.”




	Sort through an archive of pictures.


Daniel Patt Software engineer


	On From Numbers to Names, a site built by the Google engineer Daniel Patt in his free time, Holocaust survivors and family members can upload photos and scan through half a million pictures to find other pictures of their loved ones. It’s a task that otherwise would take a gargantuan number of hours.


	“We’re really using the A.I. to save time,” he said. “Time is of the essence, as survivors are getting older. I can’t think of any other way we could achieve what we’re doing with the identification and discoveries we’re making.”




	Transcribe a doctor’s visit into clinical notes.


 Dr. Jeff Gladd Integrative medicine physician


	Dr. Gladd uses Nabla’s Copilot to take notes during online medical consultations. It’s a Chrome extension that listens into the visit and grabs the necessary details for his charts. Before: Writing up notes after a visit took about 20 percent of consult time. Now: The whole task lasts as long as it takes him to copy and paste the results from Copilot.




	Appeal an insurance denial.


Dr. Jeffrey Ryckman Radiation oncologist


	Dr. Ryckman uses ChatGPT to write the notes he needs to send insurers when they’ve refused to pay for radiation treatment for one of his cancer patients.


	“What used to take me around a half-hour to write now takes one minute,” he said.


	Write an insurance rebuttal to an insurance company about treatment of the primary prostate tumor and single site of metastases. Make the tone polite but assertive. Use the terms ‘medically necessary’ and ‘would render the patient without evidence of radiographic disease.’




	Write Excel formulas.


Mike Jungbluth Video game animator


	“I could ask a specific question on the type of formula I wanted, and then I could reword my question based on the answer it gave me. This allowed for a more interactive and iterative process towards finding the answer than I found through tutorials, articles or random message board posts.”


	Mr. Jungbluth had needed a formula that would assign time estimates when he picked out a combination of variables. With a few prompts to ChatGPT, eventually he got it:


	=IF(OR(C263=”GroupAType1”, C263=”GroupAType2”, C263=”GroupAType3”, C263=”GroupAType4”), IF(D263=”GroupASize1”, Key!$K$3, IF(D263=”GroupASize2”, Key$K$4, IF(D263=”GroupASize3”, Key!$K$5, “NA”))), IF(OR(C263=”GroupBType1”, C263=”GroupBType2”), IF(D263=”GroupBSize1”, Key!$K$8, IF(D263=”GroupBSize2”, Key!$K$9, IF(D263=”GroupBSize3”, Key!$K$10, “NA”))), “NA”))




	Get feedback on fiction.


Paul Gamlowski Microfiction author


	“After I finish 98 percent of a story, I prompt ChatGPT with:”


	Summarize the meaning or symbolism of this story I wrote. Mention any plot twist. Speculate on the moral of the story. Analyze how well the story reads to an average reader grammatically and structurally. Analyze if the title matches appropriately.


	If ChatGPT misses the point, or the moral, “that tells me as a writer probably many readers will miss it too.” And he’ll give it another shot. “So I just adjust a few words or a phrase and have it re-analyze and it gets it. It doesn’t take away from the story because I still write in a literary symbolic way, but it helps me get insight into what a future reader might get or miss.”








	Get homework help.


Maya Upadhyay High school student


	Ms. Upadhyay takes advanced placement math classes, like statistics and calculus, and says when she’s confused with a homework question, she’ll feed it into ChatGPT.


	It will give her an answer, but also step-by-step instructions on how it got there — a kind of self-guided tutoring process that she once used math apps or Khan Academy videos for.


	“Sometimes if I’m still confused, I can ask the A.I. to put it into simpler terms. It’s just become another option for me to use and it’s been really helpful to have whenever I need it.”




	Learn Chinese.


Jason Phang Ph.D. student in data science


	“My Chinese teacher has actually recommended I use ChatGPT to supplement my learning. ChatGPT generally writes more fluently/formally than I can.”


	Mr. Phang uses it as a two-way street, sometimes writing a paragraph in Chinese, then asking ChatGPT to clean up his work. Other times he asks ChatGPT to write the paragraph first, then he combs the paragraph for phrases or sentence structures and writes from there.




	Get help when English is your second language.


Ronald Mannak Entrepreneur


	“If I can’t think of a particular word, for example, it is super easy to just describe the word, and GPT almost always knows what I mean, even if the description is really bad.”




	Create an app when you’ve never coded before.


Ethan Mollick Professor at the University of Pennsylvania


	“I wondered if I could make a button on my computer that, when I hit it, will automatically summarize a document for me. I said:


	Can you do that?


	“And GPT-4 said:


	Sure! Here’s a Python program.


	“I pasted in everything it told me to paste in. Now I have a button on my computer to summarize documents. And I can’t code, by the way.”




	Fix bugs in your code.


Roman Pshichenko Software engineer


	When his code doesn’t run, Mr. Psichenko’s go-to fix is ChatGPT. He pastes in his code, and he often gets a decent suggestion for how to rewrite it.


	“It’s like if you had a good, mostly respectable co-worker, that can give you the time to make their suggestions match your tools, your environment, everything that couldn’t possibly be addressed in one of those generic posts online.”




	Play Pong …


Pietro Schiarno Developer and designer


	“It did it in 60 seconds. I asked it:


	Give me Pong.


	“It spat out the code. All I had to do was copy-paste, run it, and it worked.”

	… or 3D games.


Ammaar Reshi Design manager


	Mr. Reshi first tried using GPT-4 to make the game Snake, and that was too easy. So then he tried something in 3D: SkyRoads, one of his childhood favorites.


	It took time, and help from another chatbot (Anthropic’s A.I. assistant Claude), but ultimately Mr. Reshi — who does not himself know how to code — was able to replicate a simple version of the game.

	Build entirely new games.


Daniel Tait Hobby game designer


	Mr. Tait was playing Sudoku, and got a little bored. It occurred to him that ChatGPT might have a few ideas for a new game. So he asked:


	Can you create me a puzzle game like Sudoku?


	“Instantly, it came up with some pretty good puzzle game ideas,” he said. “I found one I was happy with.”


	Then he wrote:


	Can you code me a playable version of this?


	“Lo and behold, a couple seconds later, I had a playable version of the puzzle.”



















Daniel Tait’s game, Sumplete, was created by ChatGPT



	He even let the A.I. name the game.




	Teach people to curl like a pro.


Levi Lelis Assistant professor


	Mr. Lelis trained an A.I. to come up with the best curling strategy, and now he’s figuring out the best ways to use its results to teach players. His most recent research shows that the program can make a decent coach. The key, he says, is that the program doesn’t just give the player the answer — where exactly to aim the stone — but also the justification. It shows you a similar but not quite identical scenario, and tells you how much worse that placement would be.


	He found that it was an effective teacher, but it has one shortcoming. It doesn’t adapt to the skill level of the person it’s teaching. “We only focus on strategy,” he said. “We do assume the person would be Olympic level.”




	Create new proteins in minutes.


Christoffer Norn Senior Researcher at BioInnovation Institute


	Two years ago researchers cracked the code on using A.I. to predict the shape of proteins.


	Creating new proteins can be a critical scientific endeavor: In the past, humans have been able to make insulin analogs for diabetics and immune cells that fight cancer.


	But all of that is hard. Building a new protein requires determining how a sequence of amino acids will fold up into a final molecular structure, to figure out how the protein actually functions.


	“Beforehand, we had to draw out a blueprint of how we wanted the new protein to look, and then we’d spend a lot of time having the computer generate examples and, rarely, those examples worked,” Mr. Norn said.


	Now A.I. can do it. He used it recently to make a light-generating firefly-esque protein while at the University of Washington. Other researchers have used A.I. in the search for a malaria vaccine, and for Parkinson’s research.

Ian C Haydon / UW Institute for Protein Design



	“We can only test so many hypotheses in a day,” he said. “I can have an idea, maybe a protein of a particular structure, but I have not memorized all the protein structures. The algorithms have. They’ve looked at all of them, and generalized rules for how to put together new structures. It’s pretty amazing.”


	He has done protein research for a decade. This, he says, is the most efficient he has ever been.


	“It’s crazy,” he said. “Everything is becoming much easier.”




	Identify diseases in banana plants.


Michael Selvaraj Scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture


	There are a lot of ways a banana plant can die, from Xanthomonas wilt to banana bunchy top virus. And the farmers responsible for producing more than 100 million tons of bananas each year aren’t trained as diagnosticians.



















Tumaini is an A.I.-trained app that recognizes and diagnoses banana plant diseases.

	“Classification of disease is really difficult,” said Mr. Selvaraj, a senior scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture.


	He trained an A.I. on nearly 20,000 pictures of all kinds of banana plants: sick, healthy, young and old. Now farmers across India, Latin America and Africa can use his app, Tumaini, to take pictures of their crop and get a diagnosis.


	“If we know the disease is coming, this will be helpful for scientists, stakeholders and government,” he said.




	Draw like Sol LeWitt.


Amy Goodchild Generative artist


	The famed artist Sol LeWitt’s instructions were prescriptive and specific, the kind you might want to hand over to an A.I. model. So Ms. Goodchild did, seeing if A.I. could create art by carrying out Lewitt’s instructions and generating Javascript code.


	With OpenAI’s older model, GPT-3, it was mostly a flop. But GPT-4 did OK — on some of them.


	On a wall surface, any continuous stretch of wall, using a hard pencil, place 50 points at random. The points should be evenly distributed over the area of the wall. All of the points should be connected by straight lines.



















ChatGPT’s relatively successful attempt at Sol LeWitt’s Wall Drawing #118





	Describe entire Dungeons & Dragons worlds.


Jackson Green Dungeon master


	When you run a Dungeons & Dragons game, Mr. Green says, you have to be creative, but that almost always means pulling from existing fantasy literature.


	“The game is sometimes wholesale lifted and reskinned, like a kind of collaborative plagiarism,” he said. And ChatGPT is great at it.


	Describe a fantasy medieval city that has an enormous network of canals for travel. What factions and guilds are there?


	The city of Venoria is a bustling metropolis located on the shores of a great inland sea. It is known for its impressive network of canals, which crisscross the city and serve as the primary means of transportation for its residents. Boats and gondolas ply the waterways, ferrying people and goods from one part of the city to another. Venoria is a city of many factions and guilds, each with its own interests and agendas. The Merchant's Guild is a powerful force in the city, controlling much of the trade that flows through its ports. The Artisans' Guild is also influential, with its members producing everything from fine jewelry to intricate clockwork mechanisms ...




	Make a Spotify playlist


Jonathan Soma Journalism professor at Columbia University


	Mr. Soma wanted “on-demand, vibes-based” playlists. All Sum 41 songs, with none of the slow ones, for example. So he hooked up GPT-3 to Spotify.


	Now he can just type:


	Give me songs that are acoustic but energetic.


	Play the Cars but none of those boring slow songs.


	And he gets back his playlist.

	Play with language.


Bethany Grace Howe Writer and comedian


	Ms. Howe doesn’t actually try out jokes on ChatGPT. But the A.I. is useful when she needs a creative boost.


	“Sometimes I have an idea about something that I think might be funny, and so I will get ChatGPT working on alliteration or words that rhyme or synonyms that start with a certain letter or whatever, so that I can kind of build a joke.”


	It’s particularly helpful for bizarre acronyms, like this:


	Please tell me the words I could use to create the acronym ‘BIBERE’ to identify an organization dedicated to getting together after work to hit the bar — without saying we’re going to the bar in a workplace email.


	ChatGPT offered:


	Break, Indulge, Brainstorm Escaping, Relax and Enjoy

Published 1 year ago on  April 13, 2023 By  Haziqa Sajid  Table Of Contents Generative AI is transforming many industries, including entertainment, manufacturing, automotive, and knowledge-based. In knowledge-based industries, it has the potential to automate certain tasks, such as generating legal documents and automating financial analysis, that can increase the productivity of knowledge workers. A report by Research and Markets states generative AI is projected to become a $200.73 billion market by 2032.Recently, Bill Gates, in his blog post, said, “In the future, ChatGPT will be like having a white-collar worker available to assist you with various tasks,”But since generative AI is still in its early stages, it has limitations and unintended consequences. While it can perform tasks, it cannot replace the reasoning abilities and cognitive flexibility of humans essential to white-collar knowledge work.Let’s explore whether generative AI is becoming the new white-collar worker and its impact on knowledge-based industries.What Is Generative AI?Generative AI is an AI technology that can generate new content, including text, images, and videos. Emerging generative AI technologies like GPT enable access to a wider range of applications. Applications include chatbots, deep fakes, art, product demos, drug compounds, music, and more. It's also useful for writing email responses, dating profiles, and term papers while improving dubbing and design for buildings and products.Generative AI offers several advantages that are given below.Generative AI enhances efficiency by automating processes and eliminating the need for manual labor in various tasks. This results in substantial savings of both time and money, faster completion of projects, shorter timelines, and increased productivity.It aids in generating high-quality content, including images, videos, and text, that are visually appealing and more accurate than those created manually.Generative AI can assist in informing marketing strategies, product development, and improving customer experience, thereby facilitating businesses in making better business decisions.In inverse design, generative AI can be employed to produce new designs that meet specific criteria or constraints.What Are White-Collar Knowledge Workers?White-collar knowledge workers are professionals who use their cognitive abilities, knowledge, and skills to perform their jobs. They are responsible for analyzing data, managing teams, making strategic decisions, and creating solutions to complex problems. Typical white-collar jobs include lawyers, company management, accountants, consultants, financiers, insurance, and computer programmers.The current wave of uninterrupted technologization has significantly impacted white-collar jobs by automating repetitive and routine tasks and analyzing data faster than humans. For instance, software programs can now handle data entry, filing, and other administrative tasks, freeing up time for white-collar workers to focus on more tasks that need convergent, divergent, and critical thinking. If used properly, generative AI can lead to a 10x increase in the coding productivity of knowledge workers.However, increased reliance on technology has also led to a major shift in the job market. Millions of workers worldwide have had to either change their occupations or enhance their skill sets to stay employable. In a global economic report, Goldman Sachs economists predict that the latest high-velocity AI development and accessibility, which has given rise to platforms like ChatGPT, could automate up to 300 million full-time jobs globally. Furthermore, research by the University of Pennsylvania and Open AI estimates that the impact of automation is expected to be felt most significantly by highly educated white-collar workers who earn up to $80,000 annually.The Intersection of Generative AI & White-Collar WorkImage by Blue Planet Studio from Adobe StockThe intersection of generative AI and white-collar work has been particularly notable. It has significantly automated repetitive and tedious tasks, such as data entry, analysis, and report writing. New AI capabilities that recognize context and concepts allow machines to collaborate more effectively with knowledge workers. The intersection can also lead to upskilling opportunities as workers learn to collaborate with machines and use AI to augment their abilities.A few examples where generative AI aids white-collar work are:AI can streamline HR tasks, such as candidate screening. A digital assistant can conduct initial interviews and ask job-related questions to filter out unsuitable candidates. This saves time for HR professionals by automatically handling data and volume in a secure environment, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.Since generative AI can generate news articles, reports, and other written content, it frees up time for human journalists to focus on in-depth reporting and analysis.As the use of AI expands, it creates new job opportunities, requiring people to build, program, and maintain these intelligent machines. With millions of AI-related job roles available worldwide, new opportunities are arising for data scientists, robotic engineers, and more.Here are two industries where generative AI is transforming knowledge work and increasing work efficiency.Legal Services: An attorney recently used ChatGPT to publish a 14-page legal paper covering various legal prompts, indicating that AI bots can potentially address access to justice issues. AI startups like Lawgeex have already begun using AI to read contracts faster and more accurately than humans.Finance & Banking: According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the World Economic Forum, over half of the banks have integrated AI, with 56% using it for management and 52% for revenue generation. Morgan Stanley is already using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organize its wealth management database, leading to increased efficiency.The Future of Generative AI & White-Collar WorkThe future of generative AI looks promising. Tools such as ChatGPT and DALL-E-2, become more sophisticated and capable of automating several tasks. However, there are still shortcomings to consider. Generative AI lacks the human context, knowledge, and history that allows us to do tasks better.Furthermore, the output generated by AI is not always ready to be used as-is and often requires human intervention, which can sometimes take longer. Additionally, large language models can hallucinate or generate biased results, which is why human oversight is necessary to ensure fairness and accuracy.In a rapidly accelerating AI environment, white-collar workers can develop new skills and competencies, such as data and digital literacy. They will need to learn how to use and integrate generative AI into their work ethically. Also, they need to develop deep functional, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving skills. Employees must develop skills like data analysis,  AI programming, and machine learning to stay competitive in the job market.Despite generative AI’s capabilities, there are still areas where it lacks compared to human intelligence. For instance, AI lacks common sense reasoning and understanding of context. It can struggle with tasks that require a basic human-level understanding of everyday situations. Moreover, it cannot easily automate soft skills like empathy, social intelligence, and relationship building. Additionally, AI systems can be biased or limited by the data they are trained on. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair outcomes.Going forward, AI will be most effective as a tool to enhance human work rather than replace human labor. Ultimately, the co-existence of generative AI and human workers can set the bar higher, as workers using AI tools can have better productivity.Visit Unite.ai to stay updated on the advancements of generative AI.

 Large language models (LLMs) are the underlying technology that has powered the meteoric rise of generative AI chatbots. Tools like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat all rely on LLMs to generate human-like responses to your prompts and questions. 







 But just what are LLMs, and how do they work? Here we set out to demystify LLMs. 


 What Is a Large Language Model? 
 In its simplest terms, an LLM is a massive database of text data that can be referenced to generate human-like responses to your prompts. The text comes from a range of sources and can amount to billions of words. 

 Among common sources of text data used are: 
Literature: LLMs often contain enormous amounts of contemporary and classical literature. This can include books, poetry, and plays. Online content: An LLM will most often contain a large repository of online content, including blogs, web content, forum questions & responses, and other online text. News and current affairs: Some, but not all, LLMs can access current news topics. Certain LLMs, like GPT-3.5, are restricted in this sense. Social Media: Social media represents a huge resource of natural language. LLMs use text from major platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  





 Of course, having a huge database of text is one thing, but LLMs need to be trained to make sense of it to produce human-like responses. How it does this is what we cover next. 



 How Do LLMs Work? 
 How do LLMs use these repositories to create their responses? The first step is to analyze the data using a process called deep learning. 

 Deep learning is used to identify the patterns and nuances of human language. This includes gaining an understanding of grammar and syntax. But importantly, it also includes context. Understanding context is a crucial part of LLMs. 

 Let's look at an example of how LLMs can use context. 

 The prompt in the following image mentions seeing a bat at night. From this, ChatGPT understood that we were talking about an animal and not, for instance, a baseball bat. Of course, other chatbots like Bing Chat or Google Bard may answer this completely differently. 






    

 However, it isn't infallible, and as this example shows, sometimes you will need to supply additional information to get the desired response. 

    

 In this instance, we deliberately threw a bit of a curve ball to demonstrate how easily context is lost. But humans can misunderstand the context of questions too, and it only needs an extra prompt to correct the response. 






    

 To generate these responses, LLMs use a technique called natural language generation (NLG). This involves examining the input and using the patterns learned from its data repository to generate a contextually correct and relevant response. 

 But LLMs go deeper than this. They can also tailor replies to suit the emotional tone of the input. When combined with contextual understanding, the two facets are the main drivers that allow LLMs to create human-like responses. 

 To summarize, LLMs use a massive text database with a combination of deep learning and NLG techniques to create human-like responses to your prompts. But there are limitations to what this can achieve. 








 What Are the Limitations of LLMs? 
    

 LLMs represent an impressive technological achievement. But the technology is far from perfect, and there are still plenty of limitations as to what they can achieve. Some of the more notable of these are listed below: 
Contextual understanding: We mentioned this as something LLMs incorporate into their answers. However, they don't always get it right and are often unable to understand the context, leading to inappropriate or just plain wrong answers. Bias: Any biases present in the training data can often be present in responses. This includes biases towards gender, race, geography, and culture. Common sense: Common sense is difficult to quantify, but humans learn this from an early age simply by watching the world around them. LLMs do not have this inherent experience to fall back on. They only understand what has been supplied to them through their training data, and this does not give them a true comprehension of the world they exist in. An LLM is only as good as its training data: Accuracy can never be guaranteed. The old computer adage of ""Garbage In, Garbage Out"" sums this limitation up perfectly. LLMs are only as good as the quality and quantity of their training data allow them to be.  





 There is also an argument that ethical concerns can be considered a limitation of LLMs, but this subject falls outside the scope of this article. 



 3 Examples of Popular LLMs 
 The continuing advance of AI is now largely underpinned by LLMs. So while they aren't exactly a new technology, they have certainly reached a point of critical momentum, and there are now many models. 

 Here are some of the most widely used LLMs. 

 1. GPT 
 Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is perhaps the most widely known LLM. GPT-3.5 powers the ChatGPT platform used for the examples in this article, while the newest version, GPT-4, is available through a ChatGPT Plus subscription. Microsoft also uses the latest version in its Bing Chat platform. 

 2. LaMDA 
 This is the initial LLM used by Google Bard, Google's AI chatbot. The version Bard was initially rolled out with was described as a ""lite"" version of the LLM. The more powerful PaLM iteration of the LLM superseded this. 





 3. BERT 
 BERT stands for Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers. The bidirectional characteristics of the model differentiate BERT from other LLMs like GPT. 

 Plenty more LLMs have been developed, and offshoots are common from the major LLMs. As they develop, these will continue to grow in complexity, accuracy, and relevance. But what does the future hold for LLMs? 



 The Future of LLMs 
 These will undoubtedly shape the way we interact with technology in the future. The rapid uptake of models like ChatGPT and Bing Chat is a testament to this fact. In the short term, AI is unlikely to replace you at work. But there is still uncertainty about just how big a part in our lives these will play in the future. 

 Ethical arguments may yet have a say in how we integrate these tools into society. However, putting this to one side, some of the expected LLM developments include: 
Improved Efficiency: With LLMs featuring hundreds of millions of parameters, they are incredibly resource hungry. With improvements in hardware and algorithms, they are likely to become more energy-efficient. This will also quicken response times. Improved Contextual Awareness: LLMs are self-training; the more usage and feedback they get, the better they become. Importantly, this is without any further major engineering. As technology progresses, this will see improvements in language capabilities and contextual awareness. Trained for Specific Tasks: The Jack-of-all-trade tools that are the public face of LLMs are prone to errors. But as they develop and users train them for specific needs, LLMs can play a large role in fields like medicine, law, finance, and education. Greater Integration: LLMs could become personal digital assistants. Think of Siri on steroids, and you get the idea. LLMs could become virtual assistants that help you with everything from suggesting meals to dealing with your correspondence.  





 These are just a few of the areas where LLMs are likely to become a larger part of the way we live. 



 LLMs Transforming and Educating 
 LLMs are opening up an exciting world of possibilities. The rapid rise of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard is evidence of the resources being poured into the field. 

 Such a proliferation of resources can only see these tools becoming more powerful, versatile, and accurate. The potential applications of such tools are vast, and at the moment, we are only scratching the surface of an incredible new resource.

Amazon is working on generative AI, too, CEO Andy Jassy assures shareholders in annual letter

Large language models that power generative AI “will transform and improve virtually every customer experience,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says in his letter to shareholders. (GeekWire File Photo / Dan DeLong)
What about Amazon?
That question comes up frequently these days in tech industry conversations about generative artificial intelligence, especially as Open AI leverages its partnership with Microsoft Azure, the Amazon Web Services cloud rival, to train the GPT-4 large language model (LLM) that powers applications including ChatGPT. 
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy spends a chunk of his annual letter to shareholders, released Thursday morning, planting the company’s flag in the world of generative AI, and making the case that Amazon actually has a longstanding beachhead in this realm through its investments in machine learning. 
“We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now,” Jassy writes toward the end of the letter. Amazon believes these emerging forms of artificial intelligence will “transform and improve virtually every customer experience,” and the company “will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences,” he adds.
Longstanding work by AWS in machine learning, including specialized chips, will help AWS customers affordably train and build their own LLMs, Jassy writes. 
He also cites Amazon’s CodeWhisperer (a rival to Microsoft-owned GitHub’s AI-powered CoPilot virtual pair programmer) as another example of the company’s generative AI work.
“I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I’ll leave that for a future letter,” he concludes. “Let’s just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.”
[Update: AWS this morning announced new tools for building large language models and generative AI.]
Amazon will evaluate costs and ‘proceed adaptively’: Toward the beginning of the letter, Jassy addresses the company’s recent cutbacks, including its decision to lay off 27,000 corporate workers. 
He writes that Amazon “took a deep look across the company, business by business, invention by invention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital.”
But perhaps the most notable sentence in this section hints that Amazon might not be done cutting costs. Jassy writes that he and Amazon’s leaders “will continue to evaluate what we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.”
Big bets and long-term focus: This is Jassy’s second letter to shareholders since becoming CEO. His predecessor, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, set the tone in 1997 with a letter that defined Amazon’s approach — putting investors on notice about its focus on long-term impact over short-term profits. 
Jassy’s new letter addresses the challenges Amazon is facing in the larger economy, comparing this period to the dot-com bust, when Amazon had to borrow money to bolster its holiday inventory; and the Great Recession, when it decided to continue investing in its then-nascent cloud business. 
He points to the subsequent success of AWS, now generating revenue at a rate of $85 billion per year, to establish credibility for some of the business bets that might seem similarly outlandish today.
Toward the end of the letter, he cites two examples: Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellite broadband initiative and Amazon Healthcare, including its OneMedical primary care acquisition. 
Checking the name-checks: For those keeping score, other businesses receiving extensive ink in this year’s letter include Amazon grocery, fulfillment and logistics, advertising, international stores, Amazon Business, Buy with Prime, and of course AWS, which Jassy previously led and describes as still in its early days given the large volume of global IT spending that has yet to shift to the cloud. 
The word “devices” is used one time in the letter, referencing the company’s decision to move on from “some newer devices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns.” That compares with 10 “devices” mentions in last year’s annual letter. 
Return to the office: In case there was any lingering doubt, Jassy makes it clear that the company isn’t backing down from its push to get employees back in the office for at least three days a week starting in May. The Amazon CEO dedicates a section of the letter to this topic, amounting to his own return-to-work manifesto. 
This is a portion:

We’ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we’re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing on one another’s ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthrough moments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, or continuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate’s office later that day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates. Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It’s also significantly easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues. 

Jassy concludes this section by writing, “Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important in our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.”

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) are examples of neural networks -- a type of deep learning algorithm modeled after how the human brain works.







CNNs, one of the oldest and most popular of the deep learning models, were introduced in the 1980s and are often used in visual recognition tasks.
GANs are relatively newer. Introduced in 2014, GANs were one of the first deep learning models used for generative AI.
CNNs are sometimes used within GANs to generate and discern visual and audio content.
""GANs are essentially pairs of CNNs hooked together in an 'adversarial' way, so the difference is one of approach to output or insight creation, albeit there exists an inherent underlying similarity,"" said John Blankenbaker, principal data scientist at SSA & Company, a global management consulting firm. ""How they answer a given question, however, is slightly different.""
For example, CNNs might try to determine if a picture contains a cat -- a recognition task -- while GANs will try to make a picture of a cat, a generation task. In both cases, the networks are building up a representation of what makes a picture of a cat distinctive.

Let's look deeper into CNNs and GANs.







Understanding convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
History. French computer scientist Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and chief AI scientist at Meta, invented CNNs in the 1980s when he was a researcher at the University of Toronto. His aim was to improve the tools for recognizing handwritten digits by using neural networks. Although his work on optical character recognition was seminal, it stalled due to limited training data sets and computing power.
Interest in the technique exploded after 2010, following the introduction of ImageNet -- a large, labeled database of images -- and the launch of its annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). One of the most promising entries in the inaugural year of the competition was the AlexNet model based on CNNs, which was optimized for GPUs. Its success demonstrated that CNNs could efficiently scale to achieve good performance on even the largest image databases.
How they work. ""CNNs are designed to use data with spatial structure such as images or video,"" said Donncha Carroll, a partner at Lotis Blue Consulting who leads the firm's Data Science Center of Excellence.
The convolutional neural network is composed of filters that move across the data and produce an output at every position. For example, a convolutional neural network designed to recognize animals in an image would activate when it recognizes legs, a body or a head.
It's also important to note that CNNs are designed to recognize the lines, edges and textures in patterns near each other, said Blankenbaker. ""The 'C' in CNNs stands for convolutional, which means that we are processing something where the idea of neighborhood is important -- such as, for example, pixels around a given pixel or signal values slightly before and after a given moment.""

Understanding generative adversarial networks (GANs)
History. GANs were invented by American computer scientist Ian Goodfellow, currently a research scientist at DeepMind, when he was working at Google Brain from 2014 to 2016.
GANs, as noted, are a type of deep learning model used to generate images of numbers and realistic-looking faces. The field exploded once researchers discovered it could be applied to synthesizing voices, drugs and other types of images. GANs and their variations were heralded by CNN inventor LeCun as the most interesting idea of the last 10 years in machine learning.
How they work. The term adversarial comes from the two competing networks creating and discerning content -- a generator network and a discriminator network. For example, in an image-generation use case, the generator network creates new images that look like faces. In contrast, the discriminator network tries to tell the difference between authentic and generated images. The discriminator performance data then helps to train the overall system.

CNN vs. GAN: Key differences and uses, explained
One important distinction between CNNs and GANs, Carroll said, is that the generator in GANs reverses the convolution process. ""Convolution extracts features from images, while deconvolution expands images from features.""
Here is a rundown of the chief differences between CNNs and GANs and their respective use cases.
CNN

CNNs are used for recognizing objects, sounds or characteristics such as faces, biometrics, faulty parts or medical conditions. They are also ideal for interpreting images, speech or other audio signals.
CNNs are trained using a supervised learning approach, with input data labeled for a particular output.
The convolutional aspect of CNNs extracts features from images.
Common use cases include reading documents, visually inspecting machine parts, listening to machinery to detect wear and hearing customer sentiment in customer service or sales calls.

GAN

GANs are used to generate realistic-looking people, objects, sounds or characteristics.
GANs are trained using an unsupervised learning approach -- i.e. they can be trained independently without requiring humans to label data.
An inverse convolutional process, called deconvolution, expands images from features.
Common use cases include generating realistic human-looking faces or an image of a specific individual, giving rise to the phenomenon known as deepfakes. They are also good at generating voices that sound like an individual or synthesizing someone's voice and tone in another language for more realistic dubbing. Other common use cases include generating all kinds of text, including news, poetry and code; speeding up drug discovery; and detecting fraud.



How can CNNs and GANs work together?
Although GANs are getting a lot of the attention lately, CNNs continue to be used under the hood -- that is, within GANs for generating and discerning authenticity. Indeed, Pierre Custeau, CTO of ToolsGroup, a supply chain planning and optimization firm, considers the two neural networks to be complementary in terms of function. ""Since CNNs are so effective at image processing, both the generator and discriminator networks are by default CNNs,"" he said.
It is important to note that CNNs and GANs only tend to be combined in one way, said Matthew Mead, CTO at IT consultancy SPR.
""GANs typically work with image data and can use CNNs as the discriminator. But this doesn't work the other way around, meaning a CNN cannot use a GAN,"" Mead said.



One of the biggest challenges is always the data quality itself for training the models, especially when we're talking about business-specific solutions instead something as generic as a cat.


John BlankenbakerPrincipal data scientist, SSA & Company




Early GANs generated relatively simple, low-resolution faces. One of the reasons interest in GANs has grown is the dramatic decline in cost per unit of compute, which has enabled teams to build more complex neural networks, Carroll pointed out. Advancements in hardware, software and neural network design have also fueled the growth of other generative AI models like transformers, variational autoencoders and diffusion.
Blankenbaker cautions against getting caught up in the latest model rather than focusing on specific goals and the underlying data. ""We see too many companies getting excited about the buzzwords and trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, resulting in overspending on overkill solutions,"" Blakenbaker said.
""One of the biggest challenges is always the data quality itself for training the models, especially when we're talking about business-specific solutions instead something as generic as a cat,"" he said.

Will artificial intelligence — especially generative AI — be an accelerant or a drain to the creativity and innovation of today’s workforce? No one knows for sure, but some industry observers are taking educated guesses about the direction things may take.


While the popular perception is that AI will eliminate or severely displace human creativity, it appears many humans are happy to have generative AI in their lives. A recent survey by Fishbowl, an anonymous social network for professionals, finds that 43% of professionals have used AI tools, including ChatGPT, for work-related tasks — without any prompting or even knowledge of their managers.

So we have a push-pull going on within workplaces when it comes to AI and generative AI. It may serve as a super-productive assistant to workers and professionals, or it may usurp their roles. Can AI be creative? Can it innovate on a greater scale that humans?

PROMOTED
The conventional wisdom is that humans will always have the edge as creators and innovators. “Generative AI applications such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are threatening to upend this special status and significantly alter creative work, both independent and salaried,” according to David De Cremer, Nicola Morini Bianzino, and Ben Falk, writing in Harvard Business Review. “These new generative AI models learn from huge datasets and user feedback, and can produce new content in the form of text, images, and audio or a combination of those. As such, jobs focused on delivering content — writing, creating images, coding, and other jobs that typically require an intensity of knowledge and information — now seem likely to be uniquely affected by generative AI. What isn’t clear yet is what shape this kind of impact will take. ""

De Cremer and his co-authors paint three possible scenarios for the impact of AI on creative work:
Scenario 1: AI augments work, and boosts productivity. Generative AI tools deliver the ultimate democratization of AI. “In fact, most of these applications are so easy to use that even children with elementary-level verbal skills can use them to create content right now,” the co-authors state. “Rather than putting many creators out of work, AI will support humans to do the work they already perform, but simply allowing them to do it with greater speed and efficiency. In this scenario, productivity would rise, as reliance on generative AI tools that use natural language reduces the time and effort required to come up with new ideas or pieces of text.”

Scenario 2: Generative AI creates a flood of cheap content that drives out human creatives. Intellectual-property laws are still being worked out, and in the meantime, content creation will run amok. “Unfair algorithmic competition and inadequate governance leads to the crowding out of authentic human creativity,” the co-authors speculate. “Here, human writers, producers, and creators are drowned out by a tsunami of algorithmically generated content, with some talented creators even opting out of the market.”

Scenario 3: Human-made creative work demands a premium. With the potential of AI-generated work flooding the market, people may hunger for the “real thing” — and be willing to pay for the authenticity. “While generative models demonstrate remarkable and sometimes emergent capabilities, they suffer from problems with accuracy, frequently producing text that sounds legitimate but is riddled with factual errors and erroneous logic,” De Cremer and his co-authors observe.
It’s possible we may experience a combination of these scenarios, depending on the nature of the business. To paraphrase the oft-quoted adage, culture eats technology for breakfast. The ability to adapt to changes in the vision and purpose of the business is where humans are likely to be irreplaceable. “Culture changes much more quickly than generative algorithms can be trained, so humans maintain a dynamism that algorithms cannot compete against,” the co-authors suggest.

Johnny Taylor Jr., CEO of the Society of Human Resource Management, offshored the job of a tech employee to India, saving 40% in the labor-cost arbitrage, when she asked to relocate from Arlington, Virginia, where the HR membership group is based, to North Carolina, according to the Wall Street Journal.


Companies are accelerating their efforts to send jobs to lower-cost countries in response to the challenge of finding workers and inflation driving up wages. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta survey found that 7.3% of leadership in the United States plans to move more jobs offshore as the next step from remote work within America.

Richard Baldwin, an economics professor at the Graduate Institute in Geneva who studied the “offshoreability” of teleworking jobs, gave a warning at the European-based Center for Economic Policy Research last year, “If you can do your job from home, be scared.” Baldwin added, “Be very scared because somebody in India or wherever is willing to do it for much less.”

PROMOTED
Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University and an expert in workplace matters, told the Wall Street Journal, “About 10% to 20% of U.S. service support jobs, like software developers, human-resources professionals and payroll administrators, could move overseas in the next decade.”

Cutting Costs And Jobs
Outsourcing has become a popular business tool for companies across the U.S. looking for ways to increase profit margins and cut costs. According to Zippia, about 300,000 U.S. jobs are outsourced yearly, and 66% of businesses in America outsource at least one department. Moreover, roughly 30 million jobs are vulnerable to outsourcing.

Highly industrialized countries, like the U.S., offshore to developing countries to curtail operational costs, receive tax benefits and access cheap raw materials.
Information technology is the most outsourced industry and business division. The average IT department allocates 13.6% of its budget to offshored roles, and roughly 37% of IT tasks are outsourced. The top five jobs most vulnerable to offshoring include computer programmers, data entry keyers and other computer and information personnel.

This Has Been Going On For A Long Time
The trend began in the late 1970s at large manufacturers, including General Electric. Jack Welch, GE’s chief executive at the time, argued that public corporations owe their primary allegiance to stockholders, not employees. Welch said that companies should seek to lower costs and maximize profits by moving operations wherever is cheapest.

In 2011, Forbes reported that U.S. companies, like GE, Caterpillar, Microsoft and Wal-Mart, employed 20% of all U.S. workers. In the 2000s, these corporations reduced their workforces in America by 2.9 million, while increasing their outsourced roles by 2.4 million. In 2009, large corporations employed 21.1 million American workers and 10.3 million employees outside the U.S.
Startups Are Focused On Offshoring White-Collar Professionals
The offshoring movement is gaining even more momentum in well-funded startups focused on making it easier for jobs to move around the world.
Startups, like Remote.com and Deel, make it easy for companies to hire personnel worldwide. These organizations have established the mechanisms and systems for global corporations to hire, onboard and manage the taxes and compliance for remote workers in countries throughout the world.
AngelList Talent scours the globe to find job hunters who want to get hired remotely. Job seekers can share what kind of remote work culture they want, time-zone preferences and other important factors. They then take assessments to demonstrate their skills. For example, engineering candidates can take assessments for frontend, backend, iOS, Android and more and display their scores for recruiters to see.
In Addition To Offshoring Jobs, Workers Need To Worry About AI
If generative AI lives up to its hype, the workforce in the U.S. and Europe will be upended, Goldman Sachs recently reported. The investment bank estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.
Office administrative support, legal, architecture and engineering, business and financial operations, management, sales, healthcare and art and design are some sectors that automation will impact.

 Breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence have the potential to bring about sweeping changes to the global economy, according to Goldman Sachs Research. As tools using advances in natural language processing work their way into businesses and society, they could drive a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.
 “Despite significant uncertainty around the potential for generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,” Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani write in a report.

               
        

 A new wave of AI systems may also have a major impact on employment markets around the world. Shifts in workflows triggered by these advances could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation, Briggs and Kodnani write.
 Analyzing databases detailing the task content of over 900 occupations, our economists estimate that roughly two-thirds of U.S. occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI. They further estimate that, of those occupations that are exposed, roughly a quarter to as much as half of their workload could be replaced. But not all that automated work will translate into layoffs, the report says. “Although the impact of AI on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,” the authors write.

               
        

 In addition, jobs displaced by automation have historically been offset by the creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth, according to the report. For example, information-technology innovations introduced new occupations such as webpage designers, software developers and digital marketing professionals. There were also follow-on effects of that job creation, as the boost to aggregate income indirectly drove demand for service sector workers in industries like healthcare, education and food services.   
 A recent study by economist David Autor cited in the report found that 60% of today’s workers are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940. This implies that more than 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions, our economists write.

               
        

 At the same time, advances in AI are expected to have far-reaching implications for the global enterprise software, healthcare and financial services industries, according to a separate report from Goldman Sachs Research. With well-known tech giants poised to roll out their own generative AI tools, the enterprise software industry appears to be embarking on the next wave of innovation, after the development of the internet, mobile and cloud computing transformed the ways we operate as a society.
 
 “Generative AI can streamline business workflows, automate routine tasks and give rise to a new generation of business applications,” Kash Rangan, senior U.S. software analyst in Goldman Sachs Research, writes in the team’s report. The technology is making inroads in business applications, improving the day-to-day efficiency of knowledge workers, helping scientists develop drugs faster and accelerating the development of software code, among other things.
 Software companies are already arming their product portfolios with new generative AI offerings. Software-as-a-service firms, for example, are using it to open opportunities for upselling and cross-selling product and increasing their customer retention and expansion, the authors note. They see multiple ways that such businesses can leverage generative AI for growth: 1) through new production and application releases, 2) by charging premiums for AI-integrated offerings, and 3) by increasing prices over time as existing products are supplemented with AI-enabled features and prove their value to customers. Added up, GS Research estimates the total addressable market for generative AI software to be $150 billion, compared with $685 billion for the global software industry.
 As more generative AI tools are developed and layered into existing software packages and technology platforms, the team sees businesses across the economy benefiting, from enhancing office productivity and sales efforts, to the design of buildings and manufactured parts, to improving patient diagnosis in healthcare settings, to detecting cyber fraud.
 While much is unknown about how generative AI will influence the world economy and society, and it will take time to play out, there are clear signs that the effects could be profound.

NewsletterHow Does ChatGPT Really Work?Learning how a “large language model” operates.Share full article524VideoCreditCredit...Illustrations by Mathieu LabrecqueBy Kevin RoosePublished March 28, 2023Updated April 4, 2023In the second of our five-part series, I’m going to explain how the technology actually works.The artificial intelligences that powers ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing chatbot and Google’s Bard can carry out humanlike conversations and write natural, fluid prose on an endless variety of topics. They can also perform complex tasks, from writing code to planning a kid’s birthday party.But how does it all work? To answer that, we need to peek under the hood of something called a large language model — the type of A.I. that drives these systems.Large language models, or L.L.M.s, are relatively new on the A.I. scene. The first ones appeared only about five years ago, and they weren’t very good. But today they can draft emails, presentations and memos and tutor you in a foreign language. Even more capabilities are sure to surface in the coming months and years, as the technology improves and Silicon Valley scrambles to cash in.I’m going to walk you through setting up a large language model from scratch, simplifying things and leaving out a lot of hard math. Let’s pretend that we’re trying to build an L.L.M. to help you with replying to your emails. We’ll call it MailBot.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 1: Set a goalEvery A.I. system needs a goal. Researchers call this an objective function. It can be simple — for example, “win as many chess games as possible” — or complicated, like “predict the three-dimensional shapes of proteins, using only their amino acid sequences.”Most large language models have the same basic objective function: Given a sequence of text, guess what comes next. We’ll give MailBot more specific goals later on, but let’s stick to that one for now. Step 2: Collect lots of dataNext, we need to assemble the training data that will teach MailBot how to write. Ideally, we’ll put together a colossally large repository of text, which usually means billions of pages scraped from the internet — like blog posts, tweets, Wikipedia articles and news stories.To start, we’ll use some free, publicly available data libraries, such as the Common Crawl repository of web data. But we’ll also want to add our own secret sauce, in the form of proprietary or specialized data. Maybe we’ll license some foreign-language text, so that MailBot learns to compose emails in French or Spanish as well as English. In general, the more data we have, and the more diverse the sources, the better our model will be.Before we can feed the data into our model, we need to break it down into units called tokens, which can be words, phrases or even individual characters. Transforming text into bite-size chunks helps a model analyze it more easily.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 3: Build your neural networkOnce our data is tokenized, we need to assemble the A.I.’s “brain” — a type of system known as a neural network. This is a complex web of interconnected nodes (or “neurons”) that process and store information.For MailBot, we’re going to want to use a relatively new type of neural network known as a transformer model. They can analyze multiple pieces of text at the same time, making them faster and more efficient. (Transformer models are the key to systems like ChatGPT — whose full acronym stands for “Generative Pretrained Transformer.”)Step 4: Train your neural networkNext, the model will analyze the data, token by token, identifying patterns and relationships. It might notice “Dear” is often followed by a name, or that “Best regards” typically comes before your name. By identifying these patterns, the A.I. learns how to construct messages that make sense.The system also develops a sense of context. For example, it might learn that “bank” can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river, depending on the surrounding words.

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.As it learns these patterns, the transformer model sketches a map: an enormously complex mathematical representation of human language. It keeps track of these relationships using numerical values known as parameters. Many of today’s best L.L.M.s have hundreds of billions of parameters or more.Training could take days or even weeks, and will require immense amounts of computing power. But once it’s done, it will almost be ready to start writing your emails.Weirdly, it may develop other skills, too. As L.L.M.s learn to predict the next word in a sequence, over and over and over again, they can pick up other, unexpected abilities, such as knowing how to code. A.I. researchers call these emergent behaviors, and they’re still sometimes mystified by them.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 5: Fine-tune your modelOnce a large language model is trained, it needs to be calibrated for a specific job. A chatbot used by a hospital might need to understand medical terms, for example.To fine-tune MailBot, we could ask it to generate a bunch of emails, hire people to rate them on accuracy and then feed the ratings back into the model until it improves.This is a rough approximation of the approach that was used with ChatGPT, which is known as reinforcement learning with human feedback.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 6: Launch, carefullyCongratulations! Once MailBot has been trained and fine-tuned, it’s ready to use. After you build some kind of user interface for it — like a Chrome extension that plugs into your email app — it can start cranking out emails.But no matter how good it seems, you’re still going to want to keep tabs on your new assistant. As companies like Microsoft and Meta have learned the hard way, A.I. systems can be erratic and unpredictable, or even turn creepy and dangerous.Tomorrow, we’ll hear more about how things can go wrong in unexpected and sometimes disturbing ways.ImageYour homeworkLet’s explore one of the more creative abilities of L.L.M.s: the ability to combine disparate concepts and formats into something bizarre and new. For example, our colleagues at Well asked ChatGPT to “write a song in Taylor Swift’s voice that uses themes from a Dr. Seuss book.”For today’s homework, try to mix and match a format, a style and a topic — like, “Write a limerick in the style of Snoop Dogg about global warming.”Don’t forget to share your creation as a comment.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTQuizQuestion 1 of 3What is the primary objective function of large language models like ChatGPT?Win as many chess games as possiblePredict the 3-D shapes of proteinsGuess what comes next in a sequence of textStart the quiz by choosing your answer.GlossaryTransformer model: A neural network architecture useful for understanding language, which does not have to analyze words one at a time but can look at an entire sentence at once. A technique called self-attention allows the model to focus on the particular words that are important in understanding the meaning of the sentence.Parameters: Numerical values that define a large language model’s structure and behavior, like clues that help it guess what words come next. Modern systems like GPT-4 are thought to have hundreds of billions of parameters.Reinforcement learning: A technique that teaches an A.I. model to find the best result by trial and error, receiving rewards or punishments from an algorithm based on its results.

Midjourney, ChatGPT, Bing AI Chat, and other AI tools that make generative AI accessible have unleashed a flood of ideas, experimentation and creativity. If you want to harness that in your organization, questions remain about where to start putting AI to work and how to do it without running into ethical dilemmas, copyright infringement, or factual errors. A good place to start is use it to help people who are already expert in their area to save time and be more productive.
There are many other different places to quickly start using generative AI, and it’s being incorporated into several tools and platforms your organization may already use. So you’ll want to think about setting out guidelines for how to experiment with and adopt these tools. Here are five key areas where it’s worth considering generative AI, plus guidance on finding other appropriate scenarios.
1. Increase developer productivity knowhow
Coding is often considered to be somewhere between an art and a science, but there’s a lot of work in programming that’s routine and repetitive. The rise of cloud platforms and module repositories means that writing modern applications is as much about gluing together components and APIs, refactoring existing code, optimizing environments, and orchestrating pipelines as it is about coming up with algorithms. A lot of that work is ripe for automation and AI assistance, but, again, you need to know how and where you’re using these tools to monitor impact and effectiveness. You could start with single-use tools that speed up specific, common tasks before moving on to full-scale coding assistants.
 
 
 













 
 

Documentation is both critical and frequently neglected: not only can you have generative AI document a codebase, but you can then build a chat interface into your documentation where developers can ask how it works and use it, or just replace the usual search box. That turns generic documentation into conversational programming where the AI can take your data and show you how to write a query, for example.

Testing is another area that tends to get neglected, so automated unit test generation will help you get much broader test coverage. Commit bots can also help developers write messages that include enough information to be useful to users and other developers, and generative AI could do the same for IT staff documenting upgrades and system reboots.
It’s also key to generate backend logic and other boilerplate by telling the AI what you want so developers can focus on the more interesting and creative parts of the application. You should also use generative AI to write your own codemods, (scripts that automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks in large code bases), or ask it to help fix contribution voice and tone to better suit house style. Coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and IDEs that build in large language models (LLMs) can do all of that and more but shouldn’t replace a developer; they need to understand and assess code they haven’t written (and the context it runs in) in case it contains security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks, omissions, bad decisions or just plain mistakes since it’s generating code based on learning from repos that might have any or all of those issues. Think about how to track AI-generated code in your organization so you can audit it and assess how useful it is. Developers report being more productive and less frustrated when using GitHub Copilot, and Microsoft says 40% of the code Copilot users check in is AI-generated and unmodified. Currently that provenance is lost once a developer leaves their IDE session, so think about internal guidance on recording how AI tools are used.
 
 
 













 
 

2. Uplevel low code and no code business users
Although business users don’t have the expertise to evaluate the code produced by an AI assistant, low code and no code environments are highly constrained, and the places where they integrate generative AI tools are far less likely to be problematic.
Low code apps frequently need to retrieve and filter data. And low code platforms already add generative AI features that can generate lookup queries or sanitize the data that come back—like programmatically adding missing zip codes—which allows business users without database expertise to get further without needing to stick to prebuilt components or wait for a professional developer to build the query string for them. Open-source tools like Census GPT make it easier to query large public data sets.
Code assistants aren’t just for pro developers, either. Wix Artificial Design Intelligence (ADI) can build a whole website for you, mixing code generation and generative design; Uizard does the same for website and app prototypes; and Fronty turns images into HTML and CSS while Express design in Microsoft Power Apps turns a hand drawn sketch or Figma file into a working app, complete with backend.
 
 
 













 
 

Most of the generative AI use cases organizations will be interested in are modules that can be called in a low code automation workflow so employees can adapt them to their specific needs. And platforms are already making ChatGPT and other OpenAI APIs available like any other component. However, be sure any warnings or guidance accompanying the text or images generated show up correctly in the low code environment, ideally with a way to give feedback, and that staff know your policy on whether any of this can be presented directly to customers without an employee reviewing it first.

3. Understand documents and data
Combining a custom version of ChatGPT with Bing has brought millions of new users to Microsoft’s search engine. But the way LLMs work means errors and ‘hallucinations’ will happen as they essentially autocomplete sentences and paragraphs to generate text that matches query prompts. And if the information you want doesn’t exist, the model will still attempt to create something plausible. Even when the information given is correct and matches what most experts in an area would say, responses may be incomplete, inaccurate, and if you’re not already an expert, you may not know what’s missing. These issues can be as much of a problem for enterprise search as they are for the public web; the forthcoming Microsoft 365 Copilot tool will try to deal with that by grounding queries in data from the Microsoft Graph of documents and entities, and providing references, but it might still miss important points you’ll need to add in yourself.
Start taking advantage of the opportunities to use LLMs to summarize and analyze documents, or generate text to explain concepts in more constrained scenarios where that information gets reviewed internally by people with expertise, rather than getting shown directly to your customers or other end users.
 
 
 













 
 

Generate a knowledge graph to visualize the connections and relationships between different entities as a way to help you understand a project, community or ecosystem. The Copilot tool coming to Excel promises an interactive way to get insights and ask questions about data in a sandbox that doesn’t change the underlying data, so any mistakes might take you down the wrong path but shouldn’t contaminate the original information for future analysis.
Storytelling with data is another effective way to communicate key trends and AI-powered analytics like Power BI’s Smart Narratives, which can find anomalies and contributing factors, and then explain them with charts and autogenerated descriptions. This avoids the problems LLMs have with math because the insights are derived by AI models like linear regression and then described by the language model. These kinds of ensemble approaches are likely to become more common. Similarly, security tools are starting to use language generation to explain threats, anomalies, and possible evidence of breaches detected by AI in clear, customized language that tells you what it means and what to do about it. In future, expect to be able to ask these kinds of tools questions and have them explain recommendations.
You can also make existing chatbots smarter and more flexible by moving beyond keywords and canned responses to something that sounds more natural and can automatically include new information as your knowledge base updates. Again, it’s tempting to use generative AI chatbots directly with customers to increase customer satisfaction and reduce costs, but this is a riskier scenario than using them inside your organization to surface useful information about benefits and other HR questions, for example. While a sassy chatbot will suit some brands, you don’t want to make the headlines because a customer received dangerous advice or got insulted by your chatbot. Using generative AI for agent assistance can get you the productivity boost with less of the risk.  
 
 
 













 
 

4. Speed up business user workflow
Meetings are supposed to be where business decisions are made and knowledge is shared, but far too much meeting value never leaves the room. AI tools like Microsoft Teams Premium, Dynamics 365 Copilot and the ChatGPT app for Slack create summaries and record the action items assigned to attendees and people who weren’t in the room and may not know what they’re on the hook for. This can also help avoid power plays around who’s asked to take notes and do other ‘office housework,’ for instance.
Being able to catch up with a busy Slack channel once a day could also improve productivity and work-life balance, but those who make the plans and decisions should take responsibility for making sure AI summaries, action items, and timescales are accurate. AI tools that summarize calls with customers and clients can help managers supervise and train staff. That might be as useful for financial advisors as for call center workers, but tools that monitor employee productivity need to be used with empathy to avoid concerns about workplace surveillance. User feedback and product reviews are helpful, but the sheer volume can be overwhelming and nuggets of useful information might be buried pages deep.
Generative AI can classify, summarize, and categorize responses to give aggregate feedback that’s easier to absorb. In the long term, it’s easy to imagine a personal shopping assistant that suggests items you’d want to buy and answers questions about them rather than leaving you to scroll through pages of reviews and comments. But again, businesses will need to be cautious about introducing tools that might surface offensive or defamatory opinions, or be too enthusiastic about filtering out negative reactions. Generative AI tools can read and summarize long documents, and use the information to draft new ones. There are already tools like Docugami that promise to extract due dates and deliverables from contracts, and international law firm Allen & Overy is trialling a platform to help with contract analysis and regulatory compliance. Generating semi-structured documents like MoUs, contracts, or statements of work may speed up business processes and help you standardize some business terms programmatically, but expect to need a lot of flexibility and oversight.
 
 
 













 
 

5. Get over writer’s block, spruce up designs
You don’t have to turn your whole writing process over to an AI just to get help with brainstorming, copywriting and creating images or designs. Office 365 and Google Docs will soon allow you to ask generative AI to create documents, emails and slideshows, so you’ll want to have policy on how these are reviewed for accuracy before they’re shared with anyone. Again, start with more constrained tasks and internal uses that you can monitor.
Generative AI can suggest what to write in customer outreach emails, thank you messages, or warnings about logistical issues, right inside your email or in a CRM like Salesforce, Zoho, or Dynamics 365, either as part of the platform or through a third-party tool. There’s also a lot of interest in using AI for marketing, but there are brand risks too. Treat these options only as a way to get started and not the final version before clicking send.
AI-generated text might not be perfect but if you have a lot of blanks to fill, it’s likely better than nothing. Shopify Magic, for instance, can take basic product details and write consistent, SEO-tuned product descriptions for an online storefront, and once you have something, you can improve on it. Also, Reddit and LinkedIn use Azure Vision Services to create captions and alternative text for images to improve accessibility when members don’t add those themselves. If you have a large video library for training, auto-generated summaries might help employees make the most of their time. Image generation from text can be extremely powerful, and tools like the new Microsoft Designer app put image diffusion models in the hands of business users who might balk at using a Discord server to access Midjourney, and don’t have the expertise to use a Stable Diffusion plugin in Photoshop. But AI-generated images are also controversial, with issues ranging from deepfakes and uncanny valley effects, to the source of training data and the ethics of using works of known artists without compensation. Organizations will want to have a very clear policy on using generated images to avoid the more obvious pitfalls.
 
 
 













 
 

Finding your own uses
As you can see, there are opportunities to benefit from generative AI in everything from customer support and retail, to logistics and legal services—anywhere you want a curated interaction with a reliable information source.

To use it responsibly, start with natural language processing use cases such as classification, summarization and text generation for non-customer-facing scenarios where the output is reviewed by humans who have the expertise to spot and correct errors and false information, and look for an interface that makes it easy and natural to do that rather than it just accepting suggestions. It’ll be tempting to save time and money by skipping human involvement, but the damage to your business could be significant if what’s generated is inaccurate, irresponsible, or offensive.
Many organisations are worried about leaking data into the models that might help competitors. Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have already published data usage policies that say the data and prompts used by one company will only be used to train their model, not the core model supplied to every customer. But you’ll still want to have guidance on what information staff can copy into public generative AI tools.
 
 
 













 
 

Vendors also say that users own the input and output of the models, which is a good idea in theory, but may not reflect the complexity of copyright and plagiarism concerns with generative AI, and models like ChatGPT don’t include citations, so you don’t know if the text they return is correct or copied from someone else. Paraphrasing isn’t exactly plagiarism, but misappropriating an original idea or insight from someone else isn’t a good look for any business.
It’s also important for organizations to develop AI literacy and have staff become familiar with using and evaluating the output of generative AI. Start small with areas that aren’t critical and learn from what works.

",,"The potential impact on job losses and dangerous cybersecurity incidents alone warrant a short pause. 
",,https://schema.org,,,,"The non-profit Future of Life Institute recently published an open letter calling for a six-month pause to study the effects of generative AI and how we can innovate more responsibly. This comes as AI technologies such as ChatGPT and Dall-e have provoked global fascination and fear regarding the capabilities of AI on its current trajectory of development. Thousands of tech experts and leaders signed the open letter. I have joined them.Generative AI will disrupt the world in profound ways. Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, generative AI creates new content in the form of images, text, and audio. It poses a great potential societal and economic impact as it may cause hundreds of millions of people to lose their jobs. This fear was shared by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on a recent Lex Fridman podcast, where Altman talked about job losses among programmers and customer service people. We can compare the generative AI revolution to what happened to blue-collar jobs during the Industrial Revolution. Except this time, white-collar professions are more at risk.Many professions are potentially impacted: art, teaching, journalism, legal, real estate, and software development. In its recent GPT-4 technical report, OpenAI reported that GPT-4 demonstrates human-level performance on a large panel of academic and professional benchmarks: Uniform Bar Exam, SAT Math, AP Art History, and AP Biology. It’s even more impressive when considering that GPT-4 has not been fine-tuned on these specific tasks.In journalism, the effects of generative AI are underway as we see job cuts at major newspapers and digital outlets. It’s not all bad though, since the technology could foster more investigative journalism and the production of original content—as mentioned recently by Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of the Axel Springer media group. In the software industry—like the cybersecurity industry—AI will help build software and products much more quickly—think GitHub Copilot. This may put some tech workers at risk as less people are required to do the job. The potential societal impact goes far beyond jobs. Generative AI presents big risks in terms of cybersecurity. In a recent, and very interesting, technical report, Microsoft Research ran a series of experiments documenting the capabilities of GPT-4. In one experiment, researchers instructed an early version of GPT-4 to plan and execute a cyberattack that consisted of hacking a computer in a local network. It presents both a fascinating and scary use case for the technology.As shown in the report, the main cybersecurity risk will happen when we connect generative AI to tools, so that the AI can interact with the world, learn from the feedback, and adapt. Linux systems are just one example of a tool, which itself includes many tools to interact with the world, such as network commands. There’s also a compiler toolchain, which lets the AI write its own programs. As generative AI typically excels in Linux and programming, from there the possibilities are theoretically infinite.In terms of cybersecurity, the current AI safety protocols are not sufficient, and the protocols in themselves don’t provide perfect protection. OpenAI has reported that for the development of GPT-4 they have worked with 50 experts from domains such as cybersecurity, biorisk, and international security. These experts test the AI in an adversarial manner and ensure that it does not generate harmful content. However, it’s not 100% bullet proof; it’s indeed quite easy to generate harmful content with ChatGPT. Besides the risk to cybersecurity, and in the light of the recent pandemic, we have to consider biorisk as a major concern.That’s why we need to take time to understand the technology. AI research and development should focus on AI safety, alignment, and interpretability. It’s also important that the AI community builds robust watermarking systems. AI will impact many industries, and it’s difficult to predict if it will have a negative or positive long-term effect, especially from a social and economic point of view. That’s a key purpose of the open letter. To give us more runway so that we can make the right decisions.

Tech recruiters have to keep in mind talent shortages, layoffs, budget cuts and economic uncertainty, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion mandates. Suffice it to say, it’s not an easy time to be a recruiter.
But LinkedIn’s The Future of Recruiting 2023 report finds that generative AI tools such as ChatGPT may take some of the pressure off. About two-thirds (68%) of hirers surveyed in February 2023 said they were “very hopeful” or “cautiously optimistic” about generative AI’s impact on recruiting.
“Generative AI — i.e., tools like ChatGPT that intelligently generate content — is a fascinating new technology that holds promise for talent professionals, many of whom believe it can help in time-consuming tasks, like drafting job descriptions and personalized messages to candidates, among others,’’ the report said.
The top recruiting outcomes hiring pro respondents said they would like to see from GAI tools are:

Automate repetitive tasks to prioritize more strategic work (74%)
Make it faster/easier to source candidates (67%)
Make it faster/easier to engage candidates (59%)

How GAI can help recruiters
While the technologies and skills used in the world of work continue to change, today, both are driven by AI, said Jennifer Shappley, vice president of global talent and acquisition at LinkedIn.

            Hostile Workplace Prevention Policy        



“We know that the number one goal of hirers is to find the right candidate fast. Our recent research found that 75% of hirers hope that generative AI can help them uncover new candidates,’’ she said. Another pain point for recruiters is writing a job description, which can be a time-consuming and difficult task, particularly if they are struggling to attract the right candidates.
“With generative AI, we can integrate this technology into our products to help streamline parts of the hiring process, so recruiters can focus their energy on the more strategic aspects of their job,’’ Shappley said.
One way LinkedIn is doing this is by testing new AI-powered job descriptions that will make it faster and easier to write job descriptions and attract quality candidates for a role.
LinkedIn hiring predictions
The report laid out a number of recruitment predictions.
Continue building diverse workforces
Besides the use of GAI in the hiring process, LinkedIn is predicting that employers “will remain committed to building a diverse workforce” despite the uncertain economy.
Though most recruiting pros said hiring overall has been negatively impacted, three out of four said that DEI hiring is not being deprioritized — in fact, nearly 20% said it’s a higher priority now, according to the report.
Hire more contract workers
As a result of the tumultuous times, LinkedIn is also predicting employers will hire more contract workers “as a hedge against uncertainty.”
The job site based this prediction on the fact that in the U.S., for example, LinkedIn job posts for contract positions are growing much faster than job posts for full-time employees, which is relatively stable. The report defines contract positions as labor “contracted” out to a company for a finite amount of time listed by a contract, whether full-time or part-time work.
Keep recruiting/staffing in-house vs external is pretty evenly split
The data indicates a more stable split: 22% of companies expect to spend more on in-house recruiters this year vs. in 2022, while 23% expect to invest more in external staffing firms.
Stay informed about candidates’ top priorities
Another prediction is that companies will keep a closer eye on what candidates most want in order to stay competitive in a tight labor market.
Every month, LinkedIn surveys over 20,000 members about the most important factors they weigh when considering a new job. The top priority for candidates today is excellent compensation and benefits, by a fairly wide margin. This is followed by work-life balance and flexibility and comp, which the report said are also the two fastest-growing priorities year over year.
“There’s much more to your employer brand than good pay and flexibility, and offering them may not make you stand out — but be warned: If you don’t provide them, talent will take notice,’’ the report said.
Upskilling will be key to internal recruiting and diverse hiring
Two other predictions focus on upskilling. One is that business leaders will recognize the value of filling open roles with homegrown talent, given the shaky economy. Some 75% of recruiting pros said that “internal recruiting will be an important factor shaping the future of recruiting over the next five years.”
A related prediction is that upskilling will be a key tool for hiring a diverse workforce. Eighty-one percent of recruiting pros said upskilling and reskilling employees will be an important factor in shaping the future of recruiting over the next five years.
Tips for hiring leaders to attract tech talent
A key way to hire talent today is to focus on skills as opposed to pedigree, Shappley said. “Gone are the days where degrees were prioritized. Today it’s about skills.”
She recommended that talent professionals focus on three things:

Write job descriptions to include skills and not unnecessary qualifiers like a four-year degree.
Ask about a candidate’s skills during the interview process.
Help make sure the entire hiring team has a skills-first focus when hiring.

LinkedIn has been working on creating a skills-first labor market “that makes it easier for employers to hire and develop talent based on skills, and for members to stand out and get hired based on their skills,’’ Shappley said.

AI and the Future of Work: Preparing the Workforce for an AI-Driven Economy
By Brent Orrell
US Chamber of Commerce
April 04, 2023



FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
AI is best positioned to augment the workforce, not replace it. The U.S. Chamber’s Commission on Artificial Intelligence Competition, Inclusion, and Innovation report outlines recommendations for preparing the workforce for the continued integration of AI tools across our economy.
To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the “end of work” have been greatly exaggerated – more than once. Throughout history, the arrival of new technology has been regarded as a threat to human work and, in every instance, new technology has been integral to unlocking new work, new value, and rising incomes.
This hopeful view is not the same thing, however, as saying that new technology, like artificial intelligence, will be all upside for every worker, all the time, everywhere. The recent report from the U.S. Chamber’s Commission on Artificial Intelligence Competition, Inclusion, and Innovation acknowledges that the effects of AI on employment will be both uneven and hard to predict. The report emphasizes that, at its core, AI tools are informing and expanding, not replacing, human labor and, “if developed and deployed ethically, [AI] has the ability to augment human capabilities and empower people to do much more.”
How Workers and Businesses Can Prepare for the AI Economy of the Future
By its nature, technological innovation requires businesses and workers to learn and adapt—and learning and adaptation can be hard. Sometimes, it means upskilling within an existing job and at other times finding a whole new job in a different sector.
This learning and adaptation process is likely to be particularly demanding when it comes to AI. A recent University of Pennsylvania study found that 80 percent of American jobs are likely to see at least 10 percent of their tasks altered by AI while almost 20 percent of jobs will see at least 50 percent of their tasks altered. Another study by Goldman Sachs largely echoed these findings estimating that 18 percent of jobs globally could be computerized with “knowledge” and “information” tasks especially exposed.
During one of the AI Commission’s field hearings, Cheryl Oldham, vice president of education policy at the U.S. Chamber, emphasized that if we’re going to minimize any labor market disruptions and build new and effective pathways that lead to AI-related jobs, “we need to proactively lean into workforce development.”
To do so, the report recommends:
Training and Reskilling: The creation of new programs that can help ease worker transitions find and improve incentives for businesses to invest in retraining as necessary.Educating the Future Workforce: Urging students and workers to prepare early and to continuously upgrade their knowledge, skills, and abilities.Economic Policies: Encouraging Congress to adopt tax policies that support “human labor augmentation” within firms rather than ones that incentivize the substitution of technology for human labor and skill.
AI is neither the end of work nor a future delivered on a golden platter. Rather, it is a new tool that, just like new tools of the past, will take time, effort, and practice to master.

SeekOut Launches Generative AI Technology Based on ChatGPT

By Mark Feffer -   April 4, 2023   





Talent intelligence platform SeekOut launched new generative AI technology based on OpenAI’s GPT. Called SeekOut Assist, the tool allows recruiting teams to quickly move from a job description to initial contact with candidates, the company said.
According to SeekOut, the product works with recruiters to quickly surface qualified candidates. When recruiters paste a job description into the system, SeekOut generates a list of the most qualified candidates for the role.
The system uses GPT technology to break down job descriptions into search criteria such as job title, required skills and preferred skills. It then analyzes over 800 million profiles in SeekOut’s talent database to find the best matches. SeekOut said the search criteria it uses are transparent, explainable and can be further fine-tuned by a recruiter.
Personalized Outreach at Scale
The best recruiters research candidates and craft highly personalized messages to increase their email response rates. SeekOut Assist generates a personalized message to the candidate based on their unique qualifications for the role.
In addition, SeekOut Assist analyzes the information in each candidate’s SeekOut profile, including skills and experiences. The technology uses the candidate profile and job description to write a personalized outreach message to the candidate, improving the chances of a response.  
SeekOut believes its new approach to generative AI could have a serious impact on how recruiters get their jobs done. To use Josh Bersin’s words, “Generative AI will be a total game changer in HR.”
“SeekOut Assist is a big step forward in solving real business problems with the power of Generative AI and will make our customers radically more productive and effective,” said SeekOut Co-Founder and CTO Aravind Bala. “We’re excited about the future of AI in the HR technology space, and look forward to working with our customers and partners to build new tools that make recruiters’ contributions to their organizations even more strategic.”

Sam Johnson



					Editor-In-Chief, Otter PR				




April 3, 2023




 








Sam Johnson, editor-in-chief of Otter PR, says that as advanced as AI technology has become throughout the past several decades, it still lacks critical qualities, features, and skills that can be easily replicated by human writers when working with clients but not by a machine.
The world is abuzz with talk of AI and all it can do to make our lives easier. It is the stuff of science fiction now come to life, and many who have predicted the emergence of AI over the years are heralding its arrivalOpens a new window . 
However, for those who work as writers — whether it be copywriting, journalism or creative writing — the emergence of AI in these industries has caused a dust-up of concern. Since AI is here to stay, what does this mean for those who write for a living or those who lead them?

AI programs like ChatGPT and OpenAI have revolutionized content creation and copywriting. There is no denying this, yet as intuitive as these programs may be, they are far from replacing a team of client-focused human beings. With creativity and nuance still necessary to convey human emotion, the world still needs human writers.
The Capabilities of AI for Writing
AI is not coming to take our jobs, writers. Not yet, but the fear of it doing so is understandable. Text-based AI programs can quickly spit out a comprehensive article outline in seconds and generate an entire article based on that outline in minutes. The result is a good piece that would pass muster with most editors and outlets. 
Indeed, these programs are handy tools for writers. They can outline drafts, generate fresh ideas, or revitalize outdated pitches. Need a little nuance? Tweak your requests within the program, and you’ll suddenly receive a completely new, computer-generated writing portion. 
These programs access a remarkable amount of data and are lightning-fast. They tap into other stories, research, and content created (by humans) to generate functional pieces that accomplish what functional writing is intended to do: compile data and inform readers. 

Moreover, the capabilities of AI programs like ChatGPT are beneficial to career writers. The outlining capabilities alone could save journalists and bloggers several hours of work each week. As long as you trust the information the program is pulling and compiling, your days of searching the internet for just the right bits of research may be numbered. 
Frankly, I don’t know any writer who would scoff at freeing up some of their time that would otherwise be dedicated to research and outlining. The ability of AI programs to do the frontline work of compiling data, outlining, and prompting ideas can prove endlessly helpful for writers looking to maximize their productivity and output. 
With all that current AI is capable of and all of the advancements that will come soon, writers need to think of AI not as a replacement but as an additional tool in their toolbelt. AI will hopefully improve the writer’s job, but it is not on its way to replacing human writers soon.

The Benefit of Human Writers
AI is based on statistics and quantitative modeling. It is unfamiliar with emotion and often struggles with context, hyperbole, and prose. These programs cannot think independently of human intervention because they are utilitarian — they are merely meant to serve a purpose and get a job done as efficiently as possible. 
We live in a world where emotional language still serves a purpose; hyperbole, humor, and stunning prose thrill people, win awards, and make a difference in people’s lives. AI-generated content gets the job done, but it is not yet sentient to the point where it can replace the genius of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists or authors. 
This is where the benefit of a team of human writers comes in. Human creativity is endless; we can sense the needs of other humans, bend our interactions to fit those needs and create pieces that speak to issues so beautifully that they can alter the perception and opinions of others. 
Service, promotion, and marketing are still very human ideals. If given the opportunity, human beings will excel far beyond anything a computer program could produce.
Client support and collaboration are other areas where human beings will always surpass the potential of AI. In virtually every global industry and market, it’s imperative that writers can communicate well with clients to tell stories properly or bring visions to life. A person could input all of the commands in the world into an AI program, and it still would not make up for the benefit of having a human being field their requests. 
To hear the inflection in one’s voice, to read body language and facial expression, and to take constructive criticism and expand on ideas are all human abilities that cannot be replicated by a machine — one that was created by humans, for humans. When clients request changes that need to be made or nuance that needs to be added, it is based on human knowledge of their market and intent, the latter of which no machine today can truly understand. And yet, every day, human writers quickly form relationships with clients, come to understand their particularities, and produce work that ultimately benefits the client, the writer, and the writer’s employer.

The Need for Human Expression 
The fear built around the expansion of AI capable of churning out articles, blogs, emails, and even books is not entirely unwarranted. There is no doubt that AI will change the way writers work, perhaps even irreversibly so. The more companies across all industries become aware of the capabilities of AI to streamline processes and, ultimately, save them time and money, the more they will champion the rise of AI. 
As AI continues gaining traction in the modern workplace, writers must adapt or risk being left behind. Lower-level copywriters, editors, or those who fail to expand on their writing skills will likely be the first to feel the potential adverse effects of AI. However, there still needs to be more specialized services for talented writing teams. 
Jobs being replaced with the rise of technological advancements is a worry that has existed for a while. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the same fear has been expressed by workers who were eventually replaced by innovations in automation. Throughout the 20th century, many have witnessed customer service roles lose out to more efficient technological interventions. But as long as there are new ideas, talented wordsmiths must articulate those ideas artfully. 
The need for pure human expression will endure as long as we hold it sacred. Career writers will significantly benefit from learning what they can about AI and how they can employ it to enhance their work and help tighten their creative process.

ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. The chatbot saw a meteoric rise, gaining 1 million users within the first five days of its November 30, 2022 launch. By January, it became the fastest-growing platform with 100 million users, reaching 1 billion visits in February alone. To put ChatGPT’s ascendency into perspective, it took social media app Twitter five years to reach 100 million users, while Instagram took 2 ½ years after its launch and TikTok nine months.


ChatGPT’s resonance with its global users and overnight success can be attributed mainly to the chatbot’s many uses and its human capability. OpenAI’s technology platform managed to score in the 90th percentile on both the college-entry SATs and the attorney bar exam.

Cutting-Edge Job Seekers See An Advantage To Using ChatGPT
Forward-thinking job seekers are also leveraging artificial intelligence in their job searches. According to a February survey from ResumeBuilder.com of 1,000 current and recent job hunters, nearly half (46%) of job seekers are using the chatbot to craft their résumés or cover letters.

PROMOTED
Seventy percent of respondents saw a higher response rate from companies when using ChatGPT. Seventy-eight percent of candidates who used the chatbot scored interviews, while nearly six in 10 job hunters were hired after using the AI tool during their application process.

However, it is worth mentioning that 11% of job seekers were rejected once it was learned from the hiring company that the candidate used ChatGPT.
With the AI platform disrupting the job search, I spoke with career coaches about the manner in which they were advising job seekers on how to gain a competitive advantage by using ChatGPT to streamline and guide the application and interview process.

“ChatGPT is empowering job seekers. It can provide answers to their specific questions beyond what a basic Google search will find (articles and videos). For example, ChatGPT can help develop a list of questions a job seeker can ask during an informational meeting. It can help job seekers identify alternative job titles in a new industry. It can even help them make a career shift to something totally different. Plus, it helps get rid of writer's block. It can craft a rough draft of a cover letter, thank you note or even a follow-up email.”

Samantha Foster, Executive Recruiter
“ChatGPT is a great ‘complementary’ tool. I just started using it and it cuts the time I spend rewriting boring job descriptions and preparing better interview questions. For candidates, it is definitely helping them stay organized when applying to and interviewing for several positions simultaneously.”
Sweta Regmi, Career And Résumé Strategist/ Interview And Branding Coach
“Job seekers have the power to use AI just the way employers have been using it for years for recruiting.
I tested ChatGPT as a job seeker by providing the prompt. I asked ChatGPT to identify core competencies based on the targeted role and added four job postings. Now, I have the resources with soft skills and hard skills to create a résumé. It helped me understand my strength, weakness, opportunities and threat (SWOT) to self-reflect.
As an employer, I created job descriptions to test out. It saved me time on productivity. I still have to have knowledge of HR and employment laws in my country and city. AI can only help if you have the skills or knowledge.”
Marti Konstant, Workforce And Career Agility Trainer And Writer
“Use AI as your personal genius bar and you will not lose jobs to robots. You will only lose out to those who embrace AI.
AI use cases for job search: conduct job research; compare your transferable skills to open up ideas for new role possibilities; create project planning examples to demonstrate your understanding of the work requirements; extract language and requirements from job description to use in your job search process and ATS; develop branding phrases and talking points that integrate your competencies and strengths; feed in your accomplishments, milestones and your ""about"" section via LinkedIn (requires specific prompt crafting) and identify case studies in your area of expertise (digital marketing, product development and learning and development) and include these in your written and verbal talking points during the outreach or interview process.”
Ruth Sternberg, Job Search And Résumé Writer
“AI can help you when you're preparing your materials for a job search by providing a compilation or list of expectations from job postings, all in one place; providing rough organization of your career history—an outline to give you somewhere to start and helping you identify new job possibilities.
When you feed it your résumé, you can ask to see jobs that seem to align with it. ChatGPT can give you a list of what’s important for a particular role, based on descriptions and other developed material, so you can compare your own job history to see if you match up. You also can ask the software to suggest ways you could improve what you’ve written based on a particular job. It can help you determine what types of jobs match a particular college major.
It also could translate résumés into other languages; add keywords from a particular industry and help you spot incongruities or flag unusual claims in your narrative to prompt a fact check.”
Virginia Franco, LinkedIn And Résumé Writer
“I see AI tools serving as powerful tools for job seekers, who will be able to use it to support interview prep and even outreach. AI could disrupt ATS systems as we know them! I’ve tested it out by plugging in the résumé I wrote and a job posting and asking it to write a cover letter. It provided a great start, but a so-so final product. Once I edited it, it was good!”
Adrienne Tom, Executive Résumé And LinkedIn Profile Writer
“Job seekers must understand the limitations of AI. Content is not always accurate, customized, or personalized. So, AI support may only be a starting point or a booster, not the complete solution. The output of AI is typically only as good as the input or questions it is asked. So knowing what to ask is critical.”
Shennee Rutt, Executive Résumé Writer And Career Strategist
“I think as AI evolves, and more shortcuts from writing a résumé, applying for a job, interviewing could potentially eliminate highly qualified candidates due to bias in scripted computer-generated content. It also removes the “human” in human resources and talent acquisition. Since humans write the codes, it could be biased and adversely impact job hunters. If the human-being who writes the code has biased discrimination and it is interpreted in the code written, this could impact candidates and job seekers with disabilities or pre-existing conditions.”

The implications of AI — both positive and negative — have fascinated experts and amateurs alike for many years, but there are some great benefits of artificial intelligence that are perhaps not frequently considered.
Digital technology has been developing at breakneck speed over the last few decades. Most of us have significantly more technological power in our pockets than in our homes in the 90s. Coating wine bottle with wax and honey extraction, the best of IE this week

There have also been significant breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning. These concepts have allowed machines to process and analyze information and, in some cases, to learn for themselves very sophisticatedly.
Thanks to these developments in AI technology, machines can now learn to perform complex functions such as facial recognition.

That being said, there has been significant debate regarding the risks artificial intelligence poses to humanity, including concerns that AI can be misused or may take over humanity. For example, movies like The Terminator, Westworld, and Saturn depict grim pictures of killer robots.
Fears of the potentially darker side of AI are one thing, but they are balanced by some potential benefits that AI and ML could deliver. Here are some of the most notable examples. 
1. AI has and will continue to enhance automation

KUKA Roboter GmbH, Bachmann/Wikimedia
Today, AI-augmented robots can easily perform various automated tasks, both inside and outside the factory, without the need for constant human intervention. AI is poised to be a transformative technology for some applications and tasks across a vast suite of industries.
Machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies are already being used to reduce human workloads in assembly, packaging, customer service, and HR, among other areas, and the move has reduced operational and employee costs substantially. 
An example of AI’s inexhaustible capacity to enhance the level of automation can be seen in the Japanese machine tool builder, Okuma. In 2018, Okuma highlighted many innovations to showcase the future of smart manufacturing.
This includes robots for plants of all sizes, new and improved machine tools, and smart machine tools. Such examples clearly demonstrate the potential of AI for future work in the industry. 
We may also see AI and robots working alongside human operatives. Robotic coworkers or Cobots will assist, rather than fully replace human workers, and improve the overall efficiency and general happiness of humans in the workplace. 
Companies like Amazon already benefit from this kind of working relationship between us and the machines. 
2. AI can help eliminate the necessity for humans to perform tedious tasks

One of the main benefits of artificial intelligence is its ability to reduce the drudgery involved in many work tasks. Repetitive, tedious tasks in any job are the bane of many human workers. While monotony may result in human perfection, computer automation remains the best and cheapest option for monotonous tasks.  
Machines excel when executing standardized processing work like data entry, freeing up human operatives to concentrate on the more creative and interpersonal aspects of their jobs or lives. For example, financial institutions today take full advantage of AI to make banking quicker and easier for consumers. With AI at the helm of simple and repetitive tasks, financial workers can focus on the tedious aspects of their job. 
The 2019 MIT SMR-BCG Artificial Intelligence Global Executive Study and Research Report reveals that the early AI adopters and winners focus on organization-wide alignment with AI, integration, and investment. 45% of the study’s respondents recognize that one of the dangers of AI is the fact that the competition can easily utilize the tool to drive efficiency. 47% of the respondents strongly agreed that employees will have the space and time to think creatively and drive the business goals while AI does the heavy and repetitive lifting.    
 3. Improving weather forecasting is another way AI can benefit humans

Weather forecasting is highly complex and needs computing and deep-learning networks to sift through and analyze large data sets infinitely faster than humans ever could. 
In the past few years, we have seen artificial intelligence and its associated technologies used in weather and climate forecasting. Climate Informatics, for example, enables greater collaboration between data scientists and climate scientists. 
There are countless applications of AI aimed at accurate weather forecasting. IBM, for instance, used its computers to improve its forecasts as early as the mid-1990s.
4. Next-generation disaster response is another reason why AI is good

2017 California wildfires led to the burning of more than 1 million acres of land. 46 people lost their lives to the devastation, and hundreds of homes were reportedly burnt to the ground. The large-scale wildfires in Australia between 2019 and 2020 also caused severe damage and loss of life. 
Due to the increasing threats of extreme weather events like these, more and more government authorities and organizations are embracing artificial intelligence to help fight these disasters with algorithms and satellite data. 
AI has demonstrated its utility in building smart disaster responses and providing real-time data on disasters and weather events. With AI, governments save valuable time and enable disaster response in a more targeted and efficient manner. Once sophisticated enough, it may be able to offer early and crucial warnings that will save lives. 

5. AI could fight alongside humans in battles

It is a common trope that AI will one day be the end of humanity because robots and machines will deskill, destroy, or enslave us all. However, robots may just be the ultimate human companions in war. AI shows immense promise as a potential application in war, as stipulated in Paul Scharre’s book “Army of None.”
According to Scharre, militaries and machine intelligence are expected to work in tandem to conduct wars. This would likely mean AI and robots taking on the more dangerous roles in combat instead of putting human beings in the literal firing line. Needless to say, there are some very serious ethical issues to work out first before we give AI the ability to potentially take life. 
But AI could help save human lives in other areas like disaster rescue situations. We may, one day, see AI-powered firefighters or assist first responders in locatingsaving and save lives during environmental or industrial catastrophes. 
6. AI is on-call all the time

AI never sleeps. Rather than an ominous statement, this is actually potentially very beneficial to us all. 
Humans need to eat, sleep and rest; machines and AI do not. So long as it has a supply of electricity, In theory, AI can work all the time, for eternity. 
This will reduce errors, maintain critical services, and enable businesses and other organizations to provide services their users rely on (like helplines, etc.). For educational and research institutions, this could lead to some breakthroughs in future discoveries that could have wide-ranging benefits for us all. 
7. AI could create new jobs!

While there are some very real concerns about the potential to eliminate or make some types of jobs redundant, AI could also open entirely new areas of work. Applying AI in businesses will also force the job market to evolve, which, with the right preparation, could be a very good thing. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

From various maintenance and supporting roles, to entirely new careers not yet dreamed of, the widespread adoption of AI could be a brighter future for all of us. And we’ve been here before.
Similar fears to those around AI have surfaced around most new forms of technology. Sometimes, the fears are well-founded, and sometimes not, but the genie of new technology cannot be put back in the bottle. All we can do is learn how to use it wisely and to our advantage. 
And that is your lot for today. 
While there are some genuine concerns around its development, AI could be the best thing since sliced bread is adopted properly.

Its abilities were astonishing — and squarely in the bailiwick of people who generate content, such as advertising copy and blog posts, for a living.“They’re horrified,” said Rebecca Matter, the institute’s president. Over the holidays, she scrambled to organize a webinar on the pitfalls and potential of the new artificial-intelligence technology. More than 3,000 people signed up, she said, and the overall message was cautionary but reassuring: Writers could use ChatGPT to complete assignments more quickly, and move into higher-level roles in content planning and search-engine optimization.“I do think it’s going to minimize short-form copy projects,” Ms. Matter said. “But on the flip side of that, I think there will be more opportunities for things like strategy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOpenAI’s ChatGPT is the latest advance in a steady march of innovations that have offered the potential to transform many occupations and wipe out others, sometimes in tandem. It is too early to tally the enabled and the endangered, or to gauge the overall impact on labor demand and productivity. But it seems clear that artificial intelligence will impinge on work in different ways than previous waves of technology.The positive view of tools like ChatGPT is that they could be complements to human labor, rather than replacements. Not all workers are sanguine, however, about the prospective impact.Katie Brown is a grant writer in the Chicago suburbs for a small nonprofit group focused on addressing domestic violence. She was shocked to learn in early February that a professional association for grant writers was promoting the use of artificial-intelligence software that would automatically complete parts of an application, requiring the human simply to polish it before submitting.The platform, called Grantable, is based on the same technology as ChatGPT, and it markets itself to freelancers who charge by the application. That, she thought, clearly threatens opportunities in the industry.“For me, it’s common sense: Which do you think a small nonprofit will pick?” Ms. Brown said. “A full-time-salary-plus-benefits person, or someone equipped with A.I. that you don’t have to pay benefits for?”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTArtificial intelligence and machine learning have been operating in the background of many businesses for years, helping to evaluate large numbers of possible decisions and better align supply with demand, for example. And plenty of technological advancements over centuries have decreased the need for certain workers — although each time, the jobs created have more than offset the number lost.ImageGuillermo Rubio has found that his job as a copywriter has changed markedly since he started using ChatGPT to generate ideas for blog posts.Credit...In-camera double exposure by Mark Abramson for The New York TimesChatGPT, however, is the first to confront such a broad range of white-collar workers so directly, and to be so accessible that people could use it in their own jobs. And it is improving rapidly, with a new edition released this month. According to a survey conducted by the job search website ZipRecruiter after ChatGPT’s release, 62 percent of job seekers said they were concerned that artificial intelligence could derail their careers.“ChatGPT is the one that made it more visible,” said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute who studies automation’s effects. “So I think it did start to raise questions about where timelines might start to be accelerated.”That’s also the conclusion of a White House report on the implications of A.I. technology, including ChatGPT. “The primary risk of A.I. to the work force is in the general disruption it is likely to cause to workers, whether they find that their jobs are newly automated or that their job design has fundamentally changed,” the authors wrote.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor now, Guillermo Rubio has found that his job as a copywriter has changed markedly since he started using ChatGPT to generate ideas for blog posts, write first drafts of newsletters, create hundreds of slight variations on stock advertising copy and summon research on a subject about which he might write a white paper.

More voices, better journalism. The article you are reading is in part the result of The Times inviting readers to share their experiences. With questionnaires, we get a wide range of views that often lead to a more deeply reported article. This helps us ensure that our journalism reflects the world we cover.Here’s more on how it works and why it’s good for us and you.Since he still charges his clients the same rates, the tool has simply allowed him to work less. If the going rate for copy goes down, though — which it might, as the technology improves — he’s confident he’ll be able to move into consulting on content strategy, along with production.“I think people are more reluctant and fearful, with good reason,” Mr. Rubio, who is in Orange County, Calif., said. “You could look at it in a negative light, or you can embrace it. I think the biggest takeaway is you have to be adaptable. You have to be open to embracing it.”After decades of study, researchers understand a lot about automation’s impact on the work force. Economists including Daron Acemoglu at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have found that since 1980, technology has played a primary role in amplifying income inequality. As labor unions atrophied, hollowing out systems for training and retraining, workers without college educations saw their bargaining power reduced in the face of machines capable of rudimentary tasks.The advent of ChatGPT three months ago, however, has prompted a flurry of studies predicated on the idea that this isn’t your average robot.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne team of researchers ran an analysis showing the industries and occupations that are most exposed to artificial intelligence, based on a model adjusted for generative language tools. Topping the list were college humanities professors, legal services providers, insurance agents and telemarketers. Mere exposure, however, doesn’t determine whether the technology is likely to replace workers or merely augment their skills.Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang, doctoral students at M.I.T., conducted a randomized, controlled trial on experienced professionals in such fields as human relations and marketing. The participants were given tasks that typically take 20 to 30 minutes, like writing news releases and brief reports. Those who used ChatGPT completed the assignments 37 percent faster on average than those who didn’t — a substantial productivity increase. They also reported a 20 percent increase in job satisfaction.A third study — using a program developed by GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft — evaluated the impact of generative A.I. specifically on software developers. In a trial run by GitHub’s researchers, developers given an entry-level task and encouraged to use the program, called Copilot, completed their task 55 percent faster than those who did the assignment manually.Those productivity gains are unlike almost any observed since the widespread adoption of the personal computer.“It does seem to be doing something fundamentally different,” said David Autor, another M.I.T. economist, who advises Ms. Zhang and Mr. Noy. “Before, computers were powerful, but they simply and robotically did what people programmed them to do.” Generative artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is “adaptive, it learns and is capable of flexible problem solving.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat’s very apparent to Peter Dolkens, a software developer for a company that primarily makes online tools for the sports industry. He has been integrating ChatGPT into his work for tasks like summarizing chunks of code to aid colleagues who may pick up the project after him, and proposing solutions to problems that have him stumped. If the answer isn’t perfect, he’ll ask ChatGPT to refine it, or try something different.“It’s the equivalent of a very well-read intern,” Mr. Dolkens, who is in London, said. “They might not have the experience to know how to apply it, but they know all the words, they’ve read all the books and they’re able to get part of the way there.”There’s another takeaway from the initial research: ChatGPT and Copilot elevated the least experienced workers the most. If true, more generally, that could mitigate the inequality-widening effects of artificial intelligence.On the other hand, as each worker becomes more productive, fewer workers are required to complete a set of tasks. Whether that results in fewer jobs in particular industries depends on the demand for the service provided, and the jobs that might be created in helping to manage and direct the A.I. “Prompt engineering,” for example, is already a skill that those who play around with ChatGPT long enough can add to their résumés.Since demand for software code seems insatiable, and developers’ salaries are extremely high, increasing productivity seems unlikely to foreclose opportunities for people to enter the field.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat won’t be the same for every profession, however, and Dominic Russo is pretty sure it won’t be true for his: writing appeals to pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies when they reject prescriptions for expensive drugs. He has been doing the job for about seven years, and has built expertise with only on-the-job training, after studying journalism in college.After ChatGPT came out, he asked it to write an appeal on behalf of someone with psoriasis who wanted the expensive drug Otezla. The result was good enough to require only a few edits before submitting it.“If you knew what to prompt the A.I. with, anyone could do the work,” Mr. Russo said. “That’s what’s really scares me. Why would a pharmacy pay me $70,000 a year, when they can license the technology and pay people $12 an hour to run prompts into it?”To try to protect himself from that possible future, Mr. Russo has been building up his side business: selling pizzas out of his house in southern New Jersey, an enterprise that he figures won’t be disrupted by artificial intelligence.Yet.Audio produced by Kate Winslett.Lydia DePillis is a reporter on the Business desk who covers the changing American economy and what it means for people’s lives.

		States and municipalities are eyeing restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence-based bots to find, screen, interview, and hire job candidates because of privacy and bias issues. Some states have already put laws on the books.	




 









Organizations are rapidly adopting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the discovery, screening, interviewing, and hiring of candidates. It can reduce time and work needed to find job candidates and it can more accurately match applicant skills to a job opening.
But legislators and other lawmakers are concerned that using AI-based tools to discover and vet talent could intrude on job seekers’ privacy and may introduce racial- and gender-based biases already baked into the software.
“We have seen a substantial groundswell over the past two to three years with regard to legislation and regulatory rule-making as it relates to the use of AI in various facets of the workplace,” said Samantha Grant, a partner with the law firm of Reed Smith. 











 
 
 
States, including California, Maryland, and Washington, have enacted or are considering legislation to put rules around using AI for talent acquisition. The European Union’s EU AI Act is also aimed at addressing issues surrounding automated hiring software.

On April 1, Italy became the first Western nation to ban further development of ChatGPT over privacy concerns after the natural language processing app experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information. ChatGPT is the popular chatbot created by OpenAI and backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft.
The Italian data protection authority is also investigating whether OpenAI’s chatbot already violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation rules created to protect personal data inside and outside the EU. OpenAI has complied with the new law, according to a report by the BBC.











 
 
 
Congress is considering the federal Algorithmic Accountability Act, which, if passed, would require employers to perform an impact assessment of any automated decision-making system that has a significant effect on an individual’s access to, terms, or availability of employment. 
In addition, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently announced that it intends to increase oversight and scrutiny of AI tools used to screen and hire workers. As part of that effort, the EEOC held a public hearing Jan. 31 to explore the potential benefits and harms of AI in hiring situations, according to Grant.
“The current swell of laws and regulations related to AI in HR is like a wave under the water — building, gaining momentum, and getting ready to come ashore,” said Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of Global Strategy at Phenom, an AI-enabled hiring platform provider. “The new laws are necessary and welcomed as technology has outpaced existing regulations for protecting underrepresented groups.”











 
 
 
New York City makes a move
One of the attempts to wrangle AI-based automated employment-decision tools is New York City’s Local Law 144, slated to go into effect in April. The law, originally passed in 2021, was postponed due to the “high volume of public comments” during the rule-making process. It prohibits employers from using automated employment selection tools unless an organization institutes specific bias auditing and makes the resulting data publicly available.
A company must also disclose its use of AI to job candidates who live in New York City.
The New York City law could be a catalyst for other states to adopt similar legislation — since so many companies do business in the city and it is an epicenter of finance and commerce, Jurkiewicz said. “Implementing such a law will undoubtedly influence similar laws throughout the US and potentially other regions,” he said.











 
 
 
While the city ordinance implies employers must conduct an audit, vendors are preemptively doing them to help companies they work with, “both as security for existing clients, as well as a way to differentiate/appeal to potential prospective clients,” said Ben Eubanks, chief research officer with Lighthouse Research & Advisory.
“I think everybody’s holding their breath and watching to see what’s going to happen in New York, partially because the rules around these tools [require them] to be audited [and] evaluated and the vendor has to prove they’ve passed some approved checklist,” Eubanks said. “At this point, it’s hard to know what it’s going to look like rolling out. I have lots of companies within the vendor community that have been watching this closely.”
Companies offering AI-based recruitment software include Paradox, HireVue, iCIMS, Textio, Phenom, Jobvite, XOR.ai, Upwork, Bullhorn and Eightfold AI.











 
 
 
For example, HireVue’s service includes a chatbot that can hold text-based conversations with job seekers to guide them to jobs that best fit their skills. Phenom’s deep-learning algorithm chatbot sends tailored job recommendations and content based on skills, position fit, location, and experience to candidates so employers can “find and choose you faster.” Not only does it screen applicants, but it can schedule job interviews.
AI talent acquisition software uses numerical scores based on a candidate’s background, skills, and video interview to deliver an overall competency-based score and rankings that can be used in employer decision-making.
This week, Beamery, a multinational AI-based talent management software provider, announced the launch of TalentGPT, a chatbot based on GPT-4 and other large language models (LLMs). The chatbot is aimed at assisting hiring managers, recruiters, candidates and employees in talent acquisition and job searches. The company claims its AI automates rules compliance and mitigates bias risks associated with LLMs, which are the algorithms behind chatbots.











 
 
 
Talent acquisition software and services have touted their AI-based platforms as offering greater diversity, inclusion and equality (DEI) because the computer software can be programmed to be gender and ethnicity neutral; the goal is to eliminate as much human bias as possible.
The problem: humans program the software.
The challenges inherent in AI
As with any “disruptive technology,” Jurkiewicz said AI brings challenges that should be considered and planned for by hiring organizations. They include:











 
 
 

Algorithmic bias.
Lack of transparency.
Legal and ethical concerns.
Over-reliance on AI.
Privacy and data security.
Dehumanization in the hiring process.
Misalignment with organizational culture and values.

A US and EU joint report released this year on the potential economic impact of AI on the future of workforces found that while it can bolster workforce efficiency and innovation, it can exacerbate inequality.
“There is substantial evidence…AI has introduced and perpetuated racial or other forms of bias, both through issues with the underlying datasets used to make decisions, and by unintentional or seemingly benign decisions made by algorithm designers,” the report said. “The challenge for policymakers is to foster progress and innovation in AI while shielding workers and consumers from potential types of harm that could arise.”
The challenges are only expected to grow. From 35% to 45% of companies are expected to use AI-based talent acquisition software and services to help select and interview job prospects in the coming year, according to two recent studies.











 
 
 
Although there are few AI-related employment laws on the books at the moment, employers should expect that to change as the use of AI expands beyond just hiring and into performance evaluations, career projections, and promotion/termination decisions, according to Paul Starkman, an attorney with the Chicago-based law firm Clark Hill.
“And [that] may ultimately morph into consumer information protection laws, such as the European Union’s GDPR and California’s CCPA/CPRA,” Starkman said.
Hiring algorithms aren’t new
While the use of computer algorithms for screening prospective job candidates is not new — simple text searches have been used to parse resumes for decades — the sophistication of the applications and the breadth of their use has rapidly grown.











 
 
 
Nearly three in four organizations boosted their purchase of talent acquisition technology in 2022 and 70% plan to continue investing this year — even if a recession arrives — according to a survey by online enterprise hiring platform Modern Hire. Modern Hire’s fifth annual Hiring Report found that 45% of companies worldwide are using AI to improve recruiting and human resource functions. 
Experts caution that AI recruiting systems are only as good as the programmers who “feed the machine.” If an AI tool ingests data from  resumes of people previously hired by a company — and the recruiting departments that made those decisions harbored subconscious biases and preferences — those biases could be inherited by the AI tool.
For example, Amazon spent a decade training its applicant screening algorithm using its own hiring data. But once it went live, it reportedly showed bias against women. Just the word “woman” would cause the algorithm to rank female applicants lower than men.











 
 
 
Conversely, there are also top tips from online job search sites instructing applicants on how to write resumes that will pass automated screening software, making sure job candidates get seen.
While resume matching to job descriptions is the most common use of AI, tools are also being used to analyze patterns of potential candidates, including segmentation of candidates based on experience, education, skills, and their potential for retention once hired, according to Bret Greenstein, a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) partner and Data Analytics and AI researcher.
To perform more detailed searches for potential candidates, AI platforms must collect massive amounts of data on prospective candidates without their expressed permission, according to Eubanks, author of the book Talent Scarcity: How to Hire and Retain a Shrinking Workforce. That information can include facial recognition software and video interviews companies may keep, share, and filter with AI to determine favorable candidates.











 
 
 
In 2019, the Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (“AIVI Act”) was signed into law, making the state the first to regulate  automated “interview bots” and other forms of AI to analyze applicants’ facial expressions, body language, word choices, and vocal tones during video interviews. And in 2020, Maryland enacted a similar law prohibiting employers from using facial recognition algorithms in hiring unless the applicant agreed to it.
In a 2019 blog, Starkman wrote that AI has been used on video interviews to determine whether an applicant shows characteristics of “successful” candidates. “Multi-state employers should take note of the AIVI Act, as it explicitly applies ‘when considering applicants for positions based in Illinois,'” he wrote.
The built-in bias problem
In an email response to Computerworld, Starkman said that without proper development and use, “AI systems can be biased, either because of bias in the data itself or in how the algorithm processes the data, and that may result in the unintended elimination of certain disabled candidates, foreign-born candidates, and others in discriminatory ways, if no safeguards are in place.”











 
 
 
For example, he said, AI-driven chatbots that communicate with job candidates should be monitored to limit the inadvertent receipt of information about disabilities and other personal characteristics that could lead to discrimination claims. “Another algorithm-assisted hiring and performance evaluation system ultimately had to be scrapped because it was based on past hiring practices and could not be trained to unlearn its programmer’s bias,” he said.
In another illustration, Starkman said software designed to disregard candidates with gaps in their resumes may have unduly impacted women candidates because they were statistically more likely to leave the workforce than men.
“I understand where their hearts are at — they want to make things safer and more equitable for the candidate population out there,” Eubanks said. “But the challenge is the rules they’re making [aren’t] always aligned with how companies hire.”
For example, Eubanks said, the Illinois law requires companies to delete any video interviews after 30 days. Many employees quit a short time after being hired. So, by the time the company goes back to look at a second-choice candidate, their video interview is deleted.











 
 
 
“Some of those nuances they put into laws…, [they’re] put in place by people who don’t always understand how hiring works,” Eubanks said. “They’re not doing the day to day [work]. And because of that, it creates some complexities, challenges, and headaches.”
To address the challenges, organizations should adopt a balanced approach that combines the strengths of AI with human judgment or a human in the hiring process loop that has expertise, Jurkiewicz said. “It is vital to ensure that AI-driven employment tools are explainable, unbiased, tested and compliant with applicable laws and ethical guidelines,” he said.
When developed, tested, monitored and implemented responsibility, AI-powered tools can significantly increase diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace.
Studies have shown that many underrepresented communities either lack the skills or do not understand the impact of not promoting their favorable attributes (skills, behaviors, competencies and experiences) as other, systemically well-trained communities can and have [done] historically, according to Jurkiewicz.
“AI can surface individuals’ positive attributes and encourage underrepresented groups to compete for work they may not have thought possible,” he said.

OpenAI’s chatbot, powered by its latest large language model, can write poems, tell jokes, and churn out essays that look like a human created them. Prompt ChatGPT with a few words, and out comes love poems in the form of Yelp reviews, or song lyrics in the style of Nick Cave.The last time generative AI loomed this large, the breakthroughs were in computer vision. Selfies transformed into Renaissance-style portraits and prematurely aged faces filled social media feeds. Five years later, it’s the leap forward in natural language processing, and the ability of large language models to riff on just about any theme, that has seized the popular imagination. And it’s not just language: Generative models can also learn the grammar of software code, molecules, natural images, and a variety of other data types.The applications for this technology are growing every day, and we’re just starting to explore the possibilities. At IBM Research, we’re working to help our customers use generative models to write high-quality software code faster, discover new molecules, and train trustworthy conversational chatbots grounded on enterprise data. We’re even using generative AI to create synthetic data to build more robust and trustworthy AI models and to stand-in for real data protected by privacy and copyright laws.As the field continues to evolve, we thought we’d take a step back and explain what we mean by generative AI, how we got here, and how these models work.An overview from IBM expert Kate SouleWhat are generative AI models?The rise of deep generative modelsGenerative AI refers to deep-learning models that can take raw data — say, all of Wikipedia or the collected works of Rembrandt — and “learn” to generate statistically probable outputs when prompted. At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data and draw from it to create a new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.Generative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. The rise of deep learning, however, made it possible to extend them to images, speech, and other complex data types. Among the first class of models to achieve this cross-over feat were variational autoencoders, or VAEs, introduced in 2013. VAEs were the first deep-learning models to be widely used for generating realistic images and speech.“VAEs opened the floodgates to deep generative modeling by making models easier to scale,” said Akash Srivastava, an expert on generative AI at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. “Much of what we think of today as generative AI started here.”Hear from other AI expertsDmitri Krotov is on a quest to improve AI.Ruchir Puri leads the charge on code modernization.Kush Varshney explains how governance is applied throughout the AI pipeline.Autoencoders work by encoding unlabeled data into a compressed representation, and then decoding the data back into its original form. “Plain” autoencoders were used for a variety of purposes, including reconstructing corrupted or blurry images. Variational autoencoders added the critical ability to not just reconstruct data, but to output variations on the original data.This ability to generate novel data ignited a rapid-fire succession of new technologies, from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to diffusion models, capable of producing ever more realistic — but fake — images. In this way, VAEs set the stage for today’s generative AI.They are built out of blocks of encoders and decoders, an architecture that also underpins today’s large language models. Encoders compress a dataset into a dense representation, arranging similar data points closer together in an abstract space. Decoders sample from this space to create something new while preserving the dataset’s most important features.Transformers, introduced by Google in 2017 in a landmark paper  “Attention Is All You Need,” combined the encoder-decoder architecture with a text-processing mechanism called attention to change how language models were trained. An encoder converts raw unannotated text into representations known as embeddings; the decoder takes these embeddings together with previous outputs of the model, and successively predicts each word in a sentence.Through fill-in-the-blank guessing games, the encoder learns how words and sentences relate to each other, building up a powerful representation of language without anyone having to label parts of speech and other grammatical features. Transformers, in fact, can be pre-trained at the outset without a particular task in mind. Once these powerful representations are learned, the models can later be specialized — with much less data — to perform a given task.Several innovations made this possible. Transformers processed words in a sentence all at once, allowing text to be processed in parallel, speeding up training. Earlier techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks processed words one by one. Transformers also learned the positions of words and their relationships, context that allowed them to infer meaning and disambiguate words like “it” in long sentences.By eliminating the need to define a task upfront, transformers made it practical to pre-train language models on vast amounts of raw text, allowing them to grow dramatically in size. Previously, people gathered and labeled data to train one model on a specific task. With transformers, you could train one model on a massive amount of data and then adapt it to multiple tasks by fine-tuning it on a small amount of labeled task-specific data.Transformers have come to be known as foundation models for their versatility. “If you wanted to improve a classifier, you used to have to feed it more labeled data,” said Srivastava. “Now, with foundation models, you can feed the model large amounts of unlabeled data to learn a representation that generalizes well to many tasks.”Language transformers today are used for non-generative tasks like classification and entity extraction as well as generative tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering. More recently, transformers have stunned the world with their capacity to generate convincing dialogue, essays, and other content.Language transformers fall into three main categories: encoder-only models, decoder-only models, and encoder-decoder models.Encoder-only models like BERT power search engines and customer-service chatbots, including IBM’s Watson Assistant. Encoder-only models are widely used for non-generative tasks like classifying customer feedback and extracting information from long documents. In a project with NASA, IBM is building an encoder-only model to mine millions of earth-science journals for new knowledge.Decoder-only models like the GPT family of models are trained to predict the next word without an encoded representation. GPT-3, at 175 billion parameters, was the largest language model of its kind when OpenAI released it in 2020. Other massive models — Google’s PaLM (540 billion parameters) and open-access BLOOM (176 billion parameters), among others, have since joined the scene.Encoder-decoder models, like Google’s Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, or T5, combine features of both BERT and GPT-style models. They can do many of the generative tasks that decoder-only models can, but their compact size makes them faster and cheaper to tune and serve.Generative AI and large language models have been progressing at a dizzying pace, with new models, architectures, and innovations appearing almost daily.Supervised learning strikes backThe ability to harness unlabeled data was the key innovation that unlocked the power of generative AI. But human supervision has recently made a comeback and is now helping to drive large language models forward. AI developers are increasingly using supervised learning to shape our interactions with generative models and their powerful embedded representations.Instruction-tuning, introduced with Google’s FLAN series of models, has enabled generative models to move beyond simple tasks to assist in a more interactive, generalized way. Feeding the model instructions paired with responses on a wide range of topics can prime it to generate not just statistically probable text, but humanlike answers to questions like, “What is the capital of France?” or requests like, “Sort the following list of numbers.”By carefully engineering a set of prompts — the initial inputs fed to a foundation model — the model can be customized to perform a wide range of tasks. In some cases, no labeled data is required at all. You simply ask the model to perform a task, including those it hasn’t explicitly been trained to do. This completely data-free approach is called zero-shot learning, because it requires no examples. To improve the odds the model will produce what you’re looking for, you can also provide one or more examples in what’s known as one- or few-shot learning.Zero- and few-shot learning dramatically lower the time it takes to build an AI solution, since minimal data gathering is required to get a result. But as powerful as zero- and few-shot learning are, they come with a few limitations. First, many generative models are sensitive to how their instructions are formatted, which has inspired a new AI discipline known as prompt-engineering. A good instruction prompt will deliver the desired results in one or two tries, but this often comes down to placing colons and carriage returns in the right place. While effective, prompt engineering can also be fiddly. A prompt that works beautifully on one model may not transfer to other models.Another limitation of zero- and few-shot prompting for enterprises is the difficulty of incorporating proprietary data, often a key asset. If the generative model is large, fine-tuning it on enterprise data can become prohibitively expensive. Techniques like prompt-tuning and adaptors have emerged as alternatives. They allow you to adapt the model without having to adjust its billions to trillions of parameters. They work by distilling the user’s data and target task into a small number of parameters that are inserted into a frozen large model. There, they modulate the model’s behavior without directly changing it.“Parameter-efficient tuning methods allow users to have their cake and eat it too,” said David Cox, IBM director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. “You can leverage the power of a large pre-trained model with your own proprietary data. Together, prompt engineering and parameter-efficient tuning provide a powerful suite of tools for getting a model to do what you want, without spending time and money on traditional deep-learning solutions.”Most recently, human supervision is shaping generative models by aligning their behavior with ours. Alignment refers to the idea that we can shape a generative model’s responses so that they better align with what we want to see. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an alignment method popularized by OpenAI that gives models like ChatGPT their uncannily human-like conversational abilities. In RLHF, a generative model outputs a set of candidate responses that humans rate for correctness. Through reinforcement learning, the model is adjusted to output more responses like those highly rated by humans. This style of training results in an AI system that can output what humans deem as high-quality conversational text.Where is generative AI headed?Until recently, a dominant trend in generative AI has been scale, with larger models trained on ever-growing datasets achieving better and better results. You can now estimate how powerful a new, larger model will be based on how previous models, whether larger in size or trained on more data, have scaled. Scaling laws allow AI researchers to make reasoned guesses about how large models will perform before investing in the massive computing resources it takes to train them.On the flip side, there’s a continued interest in the emergent capabilities that arise when a model reaches a certain size. It’s not just the model’s architecture that causes these skills to emerge but its scale. Examples include glimmers of logical reasoning and the ability to follow instructions. Some labs continue to train ever larger models chasing these emergent capabilities.Recent evidence, however, is bucking the trend toward larger models. Several research groups have shown that smaller models trained on more domain-specific data can often outperform larger, general-purpose models. Researchers at Stanford, for example, trained a relatively small model, PubMedGPT 2.75B, on biomedical abstracts and found that it could answer medical questions significantly better than a generalist model the same size. Their work suggests that smaller, domain-specialized models may be the right choice when domain-specific performance is important.“When you want specific advice, it may be better to ask a domain expert for help rather than trying to find the single smartest person you know,” said Cox, at MIT-IBM. “Specialization also comes with other advantages; a smaller model is vastly cheaper and less carbon-intensive to run.”The question of whether generative models will be bigger or smaller than they are today is further muddied by the emerging trend of model distillation. A group from Stanford recently tried to “distill” the capabilities of OpenAI’s large language model, GPT-3.5, into its Alpaca chatbot, built on a much smaller model. The researchers asked GPT-3.5 to generate thousands of paired instructions and responses, and through instruction-tuning, used this AI-generated data to infuse Alpaca with ChatGPT-like conversational skills. Since then, a herd of similar models with names like Vicuna and Dolly have landed on the internet.“The Alpaca approach calls into question whether large models are essential for emergent capabilities,” said Cox. “Some models, like Dolly 2, are even skipping the distillation step and instead crowdsourcing instruction-response data directly from humans. Taken together, recent events suggest we may be entering an era where more compact models are sufficient for a wide variety of practical use cases.”Generative AI holds enormous potential to create new capabilities and value for enterprise. However, it also can introduce new risks, be they legal, financial or reputational. Many generative models, including those powering ChatGPT, can spout information that sounds authoritative but isn’t true (sometimes called “hallucinations”) or is objectionable and biased. Generative models can also inadvertently ingest information that’s personal or copyrighted in their training data and output it later, creating unique challenges for privacy and intellectual property laws. Solving these issues is an open area of research, and something we covered in our next blog post.Learn more about the future of AIEnhancing LLMs with a framework called retrieval-augmented generation.Putting trained AI models to the test through inferencing.Developing tools to make generative AI more transparent.Subscribe to our Future Forward newsletter and stay up to date on the latest research newsSubscribe to our newsletterHome↳ BlogDate20 Apr 2023AuthorsKim MartineauTopicsAIGenerative AIShareMeet AI-Hilbert, a new algorithm for transforming scientific discoveryNewsPeter Hess19 Jul 2024AIExploratory SciencePhysical SciencesWhat are LLM AI agents?ExplainerKim Martineau18 Jul 2024AIAI for Business AutomationFoundation ModelsGenerative AIIBM reaffirms its commitment to the Rome Call for AI ethicsNewsMike Murphy15 Jul 2024AIFairness, Accountability, TransparencyRevolutionizing geospatial data managementTechnical noteRomeo Kienzler and Thomas Brunschwiler09 Jul 2024AIClimate and SustainabilityFoundation Models",Article,,,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kim Martineau', 'url': 'https://research.ibm.com/blog?author=kim-martineau'}]",2024-05-01T20:04:51.341Z,2023-04-20T12:41:00.000Z,What is generative AI?,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://research-website-prod-cms-uploads.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/Generative_Ai_Linework_Anim_2_5ef4c5084f.gif', 'width': '2520', 'height': '1418'}",,https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://research.ibm.com/'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'IBM', 'url': 'https://ibm.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://research.ibm.com/ibm-logo.svg', 'width': '576', 'height': '576'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can we get past the fear and find a silver lining?Claire has worked as a PR at a major consulting firm, based in London, for six years. The 34-year-old enjoys her job and earns a comfortable salary, but in the past six months, she’s started to feel apprehensive about the future of her career. The reason: artificial intelligence.“I don’t think the quality of the work that I’m producing could be matched by a machine just yet,” says Claire, whose last name is being withheld to protect her job security. “But at the same time, I’m amazed at how quickly ChatGPT has become so sophisticated. Give it a few more years, and I can absolutely imagine a world in which a bot does my job just as well as I can. I hate to think what that might mean for my employability.”In recent years, as headlines about robots stealing human jobs have proliferated – and as generative AI tools like ChatGPT have quickly become more accessible – some workers report starting to feel anxious about their futures and whether the skills they have will be relevant to the labour market in years to come. In March, Goldman Sachs published a report showing that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. Last year, PwC’s annual global workforce survey showed that almost a third of respondents said they were worried about the prospect of their role being replaced by technology in three years.“I think a lot of creatives are concerned,” says Alys Marshall, a 29-year-old copywriter based in Bristol, UK. “We’re all just hoping that our clients will recognise [our] value, and choose the authenticity of [a human] over the price and convenience of AI tools.”Now, career coaches and HR experts are saying that although some anxiety might be justified, employees need to focus on what they can control. Instead of panicking about possibly losing their jobs to machines, they should invest in learning how to work alongside technology. If they treat it as a resource and not a threat, add the experts, they’ll make themselves more valuable to potential employers – and feel less anxious. Getty ImagesAs headlines about robots stealing human jobs proliferate some workers report feeling anxious about their futures (Credit: Getty Images)Fear of the unknown For some people, generative AI tools feel as if they’ve come on fast and furious. OpenAI’s ChatGPT broke out seemingly overnight, and the “AI arms race” is ramping up more every day, creating continuing uncertainty for workers.Carolyn Montrose, a career coach and lecturer at Columbia University in New York, acknowledges the pace of technological innovation and change can be scary. “It is normal to feel anxiety about the impact of AI because its evolution is fluid, and there are many unknown application factors,” she says.But as unnerving as the new technology is, she also says workers don’t necessarily have to feel existential dread. People have the power to make their own decisions about how much they worry: they can either “choose to feel anxious about AI, or empowered to learn about it and use it to their advantage”.PwC’s Scott Likens, who specialises in understanding issues around trust and technology, echoes this. “Technology advancements have shown us that, yes, technology has the potential to automate or streamline work processes. However, with the right set of skills, individuals are often able to progress alongside these advancements,” he says. “In order to feel less anxious about the rapid adoption of AI, employees must lean into the technology. Education and training [are] key for employees to learn about AI and what it can do for their particular role as well as help them develop new skills. Instead of shying away from AI, employees should plan to embrace and educate.”It may also be helpful to remember that, according to Likens, “this isn’t the first time we have encountered industry disruptions – from automation and manufacturing to e-commerce and retail – we have found ways to adapt”. Indeed, the introduction of new technology has often been unnerving for some people, but Montrose explains that plenty good has come from past new developments: she says technological change has always been a key ingredient for society’s advancement.Regardless of how people respond to AI technology, adds Montrose, it’s here to stay. And it can be a lot more helpful to remain positive and look forward. “If people feel anxious instead of acting to improve their skills, that will hurt them more than the AI itself,” she says. This isn’t the first time we have encountered industry disruptions – from automation and manufacturing to e-commerce and retail – we have found ways to adapt – Scott LikensUnique value of humansAlthough experts say some level of anxiety is justified, it may not be time to hit the panic button yet. Some research has recently shown fears of robots taking over human jobs might be overblown. November 2022 research by sociology professor Eric Dahlin at Brigham Young University in Utah, US, showed that not only are robots not replacing human workers at the rate most people believe, but some people also misperceive the rate at which automation tools are taking over. His data showed about 14% of workers said they had seen their job replaced by a robot. But both workers who had experienced job displacement due to technology as well as those who hadn’t tended to overstate the pace and volume of the trend – their estimates were far off reality.“Overall, our perceptions of robots taking over is greatly exaggerated. Those who hadn’t lost jobs overestimated by about double, and those who had lost jobs overestimated by about three times,” said Dahlin in presenting his research. While Dahlin said that some new technologies would likely be adopted and implemented without considering all implications, it’s also true that “just because a technology can be used for something does not mean that it will be implemented”.Stefanie Coleman, a principal in consultancy EY's people advisory services business, also points out that we shouldn’t expect the workforce of the future to be “binary”. In other words, a combination of both humans and robots will always need to exist.""Humans will always have a role to play in business by performing the important work that robots cannot. This kind of work typically requires innate human qualities, such as relationship building, creativity and emotional intelligence,” she says. ""Recognising the unique value of humans in the workforce, when compared to machines, is an important step in navigating the fears that surround this topic.""A few weeks ago, Claire, the PR worker, decided she wanted to start learning more about the technology that’s transforming her industry. She’s now researching online courses through which she hopes to learn to code. “A lot of tech used to scare me, so I just ignored it, but based on everything I’m seeing, that’s sort of stupid,” she says. “Ignoring something definitely won’t make it go away, and I’m slowly starting to understand that if I take the time to make it less unfamiliar – which makes it less scary – it might actually be able to help me a lot.”How we workFeatures",NewsArticle,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Josie Cox', 'url': ''}",2023-07-13T13:49:12.062Z,2023-04-18T17:27:15.000Z,The anxiety of being replaced by AI,['https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0fh6sjs.jpg'],,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new report discusses the evolving attitudes towards the use of generative AI and ChatGPT within law firms, surveying lawyers about the opportunities and potential risks

It didn’t take long after OpenAI released its ChatGPT prototype for public use — shedding light on the myriad abilities that its underlying technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI), possessed — that many lawyers and legal industry experts became keenly aware of what these tools could mean for the profession and for law firms in particular.
Not surprisingly, strong opinions arose, not only about the potential sea-change in the delivery, pricing, and execution of legal services that the wider use of generative AI could bring, but also about the unknown risks that such usage could pose.
In fact, a recent survey of law firm lawyers illustrated this dichotomy well — a large majority (82%) of those surveyed said they believe that ChatGPT and generative AI can be readily applied to legal work; and a slightly smaller majority (51%) said that ChatGPT and generative AI should be applied to legal work.

The survey, conducted in late-March by the Thomson Reuters Institute, gathered insight from more than 440 respondent lawyers at large and midsize law firms in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The survey forms the basis of a new report, ChatGPT & Generative AI within Law Firms, which takes a deep look at the evolving attitudes towards generative AI and ChatGPT within law firms, measuring awareness and adoption of the technology as well as lawyers’ views on its potential risks.
The report also reveals several key findings that deserve special attention from law firm leaders and other legal professionals as ChatGPT and generative AI evolve from concept to reality for the vast majority of the legal industry participants. These findings include:





Attitudes are evolving around this technology — While almost everybody we surveyed had heard of ChatGPT and generative AI, actual use among law firms thus far was quite limited, with just 3% of respondents saying they are actually using generative AI right now. Of course, a much larger portion (34%) said their firm was still considering whether or not to use generative AI for legal operations.
Firms are taking a cautiously proactive approach — About 15% of respondents said their firms have warned employees against unauthorized generative AI use at work, and 6% said their firms have banned unauthorized usage outright, indicating that many lawyers clearly understand the importance of applying guardrails to generative AI use. In fact, all those interviewed noted that they do not fully trust generative AI tools — and particularly the public-facing ChatGPT tool — with confidential client data. Yet, even as this mistrust exists, our research shows that attitudes are changing, and potential use cases are being explored by many law firms.
There’s a growing awareness of the risks — A large portion of respondents had concerns with use of ChatGPT and generative AI at work — 62%, which included 80% of partners or managing partners. Further, many of the concerns voiced in our survey seemed to revolve around the technology’s accuracy and security, most specifically about how law firms’ concerns of privacy and client confidentiality will be addressed. Still, many legal industry observers (and many of our respondents) know that by any measure, we are still early in the game for generative AI and ChatGPTs. It is expected that time and experimentation will make users more comfortable with these tools, and a day will come when generative AI and ChatGPT is in as common use within law firms as online legal research and electronic contract signing are now.





Yet, whichever side of the debate over this fledgling technology a lawyer might find themselves, one idea the report makes clear — whatever the level of use of ChatGPT and generative AI eventually reaches among law firms and throughout legal, this technology has the potential to change the industry. And even in its infancy, the growing acceptance of ChatGPT and generative AI is being seen as a watershed moment.
“Within the next six months everybody at the firm will be using it,” said Charlotte Woolven-Brown, Head of Employment and a Partner at law firm Sternberg Reed in the United Kingdom. “And there’s absolutely no way you’re going to stop that, because people will get more in tune with what’s happening and how quickly this technology is developing.”

The light and dark sides of AI have been in the public spotlight for many years. Think facial recognition, algorithms making loan and sentencing recommendations, and medical image analysis. But the impressive – and sometimes scary – capabilities of ChatGPT, DALL-E 2 and other conversational and image-conjuring artificial intelligence programs feel like a turning point.
The key change has been the emergence within the last year of powerful generative AI, software that not only learns from vast amounts of data but also produces things – convincingly written documents, engaging conversation, photorealistic images and clones of celebrity voices.
Generative AI has been around for nearly a decade, as long-standing worries about deepfake videos can attest. Now, though, the AI models have become so large and have digested such vast swaths of the internet that people have become unsure of what AI means for the future of knowledge work, the nature of creativity and the origins and truthfulness of content on the internet.
Here are five articles from our archives that take the measure of this new generation of artificial intelligence.
1. Generative AI and work
A panel of five AI experts discussed the implications of generative AI for artists and knowledge workers. It’s not simply a matter of whether the technology will replace you or make you more productive.
University of Tennessee computer scientist Lynne Parker wrote that while there are significant benefits to generative AI, like making creativity and knowledge work more accessible, the new tools also have downsides. Specifically, they could lead to an erosion of skills like writing, and they raise issues of intellectual property protections given that the models are trained on human creations.
University of Colorado Boulder computer scientist Daniel Acuña has found the tools to be useful in his own creative endeavors but is concerned about inaccuracy, bias and plagiarism.
University of Michigan computer scientist Kentaro Toyama wrote that human skill is likely to become costly and extraneous in some fields. “If history is any guide, it’s almost certain that advances in AI will cause more jobs to vanish, that creative-class people with human-only skills will become richer but fewer in number, and that those who own creative technology will become the new mega-rich.”
Florida International University computer scientist Mark Finlayson wrote that some jobs are likely to disappear, but that new skills in working with these AI tools are likely to become valued. By analogy, he noted that the rise of word processing software largely eliminated the need for typists but allowed nearly anyone with access to a computer to produce typeset documents and led to a new class of skills to list on a resume.
University of Colorado Anschutz biomedical informatics researcher Casey Greene wrote that just as Google led people to develop skills in finding information on the internet, AI language models will lead people to develop skills to get the best output from the tools. “As with many technological advances, how people interact with the world will change in the era of widely accessible AI models. The question is whether society will use this moment to advance equity or exacerbate disparities.”

2. Conjuring images from words
Generative AI can seem like magic. It’s hard to imagine how image-generating AIs can take a few words of text and produce an image that matches the words.



A few keywords – pink hair, Asian boy, cyberpunk, stadium jacket, Manga – yield striking and believable images of a person who never existed.

Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley computer scientist who specializes in image forensics, explained the process. The software is trained on a massive set of images, each of which includes a short text description.
“The model progressively corrupts each image until only visual noise remains, and then trains a neural network to reverse this corruption. Repeating this process hundreds of millions of times, the model learns how to convert pure noise into a coherent image from any caption,” he wrote.

3. Marking the machine
Many of the images produced by generative AI are difficult to distinguish from photographs, and AI-generated video is rapidly improving. This raises the stakes for combating fraud and misinformation. Fake videos of corporate executives could be used to manipulate stock prices, and fake videos of political leaders could be used to spread dangerous misinformation.
Farid explained how it’s possible to produce AI-generated photos and video that contain watermarks verifying that they are synthetic. The trick is to produce digital watermarks that can’t be altered or removed. “These watermarks can be baked into the generative AI systems by watermarking all the training data, after which the generated content will contain the same watermark,” he wrote.

4. Flood of ideas
For all the legitimate concern about the downsides of generative AI, the tools are proving to be useful for some artists, designers and writers. People in creative fields can use the image generators to quickly sketch out ideas, including unexpected off-the-wall material.


AI as an idea generator for designers.

Rochester Institute of Technology industrial designer and professor Juan Noguera and his students use tools like DALL-E or Midjourney to produce thousands of images from abstract ideas – a sort of sketchbook on steroids.
“Enter any sentence – no matter how crazy – and you’ll receive a set of unique images generated just for you. Want to design a teapot? Here, have 1,000 of them,” he wrote. “While only a small subset of them may be usable as a teapot, they provide a seed of inspiration that the designer can nurture and refine into a finished product.”

5. Shortchanging the creative process
However, using AI to produce finished artworks is another matter, according to Nir Eisikovits and Alec Stubbs, philosophers at the Applied Ethics Center at University of Massachusetts Boston. They note that the process of making art is more than just coming up with ideas.
The hands-on process of producing something, iterating the process and making refinements – often in the moment in response to audience reactions – are indispensable aspects of creating art, they wrote.
“It is the work of making something real and working through its details that carries value, not simply that moment of imagining it,” they wrote. “Artistic works are lauded not merely for the finished product, but for the struggle, the playful interaction and the skillful engagement with the artistic task, all of which carry the artist from the moment of inception to the end result.”

	The rapidly advancing creative capabilities of generative AI have led to questions about artificial intelligence becoming increasingly capable of replacing creative workers across film and TV production, game development and music creation.

	Talent might increasingly view and use generative AI in more straightforward ways as simply a new creative tool in their belt, just as other disruptive technologies through time have entered and changed how people make and distribute their creative work.

	In effect, there will still — and always — be a need for people to be the primary agents in the creative development process.

	“Talent will incorporate AI tools into their existing processes or to make certain aspects of their process more efficient and scalable,” said Brent Weinstein, chief development officer at Candle Media, who has worked extensively with content companies and creators in developing next-gen digital-media strategies and pioneering new businesses and models that sit at the intersection of content and technology.    

	The disruptive impact of generative AI will certainly be felt in numerous creative roles, but fears about total machine takeover of creative professions are most likely overblown. Experts believe generative AI won’t be a direct substitute for artists, but it can be a tool that augments their capabilities.

	“For the type of premium content that has always defined the entertainment industry, the starting point will continue to be extraordinarily and uniquely talented artists,” Weinstein continued. “Actors, writers, directors, producers, musicians, visual effects supervisors, editors, game creators and more, along with a new generation of artists that — similar to the creators who figured out YouTube early on — learns to master these innovative new tools.”

	Joanna Popper, chief metaverse officer at CAA, brings expertise on all emerging technologies relevant for creative talent and the potential to impact content creation, distribution and community engagement. 

	“Ideally, creatives use AI tools to collaborate and enhance our abilities, similar to creatives using technical tools since the beginning of filmmaking,” Popper said. “We’ve seen technology used throughout history to help filmmakers and content creators either produce stories in innovative ways, enable stories to reach new audiences and/or enable audiences to interact with those stories in different ways.”

	









	A Goldman Sachs study released last month of how AI would impact economic growth estimated that 26% of work tasks would be automated within the “arts, design, sports, entertainment and media” industries, roughly in line with the average across all industries.  

	In February, Netflix received backlash after releasing a short anime film that partly used AI-driven animation. Voice actors in Latin America who were replaced by automated software have also spoken out. 

	Julian Togelius, associate professor of computer science and engineering and director of the Game Innovation Lab at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, has done extensive research in artificial intelligence and games. “Generative AI is more like a new toolset that people need to master within existing professions in the game industry,” he said. “In the end, someone still needs to use the tool. People will always supervise and initiate the process, so there’s no true replacemen. Game developers now just have more powerful tools.”

Adults have to do a lot of unpleasant jobs; it’s part of the gig. Taking out the trash, cleaning the toilet and making the daily school run are unavoidable when it comes to keeping life running smoothly.But there’s one particular job that fills me with dread: calling a “helpline."" Every time I pick up the phone to discuss tax codes, remortgage rates, insurance quotes, doctor’s appointments or some other exciting aspect of modern life, my knees go slack and my head starts to pound. Cue generic hold music and a constant robotic reminder of my place in the virtual queue.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksSmart Lifestyle TrendsCheapest Way To Get A Walk In Tub If You're On MedicareSmart Lifestyle TrendsUndoOnce you do get through to a person, things rarely improve. The poor soul on the other end of the line guides me through mundane security questions before reading from a pre-prepared script. Often, they fail to offer up a single noteworthy piece of advice when questioned directly.LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomsguide

During one of these recent calls, it occurred to me everyone involved would benefit from letting artificial intelligence handle the task. I don’t mean the basic interactive voice response (IVR) program that routes your call based on how you answer recorded questions; I mean a full conversational AI agent capable of discussing and actioning my requests with no human input. I’d get through the process faster (because the organization wouldn’t need to wait for available humans to assign) and it wouldn’t require a living, breathing person to spend their days on the phone to an aggravated person like me. Similarly, an AI doesn’t need to clock off at the end of a shift, so the call could be handled any time of the day or night.Let me hear a voice(Image credit: FrameStockFootages/Shutterstock)Plenty of companies have implemented browser or app-based chat clients but, the fact is, a huge amount of people still prefer to pick up the phone and do things by voice. And I think most industry leaders recognize this. Humana, a healthcare insurance provider with over 13 million customers, partnered with IBM’s Data and AI Expert Labs in 2019 to implement natural language understanding (NLU) software into its call centers to respond to spoken sentences. The machines either rerouted the call to the relevant person or, where necessary, simply provided the information. This came after Humana recognized that 60% of the million-or-so calls they were getting each month were just queries for information.According to a blog post from IBM, “The Voice Assistant uses significant speech customization with seven language models and two acoustic models, each targeted to a specific type of user input collected by Humana. “Through speech customization training, the solution achieves an average of 90-95% sentence error rate accuracy level on the significant data inputs. The implementation handles several sub-intents within the major groupings of eligibility, benefits, claims, authorization and referrals, enabling Humana to quickly answer questions that were never answerable before.”The cost of AI(Image credit: Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The obvious stumbling block for most companies will be the cost. After all, OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT charges for API access while Meta’s LLaMA is partially open-source but doesn’t permit commercial use.However, given time, the cost for implementing machine learning solutions will come down. For example, Databricks, a U.S.-based enterprise company recently launched Dolly 2.0, a 12-billion parameter model that’s completely open source. It will allow companies and organizations to create large language models (LLMs) without having to pay costly API fees to the likes of Microsoft, Google or Meta. With more of these advancements being made, the AI adoption rate for small and medium-sized businesses will (and should) increase.According to recent research by industry analysts Gartner, around 10% of so-called agent interactions will be performed by conversational AI by 2026. At present, the number stands at around 1.6%.""Many organizations are challenged by agent staff shortages and the need to curtail labor expenses, which can represent up to 95 percent of contact center costs,” explained Daniel O'Connell, a VP analyst at Gartner. “Conversational AI makes agents more efficient and effective, while also improving the customer experience.""You could even make the experience a bit more fun. Imagine if a company got the license to utilize James Earl Jones’ voice for its call center AI. I could spend a half-hour discussing insurance renewal rates with Darth Vader himself.I could spend a half-hour discussing insurance renewal rates with Darth Vader himself.I’m not saying there won’t be teething problems; AI can struggle with things like regional dialects or slang terms and there are more deep-rooted issues like unconscious bias. And if a company simply opts for a one-size-fits-all AI approach, rather than tailoring it to specific customer requirements, we won’t be any better off.Zooming out for a second, I appreciate that we’re yet to fully consider all the ethical questions posed by the rapid advancements in AI. Regulation will surely become a factor (if it can keep pace) and upskilling a workforce to become comfortable with the new system will be something for industry leaders and educational institutions to grapple with.But I still think a good place to start is letting the robots take care of mundane helpline tasks — it’s for the good of humanity.More from Tom's Guide7 Bard announcements Google should make at I/O to beat ChatGPTChatGPT could rival human intelligence with next-level upgradeElon Musk and other leaders call on ChatGPT and Bard to halt AI trainingToday's best Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) deals $94.95View Deal $99.59View Deal $99.99View DealShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices

How does AI actually work?



April 17, 2023




Kristina Bravo








Artificial intelligence has entered a new era. From search to education to art, recent advancements in AI promise to shake up the way we work and live.
Yet for some of us, AI poses more questions than answers. How will it affect us? Are there risks? How do we make it trustworthy?
Before we can answer these complex questions, it helps to get the basics down on AI. Read on for a crash course on artificial intelligence.
First, what exactly is AI?
AI is essentially software that can learn patterns from information. Think language, images, audio, online behavior and more. Using patterns from existing and new data, AI makes predictions to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence – like finding products we’re likely to buy or finishing a sentence in an email.
How does it work?
Take a customer service chatbot, for example. After you type a question, the chatbot uses an algorithm – or a set of rules  – to recognize keywords and identify what kind of help you need. The machine learning model, based on the existing and new information it has, then generates an appropriate response. The chatbot improves over time as it interacts with new customers and receives more data. 
“Think about the algorithm as the program that works with the dataset, and the model is the output that makes the prediction,” explained Mozilla researcher Becca Ricks.
Why are chatbots like ChatGPT sounding more… human?
The latest chatbots use a type of machine learning model called a neural network. Inspired by the structure of the human brain, it’s designed to learn increasingly complex patterns to come up with predictions and recommendations. With chatbots, the model learns language from a large amount of existing and new data, making it really good at sounding how a person might talk. 
Can AI get things wrong?
Absolutely. AI models learn from data, which can be incomplete. ChatGPT, for instance, is a language model trained on data on the internet. That’s why it may have trouble solving simple math problems. 
AI can also produce biased outputs. For example, image recognition trained on a set of images featuring mostly light-skinned people may not be able to recognize individuals with darker skin tones. Algorithms and data come from humans, so AI technologies typically follow biases that exist – like ones based on race, gender and age. 
“They might affect whether or not our friends are seeing what we post,” Becca said. “Or, they might affect whether or not we’re getting resources from our local government.” 
How do we make sure we can trust AI?
The first step is learning about it. From there, we can demand transparency and accountability.
“The more that we all know the way AI systems work, the easier it makes for us to imagine what better looks like,” Becca said. “And it makes it easier for us to design alternatives that benefit society and reflect the values of our communities.”

AI exists in almost everything we use on the internet, like search engines and our social media feeds. But if you want to reduce the amount of personal information you have out on the web, don’t give away your true email and phone number when signing up for the latest AI apps.Like any other application, an AI app can expose your information to online trackers, spammers and hackers.

Claims About Generative AI Replacing Jobs Are Hyperbolic and Misleading

Lately, the news cycle has included a series of ever-shifting claims about what impact generative AI systems will have on jobs. The purported impact varies wildly from outlet to outlet but the central message from the news media is clear: AI is here to take almost all the jobs, not just the blue-collar ones, the white-collar ones too. The problem is, many of the claims are hokum. Let’s unpack one of the worst recent examples: Vice Media’s article “OpenAI Research Says 80% of U.S. Workers’ Jobs Will Be Impacted by GPT.”
Vice leads with a sound bite statistic. Its headline is eye-catching, emotionally resonating, and easily repeatable, but it is narrowly true and broadly misleading. The statistic comes from a research paper by OpenAI, but the paper doesn’t simply say 80 percent of jobs will be impacted, it says “around 80 percent of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected.” That means the real statistic is that large language models (LLMs) might impact at least 8 percent of work in the U.S. economy. A significantly less dramatic picture of the research findings but a more honest one.
If the statistics in Vice’s headline are a bullhorn for impending job disruption though, the words it uses are a dog whistle. Rather than saying jobs “could be impacted,” it says jobs “will be impacted,” subtly suggesting the impact on jobs is urgent and certain, which the OpenAI researchers themselves say is by no means the case. The ability for firms in different segments of the economy to adopt LLM models hinges on a myriad of factors, such as the availability of data for training the models, the regulatory environment, and innovation culture within businesses, to name just a few. 
More importantly, just because a job is exposed to LLM automation “doesn’t determine whether the technology is likely to replace workers or merely augment their skills” as the New York Times more accurately reports. Tools like ChatGPT might be able to draft a legal document in half the time a human legal secretary can, but that doesn’t necessarily mean law firms can or should substitute their staff in favor of LLMs because these tools are still at a stage where they can misrepresent key facts and cite evidence that doesn’t exist. They still need humans to verify and check their outputs. 
Unfortunately, Vice is not the only outlet exhibiting this vice (pun intended). Forbes recently published a hyperbolic article titled “Goldman Sachs Predicts 300 Million Jobs Will Be Lost Or Degraded By Artificial Intelligence,” based on a recent report from the investment firm. The report takes U.S. and EU data on job tasks, identifies the ones generative AI systems can do, and calculates exposure. The 300 million jobs number it comes up with is arguably presumptuous because it’s an extrapolated figure for the number of jobs around the entire world that might one day be exposed to generative AI automation (when that day is supposed to be isn’t entirely clear from the report). Still, Forbes has no qualms in spinning this potential “exposure” metric into a spurious narrative about seemingly certain job displacement. Several other outlets fall into the same trap.
Granted, conveying facts without any editorial color isn’t very well-suited to the modern world. The media has an important role to play in keeping the public informed in a way that is engaging and accessible, but there is a line between using data to tell a story and statistical spin-doctoring. Consider that Goldman Sachs’ own blog summarizing its research is titled “Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%” because one of its central messages is that generative AI may displace some jobs but can also create new jobs, which history has shown are typically higher-paying jobs in the same industry. The Financial Times portrays this message more faithfully, noting “Goldman’s base case is for 7 percent of workers to lose their jobs entirely in the decade after generative AI reaches half of employers, but most will find something nearly as productive to do.” In fact, since many of the jobs that might be substituted involve mundane, repetitive tasks, there is no reason why many would not find jobs they find more creative and more rewarding.
It is easier for reporters to write these attention-grabbing headlines than to dig into real substance. But they should look at the facts. Concerns about AI taking jobs are based on the “lump of labor fallacy,” the idea that there is a fixed amount of work, and thus productivity growth, such as from automation, will reduce the number of jobs. But the data tells a different story, labor productivity has grown steadily for the past century (even if that growth has been slower recently) and unemployment is near an all-time low. 
It is becoming more difficult to wade through the hogwash of claims about AI but if readers, and more importantly policymakers, aren’t prudent, they will make decisions based on unfounded fears or hype. Worse, such balderdash can distract from the real issues related to AI systems: how to spur their safe development and responsible use.

Most Americans agree that AI will have a major impact on workers in the next 20 years, and they’re more likely to say it will hurt more than help, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. But at the same time, most Americans think AI will have little or no impact on them personally.In other words, AI will harm thee, but not me.That’s a similar sentiment to what Vox heard talking to workers who’ve deployed generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard at work. Knowledge workers said the software helps them save time and avoid drudge work, allowing them to write code more quickly or spin up business memos or marketing copy with just a few prompts. But, to a person, these workers felt that even though others’ jobs might be at risk of being obviated by AI, theirs was likely safe thanks in part to their mastery over those tools.The rise of artificial intelligence, explainedHow does AI actually work? How is AI changing our society?Is AI coming for your job?Should we be worried about AI?Who will regulate AI?The refrain was frequently a version of this tweet: “AI will not replace you. A person using AI will.” While people are certainly embracing some forms of AI, they find some types, like those that would hire, fire, or monitor them, distasteful. That could be an issue depending on how exactly AI becomes integrated into the workplace.The truth is that while AI tools show a remarkable ability to replicate what was often high-paid human work, we don’t yet know if that will translate into less work for humans or simply different — and perhaps even better — work. A recent study by OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT and its more advanced successor GPT-4, found that high-paid jobs that require degrees had the most exposure to the capabilities of these tools. The study didn’t say whether those jobs would be erased or augmented by the technology. “This could be a trust-building opportunity rather than a trust-destroying opportunity”Other forms of AI have been incorporated into various workplace applications in both manual and computer-assisted work for the last decade, according to Julia Dhar, managing director, partner, and global lead of the Behavioral Science Lab at Boston Consulting Group. In manufacturing, that’s meant AI decides when to start producing one good instead of another based on sales and other demand forecasts. In services, it’s shown up in call centers, prompting workers to offer different responses based on how the interaction progresses or even the tone of a person’s voice.But so far, thanks to the costs and technical capabilities needed to scale AI in the workplace, AI penetration in the workplace is still low. Dhar sees that as an opportunity to make sure that the way AI is used at work is beneficial both to companies and to workers. “I think that we have focused not enough of the public conversation around trust,” Dhar said. “We’ve talked about trustworthy AI, but we have talked hardly at all about trust between employers and employees, and how this could be a trust-building opportunity rather than a trust-destroying opportunity.”Related:Maybe AI can finally kill the cover letterThe Pew study, which surveyed more than 11,000 Americans, suggests that trust is lacking. While people like certain types of AI at work, lots of it has them on edge, specifically when it’s used in hiring, firing, and monitoring. Seventy-one percent opposed the idea of AI making final hiring decisions (just 7 percent were for it) and 55 percent were against its use in making firing decisions, according to the Pew report. A plurality didn’t want it to be used to review applications at all or to decide who gets promotions. Many felt AI lacked the human touch that would allow it to see things like the potential in a candidate who didn’t exactly match a job description or how well a person might get along with their coworkers. The use of AI is already commonplace in so-called applicant tracking software, which most major companies use in their hiring process. This widespread technology allows companies to use keywords or criteria — like whether or not they have a college degree or a gap in their resume — to automatically winnow down the mass of incoming online applications. But many, including employers themselves, fear that those broad strokes could end up excluding people who would be perfectly good candidates.“[AI in job interviews is] prevalent enough that our students are being trained by career services on how to handle those interviews”Jason Schloetzer, associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, found that more than half of human resource managers are either using AI-based tech in hiring or intend to do so very soon. He says that AI is creeping into more advanced levels of the hiring process, like the first round of interviews, where he says candidates respond to employer questions into a webcam, and employers use AI to analyze their response and even body language to decide whether or not they make it to the next round.“It’s prevalent enough that our students are being trained by career services on how to handle those interviews,” Schloetzer added. In a way, these practices have encouraged workers and candidates to use AI themselves. Many are turning to tools like ChatGPT to write their resumes or cover letters — in part to offload a tedious task, but also as a way to fight back in the hiring process, bot to bot.Unsurprisingly, most people surveyed by Pew also oppose using AI in creepier ways, like monitoring their movements and facial expressions while they work or tracking when they’re at their desks and what exactly they’re doing. This sort of technology has become increasingly common in the workplace, from Amazon warehouses to the office, since the start of the pandemic as bosses, leery of remote work and quiet quitting, try to ensure productivity. But as the Wall Street Journal reported, there’s little proof the technology works, and some evidence suggests it can even be counterproductive, causing people to be demoralized and less productive. Such so-called productivity trackers have also led to a rise in people trying to outwit them, with hacks like mouse jigglers — devices that can physically move a mouse on a desk with no human present — that make it look like they’re working.Related:The promise and peril of AI, according to 5 expertsVox spoke with a professional services worker at a midsize marketing company that uses activity monitoring software to track remote workers’ keystrokes and mouse movements and takes occasional photographs to check that she’s at her computer. The employee, who asked that we not use her name so as not to get her in trouble at work, said that while she finds the software annoying, she’s developed ways to get around it. She browses social media on her personal phone and makes sure not to slack off for more than 10 minutes at a time so the software doesn’t flag her to her bosses. Overall, she’s ambivalent and doesn’t think it affects her productivity one way or another. She does believe there’s a bright side in that she doesn’t do any work that’s not at her computer, so when she’s off she’s really off. “I hate that I don’t hate it,” she said, but added that she’d probably opt next time for a job that didn’t track her. As for the facial monitoring, she said, “If they want to see how busted I show up for my remote job, then good for them.”BCG’s Dhar, however, warns against such monitoring AI, saying it causes companies to “mistake activity for productivity.”“It really sends a message to people that doing anything that is observable is better than doing the very often unobservable hard work of human cognition or relationship building or spotting safety hazards,” she said.For now, it’s impossible to predict how exactly AI adoption will impact the workplace. Georgetown’s Schloetzer said it will likely mean some jobs are lost, some are added, but for the most part, a lot of existing jobs will be reconfigured. What’s certain is that prominent use of AI in the workplace will eventually happen.“I don’t even think it’s worth debating this stuff,” Schloetzer said “I think we just need to be prepared for it to be rolled out.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

They argue the systems  are unscientific and include biases.The TUC says AI is being used to analyse facial expressions, tone of voice and accents to assess candidates' suitability for roles.Left unchecked, it argues, AI could lead to greater discrimination at work. For example tools that analyse facial expressions, may disadvantage candidates or employees with certain disabilities.UK rules out new AI regulatorAI tools fail to reduce recruitment bias - studyHowever, some of the firms promoting AI tools argue that conversely computer systems will make more impartial decisions than humans alone.Mary Towers, an employment rights policy officer at the TUC, told the BBC its research had found AI tools used in a variety of industries ""at the recruitment stage in things like CV sifting, but then beyond that in team allocation, allocation of work, disciplinary measures, right through to termination of employment"". ""We found evidence of AI powered tools being used in all the different ways in which you would expect a human manager to carry out functions at work,"" she said.  'Unrealistic targets'AI tools can also be used to track worker performance, sometimes making automated decisions to effectively fire employees.The TUC warns AI could ""set unrealistic targets that then result in workers being put in dangerous situations that impact negatively on their both physical health and mental well being"".Some employers require workers to carry devices which record data about their activity which can then be analysed. One warehouse worker told AI policy campaigners Connected by Data that it meant that if they took too many toilet breaks it would be flagged and they would have to explain why they weren't working.Last month the government published its white paper on AI which proposed spreading regulation of the technology across different existing bodies rather than creating a single new watchdog.According to the TUC, the paper offered only ""vague"" and ""flimsy"" guidance to regulators on how to ensure AI is used ethically at work, ""and no additional capacity or resource to cope with rising demand"".It also suggested the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, which had its second reading Monday, will water down many protections in current data protection legislation - including the right to human review of automated decisions.'Human review'The TUC wants firms to reveal how AI is being used to make decisions about staff. All decisions should be subject to a human review so that workers may challenge them, it says.The government believes its reforms do not alter workers' rights to seek human review of significant, solely automated decisions. The bill will maintain protections that UK workers currently have while giving organisations greater flexibility, it says.But other organisations have made similar criticisms of the bill. Connected by Data told the BBC: ""The bill reduces the ability of workers to access data that is held about them, or to challenge how it is used, meaning they may never be able to know why their ability to earn a living has been threatened.""To show why such rules are important it points to a recent court case which ordered two ride-hailing firms to turn over information related to automated decisions to dismiss workers in the UK and Portugal.Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader and shadow secretary of state for the future of work, also supported the TUC's call, telling the BBC that AI was ""already transforming the economy"".Workers must ""have a proper say in how technologies are implemented"", she said.

But the meteoric rise of ChatGPT has led many to ask themselves the same question that those working in manufacturing have asked themselves for many years now: will my job be replaced with AI?With businesses discovering new ways to use ChatGPT every day, you can understand why workers in all sorts of roles are looking over their shoulders. With AI tools worming their way into the day-to-day routines of employees and solving all sorts of problems, it’s unsurprising that over two-thirds of employees are hiding the fact they use it from their bosses.We’ve spoken to AI experts, entrepreneurs developing AI tools, and businesspeople using them to find out exactly which jobs they think will be automated first, how AI might make things easier, and how you can make yourself AI-proof for the job market.

Is AI Replacing Jobs?It’s unlikely that AI will suddenly replace huge swathes of the human workforce by the end of this week, but the idea this sort of change may happen in the near future has never seemed more realistic than it does at present.A report published by the World Economic Forum in 2020, for example, predicted 85 million jobs will be replaced by AI by the year 2025. Mckinsey’s more conservative 2021 estimate, on the other hand, is 45 million by 2030.Our own Tech.co research has also found that 47% of business leaders would consider using AI instead of hiring for roles at their company.But arguably, these estimations now seem too small. In the wake of ChatGPT’s explosive popularity, Goldman Sachs revealed its predictions that around 300 million jobs could soon be replaced by artificial intelligence or automated in some way or another.At the moment, AI is competently completing tasks within job remits, rather than subsuming whole job roles. But it’s not difficult to imagine how this may progress to entire positions being taken over by artifical intelligence.Indeed, rather than entire roles disappearing into thin air and being replaced with a chatbot like ChatGPT, What we’re more likely to see in the next year or so is AI being used as a tool to aid some duties performed by an increasingly large class of workers.OpenAI predicted in a recent paper that artificial intelligence will soon be able to help with around 10% of tasks for eight out of 10 workers, while 19% of workers will be able to use AI to complete 50% of their tasks. This sort of spread suggests AI replacing jobs will be a slow, gradual process rather than a sudden change.The Top 10 Jobs Most Likely to Be Replaced by AIWe’ve put together a list of jobs most vulnerable to AI. 10 jobs that could be replaced by AI are:Entry-level Admin RolesData Entry Clerks Software Engineers and CodersCustomer Service RepsParalegalsCopywriters and Content RolesGraphic DesignersBankers and AccountantsTradersFact-Checkers and Proofreaders1. Entry-Level admin rolesAdministrative roles are perhaps most at risk of being replaced by AI tools currently available, such as ChatGPT. Admin roles consist of tasks like note-taking, proofreading, writing summaries, and managing spreadsheets, jobs that can already be performed competently by ChatGPT.In the same research note that revealed Goldman Sachs’ prediction that 300 million jobs could be replaced by AI back, “office and administrative support” is cited as the job with the highest percentage (46%) of “current work tasks” that could feasibly be automated and carried out by AI.In Microsoft Teams Premium, the CoPilot feature will summarize your video conferencing meetings into note form and then generate a list of action points by analyzing the content of the transcript. Twenty years ago, taking meeting notes would have been a core duty of a number of administrative and secretarial roles. Now, this task can be completely automated.2. Data entry clerks Data entry roles involve lots of tasks that follow pre-defined sets of rules. This means it’s a comparatively easy role to automate, due to the repetitiveness and logic-following nature.“Jobs that require decision-making based on data analysis, such as financial analysis and medical diagnosis” are most at risk according to Angelo Sorbello, CEO of AI writing and SEO tool Linkdelta. “In general, any job that involves performing a set of predefined steps or following a strict set of rules is vulnerable to automation,” he explained.“Manually entering data into a computer system is time-consuming” Ryan Faber, the founder of the AI content writing platform Copymatic, agrees.“While it’s an important part of many businesses,” he continued, “it’s also a task that’s ripe for automation. With the development of AI-powered tools such as OCR and NLP, it’s now possible to automate many aspects of data entry.”3. Software Engineers and CodersThe news that OpenAI is already trying to make basic coding obsolete with ChatGPT will have certainly spooked those in the software industry. AI can automate much of the repetitive testing that software engineers currently perform during development, as well as many responsibilities usually assigned to junior software engineers.AI could also help with hunting down bugs and patching vulnerabilities. Although it doesn’t seem to have the skill set to replace engineers building highly complicated software that requires human creativity, this isn’t necessarily necessary for every code-based task.OpenAI is already working on a program called Codex that can be applied to virtually any coding task, while Amazon and Samsung employees have also reportedly been using ChatGPT for coding purposes.4. Customer Service RepresentativesCompanies are now using AI to deal with customer service requests; a lot of small businesses can’t afford to employ humans in these roles, so it’s becoming commonplace. They join larger platforms like Amazon in turning to AI to deal with customer service queries, something which the ecommerce giant has been doing for nearly three years now.Jonathan Tian, CEO of CreditYelp, says that AI “has taken over the customer support response” at his company. “Most frequently queried responses are fed to the algorithm to assist our online clients with immediate replies” he added.5. Legal assistantsWhen Legal Cheek recently asked ChatGPT what jobs technology powered by GPT-4 could potentially replace, the paralegal profession was third on its list. The “human trait replaced”, as ChatGPT puts it, is “research and organization.”AI legal assistants are already commercially available – some even offer free trials. One of these programs – Casetexts – will review documents and legal research memos, and help lawyers prepare depositions. It can analyze contacts and revise them if they conflict with compliance laws, as well as identify potential risks your business might face.As you can probably imagine, this covers a lot of duties carried out at present by human paralegals.6. Copywriting and content productionAnyone who’s used ChatGPT knows it can produce competent paragraphs of useful, relevant content in seconds – just like a writer or editor can, but quicker. ChatGPT alternatives like Jasper and Writesonic are already well-established in this place and charge hefty subscription fees for access to their premium services.Although major websites have started to dabble in using artificial intelligence to create content and write articles, producing content en masse with AI hasn’t exactly gone smoothly for the companies testing the water. For instance, tech website CNET used AI to write 77 articles but was then forced to issue corrections on 41 of them while other news outlets identified examples of “extensive plagiarism.”Buzzfeed has recently begun publishing AI-generated content too, although it’s been accused of being quite repetitive. Although we’re a long way off from replacing writers, it’s an area being considered closely by a lot of publications – so watch this space.7. Graphic designers Already, AI tools like DALL-E can generate images at the drop of a hat that would give experienced graphic designers a run for their money. GPT-4, which is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus customers, now allows image inputs, and other competing AI chatbots can also generate impressive image content, such as Character.ai.DALL-E and similar tools aren’t going to kill the graphic design industry in their current iteration; rather, some artists are already using it to their advantage. But it’s more about what DALL-E – and similar tools – could become in a short amount of time. If we can easily access technology that can produce unique, original, high-quality images now, what will it be able to do in a year’s time?8. TradersWould a computer program be better at trading than a human? Well, considering the duties you have to perform in your early years on the job, the answer is probably “yes”.“I definitely think [it will impact] the trading side, but even [at] an investment bank, people [are] hired out of college and spend two, three years to work like robots and do Excel modeling — you can get AI to do that,” Pengcheng Shi, Professor of Computing and Information Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology told the New York Post in January.Teams around the world are already using ChatGPT and Bard to generate Excel formulas for specific tasks, and saving valuable time hunting. When we recently tested ChatGPT and Bard, we found that they both served us responses to requests for Google Sheets formulas at lightning speed, which otherwise would have taken considerable time leafing through Google to find.9. Bankers and accountantsTrading isn’t the only role in the finance industry that is likely to be affected by the AI revolution.“I believe that roles in accounting and finance are most at risk of being taken by AI” argues Forbes 30 under 30 alumni Matt Ramirez, Founder of AI firm Rephrase Media.“Advanced algorithms are already being used to detect patterns in large sets of data, which can then be used to predict future outcomes and make better business decisions,” he continued. “Sectors such as finance, accounting, and insurance will certainly experience disruption from AI.”10. Fact-checkers and proofreadersRight now, neither Bard nor ChatGPT is capable of getting every single question they’re asked correct, every single time. But if they undergo significant fine-tuning and provide sources to every answer they serve to users, they could function as formidable, real-time fact-checkers. What a great addition to the US presidential debates they’d be.Whether people would initially be prepared to trust an AI fact-checker is another story. But roles that revolve around sourcing correct information quickly and efficiently would be transformed by a chatbot that can consistently pull accurate information from the web while citing its sources – and it doesn’t feel like we’re miles off from making this a reality.Proofreading huge texts – which requires a similar level of attention to detail and would take veteran proofreader hours to check – can be reviewed for mistakes by AI programs in seconds already, meaning this sort of role is vulnerable to automation too. Will AI Just Make Jobs Easier?ChatGPT has already proven itself competent at basic administrative jobs, as well as coding, content ideation, generating Excel formulas, and writing emails. The version built into Microsoft Teams can take meeting notes and create action points. Rather than replacing jobs, however, might it just make our existing ones easier?Real Fake Photos founder Jan-Oliver Seidenfass, who’s currently completing a postgraduate degree focused on signal processing and machine learning at ETH Zurich, thinks the jobs most at risk include roles that deal with “mass content creation and editing, related to text, images, and video.”However, he told Tech.co that “rather than eliminating these jobs, AI is likely to boost individual productivity significantly. For example, software engineers can now generate boilerplate code in seconds instead of hours.”Ryan Daniel, President of Finance Manager Training, thinks the sales industry won’t be heavily affected by an AI revolution – in fact, workers in the sector may benefit from AI programs.“Our team recently launched an AI product designed to train car dealership staff. However, we were surprised to hear from many people expressing concerns that our product might replace their job,” Daniels recalls.“Our product uses AI to help train salespeople and finance managers, therefore allowing these employees to be even better at their job. In this way, we use AI as an enhancement – rather than a replacement” – Ryan Daniels, Finance Manager Training.Out of all the industries witnessing AI-related changes, Daniels believes “sales will be the least affected over the course of what we now know as artificial intelligence” because people are “less likely to trust AI with purchasing decisions.”It’s also important to remember that this sort of paradigmatic shift is nothing new for a constantly evolving global economy.“Every great technological innovation in history has changed up the job market, and AI is no different,” explains Nick Gausling, Managing Director of Romy Group LLC and Author of Bots in Suits: Using Generative AI to Revolutionize Your Business.“Some skills and jobs will become obsolete and resources will be reallocated to fit the new economy,” Gausling continued. “The most successful people will be those who learn to leverage AI to augment their work.”Jobs That Won’t Be Taken by AIWe’re some years away from the AI-supported utopian dreamland that’s been described by sci-fi novelists and tech futurists for decades, where we’ll be free to indulge in whatever activities we want to while robots do all the work.A whole swathe of job roles will be occupied by humans for years to come. For instance, it’s hard to envisage how the roles of lawyers and public sector jobs in nursing and law enforcement can feasibly be replaced in the near future. It will be a long while before we trust AI to occupy roles that demand accountability, even if the technology is advanced enough to perform the relevant duties capably.Indeed, a general distrust of AI – as well as more nuanced ethical considerations – is likely to hold up the expansion of AI into specific sectors as much as actual technological development. Major names in the tech industry are already speaking out against its unchecked development, and this pushback is likely to exist in perpetuity.Interestingly, however, public service job shortages are common at present in developed countries like the United Kingdom, where there’s still a huge backlog of unheard court cases left over from Covid-19, as well as severe nursing shortages. This could lead governments to explore innovative ways to fix this – which may include incorporating AI into job roles and processes.In the private sector, a 2022 Gartner survey found that 80% of executives thought AI could be applied in “any direction” – which would suggest no stone will be left unturned when it comes to automation.Will AI Create More Jobs Than It Replaces?Conversations about how artificial intelligence and advanced robotics will impact the job market are usually focused on the jobs they’ll replace. But AI development has the capacity to create a whole new industry full of jobs, too. It’s anything but a zero-sum game.In the World Economic Forum report referenced earlier on in this article is the fact that while AI may make around 85 million jobs obsolete, at the same time, it’ll create 97 million new ones.Other studies, such as a University of Warwick investigation published in March of last year, found AI investments were 28.4% more likely to create jobs than investments in other types of similar technologies.Dr. Will Hunt said at the time that “discussions about AI’s potential impact on jobs have tended to focus on potential job losses as AI is increasingly capable of automating complex tasks. And while there does seem to be some evidence of that, our research shows that AI is as likely to lead to net job creation in companies introducing AI as it is to lead to net destruction.”Many of the businesses that Tech.co has spoken to for this piece seemed positive about the impact AI is having on their respective industries, and keen to incorporate it into their workers’ lives.How to Make Yourself AI-ProofThe AI revolution is here, and if companies don’t start upskilling their staff so they can keep up with these significant changes to their working lives, they risk their business being left behind.But what can individuals do to prepare themselves? Iu Ayala, the co-founder of AI-focused consultancy firm Gradient Insight, says prospective employees heading into the job market should “focus on developing skills that complement AI technology.”“For example,” he explains, “skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, emotional intelligence, and communication are likely to become increasingly valuable in a world where AI is prevalent.”As we’ve said before, major changes aren’t going to happen overnight. If you’re worried about your role being swallowed up by artificial intelligence in the next few years, there are things you can do to adapt. Expanding your soft skills – and getting comfortable using the latest AI chatbots and other tools – is a good way to start.

Atlassian is rolling out new generative AI capabilities that will be embedded in the company’s entire portfolio of workforce management cloud products and are designed to help both service-based and project-based work teams be more efficient.
The technology, dubbed Atlassian Intelligence, was announced Wednesday and is built on in-house AI models gained through the company’s acquisition of Perceptive.ai in 2022, and a collaboration with Microsoft-back OpenAI — the creator of ChatGPT, whose launch last year sparked a virtual AI arms race among top tech companies including Google and Meta.
Through the use of large language models, the foundation of generative AI, Atlassian Intelligence constructs custom teamwork graphs showing the types of work being done and the relationship among them, while the open approach of the Atlassian platform provides additional context and data from the third-party apps teams use, according to the company.











 
 
 
“This is really about accelerating teamwork across the different types of products that we have,” said Sherif Mansour, product manager at Atlassian.

“Atlassian intelligence is a set of capabilities that exists within all our cloud products to address different use cases and scenarios, whilst leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and large language models,” he said.
Using generative AI to support teams
Atlassian has outlined multiple ways for Atlassian Intelligence to help support teams, including accelerating work, getting instant help, and building a shared understanding of projects. Atlassian Intelligence can also translate natural language queries into Jira Query Language to find issues across all Jira Cloud products.











 
 
 
To help accelerate work, Atlassian Intelligence uses generative AI technology from OpenAI to create, summarize and extract information from content. For example, decisions and action items can be quickly summarized from meeting minutes, and tweets can be drafted based on information held in Confluence.
While ChatGPT’s technology will be used to help Atlassian Intelligence process natural language requests, Sherif stresses that the company has an agreement that no customer data will be stored by the software or OpenAI.
The technology can also provide employees and customers with immediate responses and fast resolutions via the new Jira Service Management virtual agent, which can automate support interactions from within Slack and Microsoft Teams. Atlassian Intelligence also takes on repetitive requests on behalf of support teams, allowing them to focus on more important work.











 
 
 
Virtual agents to resolve work requests
The virtual agent is designed to resolve help requests instantly based on its understanding of knowledge-base articles and can also ask follow-up questions to take any necessary actions. It can also summarize activity on help requests to get assigned agents up to speed, and help craft responses to customers which can also be edited for tone.
In addition, Atlassian Intelligence can surface previously resolved or related issues and recommend relevant articles and related pages to resolve requests and incidents faster.
Atlassian Intelligence also helps to build a shared internal library of knowledge and terms used to describe projects, acronyms, and internal systems. It can provide shared context with an on-demand dictionary specific to your company, your teams, and their work. You can highlight a term and ask Atlassian Intelligence to explain it with the definition, source of information, internal subject matter experts, and how it connects to related work based on the teamwork graph, Atlassian said.











 
 
 
Natural language instead of SQL queries
Atlassian Intelligence’s understanding of natural language questions also means that users can ask questions and have the technology generate insights using data from multiple sources in Atlassian Analytics — a hub to analyze and visualize data across Atlassian products and connected third-party tools — without needing to know how to write SQL.
Since launching to the public, large language models like ChatGPT have faced criticism for providing incorrect or sometimes even defamatory information in response to requests from users, an issue Mansour is sympathetic with but not one that he thinks will be a major issue for businesses looking to leverage the technology.
“In the enterprise, it’s less of a problem because there’s far less fake news,” he said. Referencing the internal library offering from Atlassian Intelligence, Mansour acknowledged that while it’s technically possible for someone to attribute false definitions to terms, it’s a highly unlikely scenario as there’s nothing to be gained from doing so.











 
 
 
Despite this, a key principle for with Atlassian Intelligence is that the user remains in control.  Mansour explained that while the technology might help an agent craft a response, that message will only be delivered if the user manually presses the send button.
Furthermore, Mansour said that although Atlassian Intelligence largely adheres to the company’s existing privacy policy, Atlassian users will also need to opt into the technology.
“The user always has to be in control,” he said. “The technology should never do anything without the user first confirming it.”











 
 
 
Atlassian customers can sign up to Atlassian Intelligence’s early access waiting list from April 19, although it cannot guarantee specific timing for when users will gain access.

But for many artists, and the businesses that own their work, generative A.I. is a double threat. These systems can produce copycats of human works that dilute the market, and they use artists’ production, without their permission, as training data.Some see that as stealing intellectual property: Universal Music Group recently told music streaming platforms, including Spotify and Apple, to block A.I. systems from scraping its music.

These are then exposed to several antidepressants, and recorded for cellular changes called ""biomarkers"".This information, taken with a patient's medical history and genetic data, is then processed by an AI system to determine the best drug for a doctor to prescribe and the dosage.Although the technology is currently still in the development stage, Tel Aviv-based Genetika+ intends to launch commercially next year.Getty ImagesThe global pharmaceutical sector had revenues of $1.4 trillion in 2021An example of how AI is increasingly being used in the pharmaceutical sector, the company has secured funding from the European Union's European Research Council and European Innovation Council. Genetika+ is also working with pharmaceutical firms to develop new precision drugs.The company hopes its work will be in strong demand in the future. There are more than 280 million people globally who suffer from depression, according to the World Health Organization. And while taking antidepressants certainly won't be the correct treatment for all, it has long been estimated that almost two thirds of initial prescriptions for depression or anxiety may not work properly.""We are in the right time to be able to marry the latest computer technology and biological technology advances,"" says Dr Cohen Solal.Dr Heba Sailem says that the potential for AI to transform the global pharmaceutical industry, which generated revenues of $1.4 trillion (£1.1tn) in 2021, is huge.A senior lecturer of biomedical AI and data science at King's College London, she says that AI has so far helped with everything ""from identifying a potential target gene for treating a certain disease, and discovering a new drug, to improving patient treatment by predicting the best treatment strategy, discovering biomarkers for personalised patient treatment, or even prevention of the disease through early detection of signs for its occurrence"".New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Yet fellow AI expert Calum Chace says that the take-up of AI across the pharmaceutical sector remains ""a slow process"". ""Pharma companies are huge, and any significant change in the way they do research and development will affect many people in different divisions,"" says Mr Chace, who is the author of a number of books about AI. ""Getting all these people to agree to a dramatically new way of doing things is hard, partly because senior people got to where they are by doing things the old way.""They are familiar with that, and they trust it. And they may fear becoming less valuable to the firm if what they know how to do suddenly becomes less valued.""However, Dr Sailem emphasises that the pharmaceutical sector shouldn't be tempted to race ahead with AI, and should employ strict measures before relying on its predictions.""An AI model can learn the right answer for the wrong reasons, and it is the researchers' and developers' responsibility to ensure that various measures are employed to avoid biases, especially when trained on patients' data,"" she says.Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine is using AI to accelerate drug discovery.""Our AI platform is capable of identifying existing drugs that can be re-purposed, designing new drugs for known disease targets, or finding brand new targets and designing brand new molecules,"" says co-founder and chief executive Alex Zhavoronkov.Insilico MedicineAlex Zhavoronkov says that using AI is helping his firm to develop new drugs more quickly than would otherwise be the caseIts most developed drug, a treatment for a lung condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is now being clinically trialled. Mr Zhavoronkov says it typically takes four years for a new drug to get to that stage, but that thanks to AI, Insilico Medicine achieved it ""in under 18 months, for a fraction of the cost"".He adds that the firm has another 31 drugs in various stages of development.Back in Israel, Dr Cohen Solal says AI can help ""solve the mystery"" of which drugs work.MedicineDepressionArtificial intelligenceDrug breakthroughs",ReportageNewsArticle,,,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Natalie Lisbona'}]",2023-04-16T23:07:29.000Z,2023-04-16T23:07:29.000Z,How artificial intelligence is matching drugs to patients,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F13/production/_129353482_man1.jpg'}",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F13/production/_129353482_man1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65260592,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65260592,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How generative AI for business enhances collaboration


Generative AI has become a leading technology topic. Digital assistants and idea generation are two ways the technology could increase employee productivity.

ChatGPT has been a hot tech trend, and few innovations in any field have attracted as much attention in so little time. For those who view this as the ""Year of AI,"" ChatGPT has already provided all the validation needed, and we've barely scratched the surface.







That said, as with other new forms of technology, adoption starts in the consumer world. Many have experimented with ChatGPT, whereas commercial deployments in business environments have only started coming into play. Generative AI for business is starting to take shape for collaboration and contact center use cases but cautiously, given such a short track record.
Microsoft Teams has been an early adopter of ChatGPT, so it's important to watch the company's moves as a major investor in OpenAI. Unified communications-as-a-service players are following Microsoft's lead. However, it's important to note that ChatGPT is just one form of generative AI, and innovation can come from any vendor or platform provider. The possibilities are endless, and to provide a sense of what to expect, here are two emerging areas for generative AI in the collaboration space.

1. Digital assistants
This use case takes a few different forms, such as an intelligent personal assistant or virtual meeting assistant. In time, other variations will be added, but the underlying idea is for how generative AI can enhance applications built to manage and automate personal workloads. To a large extent, this is already being done using speech recognition, where workers interact with bots through voice to automate routine tasks, like calendaring, managing meetings, transcribing meeting notes and dictating emails.

The AI component means that these assistants learn more and more about the worker over time with machine learning, enabling AI to take on a greater range of tasks with more complexity. As trust builds, each worker can essentially have a personal virtual secretary, leaving more time to engage in work that calls for deep thinking, intense collaboration and creativity.
With an AI foundation in place to enable these digital assistants, generative AI can add new value for collaboration that goes beyond speech recognition. AI's ability to accurately handle voice communication is essential for building trust with end users, and once that develops, end users will be more comfortable relying on applications like ChatGPT.
These applications will be different, as they use AI and search not just to gather information from a wide range of sources, but also to generate new forms of content. The outputs need to be specified by the end user, and as would be done with a human secretary, the bot would be directed to generate whatever is needed, such as email replies, meeting summaries and reports.
What takes this beyond what you can do with conversational AI today is the ability to tailor each output for a specific audience or even individual. Not only can generative AI create these forms of content, but with enough guidance, the technology recognizes the characteristics of the reader well enough to create a more personal and relatable environment. However, ChatGPT can be wrong as much as it can be right, leaving room for refinement, but for now, the possibilities are clear.


2. Idea generation
This use case highlights how generative AI is different from the earlier forms of AI. Most AI use cases in the workplace, as well as in contact centers, are applied to either speech recognition or search, largely to automate workflows or manage large volumes of data. These applications clearly have business value, but their domain is drawn entirely from existing sources of information, either in speech or text forms. Being digital in nature, AI can only work with digitized inputs, which is why digital transformation is so crucial to AI's success and why most AI applications are still in an emerging state. A great deal of historical information will become part of the ocean of data that is the lifeblood of AI.
Generative AI represents an entirely different use case for AI -- namely, taking those existing digital inputs and generating new forms of content. Some might say that it's creating new forms of content, but that raises questions about AI that are not covered here.
While it's fair to say people shouldn't look to generative AI to do the thinking for the user, idea generation is indeed a valid use case. At some point, most collaboration scenarios require creative thinking and fresh ideas, such as developing new products, refreshing a brand or responding to a new competitor. The same can be applied to more mundane tasks that may not even be team-based, such as writing a business plan or a report.
The common thread to all of this is finding the initial inspiration or big idea to kick-start the process. Most people struggle to tap into creative instincts and can't get past staring at a blank page awaiting any input, especially when on a tight deadline. Enter generative AI, where users feed the bot with context and round up some ideas to help get started.
With some trial and error, whether you need a basic structure for a report, a visual for what a new product might look like or examples of great branding, this type of bot scans a far wider pool than any human possibly can and in much less time. These are the inherent strengths of AI, and with generative AI, users can improve work or projects when creative inspiration just isn't there.

Artificial Intelligence Makes Itself Seen (and Heard) in Radio 







NAB Show Daily 























Futuristic capabilities of this disruptive technology raise expectations and job fears
BY Paul mcLane, RadIo world

Radio industry talk has focused on the many ways artificial intelligence might make work more efficient — or take away jobs. AI already was used in radio, but generational platforms like ChatGPT have accelerated debate. Expect to hear a lot more here at NAB Show.
Futuri is here with RadioGPT, which creates “the world’s first 100 percent AI-driven radio hosts.” It combines GPT-3, voice tech and a story discovery/social content system. It scans social media and a quarter-million other sources of information to identify topics trending in a market. It uses AI to create a script for on-air use, and then puts AI voices to it.
U.S. company Alpha Media is intrigued; Executive Vice President of Content Phil Becker said the company is “conceptualizing use cases” but hasn’t deployed it. 
In Canada, Rogers Sports & Media is dabbling.
Futuri says stations can even create single-, duo- or trio-hosted shows, or train the software with voices of existing personalities, in any format.
Promises like this have a lot of radio people worried that AI will be a job-killer.
But CEO Daniel Anstandig calls it playing to radio’s strengths: “The ability for broadcasters to use RadioGPT to localize their on-air content in a turnkey fashion opens up resources for them to deepen their important home-field advantages in new and unique ways. …
With RadioGPT, there should never be a ‘liner card’ or ‘sweeper-only’ air shift again. Now everyone can be live and local.”
Exhibitor Veritone makes products to create avatars and synthetic voice models, deploying AI “to bring digital personas to life.” Clients include iHeartMedia, Audacy and ESPN. 
“Radio managers need to be thinking about which technologies to embrace and lean into,” said Sean King, Veritone senior vice president and general manager, Commercial Enterprise, “whether that’s synthetic media or automation tools to ensure their organizations are around for the next NAB Show.
“Everyone in this space needs to learn not only how to keep up with content demands and new platforms but how to reach new audiences while remaining authentic to their programs’ valuesand brand.”
What about a risk to jobs? “I think about farming,” King said. “Advances in equipment didn’t put farmers out of business, it made them more efficient. Now, many successful farms utilize AI to analyze weather patterns, make predictions and optimize their crop growth.
“AI provides great insight… Take attribution and proof of performance. Without real data, stations and advertisers are merely guessing at what’s working,” said King. “Without AI, it can take a long time to sift through content archives to find a needed clip. With AI, it can be done in mere seconds.” With synthetic voice, creators can use their voice “in two or more places at once.
Additionally, they can do this in multiple languages,” opening new markets. ENCO Systems already uses AI for automated captioning. At NAB Show, it’s showing two offerings that use ChatGPT. 
AITrack integrates with DAD automation to generate voice tracks between songs. “That might include identifying the song and artist of the previous song, introducing the next song and artist, or communicating station IDs, and news or weather updates,” President Ken Frommert said.
Meanwhile ENCO-GPT will automatically create ad copy and summarize news stories. “The application will summarize a written news article into a few sentences or inject breaking news updates into a body of a break. This technology can also be used to quickly write copy for both sponsorships and advertising and convert it to synthetic speech.” 
Frommert said AI is still emerging. “It will take time to reach the quality and accuracy levels that the broadcast industry requires and expects. One concern to alleviate is that AI will make everyone’s job obsolete. Like automation before it, AI will change operational models and perhaps disrupt some traditional structures, but AI cannot survive in broadcast alone. That human element will always be required for quality assurance.”
And not all AI applications are “generational.” Exhibitor WorldCast Systems deploys an AI system called SmartFM for Ecreso transmitters. It says the technology, sold via software license, enables reductions of energy consumption by up to 40%.
Director of Marketing Communications Chantal Fourgeaud said the AI qualifies the robustness of audio content; when the signal is robust enough, it adjusts transmitter power, with no impact on program coverage and audio quality. She said this dynamic RF power approach saves electricity, produces less carbon dioxide and improves service life. The system is in numerous markets, but the biggest is Germany, where approximately 800 transmitters are equipped with it.

The launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, ushered in an explosion of interest by businesses seeking to incorporate large language model artificial intelligence applications into the workplace. To capitalize on efficiencies that this technology presents, many employers have implemented or are considering the use of chatbots to serve human resource functions. Such a program can meet a wide range of needs, from gathering job application information and conducting basic candidate screening to acting as an initial point of contact to answer employee questions related to topics such as employee benefits and company policies or direct users to other resources.
While few areas of the country have passed laws directly regulating artificial intelligence applications to date, introducing a human resources chatbot to the workplace still carries the potential risk of violating any number of established labor and employment laws. Over the course of 2022, federal labor and employment law stakeholders, including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), published guidance addressing how artificial intelligence tools, including chatbots, can run afoul of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Thus, employers can expect conflicts between employee legal protections and artificial intelligence to draw strong interest from law enforcement agencies.
Some of the legal risks associated with chatbots may be more readily apparent than others. One issue applicable to chatbots highlighted by the EEOC’s May 12, 2022, publication, “The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees,” relates to health condition questions. The potential violations of law explained by the EEOC included that the ADA restricts an employer’s ability to conduct disability-related inquiries and medical examinations. If an employer’s chatbot directly questions a candidate or employee about his or her health condition or raises inquiries that are likely to elicit information about a health condition, such dialogue may infringe on the employee’s rights under the ADA.
Other legal risks presented through the introduction of chatbot applications may be less obvious. For example, a chatbot that is deployed as an initial point of contact to assist employees with human resources needs may be used by employees to attempt to report concerns or complaints related to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Many human resources professionals are well-familiar with the importance of a timely response to such issues to preserve invaluable defenses, among other worthy objectives.
Yet many employers have also experienced communication challenges that some employees have presented related to their unique use of emojis and slang, particularly in remote work settings that heavily rely on electronic communication. A chatbot that is not equipped to understand or redirect a potential report of misconduct using this distinct language may miss the need and opportunity to address problematic behavior. This issue highlights the importance of maintaining a human presence in human resources functions and avoiding the temptation of relying entirely on artificial intelligence for this important company department.
Additionally, risks may arise related to the information that employees communicate through a chatbot. The latest large language model chatbots utilize machine learning to improve performance over time and use. The machine learning process may rely on assimilating the information that employees submit to it and distributing it externally to expand the information available to the chatbot, thereby increasing the application’s accuracy. Companies may question what happens with that information once an employee uses it to interact with the chatbot. A business may risk losing confidentiality and trade secret protections if the information that employees communicate with the chatbot is disclosed to third parties through the machine learning process.
A chatbot application may raise other legal concerns related to the personal health information that employees may submit to it. An employee may voluntarily disclose to a chatbot the details of a health condition when seeking benefits-related information. Even assuming there is not an issue such as that discussed above with the employer soliciting information from the employee, the employer may maintain obligations to protect and retain the employee’s communication as confidential medical information. This hypothetical also presents the possibility that the employer received sufficient notice of a serious health condition supporting a need for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or a request for accommodation pursuant to the ADA. If the chatbot does not respond appropriately, the employer may face a claim of interference or denial of rights under these laws.
Employers may want to be mindful of how artificial intelligence tools such as chatbots are received by employees and communicate how and why a chatbot is being introduced. A failure to help a workforce understand the benefits of these applications and to address individual concerns may have a detrimental impact on efforts to maintain positive employee relations. Without a concerted investment in messaging strategy, an employer’s latest and greatest artificial intelligence tools may become a focus for employees to seek outside assistance to address their concerns.
These issues highlight the importance of proceeding carefully when implementing chatbot technology and understanding how the technology works to address foreseeable questions and issues that may arise. Additionally, contracts that cover the terms and conditions of third-party technology may be critical to establish the company’s rights to information and resources to defend against employee claims. Lastly, employers may want to have plans in place to closely monitor chatbot functionality to ensure compliance with labor and employment law requirements and avoid assumptions that the application works as intended when initially implemented.

<p>The <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4344524&amp;GUID=B051915D-A9AC-451E-81F8-6596032FA3F9&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search"" target=""_blank"">AI Law</a> makes it an unlawful employment practice for employers to use automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) to screen candidates and employees within New York City unless certain bias audit and notice requirements are met. </p>
<p>Following a lengthy notice and comment period and two rounds of proposed rules published in September 2022 and December 2022, on April 6, 2023 DCWP issued the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DCWP-NOA-for-Use-of-Automated-Employment-Decisionmaking-Tools-2.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Final Rule</a>, which provides further guidance on the AI Law and establishes a new effective date when enforcement efforts will begin. </p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The AI Law makes it unlawful for an employer or employment agency to use an AEDT to screen candidates and employees unless (1) the tool has undergone a bias audit no more than one year prior to its use, (2) a summary of the most recent bias audit is made publicly available, and (3) notice of the AEDT use and an opportunity to request an alternative selection process is provided to each candidate and employee who resides in New York City.</p>
<h3>Final Rule</h3>
<p>The Final Rule is largely similar to the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2023/01/nyc-postpones-enforcement-of-ai-bias-law-until-april-2023-and-revises-proposed-rules"" target=""_blank"">December 2022 proposed rule</a>, with some notable alterations. </p>
<p>First, the AI Law defines an &ldquo;AEDT&rdquo; as any process &ldquo;derived from <em>machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence</em>, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making&rdquo; (emphasis added). </p>
<p>Under the Final Rule, &ldquo;machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence&rdquo; is further defined as &ldquo;a group of mathematical, computer-based techniques: (i) that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an assessment of a candidate&rsquo;s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on skill sets or aptitude; and (ii) for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve the accuracy of the prediction or classification.&rdquo;   </p>
<p>This expanded definition could result in enforcement on additional, less sophisticated AEDTs used by employers, as the third requirement&mdash;&ldquo;(iii) for which the inputs and parameters are refined through cross validation or by using training and test data&rdquo;&mdash;was removed. </p>
<p>Second, under the AI Law, a &ldquo;bias audit&rdquo; is defined as an &ldquo;impartial evaluation by an independent auditor.&rdquo; The Final Rule largely maintains the minimum requirements for a bias audit first seen in the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/10/new-york-city-proposes-new-rules-to-clarify-law-on-employers-use-of-artificial-intelligence"" target=""_blank"">September 2022 </a>and December 2022 proposals, including (1) calculation of the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and a sex category and (2) comparison of such &ldquo;selection rates&rdquo; to the most selected category to determine an &ldquo;impact ratio&rdquo; using a defined formula. </p>
<p>However, the Final Rule adds a requirement that the bias audit also indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed who are not included because they fall within an unknown category and requires that the number be included in the summary of results. </p>
<p>Third, the Final Rule allows an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from calculations on impact ratio.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Final Rule clarifies that an employer or employment agency may only rely on a bias audit that uses historical data of other employers or employment agencies if (1) &ldquo;such employer or employment agency provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit&rdquo; or (2) &ldquo;such employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Historical data&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;data collected during an employer or employment agency&rsquo;s use of an AEDT to assess candidates for employment or employees for promotion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Fifth, the Final Rule states that the number of applicants in and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must be included in the published summary of results, in addition to the date of the most recent bias audit, source and explanation of the data used to conduct the audit, impact ratios for all categories, and distribution date of the AEDT.</p>
<p>Finally, DCWP announced that the Final Rule would be effective and enforcement would begin on July 5, 2023&mdash;six months after the AI Law was originally supposed to go into effect. </p>
<h3>Implications for Employers </h3>
<p>Employers should continue to monitor for DCWP updates as the enforcement date draws near. In the interim, employers should consider taking the following steps: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify whether the employer is currently using any AI tools in its hiring and promotion practices. Employment counsel should reach out to human resources and talent acquisition to identify what AI tools are currently being used in or considered for hiring and promotion processes. </li>
    <li>Determine whether use of such tools is covered by the AI Law and Final Rule&mdash;does the tool meet the statutory and regulatory definition of an AEDT, and is it being used to &ldquo;substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making&rdquo;?</li>
    <li>Assuming the tool is covered, determine whether the employer is going to engage an independent auditor to audit its data or rely on the vendor&rsquo;s independent audit. If the former, employers may wish to consider conducting the audit under privilege.</li>
    <li>If the employer will be relying on the vendor to conduct the audit, confirm with the vendor that it has engaged an independent auditor to evaluate their data and by when the audit will be completed.</li>
    <li>Develop a plan for posting the results of the bias audit, in conformance with the law&rsquo;s requirements. The plan should include the specific text that will be posted and where the audit results will be posted. </li>
    <li>Develop a compliant notice to applicants and employees that an AEDT is being used and identify where it will be posted. </li>
</ul>
<p>The AI Law may serve as a framework for other local and state legislatures across the United States, and, while the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued guidance in <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/05/eeoc-releases-guidance-on-algorithms-ai-and-disability-discrimination-in-hiring"" target=""_blank"">May 2022</a> related to the Americans with Disabilities Act and AI, more guidance from the EEOC is expected. Morgan Lewis will continue to monitor developments at the federal, state, and local levels and send out updates as appropriate.</p>",,,"[{'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/sharonmasling/#Person', 'email': 'sharon.masling@morganlewis.com', 'image': 'https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/people/washington-dc/masling_sharon_17641_desktop.jpg?rev=9384f14527d642f2994495fa4531009a&hash=68D3127395DD576234446C5534AD7D1C', 'faxNumber': '+1.202.739.3001', 'jobTitle': 'Partner', 'name': 'Sharon Perley Masling', 'telephone': '+1.202.739.5299', 'url': 'https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/sharonmasling'}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/jlee/#Person', 'email': 'w.john.lee@morganlewis.com', 'image': 'https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/person-images/l/lee_wonho_70454_desktop.jpg?rev=97bbff85647247dd9d0bc213bbb2423e&hash=74DD137F51C35D477B349822C93E40AB', 'faxNumber': '+1.215.963.5001', 'jobTitle': 'Partner', 'name': 'W.

READOUT: Department of Labor gathered experts, stakeholders to ensure more inclusive hiring as automated technology affects decision-making
Assistant Secretary for Disability Employment Policy Williams offers opening remarks
WASHINGTON – The Department of Labor today hosted an online “think tank” on the use of artificial intelligence tools in hiring during which federal agencies, technology innovators, disability organizations and civil rights groups convened to explore strategies for ensuring that automated employment decision tools treat workers with disabilities and other underserved communities equally.
Many organizations now use artificial intelligence to screen job candidates, streamline the application process, monitor employee actions, and provide employee training. While its use offers employers efficiencies, AI tools must be designed with diverse users in mind to prevent workplace discrimination, including against people with disabilities. 
Hosted by the department’s Office of Disability Employment Policy’s Partnership on Employment & Accessible Technology(link is external), the four-hour event included opening remarks by Assistant Secretary for Disability Employment Policy Taryn Williams. 
“By collaborating with our cross-sector partners, we can harness the power of AI and create a robust risk management framework profile for automated employment decision tools,” said Assistant Secretary for Disability Employment Policy Taryn Williams. “Our vision includes creating a profile that guides inclusive hiring for all Americans, including people with disabilities and other underserved groups.” 
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Charlotte A. Burrows and the Associate Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Info Technology Laboratory Elham Tabassi also delivered remarks.
Today’s event aligned with the commitment of the Biden-Harris administration to make certain AI-powered employment tools do not harm employment prospects for America’s workers. In October 2022, the Office of Science and Technology Policy(link is external) released its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights(link is external) to foster more equitable and inclusive digital hiring of workers with disabilities and other underserved communities. 
An ODEP-funded initiative to promote collaboration in technology and build inclusive workplaces, PEAT will issue a report on the event to promote its findings and identify action steps.

CHICAGO—Health IT giant Epic made a big splash Monday at the HIMSS 2023 conference when it announced plans to integrate generative AI into its electronic health record software.Epic is expanding its collaboration with Microsoft with a focus on combining the Azure OpenAI Service with Epic’s EHR software. The aim is to increase the productivity of physicians as well as back-office professionals.Initially, Epic is focused on using OpenAI's GPT-4 AI language model to help draft message responses from healthcare workers to patients and for use in analyzing medical records while looking for trends.""Those are just two of many use cases that we're looking at. There's a lot of general applicability to this,"" Phil Lindemann, Epic's vice president of data and analytics, said during an interview on the HIMSS23 exhibit hall floor. ""The area where we focused first was, 'How can we make physicians more efficient?'""During the COVID-19 pandemic, as the use of virtual care boomed, doctors also saw a spike in digital messages from patients ranging from requests for medication refills to more complicated medical questions, Lindemann noted.""Physicians and their teams have to be able to process those messages, and a lot of them are routine but some of them are more complex and physicians have to consume that. We are using generative AI within EHR 'in-basket' messaging to create draft responses,"" Lindemann said.The AI-enabled solution will help triage the severity of patient messages as well, he noted.RelatedHIMSS23: Epic taps Microsoft to integrate generative AI into EHRs with Stanford, UC San Diego as early adoptersUC San Diego Health and UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin, are among the first organizations to begin using the solution, and Stanford Health Care is expected to add the functionality soon.The second use case for OpenAI's GPT-4 brings natural language queries and interactive data analysis to SlicerDicer, Epic's self-service reporting tool. That functionality enables clinical leaders to ""explore data in a conversational and intuitive way"" to find trends.

""Physicians might want to ask questions about the efficacy of a drug or they want to understand readmission rates. It's a way they can do on-demand reporting without having to call up IT. With GPT, we can talk like a normal conversation and it knows how to translate it into tech speak,"" he said. ""Those are the two use cases that we see as really valuable to make a physician's day more efficient by helping them with that high volume of patient messages and then the ability to analyze large sets of data.""Some researchers are concerned about how generative AI and GPT-4 will impact diagnosis and clinical decision-making. So far, most healthcare companies are focused on administrative functions and medical documentation.Lindemann said Epic's work with generative AI is guided by its principles of responsible AI. ""One aspect of that methodology is 'human in the loop.' As we roll this out, every message that's going to be generated, a human is going to review it. When we're looking through a query, where it's translating the language, someone is evaluating it against the actual code. So there has to be this transparency early on or someone is reviewing every use case, which is slow, but it's the right thing to do to be responsible with AI,"" he said.As large language models are used in healthcare, it's important to have guardrails and build trust and transparency.""We have to make sure that whenever there is an opportunity for transparency, we show that to the clinician, to the billing office, even to the scheduler. And there need to be metrics to measure success and to say AI got the answer right X percent of the time. We don't just say let it loose and let it figure it out. There has to be constant monitoring,"" Lindemann noted.He cautions that as healthcare organizations begin to pilot and test generative AI for different use cases, clinical leaders need to be diligent about how medical data are being used.""It's up to you to manage your patients' privacy and make sure your data doesn't go into someone else's hands where it's just being sold off. That's an important thing as we're in this gold rush of generative AI is to understand how the data will be used and how it's kept safe,"" he said.He noted that generative AI is at ""peak hype"" at the current moment.""I do think the way that generative AI is going to change how we all are working and interacting is substantial. When this dies down, we are going to see some enhancements that historically would have taken 10 years and now they're going to happen in a year. That's what I'm excited about. This is a significant change,"" he said.Epic is historically known for its work in electronic medical records software, but the company also has been expanding its efforts in genomics and life sciences.Last fall, the company rolled out a genomic test ordering tool within its EHR with New Orleans-based Ochsner Health as the first user.Often genetic results are received in PDF format and then scanned into the EHR. Many health systems are working with their EHR vendor partners to make ordering genetic tests and receiving results easier for clinicians. RelatedEpic launches program for clinical trial matchmaking in effort to expand access to marginalized participants""Genomics is really just the next evolution of what we think of as a medical record,"" Lindemann said. ""There are two things that we've enabled our clients to do. The first thing is, you need a place to store your genomic data so we had to build the database and the locations that store genetic material in the EHR right alongside their problems and their orders and their social determinants data. We had to make a genomically-enabled EHR first. And that's many years in the making, and that's something that our customers are implementing.""There are 40 health systems now live with that service and an additional 15 organizations are installing it, he said.Epic also developed a network to integrate with genomics labs and biotechs like Tempus to enable physicians to seamlessly order genomics tests and view results within the EHR. Physicians can now order tests and access discrete biomarkers within the patient’s electronic health record to offer personalized cancer treatment options, as one example.This gives physicians the ability to practice precision medicine directly in the EMR.Epic also launched a life sciences program last fall aimed at facilitating clinical trial matchmaking. ""We are working on integrating clinical care and research care into a single integrated experience. We've created software that allows clinical trials to run alongside clinical care in Epic,"" Lindemann said.Providers currently rely on Epic to oversee more than 100,000 studies with 4.7 million patients, according to the company. The company is stepping up its work to match participating providers with clinical trial opportunities, offer providers customized Cosmos data queries, make trials more accessible by mitigating staffing barriers, increase efficiency by minimizing repetitive tasks, connect stakeholders through one system and support clinicians with data on when patients might qualify for a trial, according to the company.""What the life sciences platform does is it helps to run clinical trials at scale. It allows someone to go in and build all of the elements for a clinical trial from an IT perspective once and pushed as a downloadable package to the sites that want to run the trial,"" he said. ""Our sites can run more trials with less of an IT footprint and quickly decide if they want to move forward with a trial. That also means that they can more quickly find opportunities for their own patients.""

They are called generative A.I. because they possess the ability to create new content, including text, images, video, audio, and many other formats.These tools, in the past three to six months, have captured the creative and marketing world’s zeitgeist. Hollywood actor Ryan Reynold’s Mint Mobile, a virtual mobile network, in January 2023, used ChatGPT to script a TV ad while AB InBev’s Beck recently used A.I. to produce a limited-edition beer and its full marketing campaign.Their rising indiscriminate use has fuelled an atmosphere of excitement as well as a fear of the machines taking over people’s jobs, and ultimately humanity like the movies.To look at it as a threat or as something that will improve your efficiency depends on the outlook of the receiver says John Paite, chief creative officer (Art &amp; Tech), Media.Monks, an international digital agency owned by Martin Sorrell's S4Capital. “I think right now no one is running out of jobs… it will create more jobs,” he says pointing to the new jobs for people skilled at doling out prompts to these generative A.I. tools.Generative A.I. has become a part of the proverbial water cooler discussions, and while there are people on both sides of the conversation, one point has taken centre stage: Everybody wants to use it once.&nbsp;“Curiosity” is what led Deepak Gopalakrishnan to try ChatGPT in the first place. He does not see it as a fad and thinks it is the start of a new era. “I wanted to get into it in the beginning and get my hands dirty just to see what it is,” he reveals. Gopalakrishnan is a freelancer who works in the digital marketing and content landscape.He uses ChatGPT4 (a paid version), and has used Midjourney, a tool which generates images from language description. He looks at them as “the starting point” which he then uses to refine and rework before presenting the outcome to clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, like him, are using these generative A.I. tools as a base on which they build their work. Media.Monk’s Paite tells us they use tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney as a kickstart for say a writer facing a mental block or when a client requests last-minute changes.Independent agency Schbang uses tools like ChatGPT; it takes the output and combines it with human expertise “to adapt the content so that it suits the brand personality and the tone of voice of the client we are catering to,” says Eva R Sachdeva, the agency’s content lead and manager.She cites the agency’s work for a skincare brand where the prompts ensured the tool generates content which is custom to the client. Here is what she fed to ChatGPT:Can you give me an outline for writing a blog on the topic '5 summer skincare tips'? It has to be from the perspective of a brand that sells skincare items in India and the point of view and tone of voice needs to be in the second person and you need to talk like a skincare expert giving these tips and selling your product to the consumer.The content which comes out is not used right away. Once the blog post — a mix of human and generative A.I. work — is ready, it is run through an A.I. detection tool like Copyleaks. “Once detected, we use Quillbot or Copy.AI, these tools will give us a paraphrased version of that particular A.I. generated content,” says Sachdeva. After all the rework, the final piece is run through a plagiarism checker before being published on the client’s website or blog.AI, ChatGPT and its ilk: boon or bane for agencies?On the other hand, Talented, a Bangalore-based creative agency is using many generative A.I. tools to, as per co-founder P.G. Aditya, “streamline a lot of processes internally while also creating new processes altogether that collaborate with A.I. as opposed to just utilising it.”Visualisers use visual A.I. models and the agency is seeing writers and strategists use it to their advantage to speed up processes. Aditya says A.I. that uses LLMs (Language learning models) have proven to be supremely useful - be it for research, bouncing ideas off of, or just using them to break down and describe visual work. “LLMs like ChatGPT and Compose.ai have proven themselves useful in cutting down work time and increasing creation time.”Talented uses GPT-powered applications like ChatGPT, Compose.ai, Tome, Gama, and Beautiful.ai. It uses visual generation AI tools, especially ones that take advantage of Stable Diffusion like Midjourney, Gen1 by Runway, Dall-E, Scribble Diffusion, and DeepAgency.An account winFor all the increased efficiency and time-saving generative A.I. offers, what is the end game for an agency – win new work? “We won two clients in the Middle East with retail store design we'd created using these A.I. tools,"" says Mahesh Murthy, founder, Pinstorm.He tells us the agency has subscriptions to several generative A.I. tools and uses them “to look into the product category and see what kind of conventional and unconventional strategies it suggests.”What is interesting, as per Murthy, is the agency’s internal rule that the employees’ strategy should be as good as the one generative A.I. suggests. “This is the starting point, and if your work doesn't come up to it…”He says ChatGPT is not good when it comes to writing advertising copy, it's good at writing body copy and content, but ""it doesn't know to write ads so I think a copywriter's job is still safe. We think it's pretty good at visualisation, you've to learn how to push it to do that. We're already using it across every single one of our clients.""When asked about Pinstorm’s clients’ response to knowing generative A.I. was being used and if it had affected revenue, says Murthy, “Clients don't pay us to use tools, they pay us for people and the hours we put in. We're still putting the same people and the number of hours.”The art of the promptLike a young pup which needs instruction to keep it and others from harm, a user needs to prompt generative A.I. to get it to do the right thing. “A lot of what A.I. promises to do is only realised when it’s prompted correctly. Much like any new piece of technology, trial and error comes is core to the process,” says Talented’s P.G. Aditya.Gopalakrishnan gave an example of how he and his wife, used ChatGPT for a presentation. “We'd given it a few situations saying this is the brand, this is the industry, this is the persona we're trying to define with the brand. it gave us a good enough starting point for us to improve on.”One may assume prompting is the next big thing to learn but it is not. It all boils down to knowing what you want and feeding it to the tool. You can keep giving it prompts and “it has the wisdom to adapt and learn from the prompts you give,” remarks Schbang’s Sachdeva.The new teacherAn interesting aspect of these tools is their ability to teach. “ChatGPT allows our junior writers to learn,” states Bonsy Mehta, Schbang’s head of content marketing, consumer centricity, and branding.She references ChatGPT and how young writers, who make errors while writing, do not have to depend only on an editor like in the old times but can use the tool to learn where they err.Where she feels ChatGPT helps the most is with the tone of voice. “It will give you the same article in the tone of a voice of a 15-year-old and a 45-year-old.” Allying fears like Pait, Mehta believes ChatGPT won't replace writers but will allow them to hone their skills more.A peek into the near futureMachines, unlike humans, can master data quicker, and therein lies their superpower. As time passes, generative A.I. tools will grow in sophistication and the first signs of this uplift come from plugins.Think of them as additions which let you customise apps, programs, and browsers. “Plugins will increase the power of ChatGPT by at least 5X,” says Jacob Joesph, vice president, Data Science at CleverTap, a customer engagement and retention platform.Companies such as Expedia, Instacart, Shopify, Slack, Wolfram, and Zapier have developed the first plugins for ChatGPT.He, for instance, tells a story about a user who wishes to cook palak paneer. Using Instacart, a grocery delivery and pick-up company, he prompts the dish he wishes to cook and the number of servings. Now, the company app/website will calculate which ingredients in what quantity are needed and will deliver them for you.&nbsp;Jacob believes every company will benefit from generative A.I. tools. Traditional mortar companies are developing online offerings and “with tools like GPT the cost of intelligence has come down.”He explains this using ChatGPT’s pricing models, “Six months back, for 1000 tokens, which is like 750 words, I had to pay four cents which three months back they brought it back to two cents, and now it is 1/10th of it with GPT 3.5.”Unlike the many flashy trends in the past eight to sixteen months, generative A.I. has fared better and is here to stay. “I feel missing this wave is like someone who's missing the digital wave that started about 10-15 years ago and this is arguably going to be even more powerful,” says Gopalakrishnan.The machines are here to stay and generate.&nbsp;Photo by Alex Knight ",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shreyas Kulkarni', 'sameAs': 'https://www.afaqs.com/author/742894/shreyas-kulkarni'}",2023-04-17T05:30:00+05:30,2023-04-17T05:30:00+05:30,The many ways creative folks are using generative A.I. in their work,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://gumlet-images.assettype.com/afaqs/2023-04/ad378f9a-74a3-4c5a-9fb7-d79c0fdd69e5/pexels_alex_knight_2599244.jpg?auto=format,compress&fmt=webp&format=webp&w=1200&h=900&dpr=1.0', 'width': '1200', 'height': '900'}",,,,,,https://www.afaqs.com/news/advertising/the-many-ways-creative-folks-are-using-generative-ai-in-their-work,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'afaqs!', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'name': 'afaqs!', 'url': 'https://images.assettype.com/afaqs/2019-08/759331e0-2038-4873-8278-0e952e4492a3/Afaqs_512xprop.png'}}",,,,,2023-04-17T05:30:00+05:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",SiteNavigationElement," Even as technology giants push platforms like ChatGPT, Bing and Bard, top engineering colleges in India are starting an increasing number of generative artificial intelligence (AI) research projects, many of which are seeking to understand how technology can help create tools similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but in Indian languages.Generative AI platforms have been the rage since the second half of last year with Microsoft and Google pushing these programs into their existing services. Even the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), on 3 February, said it is “cognizant” of the emergence and proliferation of generative AI and noted that AI can be a “kinetic enabler” for growth in India.However, researchers at institutes underline a host of challenges for generative AI projects in academia, the biggest of which lie in sourcing ample data of Indic languages, the cost of such projects, and the scale of computing power needed. Indian researchers have been working on such projects for more than three years.“In academia, we’re using techniques from language models, namely the transformer architecture, for different tasks such as classification of data, answering questions, machine translation and building chatbots,” said Tapas Kumar Mishra, assistant professor of computer science engineering at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela.The transformer AI model is the underlying algorithm for generative AI tools. They can process conversational human language inputs and generative output after understanding context.While global platforms work mostly in English, Mishra said researchers under him are working on languages like Hindi, Bangla and Kannada, creating models that can take questions in these languages and generate output in English. They aren’t using OpenAI’s tools for this but have achieved “very good” scores according to the industry standard BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) test.He said NIT Rourkela has achieved scores of between 25 to 30 on Hindi to English, and 19 on Bangla to English. For reference, OpenAI’s GPT-4 model has scores of 22.9 in English to French outputs. The institute published a research paper on translations from Hindi to English last month with the Association for Computing Machinery—a US scientific educational community that publishes research work on natural language processing (NLP).NIT Rourkela isn’t the only one doing this either. Students from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras have also taken up such projects. Harish Guruprasad, assistant professor, computer science engineering at IIT Madras said that one such project includes “better translated YouTube videos in Tamil”.“Students mostly took this up to compare their own research language models with GPT-4, and eventually publish a paper on new approaches of translating videos into Indian languages,” he added. Generative AI projects have also been a part of research initiatives beyond Indic languages. For instance, Debanga Raj Neog, assistant professor, data science and AI at IIT Guwahati, said the institute is presently working on creating “affordable visual animation models that study eyes and facial movements from open-source visual databases, and use this to replicate the process.” IIT Guwahati, too, is working on a research paper on this.Professor Mausam, the founding head of Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Delhi, said that in 2022, he, along with Anoop Krishnan, associate professor, and a team of students, created a language model called ‘MatSciBert’ — specifically for the field of material science research.“The eventual goal is to discover new materials with the help of AI. A first step is to process scientific articles and extract from them knowledge about materials and their properties. We developed MatSciBert in 2022 — it is a language model skilled in reading material science papers more effectively than other generic language models like Bert. MatSciBert has been downloaded o almost 100,000 times in the last year and has been found useful for various material science tasks by numerous groups all over the world,” said Mausam, who goes by one name.The key problem for most researchers though is computing power. NIT Rourkela has 13 machines with 24GB graphic processing units (GPUs) each. Mausam noted that the scale of compute power required is “exorbitant and prohibitive”. “For instance, one training run of GPT-3 would cost $4.6 million, not accounting for any errors and re-trials during training. No academic institution or any Indian company, apart from the top tech firms, can afford training such large models regularly. Looking to train India-specific language models is therefore premature, unless we create massive compute infrastructure in the country,” IIT Delhi’s Mausam said.A senior executive, who was formerly working on government tech projects, said on condition of anonymity that there is “a lack of clarity in terms of enabling access to India’s supercomputer infrastructure owned by the Meity-backed Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC.” Mint reported in on July 6 last year, India’s supercomputing power is also well behind global systems.The executive added that while multiple top institutes, including IIT Delhi, have been consulted on using the infrastructure for their research initiatives, not much progress has taken place in this regard.Availability of data is another problem for India. For instance, NIT Rourkela uses various public datasets, such as the Samantaral database released by IIT Madras. “This consisted of low resource language pairs of Indic languages. We’re also using our own datasets by scraping newspapers and converting to various languages — and then working on that. We’re also using publicly available data, such as state government-backed local language data repositories,” said Mishra.To accelerate AI research in India, the Meity launched ‘Bhashini’ in May last year — an Indic language database that can be tapped by institutes. However, access to the scale of data needed for such projects continues to remain an issue. “When a language has a huge amount of data available, transformer architectures can produce great efficiency of translation. But, with small amounts of data, this is difficult to work with. For instance, translating from Odiya to Hindi, such models are not very efficient,” IIT Madras’ Guruprasad said.",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Shouvik Das', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/authors/shouvik-das'}",2023-04-16T22:20:24+05:30,2023-04-16T22:15:52+05:30,Indian colleges accelerate work on Indic languages gen AI | Mint,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/04/16/1600x900/indiclanguage_1681663746577_1681663755703_1681663755703.jpg', 'height': 900, 'width': 1600}",,"['https://www.livemint.com/news', 'https://www.livemint.com/budget', 'https://www.livemint.com/money', 'https://www.livemint.com/companies', 'https://www.livemint.com/market', 'https://www.livemint.com/elections', 'https://www.livemint.com/industry', 'https://www.livemint.com/opinion', 'https://www.livemint.com/technology', 'https://www.livemint.com/politics', 'https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge', 'https://www.livemint.com/sports', 'https://www.livemint.com/sports/cricket-news/ipl', 'https://www.livemint.com/education']",,,Indian colleges accelerate work on Indic languages gen AI | Mint,https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/indian-engineering-colleges-lead-generative-ai-research-projects-in-indic-languages-facing-challenges-in-data-sourcing-and-computing-power-11681663553393.html,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'mint', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/newschemalogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/', 'name': 'Business News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology', 'name': 'Technology'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '4', 'item': {'name': 'Indian colleges accelerate work on Indic languages gen AI'}}]",,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,,,,,,,"['Today News', 'Budget 2024', 'Money', 'Company Business News', 'Stock Market News', 'Election Results 2024', 'Indian Industry Analysis', 'Opinion', 'Technology News', 'Politics News', 'Lounge', 'Sports News', 'IPL 2024', 'Education News Today']",,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept of equal pay for equal work is a cornerstone of Americans' sense of fairness in the workplace. But the rise of artificial intelligence allows some large companies to pay workers different amounts to do the same work, a new research report alleges.  The study finds that companies like Uber and Amazon, which rely on independent contractors for labor, use artificial intelligence to enact so-called ""algorithmic wage discrimination,"" similar to consumer price discrimination.  Retailers and advertisers charge consumers different prices for the same goods, based on how much they believe a person is willing to pay, which sellers glean from details like what web browser someone is using. In a similar vein, companies that use independent contractors collect detailed information on where they live, when and where they work, how much money they aim to make, and the types of jobs they're most inclined to accept or reject, according to the report's author, University of California Hastings law professor Veena Dubal.Uber drivers strike in New York City after company blocks pay increasesAmazon accused of stealing tips from delivery driversFrom rideshare drivers' perspectives, basing pay on these metrics  leads to unpredictable and variable pay, according to Dubal, who drew on  hundreds of interviews with gig workers themselves.  






Some  ride-hail drivers said the companies they work for are ""gamifying"" work,  manipulating them and forcing them to gamble just to make a living.  ""Algorithmic  wage discrimination allows firms to personalize and differentiate wages  for workers in ways unknown to them, paying them to behave in ways that  the firm desires, perhaps [paying] as little as the system determines  that they may be willing to accept,"" the report reads, in part.  


Amazon spokeswoman Simeone Griffin told CBS MoneyWatch that its ""Flex"" program that lets drivers work only when they want to gives workers ""the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss."" She added that workers' earnings exceed $26 on average per hour worked.Uber did not reply to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. Workers have to ""guess"" their wages And while companies have reams of data on workers, they have little to no insight into how their pay is determined. 


""Given  the information asymmetry between workers and the firm, companies can  calculate the exact wage rates necessary to incentivize desired  behaviors, while workers can only guess as to why they make what they  do,"" the report reads. Dubal added that workers can't count on  their jobs for economic stability or security, and called companies' pay  practices ""deeply predatory."" ""It's like gambling! The house always wins,"" said Ben, one rideshare driver Dubal interviewed.

Another driver for Uber, Domingo, said he had completed 95 of the 96 trips he needed to secure a $100 bonus. Despite being located in a busy part of town, he had to wait 45 minutes to secure his final ride and earn the $100 he'd been counting on to pay for groceries. He believes Uber was baiting him to work longer.  ""It feels like the algorithm is turned against you. There was a night at the end of one of week, if felt like the algorithm was punishing me. I had 95 out of 96 rides for a $100 bonus… it was ten o'clock at night in a popular area. It took me 45 min in a popular area to get that last ride,"" he told Prof. Dubal. ""The algorithm was moving past me to get to people who weren't closer to their bonus. No way to verify that, but that's what it felt like was happening.""  Bringing your boss ""inside your head"" This close workplace monitoring effectively erases a worker's most powerful bargaining tool: The fact that, typically, only they know what wage or salary they're willing to accept for a job.  That's what is most scary about the practice, according to Dubal.  


""A source of power I have is that I know what I am willing to accept, and my employer doesn't know,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch. ""These practices remove that, because they can learn what a worker has been willing to accept in a certain context. They are getting inside your head."" She said that this kind of insight into how workers think, combined with the availability of other information like credit data, or how much a given worker might owe in rent, could lead to ""an extraordinarily controlled economy where the people in control are in the firms and no one else."" It could undo decades of social and labor movements advocating for equal pay for equal work, she added.  ""It's really scary, and this is how you get retrenchment — a rolling back of worker rights — through a new cultural sense of what's OK and what's not OK,"" she said.

Some  ride-hail drivers said the companies they work for are ""gamifying"" work,  manipulating them and forcing them to gamble just to make a living.  ""Algorithmic  wage discrimination allows firms to personalize and differentiate wages  for workers in ways unknown to them, paying them to behave in ways that  the firm desires, perhaps [paying] as little as the system determines  that they may be willing to accept,"" the report reads, in part.  Amazon spokeswoman Simeone Griffin told CBS MoneyWatch that its ""Flex"" program that lets drivers work only when they want to gives workers ""the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss."" She added that workers' earnings exceed $26 on average per hour worked.Uber did not reply to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. Workers have to ""guess"" their wages And while companies have reams of data on workers, they have little to no insight into how their pay is determined. ""Given  the information asymmetry between workers and the firm, companies can  calculate the exact wage rates necessary to incentivize desired  behaviors, while workers can only guess as to why they make what they  do,"" the report reads. Dubal added that workers can't count on  their jobs for economic stability or security, and called companies' pay  practices ""deeply predatory."" ""It's like gambling! The house always wins,"" said Ben, one rideshare driver Dubal interviewed.  Another driver for Uber, Domingo, said he had completed 95 of the 96 trips he needed to secure a $100 bonus. Despite being located in a busy part of town, he had to wait 45 minutes to secure his final ride and earn the $100 he'd been counting on to pay for groceries. He believes Uber was baiting him to work longer.  ""It feels like the algorithm is turned against you. There was a night at the end of one of week, if felt like the algorithm was punishing me. I had 95 out of 96 rides for a $100 bonus… it was ten o'clock at night in a popular area. It took me 45 min in a popular area to get that last ride,"" he told Prof. Dubal. ""The algorithm was moving past me to get to people who weren't closer to their bonus. No way to verify that, but that's what it felt like was happening.""  Bringing your boss ""inside your head"" This close workplace monitoring effectively erases a worker's most powerful bargaining tool: The fact that, typically, only they know what wage or salary they're willing to accept for a job.  That's what is most scary about the practice, according to Dubal.  ""A source of power I have is that I know what I am willing to accept, and my employer doesn't know,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch. ""These practices remove that, because they can learn what a worker has been willing to accept in a certain context. They are getting inside your head."" She said that this kind of insight into how workers think, combined with the availability of other information like credit data, or how much a given worker might owe in rent, could lead to ""an extraordinarily controlled economy where the people in control are in the firms and no one else."" It could undo decades of social and labor movements advocating for equal pay for equal work, she added.  ""It's really scary, and this is how you get retrenchment — a rolling back of worker rights — through a new cultural sense of what's OK and what's not OK,"" she said.
