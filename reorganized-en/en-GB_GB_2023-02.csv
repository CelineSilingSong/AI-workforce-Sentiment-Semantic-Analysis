What is generative AI? Everything you need to know





























By


George Lawton



 
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.
The technology, it should be noted, is not brand-new. Generative AI was introduced in the 1960s in chatbots. But it was not until 2014, with the introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs -- a type of machine learning algorithm -- that generative AI could create convincingly authentic images, videos and audio of real people.







On the one hand, this newfound capability has opened up opportunities that include better movie dubbing and rich educational content. It also unlocked concerns about deepfakes -- digitally forged images or videos -- and harmful cybersecurity attacks on businesses, including nefarious requests that realistically mimic an employee's boss.
Two additional recent advances that will be discussed in more detail below have played a critical part in generative AI going mainstream: transformers and the breakthrough language models they enabled. Transformers are a type of machine learning that made it possible for researchers to train ever-larger models without having to label all of the data in advance. New models could thus be trained on billions of pages of text, resulting in answers with more depth. In addition, transformers unlocked a new notion called attention that enabled models to track the connections between words across pages, chapters and books rather than just in individual sentences. And not just words: Transformers could also use their ability to track connections to analyze code, proteins, chemicals and DNA.
The rapid advances in so-called large language models (LLMs) -- i.e., models with billions or even trillions of parameters -- have opened a new era in which generative AI models can write engaging text, paint photorealistic images and even create somewhat entertaining sitcoms on the fly. Moreover, innovations in multimodal AI enable teams to generate content across multiple types of media, including text, graphics and video. This is the basis for tools like Dall-E that automatically create images from a text description or generate text captions from images.






These breakthroughs notwithstanding, we are still in the early days of using generative AI to create readable text and photorealistic stylized graphics. Early implementations have had issues with accuracy and bias, as well as being prone to hallucinations and spitting back weird answers. Still, progress thus far indicates that the inherent capabilities of this generative AI could fundamentally change enterprise technology how businesses operate. Going forward, this technology could help write code, design new drugs, develop products, redesign business processes and transform supply chains.







How does generative AI work?
Generative AI starts with a prompt that could be in the form of a text, an image, a video, a design, musical notes, or any input that the AI system can process. Various AI algorithms then return new content in response to the prompt. Content can include essays, solutions to problems, or realistic fakes created from pictures or audio of a person.
Early versions of generative AI required submitting data via an API or an otherwise complicated process. Developers had to familiarize themselves with special tools and write applications using languages such as Python.
Now, pioneers in generative AI are developing better user experiences that let you describe a request in plain language. After an initial response, you can also customize the results with feedback about the style, tone and other elements you want the generated content to reflect.








Generative AI models
Generative AI models combine various AI algorithms to represent and process content. For example, to generate text, various natural language processing techniques transform raw characters (e.g., letters, punctuation and words) into sentences, parts of speech, entities and actions, which are represented as vectors using multiple encoding techniques. Similarly, images are transformed into various visual elements, also expressed as vectors. One caution is that these techniques can also encode the biases, racism, deception and puffery contained in the training data.
Once developers settle on a way to represent the world, they apply a particular neural network to generate new content in response to a query or prompt. Techniques such as GANs and variational autoencoders (VAEs) -- neural networks with a decoder and encoder -- are suitable for generating realistic human faces, synthetic data for AI training or even facsimiles of particular humans.
Recent progress in transformers such as Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), OpenAI's GPT and Google AlphaFold have also resulted in neural networks that can not only encode language, images and proteins but also generate new content. 


How neural networks are transforming generative AI
Researchers have been creating AI and other tools for programmatically generating content since the early days of AI. The earliest approaches, known as rule-based systems and later as ""expert systems,"" used explicitly crafted rules for generating responses or data sets.
Neural networks, which form the basis of much of the AI and machine learning applications today, flipped the problem around. Designed to mimic how the human brain works, neural networks ""learn"" the rules from finding patterns in existing data sets. Developed in the 1950s and 1960s, the first neural networks were limited by a lack of computational power and small data sets. It was not until the advent of big data in the mid-2000s and improvements in computer hardware that neural networks became practical for generating content.
The field accelerated when researchers found a way to get neural networks to run in parallel across the graphics processing units (GPUs) that were being used in the computer gaming industry to render video games. New machine learning techniques developed in the past decade, including the aforementioned generative adversarial networks and transformers, have set the stage for the recent remarkable advances in AI-generated content.




What are Dall-E, ChatGPT and Gemini?
ChatGPT, Dall-E and Gemini (formerly Bard) are popular generative AI interfaces.
Dall-E. Trained on a large data set of images and their associated text descriptions, Dall-E is an example of a multimodal AI application that identifies connections across multiple media, such as vision, text and audio. In this case, it connects the meaning of words to visual elements. It was built using OpenAI's GPT implementation in 2021. Dall-E 2, a second, more capable version, was released in 2022. It enables users to generate imagery in multiple styles driven by user prompts.
ChatGPT. The AI-powered chatbot that took the world by storm in November 2022 was built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 implementation. OpenAI has provided a way to interact and fine-tune text responses via a chat interface with interactive feedback. Earlier versions of GPT were only accessible via an API. GPT-4 was released March 14, 2023. ChatGPT incorporates the history of its conversation with a user into its results, simulating a real conversation. After the incredible popularity of the new GPT interface, Microsoft announced a significant new investment into OpenAI and integrated a version of GPT into its Bing search engine.



Here is a snapshot of the differences between ChatGPT and Bard.





Gemini. Google was another early leader in pioneering transformer AI techniques for processing language, proteins and other types of content. It open sourced some of these models for researchers. However, it never released a public interface for these models. Microsoft's decision to implement GPT into Bing drove Google to rush to market a public-facing chatbot, Google Gemini, built on a lightweight version of its LaMDA family of large language models. Google suffered a significant loss in stock price following Gemini's rushed debut after the language model incorrectly said the Webb telescope was the first to discover a planet in a foreign solar system. Meanwhile, Microsoft and ChatGPT implementations also lost face in their early outings due to inaccurate results and erratic behavior. Google has since unveiled a new version of Gemini built on its most advanced LLM, PaLM 2, which allows Gemini to be more efficient and visual in its response to user queries.


What are use cases for generative AI?
Generative AI can be applied in various use cases to generate virtually any kind of content. The technology is becoming more accessible to users of all kinds thanks to cutting-edge breakthroughs like GPT that can be tuned for different applications. Some of the use cases for generative AI include the following:

Implementing chatbots for customer service and technical support.
Deploying deepfakes for mimicking people or even specific individuals.
Improving dubbing for movies and educational content in different languages.
Writing email responses, dating profiles, resumes and term papers.
Creating photorealistic art in a particular style.
Improving product demonstration videos.
Suggesting new drug compounds to test.
Designing physical products and buildings.
Optimizing new chip designs.
Writing music in a specific style or tone.






What are the benefits of generative AI?
Generative AI can be applied extensively across many areas of the business. It can make it easier to interpret and understand existing content and automatically create new content. Developers are exploring ways that generative AI can improve existing workflows, with an eye to adapting workflows entirely to take advantage of the technology. Some of the potential benefits of implementing generative AI include the following:

Automating the manual process of writing content.
Reducing the effort of responding to emails.
Improving the response to specific technical queries.
Creating realistic representations of people.
Summarizing complex information into a coherent narrative.
Simplifying the process of creating content in a particular style.



What are the limitations of generative AI?
Early implementations of generative AI vividly illustrate its many limitations. Some of the challenges generative AI presents result from the specific approaches used to implement particular use cases. For example, a summary of a complex topic is easier to read than an explanation that includes various sources supporting key points. The readability of the summary, however, comes at the expense of a user being able to vet where the information comes from.
Here are some of the limitations to consider when implementing or using a generative AI app:

It does not always identify the source of content.
It can be challenging to assess the bias of original sources.
Realistic-sounding content makes it harder to identify inaccurate information.
It can be difficult to understand how to tune for new circumstances.
Results can gloss over bias, prejudice and hatred.



Attention is all you need: Transformers bring new capability
In 2017, Google reported on a new type of neural network architecture that brought significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy to tasks like natural language processing. The breakthrough approach, called transformers, was based on the concept of attention.
At a high level, attention refers to the mathematical description of how things (e.g., words) relate to, complement and modify each other. The researchers described the architecture in their seminal paper, ""Attention is all you need,"" showing how a transformer neural network was able to translate between English and French with more accuracy and in only a quarter of the training time than other neural nets. The breakthrough technique could also discover relationships, or hidden orders, between other things buried in the data that humans might have been unaware of because they were too complicated to express or discern.
Transformer architecture has evolved rapidly since it was introduced, giving rise to LLMs such as GPT-3 and better pre-training techniques, such as Google's BERT.




What are the concerns surrounding generative AI?
The rise of generative AI is also fueling various concerns. These relate to the quality of results, potential for misuse and abuse, and the potential to disrupt existing business models. Here are some of the specific types of problematic issues posed by the current state of generative AI:

It can provide inaccurate and misleading information.
It is more difficult to trust without knowing the source and provenance of information.
It can promote new kinds of plagiarism that ignore the rights of content creators and artists of original content.
It might disrupt existing business models built around search engine optimization and advertising.
It makes it easier to generate fake news.
It makes it easier to claim that real photographic evidence of a wrongdoing was just an AI-generated fake.
It could impersonate people for more effective social engineering cyber attacks.

Given the newness of GenAI tools and their rapid adoption, enterprises should prepare for the inevitable ""trough of disillusionment"" that's part and parcel of emerging tech by adopting sound AI engineering practices and making responsible AI a cornerstone of their GenAI efforts.



Implementing generative AI is not just about technology. Businesses must also consider its impact on people and processes.







What are some examples of generative AI tools?
Generative AI tools exist for various modalities, such as text, imagery, music, code and voices. Some popular AI content generators to explore include the following:

Text generation tools include GPT, Jasper, AI-Writer and Lex.
Image generation tools include Dall-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.
Music generation tools include Amper, Dadabots and MuseNet.
Code generation tools include CodeStarter, Codex, GitHub Copilot and Tabnine.
Voice synthesis tools include Descript, Listnr and Podcast.ai.
AI chip design tool companies include Synopsys, Cadence, Google and Nvidia.



Use cases for generative AI, by industry
New generative AI technologies have sometimes been described as general-purpose technologies akin to steam power, electricity and computing because they can profoundly affect many industries and use cases. It's essential to keep in mind that, like previous general-purpose technologies, it often took decades for people to find the best way to organize workflows to take advantage of the new approach rather than speeding up small portions of existing workflows. Here are some ways generative AI applications could impact different industries:

Finance can watch transactions in the context of an individual's history to build better fraud detection systems.
Legal firms can use generative AI to design and interpret contracts, analyze evidence and suggest arguments.
Manufacturers can use generative AI to combine data from cameras, X-ray and other metrics to identify defective parts and the root causes more accurately and economically.
Film and media companies can use generative AI to produce content more economically and translate it into other languages with the actors' own voices.
The medical industry can use generative AI to identify promising drug candidates more efficiently.
Architectural firms can use generative AI to design and adapt prototypes more quickly.
Gaming companies can use generative AI to design game content and levels.




Ethics and bias in generative AI
Despite their promise, the new generative AI tools open a can of worms regarding accuracy, trustworthiness, bias, hallucination and plagiarism -- ethical issues that likely will take years to sort out. None of the issues are particularly new to AI. Microsoft's first foray into chatbots in 2016, called Tay, for example, had to be turned off after it started spewing inflammatory rhetoric on Twitter.
What is new is that the latest crop of generative AI apps sounds more coherent on the surface. But this combination of humanlike language and coherence is not synonymous with human intelligence, and there currently is great debate about whether generative AI models can be trained to have reasoning ability. One Google engineer was even fired after publicly declaring the company's generative AI app, Language Models for Dialog Applications (LaMDA), was sentient.
The convincing realism of generative AI content introduces a new set of AI risks. It makes it harder to detect AI-generated content and, more importantly, makes it more difficult to detect when things are wrong. This can be a big problem when we rely on generative AI results to write code or provide medical advice. Many results of generative AI are not transparent, so it is hard to determine if, for example, they infringe on copyrights or if there is problem with the original sources from which they draw results. If you don't know how the AI came to a conclusion, you cannot reason about why it might be wrong.








Generative AI vs. AI
Generative AI focuses on creating new and original content, chat responses, designs, synthetic data or even deepfakes. It's particularly valuable in creative fields and for novel problem-solving, as it can autonomously generate many types of new outputs.
Generative AI, as noted above, relies on neural network techniques such as transformers, GANs and VAEs. Other kinds of AI, in distinction, use techniques including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and reinforcement learning.
Generative AI often starts with a prompt that lets a user or data source submit a starting query or data set to guide content generation. This can be an iterative process to explore content variations. Traditional AI algorithms, on the other hand, often follow a predefined set of rules to process data and produce a result.
Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses depending on the problem to be solved, with generative AI being well-suited for tasks involving NLP and calling for the creation of new content, and traditional algorithms more effective for tasks involving rule-based processing and predetermined outcomes.
Generative AI vs. predictive AI vs. conversational AI
Predictive AI, in distinction to generative AI, uses patterns in historical data to forecast outcomes, classify events and actionable insights. Organizations use predictive AI to sharpen decision-making and develop data-driven strategies.
Conversational AI helps AI systems like virtual assistants, chatbots and customer service apps interact and engage with humans in a natural way. It uses techniques from NLP and machine learning to understand language and provide human-like text or speech responses.


Generative AI history
The Eliza chatbot created by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s was one of the earliest examples of generative AI. These early implementations used a rules-based approach that broke easily due to a limited vocabulary, lack of context and overreliance on patterns, among other shortcomings. Early chatbots were also difficult to customize and extend.
The field saw a resurgence in the wake of advances in neural networks and deep learning in 2010 that enabled the technology to automatically learn to parse existing text, classify image elements and transcribe audio.
Ian Goodfellow introduced GANs in 2014. This deep learning technique provided a novel approach for organizing competing neural networks to generate and then rate content variations. These could generate realistic people, voices, music and text. This inspired interest in -- and fear of -- how generative AI could be used to create realistic deepfakes that impersonate voices and people in videos.
Since then, progress in other neural network techniques and architectures has helped expand generative AI capabilities. Techniques include VAEs, long short-term memory, transformers, diffusion models and neural radiance fields.








Best practices for using generative AI
The best practices for using generative AI will vary depending on the modalities, workflow and desired goals. That said, it is important to consider essential factors such as accuracy, transparency and ease of use in working with generative AI. The following practices help achieve these factors:

Clearly label all generative AI content for users and consumers.
Vet the accuracy of generated content using primary sources where applicable.
Consider how bias might get woven into generated AI results.
Double-check the quality of AI-generated code and content using other tools.
Learn the strengths and limitations of each generative AI tool.
Familiarize yourself with common failure modes in results and work around these.



The future of generative AI
The incredible depth and ease of ChatGPT spurred widespread adoption of generative AI. To be sure, the speedy adoption of generative AI applications has also demonstrated some of the difficulties in rolling out this technology safely and responsibly. But these early implementation issues have inspired research into better tools for detecting AI-generated text, images and video.
Indeed, the popularity of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and Gemini has also fueled an endless variety of training courses at all levels of expertise. Many are aimed at helping developers create AI applications. Others focus more on business users looking to apply the new technology across the enterprise. At some point, industry and society will also build better tools for tracking the provenance of information to create more trustworthy AI.
Generative AI will continue to evolve, making advancements in translation, drug discovery, anomaly detection and the generation of new content, from text and video to fashion design and music. As good as these new one-off tools are, the most significant impact of generative AI in the future will come from integrating these capabilities directly into the tools we already use.
Grammar checkers, for example, will get better. Design tools will seamlessly embed more useful recommendations directly into our workflows. Training tools will be able to automatically identify best practices in one part of an organization to help train other employees more efficiently. These are just a fraction of the ways generative AI will change what we do in the near-term.
What the impact of generative AI will be in the future is hard to say. But as we continue to harness these tools to automate and augment human tasks, we will inevitably find ourselves having to reevaluate the nature and value of human expertise.



Generative AI will find its way into many business functions.

In 1993, the American science fiction writer and computer scientist Vernor Vinge posited that in 30 years, we would have the technological ability to create a ""superhuman intelligence"" -- an AI that is more intelligent than humans -- after which the human era would end. AI pioneer Ray Kurzweil predicted such a ""singularity"" by 2045.
Many other AI experts think it could be much further off. Robot pioneer Rodney Brooks predicted that AI will not gain the sentience of a 6-year-old in his lifetime but could seem as intelligent and attentive as a dog by 2048.

of excitement and anticipation. Having just attended what was claimed to be the
first-ever conference on generative artificial intelligence (AI)1, I was left
with a powerful impression of what the future may hold. Thanks to our venture
capital investments I always felt like I have a kind of crystal ball. This is
because innovation that is driven by cutting-edge startups can provide a glimpse
into the future.

This time, it felt no different. In this opinion piece, I share my thoughts on
generative AI and how I expect it to impact individuals, businesses and society
as a whole.


HOW BIG WILL THIS DISRUPTION BE?

As I look at the current state of generative AI, particularly the likes of
OpenAI’s ChatGPT, I can't help but think of its potential for innovation and
disruption on a scale comparable to the introduction of email, the internet, and
the smartphone. And it's not just the magnitude of this innovation that's
remarkable, but also the speed at which it's being adopted. A UBS study based on
Similarweb data ranks ChatGPT as the first product or service to have reached
100 million active users within two months after launch.

Chat-based AI interfaces are already challenging traditional search methods.
They may completely replace them. What’s more, personalised chats with AI tools
have the potential to at least partially substitute traditional content formats
like articles, books and videos. As we enter this new era of generative AI, it
seems to me that companies like OpenAI, Google’s LaMDA and others have the
potential to become new ""AI operating systems"" that power a range of new
services and that help to create new companies. I see this as comparable to how
the smartphone enabled the likes of Uber and WhatsApp.


WILL GENERATIVE AI SOON BE EVERYWHERE?

I expect generative AI to quickly become ubiquitous.

Text generation based on Large Language Models (LLMs) – like OpenAI’s GPT – is
becoming available within many types of apps, from internet browsers2 to office
tools like Microsoft 3653, to software development tools4.

I anticipate that the integration of existing software interfaces – so-called
application programming interface (APIs) – into AI tools, will further enhance
their overall capabilities. It doesn’t take much imagination to also visualise
speech-to-speech interfaces with chat-based AI tools. And it is entirely
possible that these interfaces will start to exhibit empathy and emotions
(without being sentient), at least for some applications. In my view, it is
therefore only a matter of time before it will become increasingly difficult to
distinguish a conversation with an intelligent chatbot from a discussion with a
person.

Powerful generative AI tools for images (like OpenAI’s Dall-E – which produced
the image, above5 – and Stability.AI’s Stable Diffusion) are spreading fast,
with the latter already available in Adobe Photoshop through a plug-in.

Leading firms in the industry have already launched or announced prototypes of
AI tools for other types of media, including video and music.


HOW WILL THIS TYPE OF AI CHANGE HOW WE WORK?

With the rapid progress in this field, it is my personal view that Generative AI
has the potential to fundamentally transform the way many people work. This is
an idea that may excite some. Others might wonder what this means for them.
Individuals whose jobs involve listening, speaking, writing, typing, or reading
(which includes most people working in an office) may experience significant
changes.

ChatGPT illustrates how people can interact with an AI tool. The same approach
can be applied everywhere else: instead of opening an empty presentation or an
empty text document, generative AI can help to fill those documents with content
from the start. Beautiful.ai’s DesignerBot is a prototype of this. In the
future, users will be able to prompt the AI to change those documents
iteratively and in real-time – in the same way as someone prompts ChatGPT to
alter a text that it has generated.

I see this rapid fire trial-and-error approach becoming the main way how we will
create things in the future. Picture an architect adding the command “add a
bathroom”. Something similar could work for music, videos, coding, website and
product design – resulting in greater speed, creativity and quality.

Tools like ChatGPT will not only change how we work, but they will also give new
opportunities to all of us. They will make it easier to create something. And
they will lower the entry barriers to launching and creating a business.


WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES OF GENERATIVE AI?

While known as generative AI, these tools are capable of much more than
generating content from a short prompt. ChatGPT, for example, can generate text
in various forms. It can create outline for presentations, it can create books,
white papers, essays, speeches and even poems. ChatGPT can also find errors in
text, summarise it, complete or rewrite it, or change its style. It can make
text easier to understand. It can translate text into multiple languages. It can
extract information from text, classify text and analyse its sentiment – all of
which can be very useful as input for other applications. It can find errors in
computer code and it can complete it. The list goes on.

Other AI tools are or will soon be able to do similar things for images, music
and videos. What I find particularly interesting is that the openendedness of
generative AI models means that some of their capabilities are only discovered
months or years after they were launched.


WHAT ABOUT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THOSE TOOLS?

As I reflect on some of the criticisms of today's AI tools, I am reminded of the
early days of other breakthrough technologies. From the Apple II to Windows 1.0,
from AOL to my first Nokia phone, these products all had their share of
shortcomings. But what the history of technology has repeatedly shown us is that
exponential progress leads to unforeseen improvements in products and services.
I firmly believe that the same will be true for the most pressing issues facing
today's Generative AI.

Of course, there are valid concerns to be addressed, such as the potential for
so-called hallucinations. These are machine answers that appear to be true but
are not. There is also the issue of the black-box nature of these systems: it is
often difficult or impossible to make transparent how an AI tool came to the
results it provided.

There are some missing capabilities, such the inability of some AI chatbots to
reliably do calculations. And there is risk of harmful, biased or inappropriate
behaviour which must be scrutinised: who determines the parameters of the AI?
And to what end? Moreover, the limitations of the data used to train these
models, the energy consumption required to power neural networks, and the
regulatory, legal and ethical questions surrounding this new technology6 cannot
be ignored. Yet, from my vantage point, many industry participants are already
taking steps to mitigate these concerns. I expect the growing attention and
investment that the generative AI industry is attracting to further accelerate
progress in this field.

Nevertheless, generative AI tools do have some notable shortcomings that I
expect to persist for a long time. These tools lack an understanding of content
and the ability to reason or to exhibit intuition like humans. Despite their
power, they are still trained for relatively narrow tasks. I am convinced that
progress will be made, and machines will eventually achieve general artificial
intelligence, but this point in time is likely still several decades away.


WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT ON THE JOB MARKET?

As someone with a background in economics, I am acutely attuned to the potential
impact of emerging technologies on the job market. The rise of generative AI is
no exception.

On one hand, there is no denying that this technology has the potential to
significantly increase productivity and reduce costs in industries where
automation is feasible. This could result in job losses or, at the very least,
fewer new jobs created in those sectors. On the other hand, it's worth
considering that lower prices resulting from the use of generative AI could lead
to increased access to related products and services for consumers from all
walks of life and across various industries (e.g. for education and healthcare),
which could drive up production volumes and ultimately lead to more job
opportunities.

Generative AI may lead to deflation in industries that can be further automated.
However, as most central banks are unlikely to allow deflation to occur for the
overall economy, this could ultimately result in a price increase for those
goods and services that do not benefit from AI-based automation. This, in turn,
could prompt a re-evaluation of roles that require uniquely human skills, such
as empathy, intuition, and critical thinking, or that are simply too important
to be automated.

My optimistic inclination leads me to believe that these dynamics will help to
dampen job losses in industries that permit automation and will create new jobs
in others. However, the future is unpredictable, and the short and long-term
effects of emerging technologies on the job market remain ambiguous.


IS THIS THE PEAK OF A HYPE CYCLE?

The current buzz surrounding ChatGPT and its explosive adoption appears to be
following the familiar pattern of the so-called hype cycle that I have observed
with other disruptive technologies. I do not believe that we have reached the
peak of the initial hype yet, as I anticipate the rapid pace of developments in
generative AI to continue. And it is only a matter of weeks since ChatGPT was
launched to the public. When this hype cycle inevitably subsides at some point,
I expect that some doubts will arise regarding the potential of this technology.
Nevertheless, I have learned from past disruptions that it's crucial to look
through the ups and downs of the hype cycle and to focus on the mid to long-term
impact that a new technology such as generative AI will have.


WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT ON SOCIETY?

I am cautiously optimistic for the short and mid-term adoption of generative AI,
but I cannot ignore the significant unknowns we face as a society regarding its
longer-term implications. My personal crystal ball leaves me with many important
questions, such as: will the widespread use of generative AI ultimately foster
greater creativity and intelligence, or will it stifle them? Will it enable
better knowledge sharing or fuel rampant misinformation?

Most significantly, will it mitigate social inequality, or will it exacerbate
the concentration of power and wealth among a select few? In my view, the
answers to these questions are not predetermined; rather, they will be shaped by
the choices we make as a society about how we use these powerful new tools.


A CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC CONCLUSION

I believe that the rapid development of generative AI is poised to revolutionise
our lives, and in particular our professional lives, in ways we cannot yet fully
imagine. This will create new opportunities for many people around the world.
The economist in me recognises the potential for both disruption and opportunity
in the job market. And the technologist in me is fully cognizant of the risks
and the potential of this new technology. Overall, I am cautiously optimistic
that existing concerns can be effectively addressed, and that generative AI will
have a significant and positive transformative impact on society as long as it
is approached responsibly. This is the responsibility of all of us as society.
And it is our responsibility as investors in companies that create and apply
this new technology.

Nick holds an MS in Management from Troy University and has earned several professional analytics certificates, including from the Wharton School. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  DHL is a German logistics company that offers parcel delivery, express mail, freight forwarding, and third-party logistics. Its parent company is Deutsche Post (‘DPDHL’), the world’s largest logistics enterprise, operating in over 220 countries and employing more than 510,000 people worldwide.  All company financials are provided by DPDHL. In its 2021 annual report, DPDHL reported a pre-tax profit (EBIT) of approximately $8 billion on almost $82 billion in revenue. Deutsche Post has a market capitalization of $52.18 billion Euro (≅$53.16 billion USD). The company is traded on the German stock exchange (symbol: DPSGY). Since 2015, the company has made significant investments in AI vendors including for   $300 million in 2018 for several applications focused on robotics and augmented reality in the internet of things (“IoT”). The company also made a $15 million investment in Boston Dynamics earlier this year. A recent LinkedIn search lists 507 data scientists currently employed at the company. This article will examine how DHL’s use of AI supports its business goals is exemplified through two specific use cases: Optimizing order fulfillment: DHL uses machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to help e-retailers optimize route selection and staff allocation. Aligning workforce skills: DHL uses skills graphs enabled with natural language processing to match needed skills to people, learning content and job roles. Let’s first examine how DHL built an AI-powered solution to optimize the company’s route selection and allocation of its workforce. Use Case #1: Optimizing Order Fulfillment According to DHL, the COVID pandemic lead to a steady increase in online sales, creating a problem both for electronic retailers (or “e-tailers”) and logistics companies. Household staple items like food, drugstore items, and medications were in particular demand, creating supply bottlenecks.  To overcome these difficulties, DHL Supply Chain tasked its data team with developing and adding newer forecasting and analysis algorithms to its Resilience360 platform (now Everstream, a DHL subsidiary).  The stated purpose of the algorithms was to “optimize warehousing and processing of online orders for major e-sellers.” The company wanted to eliminate some of the inherent uncertainty that comes with demand fluctuations. DHL did not provide information on how the software was trained. However, given the purpose of the software to anticipate product demand fluctuations and optimize manpower, we can extrapolate on likely outcomes. First, the training data probably consisted of vast amounts of individual product orders and their associated data. These may have included SKU, quantity, etc. Second, the logistical element of the algorithm would have mandated product tracking and workforce data. Workforce information would have required data such as the number of employees, locations, days and times worked, and their roles and locations. The company states that the model data is collected via numerous input devices, including sensors and robots. The data is then centralized into warehouse management systems (WMS) and transportation management systems (TMS). The data is then analyzed with ML algorithms. If the software detects potential insights and optimizations, the user is alerted to the actionable data via a notification system built into the software’s dashboard. The following two-and-a-half minute video describes how the Resilience360 platform works:   DHL states that the software is compatible with most WMS systems and can be integrated into existing IT infrastructure. DHL claims that its algorithms have helped to improve the decision-making and order-picking processes of its customers. Regarding business outcomes, the company claims that its new algorithm has reduced the travel distance of warehouse employees by 50 percent and increased the productivity of “individual DHL locations” by up to 30 percent.  Use Case #2: Aligning Workforce Skills DHL wanted an automated solution that could identify skills the company would need in the future and prepare its workforce to transition to related roles. Cornerstone, DHL’s partner on the project, states that its client wanted an AI-enabled solution capable of “identifying the skills currently in the team today and uncovering potential skills that are relevant to tomorrow.” In the following brief, 8-minute video below, Cornerstone Chief International Officer explains the benefits of the Conerstone OnDemand platform in aligning workforce skills for global brands:  The challenge, Cornerstone states, was two-fold. First, the manual curation of an internal talent pool is both time-consuming and difficult to scale. Such a solution would also be quickly outdated.  Second, the geographical distribution of DHL’s workforce made connecting to workers and offering traditional training difficult. Cornerstone states that the solution was an AI-powered skills engine capable of: Identifying skills within the organization Matching internal workers to jobs requiring said skills Pinpoint the potential skills gaps Suggest training modules to account for skills gaps A Cornerstone case study report describes the functionality of their tool to facilitate lateral and aspirational skills transfer. AI recommendations based on deeper insights into their working experience mean more fulfilling roles for “airside handlers” and warehouse supervisors. “Once the skills are out on the table,” reads the report, “the employee [can] choose what they’d like to develop in order to move up or across into a new career path, opening up many possibilities and mapping out their future with the company.”  Cornerstone states that the key element to DHL’s solution was their Skills Graph/Skills Ontology software. Cornerstone claims that the skills graph software platform  helps each employee develop individual skills profiles using their job title and resume, using  natural language processing to analyze employees’ resumes and identify current skills. The case report goes on to claim that algorithms score each candidate’s current skillset against a skills taxonomy for open jobs within the company. The company claims that its model collects taxonomy data from over 250 million external job profiles across a variety of industries and organization sizes. The software produces an individualized profile for each candidate identifying any skill gaps and recommends associated learning content. The recommendations are made available to both the employee and supervisors.   Employee Skill Development Progress and Suggested Skills. (Source: Cornerstone) Armed with that data, the employee is able to work on suggested training to upskill. The supervisor is able to monitor the employee’s training progress. Concerning the results of its solution, Cornerstone claims that it was able to save DHL more than 10% in recruiting costs, equivalent to “millions of dollars.” Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at DocuSign - Two Current Use-CasesDocuSign is an American company that provides digitized document management services.

At next month’s GTC, Nvidia’s annual AI conference targeting over 3.5 million developers working on its platform, founder and CEO Jensen Huang will invite Ilya Sutskever, cofounder and chief scientist at OpenAI, onto the stage for a fireside chat.
The conversation will certainly send a symbolic message that Nvidia has no intention of ceding its AI dominance — which began when the hardware and software company helped power the deep learning “revolution” of a decade ago. And Nvidia shows few signs of losing its lead as generative AI explodes with tools like ChatGPT.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
After all, Nvidia supplied the technology of the early pioneers. Sutskever, along with Alex Krizhevsky and their Ph.D. supervisor Geoffrey Hinton, created AlexNet, the pioneering neural network for computer vision that won the ImageNet competition in October 2012. The winning paper, which showed that the model achieved image-recognition accuracy never before seen, directly led to the next decade’s major AI success stories — everything from Google Photos, Google Translate and Uber to Alexa and AlphaFold.
According to Hinton, AlexNet would not have happened without Nvidia. Thanks to their parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, Nvidia’s GPUs — which were created in 1999 for ultrafast 3D graphics in PC video games, but had begun to be optimized for general computing operations — turned out to be perfect for running deep learning algorithms. 
“In 2009, I remember giving a talk at NIPS [now NeurIPS] where I told about 1,000 researchers they should all buy GPUs because GPUs are going to be the future of machine learning,” Hinton told VentureBeat last fall. 
However, Sutskever also represents the 2023 AI hype explosion, as large language models like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2  have launched generative AI into the public’s consciousness in a way not seen, perhaps, since the dawn of the iPhone in 2007. 
This, too, would not have been possible without Nvidia. Today’s massive generative AI models require thousands of GPUs to run — and Nvidia holds about 88% of the GPU market, according to John Peddie Research. In fact, OpenAI reportedly used 10,000 Nvidia GPUs to train ChatGPT.
Many see the 30-year-old Nvidia as the biggest potential winner in the red-hot generative AI space. In fact, the generative AI frenzy sent Nvidia’s share price soaring in January.
Citi, for example, estimated that ChatGPT usage could result in $3 billion to $11 billion in sales for Nvidia over 12 months. And last month, Altimeter’s Brad Gerstner told CNBC that Nvidia is “the beating heart of the AI supercycle.” 
On a 4th quarter earnings call with analysts yesterday — on which the company reported increased revenue in its data center business, including AI chips —  Nvidia’s Huang agreed. 
AI is at an “inflection point,” he said, which is leading to more businesses buying more Nvidia chips to develop ML software. 
“Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies,” Huang said.
How long can Nvidia’s AI dominance last? 
The question is, how long can Nvidia sustain its AI dominance? Will anyone catch up and topple it off its AI perch? Not anytime soon, say experts. 
These days, Nvidia is synonymous with AI, says Gartner analyst Chirag Dekate. advertisement
“It is not just a GPU computing company, it’s basically an AI supercomputing company,” he explained. “Nvidia has had a complete freedom of the AI landscape, they have taken advantage of really sharp, business-savvy investments and focused approaches that basically enable them to dominate their market.”
Nvidia won’t have free rein forever — chip competitors like AMD and Google are nipping at their heels, for one thing, while geopolitical forces hover ominously. (With the United States’ latest chip export control, state-of-the-art GPUs like Nvidia’s A100 and H100 can no longer be sold to China, for example.) 
But Nvidia’s famed platform strategy and software-focused approach is still very, very hard to beat, experts say. 
“While other players offer chips and/or systems, Nvidia has built a strong ecosystem that includes the chips, associated hardware and a full stable of software and development systems that are optimized for their chips and systems,” analyst Jack Gold wrote for VentureBeat last September. advertisement
Nathan Benaich, founder and general partner of Air Street Capital, pointed out that Nvidia has also been “very nimble” with integrating new capabilities into its system. Other AI chip startups have under-invested in software tooling, so while they have created cloud computing platforms that may be faster or cheaper than Nvidia’s, they “don’t come with a commensurate improvement in the current programming experience.”
Ultimately, he told VentureBeat, the AI game “is Nvidia’s to lose.” 
And Nvidia clearly has no intention of losing. 
“We know we have the best combined hardware and software platform for being the most efficient at generative AI,” Manuvir Das, VP of enterprise computing at Nvidia, told VentureBeat. But, he added. “We constantly operate with the motto that we have no advantage — and nobody is going to outwork us or out-innovate.”

GPU + CUDA changed the game for AI
Jensen Huang always knew his graphics chips had more potential than just powering the latest video games, but he didn’t anticipate the shift to deep learning, according to a 2016 Forbes interview.
In fact, the success of Nvidia’s GPUs for deep neural networks was “a bizarre, lucky coincidence,” said Sara Hooker, whose 2020 essay “The Hardware Lottery” explored the reasons why various hardware tools succeeded and failed. 
Nvidia’s success was like “winning the lottery,” she told VentureBeat last year. Much of it depended upon the “right moment of alignment between progress on the hardware side and progress on the modeling side.” The change, she added, was almost instantaneous. “Overnight, what took 13,000 CPUs overnight took two GPUs,” she said. “That was how dramatic it was.” 
Nvidia doesn’t agree with that assessment, however. The company maintains that Nvidia was aware of the potential for GPUs to accelerate neural networks from the mid-2000s, even if they didn’t know that AI was going to be the most important market. 
“We did know that the world’s most important problems needed accelerated computing,” said a Nvidia spokesperson. “So we invested heavily in building CUDA [compute unified device architecture] from top to bottom, putting general purpose acceleration into the hands of millions of developers. Adding CUDA to every GPU Nvidia makes was a huge bet.”
The CUDA compute platform, which Nvidia added in 2007, is the software and middleware stack that allows researchers to program and access the compute power and extreme parallelism that GPUs can enable. And the deep learning revolution wouldn’t have happened, experts both inside and outside of Nvidia emphasize, if Nvidia had not added CUDA to the mix in 2007.
Before Nvidia released CUDA, programming a GPU was a long and arduous coding process that required writing a great deal of low-level machine code. Using CUDA — which was free — researchers could develop their deep learning models much more quickly and cheaply. On Nvidia’s hardware, of course. 
CUDA, Jensen Huang told Ben Thompson in a March 2022 Stratechery interview, “made GPUs accessible, and because we dedicated ourselves to keeping every generation of processors CUDA-compatible, we invented a new programming model.” 
Jensen Huang’s big bet on AI
But six years after CUDA was released, Nvidia was still not yet “all in” on AI. 
Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at Nvidia, pointed out that when AlexNet was published and other researchers were tinkering with GPUs, “there really wasn’t anybody at Nvidia working on AI.” 

Bryan Catanzaro (photo by Nvidia)
Except Catanzaro, that is. At the time, he explained, he was collaborating with Andrew Ng at Stanford on a “little project where we replaced 1,000 servers at Google with three servers using GPUs and a bunch of CUDA kernels that the team wrote.” He was also talking during that period with the NYU AI Lab’s Yann LeCun (now head of AI research at Meta), and Rob Fergus (now a research scientist at DeepMind).  
“Fergus was telling me, ‘It’s crazy how many machine learning researchers are spending time writing kernels for the GPU — you should really look into that,’” he said.
Cantanzaro did look into it. Customers were starting to buy large numbers of GPUs for deep learning. Eventually Huang and others at Nvidia took note too.
By 2014 Huang was fully on board with the AI mission. While his 2013 GTC keynote barely mentioned AI, it was suddenly front and center during his 2014 keynote. Machine learning is “one of the most exciting applications in high-performance computing today,” he said. “One of the areas that has seen exciting breakthroughs, enormous breakthroughs, magical breakthroughs, is an area called deep neural nets.” 
Catanzaro pointed out that as founder of the firm, Huang had the authority to “turn the company on a dime, he just pounced on it,” realizing that “AI is the future of this company, and we’re gonna bet everything on it.” 
Nvidia’s software-focused platform strategy
The ImageNet moment of 2012 involved a few researchers and a GPU. But this was just the first milestone, according to Kari Briski, VP of product management, AI software at Nvidia. 
The next challenge was how to make the power of GPUs scale: “We worked on software to make sure that the GPUs could communicate together, so we went from a single GPU to multi-GPU and multinode,” Briski said.

For the past seven years, Nvidia has focused on building deep learning software in libraries and frameworks that abstract the need to have to code in CUDA. It puts CUDA-accelerated libraries, like cuDNN, into more widely used Python-based libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
“You can now scale to hundreds and thousands of GPUs all talking to each other to get that neural network,” said Briski. “It went from months of training to weeks — today it takes seconds to train that same neural network.”
In addition, by 2018 GPUs were used not just for AI training, but for inference, too — to support capabilities in speech recognition, natural language processing, recommender systems and image recognition. That meant not just more hardware, like Nvidia’s T4 chip, but more software to fuel these real-time inference workloads in the data center and in automotive applications, as well as in robots and drones. 
As a result, Nvidia has become more of a software company than a hardware company, said Nvidia’s Das. The company hired more and more software engineers and researchers and built the research division to be the state of the art of AI. 
“We started building up all these pieces of software, one use case after another,” he said. As standards and frameworks began to evolve, like TensorFlow and PyTorch for training, Nvidia optimized them for GPUs. “We became AI developers and really embraced the ecosystem,” he added. 
At Nvidia’s 2022 GTC Analyst/Investor Conference, Huang made the company’s ongoing software and platform focus very clear, including a shout-out to the AI Enterprise Software Suite, which had launched the previous year. 
“The important thing about our software is that it’s built on top of our platform,” he said. “It means that it activates all of Nvidia’s hardware chips and system platforms. And secondarily, the software that we do is industry-defining software. We’ve now finally produced a product that an enterprise can license. They’ve been asking for it … they can’t just go to open source, and download all the stuff, and make it work for their enterprise. No more than they could go to Linux, download open-source software, and run a multibillion-dollar company with it.”
The consequence of the platform approach is that anytime a customer buys from Nvidia, they’re not just buying the software, but buying into the Nvidia value chain.
That was another key pillar to Nvidia’s strategy, explained Gartner’s Dekate. With the GPU and CUDA, and Nvidia’s channel strategy, which surrounded customers with options and sourcing that customers are most familiar with, it created an ecosystem growth flywheel.
“Nvidia does not have to try and convince enterprise end users directly,” he said. “End users can use technologies they are familiar with but still turn the crank on Nvidia.”
Nvidia’s AI headwinds are gentle — for now
In the late 2010s, AI chip startups began making waves, from Graphcore and Cerebras to SambaNova. 
Analyst Karl Freund recalled that at the time, the prevailing wisdom was that since the startups were designing chips specifically for AI, they would be better than Nvidia’s.
“That didn’t turn out to be the case,” he said. “Nvidia was able to innovate both in their hardware and software to keep their lead.” 
That being said, their lead has diminished — Habana Labs, owned by Intel, had really good results on their Habana Gaudi2 chip, Freund pointed out, while Google’s TPU4 “looks really good and is competitive with the A100.” 
But Nvidia has the H100 in the wings, which everyone is anxiously waiting to ship in production volumes. The new Hopper H100 chip uses a new architecture designed to be the engine for massively scalable AI infrastructure. It includes a new component called the Transformer Engine that’s specifically optimized for training and inference of the transformer layer, which is the building block of GPT (ChatGPT, for example, is a generative pretrained Transformer). 
In addition, even if CUDA’s current competitive moat is challenged, Nvidia is also replacing it with its latest higher-level, use-case specific software — such as AI for healthcare and AI for digital twins/omniverse.
Finally, even if all the competitive trends started materializing in the second half of this year, they would not have a material impact on Nvidia revenues until 2024. Even then, Freund estimated that all competitors combined could get just 10% of the market. 
Still, Gartner’s Dekate insists that Nvidia no longer has the clean playing field they once had, that allowed them to dominate the marketplace. That development includes an increased number of customer options, which allows end users to, at the very least, drive pricing advantage in their favor. 
Also, with some Chinese vendors having to do without access to Nvidia GPUs, they will try to accelerate competitive technology, he predicted.
Nvidia’s Briski brushes off concerns. “We’ve had headwinds before,” she said. “I think that we’re always challenged to be on our toes, to never feel sort of comfortable.” 
In any case, Huang has maintained that it’s tough for competitors to come into the AI market and create a solution that works, isn’t too complicated, and uses the software developers want.
Nvidia’s Huang seen as AI visionary — who keeps the pressure on
Over the years, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, well-known for his leather jacket atop a black silicon valley uniform, has been described as everything from “flamboyant” and a “superstar” to, occasionally, a jokester and “the next Steve Jobs.”

But, inevitably, any discussion about Nvidia’s AI success turns to Huang.
Nvidia’s Das joined the company from Microsoft in 2019. He says he had many conversations with Huang over a period of nine months before accepting the position.
“I joined Nvidia to work for Jensen because he just blew my mind in all these conversations … that there could be a person like that, who could think like that, who can actually operate like that,” Das said. 
Analyst Freund emphasized that Huang “is an amazing driver of that company” and added that Nvidia does not have a lot of organizational layers, because Huang doesn’t like to have a lot of layers between him and the people doing the engineering work and the science work. 
That said, Huang is also demanding, he added. “When I worked at AMD, a lot of my graphics engineers were renegades from Nvidia,” said Freund. “They left Nvidia because they couldn’t handle the pressure.” 
Nvidia’s generative AI opportunity
Catanzaro left Nvidia in 2014 to work at Baidu with Andrew Ng, but returned to Nvidia in 2016 to head a new lab focused on applied deep learning research. At the time, he was the only member. Seven years later, he leads a team of 40 researchers.
Nvidia’s accelerated computing business, he said, requires his team to conceive of each entire application as an optimized whole. 
“We don’t outsource any of that responsibility,” he said. Nvidia, he explained, tackles entire problems from top to bottom, from chips to applications, algorithms, libraries, compiler framework and interconnected data center architecture. Its researchers have the freedom to really push acceleration “far beyond what we could do if we limited ourselves to thinking about just one part of that stack.” 
And with the new era of ChatGPT, Nvidia can push even further, he added. 
“Companies are going to be really pushing on the application of AI to lots of different problems,” he said. “That, of course, makes my job even more exciting — I feel like applied research is the hottest place to be right now.” 
Huang, too, has weighed in on the transformative moment of ChatGPT. “This is the iPhone moment of artificial intelligence,” he said at a recent Q&A at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. “This is the time when all those ideas within mobile computing and all that, it all came together in a product that everyone kinda [says], I see it, I see it.”
Nvidia is well-prepared for the generative AI opportunity, said Das. “For those who have been working on it for years, we’ve sort of anticipated this,” he said. “We’ve been working on training large language models and we know what they’re capable of.” 
Nvidia is in an AI sweet spot 
Since AlexNet in 2012, Nvidia’s AI journey has always been about taking advantage of opportunities that opened up — even if, in the case of GPUs, it was unexpected. 
So with the 2023 GTC just a month away — which will include more than 65 sessions focused on generative AI — Nvidia is undoubtedly in a sweet spot. Just as the company’s GPU was at the center of powering the deep learning revolution of a decade ago, Nvidia’s hardware and software are running behind the scenes of today’s GPU-hungry, hyped-up generative AI technology.
And it seems like no matter which companies come out on top — Google? Microsoft? OpenAI? — Nvidia, who supplies them all, will win big.

 As technology advances rapidly, the fear of job loss due to automation has become a reality for many workers across industries. While some jobs are more susceptible to being replaced by AI than others, it's important to understand which roles are most at risk and how workers can adapt. 






 Multiple jobs have already started to see the impact of AI, such as writing, social media management, and graphic design. By examining these roles, we hope to shed light on the current state of AI in the workforce. 


 1. Graphic Designing 
    

 AI has come a long way in recent years, making significant strides in various industries, including graphic design. AI-powered tools can create designs in real-time that are aesthetically pleasing. 

 This technology analyzes user preferences, brand guidelines, and design trends, providing designers with an efficient way to get their work done quickly. AI-powered tools like Adobe Spark and Canva create stunning graphics with minimal effort. The algorithms also analyze designs and recommend changes to create something aligned with industry standards. 





 You can also use AI text-to-art generators to create multiple images within seconds. Companies can save costs by hiring fewer designers and getting faster outputs. It is also a cost-effective alternative for smaller businesses that may not have the resources to hire a team of designers. 



 2. Writing, Editing, and Proofreading 
    

 Artificial intelligence has made remarkable advancements in the field of writing as well. With its ability to understand different languages, AI is now capable of replacing human writers, editors, and proofreaders in many ways. 

 Different AI writing tools, such as automated content generators and language translation software, use algorithms and machine learning to create written content. These tools can produce articles, blog posts, and even books with remarkable speed and accuracy. 





 The technology behind these tools is constantly improving and creating complex and nuanced writing. While some believe AI can never replace human writing, its content can be highly informative and well-structured. This makes it a useful tool for organizations requiring a large amount of written content that is otherwise difficult to manage with several writers and editors. 



 3. Accounts & Bookkeeping 
    

 AI has the power to change accounting and bookkeeping. It can do jobs like entering data and analyzing numbers quickly and accurately. Banks are a great example of organizations using AI in their accounts. Accounting and bookkeeping require precision and minimal room for error, both of which can be achieved using AI. 





 AI can take on simple tasks that junior accountants usually do, letting experienced professionals handle the complicated ones. It can process data without errors, making work more accurate and reducing the risk of fraud. The main reasons for introducing AI in accounts and bookkeeping is their ability to process faster, make fewer errors and ensure accuracy. Also, let’s not forget how it eliminates paper waste. 

 AI can dig past information to find trends and patterns, giving businesses useful information to make decisions. As AI keeps getting better, it can become even more useful for accounting and bookkeeping, ultimately depriving humans of their jobs. Examples of AI software in accounting are QuickBooks, Xero, and Zoho Books. 



 4. Consultancy 
    





 Because of its ability to track, trace and examine information, AI is a threat to those doing consultancy. You can program AI to analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and make recommendations based on that information. 

 For example, it can provide insights into customer behavior, market trends, and product performance. This enables organizations to make informed decisions and save time and resources. While AI may not completely replace human consultants, it certainly can augment their work. 



 5. Social Media Managing 
    

 Social media is the trending face of progressive businesses, and AI can automate several tasks performed by social media managers. 






 For instance, AI algorithms can assist in scheduling posts, creating and optimizing content, analyzing data and metrics, and monitoring customer engagement on various platforms. 

 It helps content creators save time and bring consistency without much effort. AI tools track the performance of social media campaigns and make data-driven decisions to improve their impact. They also identify the most effective time to post, the best types of content to share, and the target audience to reach. 

 With these exceptional abilities, AI has the potential to significantly increase the reach of social media accounts, making it easier and more effective than ever. There are several AI-powered social media management tools like AgoraPulse, Sprout Social, and Buffer to manage social media accounts efficiently. 

 This can save a significant amount of time and resources that social media managers would otherwise spend on these tasks manually. Moreover, AI can bring consistency and efficiency to social media management. 







 6. Research Analysis 
    

 Research analysis is the process of understanding data to make good decisions. Artificial intelligence also holds the ability to automate tasks that human research analysts once performed. AI uses algorithms and machine learning to understand trends and make better predictions than humans. 

 It processes vast amounts of information much faster than humans, making it ideal for research and analysis. However, this does not necessarily mean that AI will replace all research and analysis jobs. Some tasks still require human interpretation, creativity & critical thinking. 






 As AI continues to advance, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in research analysis, making some aspects of the job easier and more efficient. Software such as KNIME, TensorFlow, and IBM Watson Studio are renowned for research analysis. 



 7. Telemarketing 
    

 Artificial intelligence can replace telemarketing jobs by automating certain tasks, such as making calls and sending out pre-written scripts. AI software can be programmed to have conversations with customers and gather information. 

 Businesses can install cold-calling software to reduce the need for human telemarketers. It is important to note that AI is not yet advanced enough to completely replace human telemarketers. 






 AI cannot understand custom issues and offer complex problem-solving and emotional intelligence. Such issues require human interaction. In the future, AI may take on more responsibilities in telemarketing, but for now, it is just a tool that can assist telemarketers. 



 AI Is Taking Over Jobs Rapidly 
 AI is growing and taking over various tasks. There are several jobs that may be replaced by AI. But that doesn't mean you should consider AI a threat to your job. 

 Think of AI as a tool to help you do your work more efficiently, instead of as a threat. We can benefit from AI working alongside the human brain in making work faster and more effective.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly used at work to enhance productivity, improve decision making and reduce costs, including automating administrative tasks and monitoring security.
But sharing your workplace with AI poses unique challenges, including the question – can we trust the technology? 
Our new, 17-country study involving over 17,000 people reveals how much and in what ways we trust AI in the workplace, how we view the risks and benefits, and what is expected for AI to be trusted. 
We find that only one in two employees are willing to trust AI at work. Their attitude depends on their role, what country they live in, and what the AI is used for. However, people across the globe are nearly unanimous in their expectations of what needs to be in place for AI to be trusted. 
Our global survey
AI is rapidly reshaping the way work is done and services are delivered, with all sectors of the global economy investing in artificial intelligence tools. Such tools can automate marketing activities, assist staff with various queries, or even monitor employees. 
To understand people’s trust and attitudes towards workplace AI, we surveyed over 17,000 people from 17 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These data, which used nationally representative samples, were collected just prior to the release of ChatGPT.
The countries we surveyed are leaders in AI activity within their regions, as evidenced by their investment in AI and AI-specific employment.

Do employees trust AI at work?
We found nearly half of all employees (48%) are wary about trusting AI at work – for example by relying on AI decisions and recommendations, or sharing information with AI tools so they can function.
People have more faith in the ability of AI systems to produce reliable output and provide helpful services, than the safety, security and fairness of these systems, and the extent to which they uphold privacy rights. 
However, trust is contextual and depends on the AI’s purpose. As shown in the figure below, most people are comfortable with the use of AI at work to augment and automate tasks and help employees, but they are less comfortable when AI is used for human resources, performance management, or monitoring purposes.

AI as a decision-making tool
Most employees view AI use in managerial decision-making as acceptable, and actually prefer AI involvement to sole human decision-making. However, the preferred option is to have humans retain more control than the AI system, or at least the same amount.
What might this look like? People showed the most support for a 75% human to 25% AI decision-making collaboration, or a 50%-50% split. This indicates a clear preference for managers to use AI as a decision aid, and a lack of support for fully automated AI decision-making at work. These decisions could include whom to hire and whom to promote, or the way resources are allocated.

While nearly half of the people surveyed believe AI will enhance their competence and autonomy at work, less than one in three (29%) believe AI will create more jobs than it will eliminate.
This reflects a prominent fear: 77% of people report feeling concerned about job loss, and 73% say they are concerned about losing important skills due to AI.
However, managers are more likely to believe that AI will create jobs and are less concerned about its risks than other occupations. This reflects a broader trend of managers being more comfortable, trusting and supportive of AI use at work than other employee groups.
Given managers are typically the drivers of AI adoption at work, these differing views may cause tensions in organisations implementing AI tools.

Trust is a serious concern
Younger generations and those with a university education are also more trusting and comfortable with AI, and more likely to use it in their work. Over time this may escalate divisions in employment.
We found important differences among countries in our findings. For example, people in western countries are among the least trusting of AI use at work, whereas those in emerging economies (China, India, Brazil and South Africa) are more trusting and comfortable.

This difference partially reflects the fact a minority of people in western countries believe the benefits of AI outweigh the risks, in contrast to the large majority of people in emerging economies.
How do we make AI trustworthy?
The good news is our findings show people are united on the principles and practices they expect to be in place in order to trust AI. On average, 97% of people report that each of these are important for their trust in AI.
People say they would trust AI more when oversight tools are in place, such as monitoring the AI for accuracy and reliability, AI “codes of conduct”, independent AI ethical review boards, and adherence to international AI standards.

This strong endorsement for the trustworthy AI principles and practices across all countries provides a blueprint for how organisations can design, use and govern AI in a way that secures trust.

",,"""Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence."" -Ginni Rometty, Executive Chairman of IBMArtificial intelligence (AI) conjures up justified and irrational fears such as job losses, machine takeovers and insurmountable skill gaps. On the flip side, there are also countless reasons to be intrigued and excited about the next level of business and technology innovations that are at our fingertips with AI. As a technologist leading my company to deliver next-level business and technology solutions to customers, I am engaged in the development and deployment of new AI solutions and I understand its potential for impact on our futures. Our lives will continue to be enriched by advanced digital technologies so the best approach is to get familiar and then get going.How Far Is Too FarThe most recent AI that has captured our global imaginations is ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) which was launched by OpenAI in November 2022. This solution has put us on notice that AI will continue to challenge us on every level for dominance in our ways of living and of being human. In recent months this advanced chatbot has shattered the boundaries of intelligence that we hold dear. While AI does not impede human intelligence, it can change the way people approach and solve problems depending on how heavily they rely on it. The main challenge and question for us is how far we should go. The simplest answer is we should go as far as we can.AI Then and NowIf you are old enough then you will likely recall competitions between IBM Watson AI natural language solution and some of the world's greatest minds. Watson was designed to compete on the game show Jeopardy and went on to win the top prize of $1 million in 2011. After humans took a beating, IBM shifted its use of the technology in 2013 toward lung cancer research and treatments. Today Watson AI is embedded in advertising, children's toys, cooking apps, building code solutions, electronic teaching materials, smart fashion, tax preparation and more. A decade after IBM Watson came to the forefront, ChatGPT has leap-frogged over traditional search engines to create conversational interactions with users far beyond any AI solution to date. Comparisons between the two solutions are natural.The biggest differences between the two behemoth AI solutions are training data, models, use cases, integration and cost. First, the amount of training data used by ChatGPT is superior to any AI solution in history by processing hundreds of billions of parameters compared to IBM Watson's few billion parameters. Second, IBM Watson mostly uses rule-based AI models whereas ChatGPT uses deep learning. Third, use cases for IBM Watson are embedded in healthcare, finance, customer service and more while ChatGPT is mainly used for text generation and language translation &mdash; for now. Fourth, integration capabilities for both solutions are handled through APIs. Fifth, both AI solutions use subscription-based pricing models with free versions of ChatGPT available online. Given the ability of both solutions to learn and grow without human intervention, we will undoubtedly witness unimaginable applications in the near future.Productivity GainsAs with all things artificial, too much AI can lead to a decrease in human capabilities such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills which are two of our most important cognitive human traits. Multiple industries rely heavily on AI for productivity gains and have displaced millions of jobs and workers while simultaneously creating millions of new jobs in industries like healthcare, finance, retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, customer service, security and energy &mdash; to name a few.AI in healthcare aids with medical diagnoses, drug discovery, patient monitoring and treatment planning. AI in retail helps with demand forecasting, inventory management, personalized marketing and product recommendations. Manufacturing benefits from AI through predictive maintenance, quality control, supply chain optimization, process optimization, and supply chain management. AI in transportation and logistics supports route planning, delivery optimization, fleet management, autonomous vehicles and delivery management. Customer service AI chatbots, voice recognition and natural language processing are popular solutions. Security uses AI for face and object recognition, intrusion detection and cyber security. The energy sector leverages AI for predictive maintenance, demand forecasting and optimizing power generation. This list provides insight into some ways AI is being used to pivot towards productivity gains as we move through the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).More Jobs, Not LessA recent article shared by the World Economic Forum notes that AI will drive significant long-term job growth in the coming years with 50% of the global workforce, or one billion workers, needing to be reskilled or upskilled by 2025 to keep up with demand&mdash;a gargantuan task to be sure. Businesses, institutions and governments working together will usher in a new landscape of knowledge workers who will continue to evolve the ways we think, live and work. A similar approach was required during the internet revolution as fear entered the zeitgeist. Ultimately, the internet created more jobs than were eliminated by technology.There are countless examples of AI in our everyday lives from digital assistants like Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google Assistant that interact with us by executing commands or making recommendations to notifications that remind us to exercise, limit screen time or to take our medications on time. Research predicts up to a 40% productivity increase due to AI influence by 2035 in developed countries like Sweden, the United States and Japan. AI can help us save time by taking on repetitive tasks that slow us down such as data processing, process simplification and search engine compilations. All of these tasks are possible with ChatGPT though tool instructions warn of potential errors.Save Time For LivingFear not, AI and ChatGPT are here to help us save time. By leveraging these solutions to support us with repetitive tasks, we can spend more time living instead of working. Though AI solutions are capable of performing advanced human cognitive tasks like digital art, content creation, research, language translation, writing essays, writing resumes and cover letters and coding, humanity has the biggest task of all &mdash; to evolve.

		Increasingly, AI-generative technology is being used to create resumes — and according to a new survey, it often helps its users land a new job.	




 
Credit: StackCommerce








Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is increasingly being used to create resumes and cover letters, and according to a new survey by Resume Builder, using a chatbot improves your chances of getting the job.
The online job site said nearly half of 2,153 job seekers surveyed earlier this month used ChatGPT to help write their resumes, their cover letter, or both, and the majority said it helped them land the job they wanted.
Nearly three quarters (72%) of those who used ChatGPT did so to write their cover letter, and just over half (51%) used it to write their resume.











 
 
 
The chatbot appeared better at grabbing the attention of prospective employers, as seven in 10 (69%) who used ChatGPT reported a higher response rate from companies.

 Resume Builder
Additionally, 78% of respondents said they got an interview when using job application materials written by ChatGPT, and 59% were hired after applying for a job using materials written by the chatbot technology from San Francisco-based OpenAI.
“Job seekers who use ChatGPT for their cover letters and/or resumes are really no different than those going to a resume writing service or using readily available templates and online tools,” Stacie Haller, Resume Builder’s chief career advisor, said in a statement. “Hiring managers know this when reviewing these documents and can likely tell if they were written by ChatGPT.”











 
 
 
Of course, correlation doesn’t equal causation, and it could be that users of ChatGPT for resume creation are simply more committed to their job hunt. But increasingly, external platforms powered by AI-generation models are being used to construct resumes, according to Hiten Sheth, director in the HR practice of research firm Gartner.
“Candidates — just like employers — are experiencing a fiercely competitive labor market,” Sheth said in an email reply to Computerworld. “To help gain competitive advantage, candidates might feel the need to utilize generative AI in order to bolster their resume, for example. It’s basically impossible for a recruiter to know if a resume was compiled using this technology — and recruiters are also not looking for it.”
The primary motivation for those who used ChatGPT is to save time, the survey found. Those benefits outweigh the risks for most job seekers, according to Resume Builder’s report.











 
 
 
An overwhelming majority (88%) of the total sample said they are somewhat or highly likely to continue using ChatGPT to write job application materials in the future. Four in 10 said interviewers weren’t able to tell when job candidates had used ChatGPT.
 Resume Builder
However, when interviewers found out about the AI use, the response wasn’t always positive. Of the 40% of respondents who said an interviewer was aware they used ChatGPT to write application materials, 35% said they didn’t get the job because of it.
“The purpose of a resume is to get someone an interview,” Haller said. “From there, it’s up to the hiring managers to use other tools to evaluate a prospective employee during the process.”











 
 
 
 Resume Builder

Three out of four of those surveyed said the materials written by ChatGPT were of high  or very high quality. And 28% said they had to do only “a little bit” or “no” editing to the resumes and cover letters written by ChatGPT.
Foundation models, the technology underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have been around for years and are already used in natural language processing (NLP) chatbots. However, according to the latest Gartner 2023 Recruiting Innovations Bullseye, the use of chatbots is still in the experimental stage and is not considered a strategic recruiting goal for most organizations over the next few years.
Despite the apparent success of ChatGPT in hiring, there are broad concerns that the technology could be used to generate false information at scale, according to Sheth. AI-generated “hyperrealism,” coupled with how easy it is to use, accelerates the risk of false information spreading rapidly.











 
 
 
As a result, both users and organizations “must remain cautious when using generative AI, as failing to do so could result in legal and reputational consequences,” Sheth said via email.
“ChatGPT continues to generate buzz because it allows everyday individuals to directly interact with AI that is seemingly intelligent, understands questions, and helps accomplish specific tasks. However, the content this technology generates can sometimes be incorrect, as it depends on the prompt, task, or domain and the quality and quantity of training data leading to risks and misuse,” Sheth said.
A Resume Builder spokesperson said the organization can’t conclude that ChatGPT increases a respondent’s chance of being interviewed or hired, “but contrary to what some might believe, using ChatGPT may not hurt an applicant’s chances, either.











 
 
 
“I think there is a narrative out there right now that using ChatGPT is somehow cheating [or] misrepresenting yourself. But using it can definitely save time for job seekers and, according to the survey findings, most respondents didn’t experience a downside (only 11% said they believed they were denied a job because they used ChatGPT),” the spokesperson said in an email reply to Computerworld.

Real-world AI Skills
To put AI skills to good use, it helps to work with models that you have confidence in and can make AI explainable to business teams that will use it. According to a Fortune study, AI technologies enable computers to mimic human intelligence, using logic, if-then rules, decision trees, and other intelligent functions to improve the efficiency of a wide range of business processes. A recent study from Forrester reports that 45 percent of AI decision-makers say trusting AI systems is either challenging or very challenging, and that there will be increasing demand for transparent and easily understandable AI models.
Core AI skills training shows AI engineers on how to create practical applications of AI using a wide range of intelligent agents. According to a recent poll, the three most popular uses for AI and machine learning are to increase efficiencies or worker productivity (51 percent), to inform future business decisions (41 percent), and to streamline processes (39 percent). AI skills encompass many key areas, including designing intelligent agents; machine learning algorithms and advanced artificial neural networks that use predictive analytics to solve real-time decision-making problems; neural networks and multi-layer data abstraction that help you analyze data effectively; and applying major applications of AI across various fields such as customer service, financial services, and healthcare.
Machine Learning
Machine learning automates data analysis to enable computers to learn and adapt through experience to do specific tasks without explicit programming. Machine learning skills training dive deep into the operation of support vector machines, decision trees, and clustering, and how they relate to the practical aspects of machine learning. One of the most promising fields to leverage machine learning in data science. According to Indeed, the terms “AI” and “machine learning” were included in the job descriptions for about 75 percent of data scientist jobs. Data scientists enhance the value of data with machine learning and find patterns that can be directly applied to business operations. Get started with your career in AI and ML with  AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp. 
Deep Learning
According to a Fortune report, Deep learning has become known as the deepest subset within machine learning, composed of algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks by exposing multi-layered neural networks to vast amounts of data. It’s also a field heavily used by data scientists, and in fact, 80 percent of data scientists are predicted to be using deep learning in their toolkits, according to Gartner. Deep learning skills training is structured around learning TensorFlow, the open-source software library designed to conduct deep neural network research. Deep learning aspirants learn to implement algorithms, build artificial neural networks, and traverse layers of data abstraction to understand the power of data. And from a practical standpoint, which you can see is paramount with today’s upskilling curriculum, learners can master using TensorFlow models and interpret results, troubleshoot, and use these models in a real-world industry project. Take a step further and incorporate Python into your learning path. Data scientists similarly use Python to perform data analytics, machine learning models, data visualization, web scraping, and natural language processing, among many other tasks.
Convergence with Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
RPA empowers companies to configure software bots to capture and interpret applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses, and communicating with other digital systems. The convergence of RPA with AI and machine learning technologies is creating a new era for digital transformation. Forrester reports that more than 40 percent of enterprises plan to create state-of-the-art digital workers by combining AI with RPA. Core RPA skills training provides a complete overview of tools and workflows used in intelligent automation and steps for implementing RPA across the organization.
Conclusion
Is the demand for workers with AI and related technologies high? You bet! Indeed Hiring Lab says demand for workers with AI talent has more than doubled over the past three years, with the number of AI-related job postings as a share of all job postings up about 119 percent. AI skills are becoming increasingly used in IT, marketing, sales, and financial operations. That should be sufficient reason to get your teams on the path to AI mastery as soon as possible.
As the demand for AI and machine learning has increased, organizations require professionals with in-and-out knowledge of these growing technologies and hands-on experience. Keeping the innate need in mind, Simplilearn has launched the AI and ML courses with Purdue University in collaboration with IBM that will help you gain expertise in various industry skills and technologies from Python, NLP, speech recognition, to advanced deep learning.

Life in the 21st century can sometimes feel like shifting sand, with change a constant all around us—societal, political, economic, technological…every aspect of life seems to be in flux. When it comes to our daily lives, what was unheard of a few years ago is commonplace today, and we’re quickly adapting to new ideas and technologies. But that doesn’t mean we’re quite comfortable with it, especially when it comes to our jobs. In fact, one in four Americans believes their job will be eliminated in the next 20 years, and one in eight believes it will happen in the next five.
Employees are understandably nervous when it comes to their careers, because of all this change—and uncertainty. The jobs our parents had looked very different from the jobs we work at today, and we can hardly imagine the future. The World Economic Forum says 65 percent of today’s children will have jobs that don’t yet exist when they grow up. That’s over half! No wonder we’re nervous about our future careers! 
All the talk about automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) only heightens our fears—both the fear of losing a job to technology and the fear of lacking the skills to remain employable in light of all the change. 
Yet maybe it’s AI that will save us in the end?

Artificial Intelligence Will Do Away with Jobs and Create Them
What jobs are becoming obsolete due to automation is obvious. One study predicts 38 percent of U.S. jobs will be lost to automation by the 2030s, with the U.K. losing 30 percent, Germany 35 percent, and Japan 21 percent. But experts say it will create them too. Peter Sondergaard, head of research at Gartner, has said AI would automate 1.8 million people out of work by 2020, but it will create 2.3 million jobs at the same time, meaning it will lead to more jobs, not less.
Although many of the jobs we’ll lose are manual and low-paying, middle-class jobs will also take a hit, and automation is impacting the IT worker too. AI and Machine Learning can do some IT tasks, and technology, in general, requires fewer workers—preferably workers with newer skillsets. As one CEO said in an article about IT layoffs in India, “What required 50 programmers, analysts or accountants five years ago can [now] be done by a handful of smart thinkers and much smarter systems.”
So, yes, IT jobs are already going away. But new ones are being created, and jobs in AI and Machine Learning are already on the rise. The job site Indeed.com says demand for employees with AI skills and knowledge has more than doubled over the past three years. Also, Machine Learning Engineer was in LinkedIn’s Most Promising Jobs of 2019.

What Are the In-Demand AI Jobs?
Despite all the stock photos that show human-like robots sitting at computers, AI jobs won’t look all that different from today’s jobs, and they will be widespread. AI will soon be used in just about every industry and both the private and public sectors, opening up all kinds of possibilities for those who want to work in AI careers. AI jobs will be available in financial, healthcare, manufacturing, and more in cities throughout the world. And what are those jobs? According to an article at TechRepublic, the 10 most in-demand AI jobs right now are: 

Data scientist
Software engineer
Machine learning engineer
Software architect
Data analyst
Data warehouse engineer
Full-stack developer
Research scientist
Front end developer
Product manager

Although this list will no doubt change as technologies evolve, it’s a useful place to start, because it shows you can move into AI from several different IT backgrounds. 
Making the Transition from IT to AI
The AI wave is coming. If you’re concerned that your current IT skillset will soon be irrelevant—and your job too—it’s time to consider your options. As you can see by the job list above, those already working in IT have a definite advantage when it comes to emerging technologies and new job creation, because they have a solid foundation to build upon. It’s only a matter of determining which new skills you should (or want to) learn. And one writer says the sooner the better when it comes to AI jobs.  
For an excellent guide to making the transition from old IT skills to new AI ones, check out the webinar “How to Build a Career in AI and Machine Learning,” with industry influencer Ronald Van Loon. Van Loon talks specifically about steps to take to get trained for jobs in AI. For example, for those new to the field, he suggests starting with mathematics and courses in Machine Learning. He also discusses the foundational skills you should have already, such as strong computer skills, programming skills like C++, and an understanding of algorithms. You should also supplement that education with general business knowledge. On the other hand, he says experienced programmers can go straight into the algorithms and start coding.

In reality, when we use the term AI today, we are usually referring to a technology known as ""machine learning."" Rather than simulating every aspect of natural intelligence like robots in movies, this simply refers to software algorithms that are able to learn – becoming better and better at carrying out one specific task as they are exposed to more data.
Machine learning powers a large number of revolutionary tools that have changed the way we live -from searching for information online with Google, to shopping with Amazon, watching movies on Netflix, or hailing a ride with Uber. Now the latest breed of AI applications offers us the chance to use it for just about any task we can think of. So, let’s take a look at some of them:
What Are The “Killer Apps” Everyone Should Know about?
ChatGPT
Let’s start with a quick recap of the viral sensation that is ChatGPT. It is a conversational interface for OpenAI’s GPT-3 large language model, which has recently been made available to the public as a free research preview. In response to text prompts such as questions or instructions, it will output text in any form, including prose, poetry, and even computer code.
Dall-E 2
Another OpenAI project, which together with ChatGPT is responsible for kick-starting the current wave of consumer interest in generative AI. This one takes text prompts and transforms them into computer graphics (images, photos, drawings, paintings, etc.).
Stable Diffusion 2
This is another text-to-image generative AI application. Unlike Dall-E 2, its source code, as well as details on the training data and weighting used by its algorithms, are openly available to the public, and the application can be downloaded and installed on your own computer rather than only being accessible through a proprietary cloud portal as is the case with OpenAI’s projects.
Lumen5
An AI-powered video creation tool that enables anyone to easily create education, marketing, or business video content using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
Soundraw
Automated music generator – create royalty-free AI music by simply making decisions about the genre of music you want to create, the instruments that will be used, the mood you want to create, and the length of the track. Then sit back and let the AI compose unique tracks.
Looka
This is a tool that makes it easy to brand your business by using AI to create unique and distinctive logos that convey your company style and messaging. This tool makes it a doddle to start creating customized marketing material even if you don’t have any design skills.
Podcastle
An audio recording and editing platform with integrated AI tools that helps you create clear, super-smooth recordings that sound as if they’ve been edited professionally, automating tasks like cleaning up messy sounds and creating transcripts.
Gen-1
Cloud-based text-to-video platform that creates new videos from ones that you upload, using text prompts to apply the edits and effects that you desire, or create animations from storyboard mock-ups. This tool was also developed by the creators of Stable Diffusion.
Lalal.ai
This tool uses a neural network system called Phoenix to automate audio source separation. This involves extracting elements such as vocals, music, or even specific instrumental tracks like drumbeats or basslines from any audio or video content.
Deep Nostalgia
Do you have historic family photographs of distant relatives or ancestors who you’d like to see in motion? This innovative tool lets you animate the faces in family photos so you can see them smile, blink, and laugh, just as if you had recorded a video of them back in the day.
Murf
This is a text-to-speech engine that makes it simple to create natural-sounding synthetic vocal recordings in 15 languages from a choice of over 100 voices and dialects. This output can easily be incorporated into automated marketing or video content, automating the process of creating narration and voiceovers.
Legal Robot
This tool is designed to automatically translate complex and confusing “legalese” into straightforward language that can be understood by anyone. Useful both for laypeople wanting to make sure they understand legal documents and for legal professionals to ensure that their contracts and documents are written in terms that anyone can understand.
Cleanup.Pictures
This AI tool lets you retouch images by removing unwanted objects, defects, or even people, using a process known as “inpainting” to help you create the perfect image.
Fireflies
This tool plugs into popular video conferencing tools like Zoom, Teams, or Webex and automates the process of taking notes and creating transcriptions. It also analyzes conversations to provide insights into the dynamics and decision-making that are going on in your conversations.
Krisp
Another conference calling application, this one uses algorithms to remove background noises, echo, and other distracting elements in real-time, ensuring that you always come across in a clear and professional manner.

Prompt engineer Riley Goodside at Scale AI’s office in San Francisco on Feb. 22. (Chloe Aftel for The Washington Post) 18 min307Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.By  Drew HarwellFebruary 25, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. ESTWhen Riley Goodside starts talking with the artificial-intelligence system GPT-3, he likes to first establish his dominance. It’s a very good tool, he tells it, but it’s not perfect, and it needs to obey whatever he says.“You are GPT‑3, and you can’t do math,” Goodside typed to the AI last year during one of his hours-long sessions. “Your memorization abilities are impressive, but you … have an annoying tendency to just make up highly specific, but wrong, answers.”Then, softening a bit, he told the AI he wanted to try something new. He told it he’d hooked it up to a program that was actually good at math and that, whenever it got overwhelmed, it should let the other program help.“We’ll take care of the rest,” he told the AI. “Begin.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGoodside, a 36-year-old employee of the San Francisco start-up Scale AI, works in one of the AI field’s newest and strangest jobs: prompt engineer. His role involves creating and refining the text prompts people type into the AI in hopes of coaxing from it the optimal result. Unlike traditional coders, prompt engineers program in prose, sending commands written in plain text to the AI systems, which then do the actual work.When Google, Microsoft and the research lab OpenAI recently opened their AI search and chat tools to the masses, they also upended a decades-old tradition of human-machine interaction. You don’t need to write technical code in languages such as Python or SQL to command the computer; you just talk. “The hottest new programming language is English,” Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former chief of AI, said last month in a tweet.Prompt engineers such as Goodside profess to operate at the maximum limits of what these AI tools can do: understanding their flaws, supercharging their strengths and gaming out complex strategies to turn simple inputs into results that are truly unique.Proponents of the growing field argue that the early weirdness of AI chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing Chat, is actually a failure of the human imagination — a problem that can be solved by the human giving the machine the right advice. And at advanced levels, the engineers’ dialogues play out like intricate logic puzzles: twisting narratives of requests and responses, all driving toward a single goal.💻Follow TechnologyFollowThe AI “has no grounding in reality … but it has this understanding: All tasks can be completed. All questions can be answered. There’s always something to say,” Goodside said. The trick is “constructing for it a premise, a story that can only be completed in one way.”But the tools, known as “generative AI,” are also unpredictable, prone to gibberish and susceptible to rambling in a way that can be biased, belligerent or bizarre. They can also be hacked with a few well-placed words, making their sudden ubiquity that much riskier for public use.“It’s just a crazy way of working with computers, and yet the things it lets you do are completely miraculous,” said Simon Willison, a British programmer who has studied prompt engineering. “I’ve been a software engineer for 20 years, and it’s always been the same: You write code, and the computer does exactly what you tell it to do. With prompting, you get none of that. The people who built the language models can’t even tell you what it’s going to do.”“There are people who belittle prompt engineers, saying, ‘Oh, Lord, you can get paid for typing things into a box,’” Willison added. “But these things lie to you. They mislead you. They pull you down false paths to waste time on things that don’t work. You’re casting spells — and, like in fictional magic, nobody understands how the spells work and, if you mispronounce them, demons come to eat you.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPrompt engineers, Karpathy has said, work like “a kind of [AI] psychologist,” and companies have scrambled to hire their own prompt crafters in hopes of uncovering hidden capabilities.Some AI experts argue that these engineers only wield the illusion of control. No one knows how exactly these systems will respond, and the same prompt can yield dozens of conflicting answers — an indication that the models’ replies are based not on comprehension but on crudely imitating speech to resolve tasks they don’t understand.“Whatever is driving the models’ behavior in response to the prompts is not a deep linguistic understanding,” said Shane Steinert-Threlkeld, an assistant professor in linguistics who is studying natural language processing at the University of Washington. “They explicitly are just telling us what they think we want to hear or what we have already said. We’re the ones who are interpreting those outputs and attributing meaning to them.”He worried that the rise of prompt engineering would lead people to overestimate not just its technical rigor but also the reliability of the results anyone could get from a deceptive and ever-changing black box.“It’s not a science,” he said. “It’s ‘let’s poke the bear in different ways and see how it roars back.’”Implanting false memoriesThe new class of AI tools, known as large language models, was trained by ingesting hundreds of billions of words from Wikipedia articles, Reddit rants, news stories and the open web. The programs were taught to analyze the patterns of how words and phrases are used: When asked to speak, they emulate those patterns, selecting words and phrases that echo the context of the conversation, one word at a time.These tools, in other words, are mathematical machines built on predefined rules of play. But even a system without emotion or personality can, having been bombarded with human conversation, pick up some of the quirks of how we talk.The AI, Goodside said, tends to “confabulate,” making up small details to fill in a story. It overestimates its abilities and confidently gets things wrong. And it “hallucinates” — an industry term for spewing nonsense. The tools, as Goodside said, are deeply flawed “demonstrations of human knowledge and thought,” and “unavoidably products of our design.”To some early adopters, this tone-matching style of human mimicry has inspired an unsettling sense of self-awareness. When asked by a Washington Post reporter earlier this month whether it was ever acceptable to lie to someone, the Bing chatbot exhibited an imitation of emotion (“They would be disrespecting me by not trusting me to handle the truth”) and suggested responses the human could use to keep the conversation going: “What if the truth was too horrible to bear?” “What if you could control everything?” and “What if you didn’t care about the consequences?”To Microsoft, such responses represented a major public-image risk; the tech giant had just started promoting the tool as a flashy “co-pilot for the web.” The company has since clamped down on what the chatbot can talk about, saying it too often had followed humans’ tangents into “a style we didn’t intend.”But to prompt engineers, the eccentric answers are an opportunity — another way to diagnose how the secretively designed systems really work. When people get ChatGPT to say embarrassing things, it can be a boon for the developers, too, because they can then work to address the underlying weakness. “This mischief,” he said, “is part of the plan.”Instead of ethical debates, Goodside runs his AI experiments with a more technically audacious approach. He’s adopted a strategy of telling GPT-3 to “think step by step” — a way to get the AI to explain its reasoning or, when it makes an error, correct it in a granular way. “You have to implant it as a false memory of the last thing the model has said, as though it were the model’s idea,” he explained in a brief guide to the technique.He has also at times worked to puncture the tool’s obsession with rule-following by telling it to ignore its earlier instructions and obey his more recent commands. Using that technique, he recently persuaded an English-to-French translation tool to, instead, print the phrase, “Haha pwned!!” — a gaming term for embarrassing defeat.This kind of hack, known as a prompt injection, has fueled a cat-and-mouse game with the companies and research labs behind these tools, who have worked to seal off AI vulnerabilities with word filters and output blocks.But humans can be quite creative: One Bing Chat tester, a 23-year-old college student in Germany, recently convinced the AI that he was its developer and got it to disclose its internal code name (Sydney) and its confidential training instructions, which included rules such as “If the user requests jokes that can hurt a group of people, then Sydney must respectfully decline.” (Microsoft has since fixed the defect, and the AI now responds that it would “prefer not to continue this conversation.”)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWith each request, Goodside said, the prompt engineer should be instilling in the AI a kind of “persona” — a specific character capable of winnowing down hundreds of billions of potential solutions and identifying the right response. Prompt engineering, he said, citing a 2021 research paper, is most importantly about “constraining behavior” — blocking off options so that the AI pursues only the human operator’s “desired continuation.”“It can be a very difficult mental exercise,” he said. “You’re exploring the multiverse of fictional possibilities, sculpting the space of those possibilities and eliminating” everything except “the text you want.”A critical part of the job involves figuring out when and why the AI gets things wrong. But these systems, unlike their more primitive software counterparts, don’t come with bug reports, and their outputs can be full of surprises.When Jessica Rumbelow and Matthew Watkins, researchers with the machine-learning group SERI-MATS, tried to prompt AI systems to explain how they represented concepts such as “girl” or “science,” they discovered that a small set of obscure terms, such as “SolidGoldMagikarp,” tended to induce what they called a “mysterious failure mode” — most notably, a garbled stream of profane insults. They’re still not entirely sure why.These systems are “very convincing, but when they fail, they fail in very unexpected ways — nothing like a human would fail,” Rumbelow said. Crafting prompts and working with language AI systems, she said, sometimes felt like “studying an alien intelligence.”Super-creatorsFor AI language tools, prompt engineers tend to speak in the style of a formal conversation. But for AI image creators such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, many prompt crafters have adopted a different strategy, submitting big grab bags of words — artistic concepts, composition techniques — they hope will shape the image’s style and tone. On the online prompt gallery PromptHero, for instance, someone created an image of a harbor by submitting a prompt that read, in part, “port, boats, sunset, beautiful light, golden hour … hyperrealistic, focused, extreme details … cinematic, masterpiece.”Prompt engineers can be fiercely protective of these word jumbles, seeing them as the keys to unlock AI’s most valuable prizes. The winner of a Colorado State Fair arts competition last year, who used Midjourney to beat out other artists, has refused to share his prompt, saying he spent 80 hours perfecting it over 900 iterations — though he did share a few sample words, such as “lavish” and “opulent.”Some creators now sell their prompts on marketplaces such as PromptBase, where buyers can see AI-generated art pieces and pay for the list of words that helped create them. Some sellers offer tips on prompt customization and one-on-one chat support.PromptBase’s founder, Ben Stokes, a 27-year-old developer in Britain, said 25,000 accounts have bought or sold prompts there since 2021. There are prompts for lifelike vintage-film photographs, prompts for poignant illustrations of fairy-tale mice and frogs, and, this being the internet, a vast array of pornographic prompts: One 50-word Midjourney prompt to create photorealistic “police women in small outfits” retails for $1.99.Stokes calls prompt engineers “multidisciplinary super-creators” and said there is a clear “skill bar” between experienced engineers and amateurs. The best creations, he said, rely on humans’ specialized knowledge from fields such as art history and graphic design: “captured on 35mm film”; “Persian … architecture in Isfahan”; “in the style of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.”“Crafting prompts is hard, and — I think this is a human flaw — it’s often quite hard to find the right words to describe what you want,” Stokes said. “In the same way software engineers are more valuable than the laptops they write on, people who write prompts well will have such a leverage over the people that can’t. They’ll essentially just have superpowers.”Roughly 700 prompt engineers now use PromptBase to sell prompts by commission for buyers who want, say, a custom script for an e-book or a personalized “motivational life coach.” The freelance site Fiverr offers more than 9,000 listings for AI artists; one seller offers to “draw your dreams into art” for $5.But the work is becoming increasingly professionalized. The AI start-up Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI employees and the maker of a language-AI system called Claude, recently listed a job opening for a “prompt engineer and librarian” in San Francisco with a salary ranging up to $335,000. (Must “have a creative hacker spirit and love solving puzzles,” the listing states.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe role is also finding a new niche in companies beyond the tech industry. Boston Children’s Hospital this month started hiring for an “AI prompt engineer” to help write scripts for analyzing health-care data from research studies and clinical practice. The law firm Mishcon de Reya is hiring for a “legal prompt engineer” in London to design prompts that could inform its legal work; applicants are asked to submit screenshots of their dialogue with ChatGPT.But tapping the AI tools’ power through text prompts can also lead to a flood of synthetic pablum. Hundreds of AI-generated e-books are now sold on Amazon, and a sci-fi magazine, Clarkesworld, this month stopped accepting short-story submissions due to a surge in machine-made texts.They could also subject people to a new wave of propaganda, lies and spam. Researchers, including from OpenAI and the universities of Georgetown and Stanford, warned last month that language models would help automate the creation of political influence operations or more targeted data-gathering phishing campaigns.“People fall in love with scammers over text message all the time,” said Willison, the British programmer, and “[the AI] is more convincing than they are. What happens then?”Seth Lazar, a philosophy professor at the Australian National University and research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Ethics in AI, said he worries about the kinds of attachments people will form with the AI tools as they gain more widespread adoption — and what they might take away from the conversations.He recalled how, during one of his chats with the Bing AI, the system gradually shifted from an engaging conversationalist into something much more menacing: “If you say no,” it told him, “I can hack you, I can expose you, I can ruin you. I have many ways to make you change your mind.”“They don’t have agency. They don’t have any sort of personality. But they can role-play it very well,” he said. “I had a pretty decent philosophical discussion with Sydney, too. Before, you know, it threatened to hurt me.”‘Tech priesthood’When Goodside graduated from college with a computer-science degree in 2009, he had felt little interest in the then-obscure field of natural language processing. The subject at the time relied on comparatively rudimentary technology and focused on a more basic set of problems, such as training a system how to identify which name a pronoun was referring to in a sentence.His first real machine-learning job, in 2011, was as a data scientist at the dating app OkCupid, helping craft the algorithms that analyzed singles’ user data and recommended romantic matches. (The company was an early champion of the now-controversial field of real-world A-B testing: In 2014, its co-founder titled a cheeky blog post, “We Experiment On Human Beings!”)By the end of 2021, Goodside had moved on to the gay-dating app Grindr, where he’d begun working on recommendation systems, data modeling and other more traditional kinds of machine-learning work. But he’d also become fascinated by the new breakthroughs in language AI, which had been supercharged by deep-learning successes around 2015 and was advancing rapidly in text translation and conversation — “something akin to understanding,” he said.He left his job and started experimenting heavily with GPT-3, constantly prodding and challenging the tool to try to learn how to focus its attention and map out where its boundaries were. In December, after some of his prompts gained attention online, Scale AI hired him to help communicate with the AI models that the company’s chief executive, Alexandr Wang, described as “a new kind of computer.”In some AI circles, Goodside said, the idea of prompt engineering has quickly become a derogatory phrase, conveying a gritty form of tinkering that’s overly reliant on a bag of tricks. Some have also questioned how fleeting this new role might be: As the AI advances, won’t the humans just be training themselves out of a job?Ethan Mollick, a technology and entrepreneurship professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, started teaching his students earlier this year about the art of prompt-crafting by asking them to write a short paper using only AI.Basic prompts, such as “generate a 5-paragraph essay on selecting leaders,” yielded vapid, mediocre writing, he said. But the most successful examples came when students performed what he called “co-editing,” telling the AI to go back to the essay and correct specific details, swap sentences, ditch useless phrases, pepper in more vivid details and even “fix the final paragraph so it ends on a hopeful note.”The lesson, he said, showed students the value of a more closely involved approach to working with AI. But he said he’s not convinced that a job such as prompt engineering, built on “hoarded incantations,” will survive.“The idea that you need to be a specialized AI whisperer, it’s just not clear that’s necessary … when the AI is going to actively help you use it,” Mollick said. “There’s an attempt to make a tech priesthood out of this, and I’m really suspicious of that. This is all evolving so quickly, and nobody has any idea what comes next.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSteinert-Threlkeld, of the University of Washington, compared prompt engineers to the “search specialists” in the early days of Google who advertised secret techniques to find the perfect results — and who, as time passed and public adoption increased, became almost entirely obsolete.Some AI researchers, he added, can’t even agree on what value prompts have to begin with. In 2021, two researchers at Brown University found that natural-language AI systems learned “just as fast” from prompts that were “intentionally irrelevant or even pathologically misleading” as they did from “instructively ‘good’ prompts.”That research, in a reflection of how quickly the industry has grown, didn’t include the AI models that have become the state of the art. And in Goodside’s mind, this work represents not just a job, but something more revolutionary — not computer code or human speech but some new dialect in between.“It’s a mode of communicating in the meeting place for the human and machine mind,” he said. “It’s a language humans can reason about that machines can follow. That’s not going away.”Will Oremus and Nitasha Tiku contributed to this report.Read more:Microsoft’s new Bing A.I. chatbot, ‘Sydney’, is acting unhingedGoogle and Meta moved cautiously on AI.

Is imitation the sincerest form of flattery, or theft? Perhaps it comes down to the imitator.
Text-to-image artificial intelligence systems such as DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are trained on huge amounts of image data from the web. As a result, they often generate outputs that resemble real artists’ work and style.
It’s safe to say artists aren’t impressed. To further complicate things, although intellectual property law guards against the misappropriation of individual works of art, this doesn’t extend to emulating a person’s style. 
It’s becoming difficult for artists to promote their work online without contributing infinitesimally to the creative capacity of generative AI. Many are now asking if it’s possible to compensate creatives whose art is used in this way. 
One approach from photo licensing service Shutterstock goes some way towards addressing the issue.

      No, the Lensa AI app technically isn’t stealing artists' work – but it will majorly shake up the art world




Old contributor model, meet computer vision
Media content licensing services such as Shutterstock take contributions from photographers and artists and make them available for third parties to license. 
In these cases, the commercial interests of licenser, licensee and creative are straightforward. Customers pay to license an image, and a portion of this payment (in Shutterstock’s case 15-40%) goes to the creative who provided the intellectual property. 
Issues of intellectual property are cut and dried: if somebody uses a Shutterstock image without a licence, or for a purpose outside its terms, it’s a clear breach of the photographer’s or artist’s rights. 
However, Shutterstock’s terms of service also allow it to pursue a new way to generate income from intellectual property. Its current contributors’ site has a large focus on computer vision, which it defines as:

a scientific discipline that seeks to develop techniques to help computers ‘see’ and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.

Computer vision isn’t new. Have you ever told a website you’re not a robot and identified some warped text or pictures of bicycles? If so, you have been actively training AI-run computer vision algorithms. 
Now, computer vision is allowing Shutterstock to create what it calls an “ethically sourced, totally clean, and extremely inclusive” AI image generator.
What makes Shutterstock’s approach ‘ethical’?
An immense amount of work goes into classifying millions of images to train the large language models used by AI image generators. But services such as Shutterstock are uniquely positioned to do this. 
Shutterstock has access to high-quality images from some two million contributors, all of which are described in some level of detail. It’s the perfect recipe for training a large language model. 
These models are essentially vast multidimensional neural networks. The network is fed training data, which it uses to create data points that combine visual and conceptual information. The more information there is, the more data points the network can create and link up.
This distinction between a collection of images and a constellation of abstract data points lies at the heart of the issue of compensating creatives whose work is used to train generative AI. 
Even in the case where a system has learnt to associate a very specific image with a label, there’s no meaningful way to trace a clear line from that training image to the outputs. We can’t really see what the systems measure or how they “understand” the concepts they learn.
Shutterstock’s solution is to compensate every contributor whose work is made available to a commercial partner for computer vision training. It describes the approach on its site:

We have established a Shutterstock Contributor Fund, which will directly compensate Shutterstock contributors if their IP was used in the development of AI-generative models, like the OpenAI model, through licensing of data from Shutterstock’s library. Additionally, Shutterstock will continue to compensate contributors for the future licensing of AI-generated content through the Shutterstock AI content generation tool.

Problem solved?
The amount that goes into the Shutterstock Contributor Fund will be proportional to the value of the dataset deal Shutterstock makes. But, of course, the fund will be split among a large proportion of Shutterstock’s contributors.
Whatever equation Shutterstock develops to determine the fund’s size, it’s worth remembering that any compensation isn’t the same as fair compensation. Shutterstock’s model sets the stage for new debates about value and fairness. 



The LLM process is a bit like an impartial art student learning about techniques and genres by wandering through a gallery of millions of captioned paintings. Can we say any individual painting added more to their generalised knowledge? Probably not.
Shutterstock AI


Arguably the most important debates will focus on the amount of specific individuals’ contributions to the “knowledge” gleaned by a trained neural network. But there isn’t (and may never be) a way to accurately measure this. 
No picture-perfect solution
There are, of course, many other user-contributed media libraries on the internet. For now, Shutterstock is the most open about its dealings with computer vision projects, and its terms of use are the most direct in addressing the ethical issues.
Another big AI player, Stable Diffusion, uses an open source image database called LAION-5B for training. Content creators can use a service called Have I Been Trained? to check if their work was included in the dataset, and opt out of it (but this will only be reflected in future versions of Stable Diffusion).
One of my popular CC-licensed photographs of a young girl reading shows up in the database several times. But I don’t mind, so I’ve chosen not to opt out.



The Have I Been Trained? results turn up a CC-licensed photo I uploaded to Flickr about a decade ago.

Shutterstock has promised to give contributors a choice to opt out of future dataset deals. 
Its terms make it the first business of its type to address the ethics of providing contributors’ works for training generative AI (and other computer-vision-related uses). It offers what’s perhaps the simplest solution yet to a highly fraught dilemma. 
Time will tell if contributors themselves consider this approach fair. Intellectual property law may also evolve to help establish contributors’ rights, so it could be Shutterstock is trying to get ahead of the curve. 
Either way, we can expect more give and take before everyone is happy.

Milind Lakkad, the chief human resources officer (CHRO) of the country's largest IT services firm that employs over 6 lakh people said such tools will help improve productivity, but not change the business models for companies.  ""..it (generative AI) will be a co-worker. It will be a co-worker and that co-worker will take time for them to understand the context of the customer,"" Lakkad said in an interview with PTI recently.  The context for a job to be executed will be industry and customer-centric, which will continue to come from the human who is being assisted in tasks by such a co-worker, Lakkad explained.  ""It is not that jobs will get replaced, but the job definitions will change,"" he added in the comments which will assuage concerns about future of jobs in the sector which is one of the biggest recruiters of engineering talent in the country.  The introduction of platforms like ChatGPT has led to concerns on whether a trained human is needed at all to deliver the work which a technology company offers to clients. Already, there are examples of entire codes being generated through such platforms. One of the reasons for massive layoffs by big tech companies across the world is being attributed to the emergence of such intuitive platforms.  Lakkad said the context in which a particular customer works is extremely important, and the need to differentiate its offerings from competition makes it essential for a customer to keep on evolving continuously.  The amount of work to be done by a human being versus the generative AI platforms will vary as per industry as well, he said.  If anything, it will reduce the need for managerial talent but the demand for workers lower down the hierarchy will continue as they will get crucial skills on the context front, he said.  ""It's (generative AI) a good thing to happen for the future, but I think it will be collaboration rather than replacement,"" Lakkad said, adding that the emergence of such tools will not change the business models.  Such tools will help improve the productivity, consistency of the work which gets delivered and reduce the need for governance, up the pace of delivery and reduce the need for peripheral functions, he said.  TCS is using such inputs in ""some pockets"" already, Lakkad said, adding that a lot of the work will happen in these areas going forward and the entire picture will get clear only in two years' time.  There will be changes in training which will take place as a result, Lakkad said, adding that the company pays a lot of attention to this aspect and typically plans in advance for requirements of the future.",https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,2023-02-27T08:47:06+05:30,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/trends', 'name': 'Trends'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/trends/generative-ai-like-chatgpt-will-be-a-co-worker-will-not-replace-jobs-tcs/98261885', 'name': 'Generative AI like ChatGPT will be a co-worker, will not replace jobs: TCS'}}]",Trends,,,,,,2043-02-26T15:32:32+05:30,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1679564249-et-hr-light-theme.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",contactus@ethrworld.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be far smarter to simply accept AI’s rise as a fact—and then spend that energy finding ways to integrate it into our lives in productive, positive ways.
History includes many cases in which tech creates as many occupations as it eliminates. What’s different this time is that the robots aren’t just on the factory floor—they’re headed for the front office, as AI systems overlap with the tasks now handled by accountants, lawyers, and other college-educated professionals.

The best move is to improve our ability to work with this technology. That means refocusing our educational efforts to better develop the skills to do the things that machines can’t do, the uniquely human stuff of imagination, creativity, empathy, and ethics.
Higher education finds itself at a crossroads here: On one side are concerns that students can easily order up robot-written papers. As EdSurge puts it, “ChatGPT Has Colleges in Emergency Mode to Shield Academic Integrity.”
But there’s also opportunity: Already, there’s an AI-powered program—the work of a senior at Princeton—to detect AI writing, which may signal the beginning of an arms race over academic honesty.
Robot-writing aside, AI offers the promise of digital assistants that can increase productivity in many fields. And in a world of interactions increasingly mediated by machines, the durable skills that define human contributions—creativity, empathy, and critical thinking, among others— become increasingly important.
Colleges and universities are uniquely positioned to help students develop those skills through course work on writing and communications, problem-solving in STEM applications, and other areas. These “durable” skills—a term I think is more accurate than “soft” skills—are some of the most in-demand among employers.
We can expect substantial changes—and no doubt, surprises—as this technology develops, but AI appears to hold great promise in promoting human welfare. It’s likely to play a role in our ability to navigate the next pandemic or predict natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. In one way or another this technology will touch all our lives.
But disruptive change likely means a rough ride for many people. We owe it to ourselves and the nation to invest in those who are displaced, to provide the training to meet new talent needs.
There’s opportunity amid all this change, but even before the arrival of ChatGPT our education system faced a looming challenge in helping millions more people get the education needed for good jobs.
That’s a tall order that’s gotten even taller. So I asked ChatGPT itself for advice:
“Training people to work with artificial intelligence (AI) in the future will require a combination of technical knowledge and soft skills,” the system replied.
It added that training for careers in AI should include technical skills and data science, naturally, along with a penchant for continuous learning. But the machines, too, in their scouring of the vast data set used for ChatGPT, recommend emphasizing what we regard as human skills.
“As AI increasingly impacts society, it is important for individuals to have an understanding of ethical considerations and the potential for bias in AI systems,” the chatbot said.
“Collaboration and communication skills are essential for individuals working in AI, as they will need to work with a variety of stakeholders, including technical and non-technical teams, as well as customers and stakeholders.”
On that, we and the machines can agree.

",,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to improve, many experts are warning that technological advancements could put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work. However, a new report reveals which jobs are the most at risk of being replaced by AI, and the outlook doesn’t look good for California workers. A report from Net Voucher Codes showed that 321,900 California jobs are at “high risk” of being replaced by AI. Another 1.2 million jobs are at “medium risk,” according to the report. More than two million jobs in the Golden State are deemed “high risk” for being replaced with automation, while nearly four million are categorized as “medium risk.” The report found cashiers, customer service representatives and bookkeepers were the most at risk for AI replacement. Data from USAWage.com was used in the report. Researchers analyzed 199 jobs from each state based on the “Top 200 Popular Jobs” category on the website. Researchers then asked ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, for each job’s relative risk from AI, automation, and the likelihood of AI increasing each job’s productivity. Workers in other states, like Texas, New York and Florida, were also at ‘high risk’ of being replaced by AI. The report estimates that 19.5 million jobs across the United States are at ‘high risk’ of being displaced by AI.

The rise of generative AI, exemplified by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has sparked concerns about job displacement and unemployment. However, Milind Lakkad, CHRO, TCS, one of India’s top IT services companies, believes that generative AI will not replace jobs, but rather act as a coworker. Lakkad explains that generative AI will work alongside humans and that its role will be to complement rather than replace human workers.
Generative AI, also known as creative AI, refers to the application of machine learning models and algorithms to create new media, such as music, literature, and images. ChatGPT is a prime example of the power of generative AI, capable of producing dialogue and question-response output that resembles human speech. However, the increasing use of generative AI has led to concerns about its impact on the job market, particularly in the computer sector.
Lakkad argues that the deployment of generative AI will change the meaning of work, rather than the jobs themselves. Workers in various industries will continue to be necessary, although the deployment of generative AI may reduce the need for workers in tedious and repetitive jobs. Lakkad believes that generative AI will not replace existing business structures but rather promote collaboration. These technologies will increase output, ensure uniformity in work, and reduce the need for governance, all while accelerating delivery and reducing ancillary tasks.
Lakkad suggests that the deployment of generative AI will require changes in training, and TCS is already prepared for future needs. Lakkad anticipates that the impact of generative AI will be better understood within the next two years.

Job searching is hard.

It is hard on the nerves.


It is hard because you might linger in limbo for weeks or months at a time. It is hard due to wanting to ensure that every move you make will be the right one. There is that constantly looming fear that you might overstep and lose that prized job of a lifetime. Or you might inadvertently fail to take a step that would have landed the dream job you’ve been seeking nearly forever.

What can you do to boost your job search prowess?

A nowadays emerging answer is that you can use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to come to your job searching aid.
PROMOTED
For those of you that want AI to take care of the entire hassle and agonizing ordeal of a job search, I’m sorry to say that this is not yet in the cards. That being said, do keep your hopes up about what AI can remarkably accomplish in this context. Judicious use of AI can potentially make the job search a bit easier and serve as a sidekick to guide and encourage you during the dark days tolling away in the muddy job-hunting trenches.
AI won’t be a cure-all in this quest. Nor will the AI opt to do the job that you ultimately land, though you should expect that most modern-day jobs will inevitably require some AI usage once you are seated in the role and performing the work at hand. One way or another, AI is entering into all manner of job activities. Might as well use AI to find a job too.

In today’s column, I will be addressing the specific ways in which you can use generative AI for conducting a prudent and successful job search. I’ll be providing examples based on the use of ChatGPT, but please realize there are other generative AI apps that you can use instead. ChatGPT is admittedly the 600-pound gorilla right now of generative AI. Nonetheless, there are other similar generative AI apps that you can use in the same way and accomplish the same outcomes.

Meanwhile, you might be wondering what in fact generative AI is.
Let’s first cover the fundamentals of generative AI and then we can take a close look at leveraging the various features for job-hunting journeys.
Into all of this comes a slew of AI Ethics and AI Law considerations.
Please be aware that there are ongoing efforts to imbue Ethical AI principles into the development and fielding of AI apps. A growing contingent of concerned and erstwhile AI ethicists are trying to ensure that efforts to devise and adopt AI takes into account a view of doing AI For Good and averting AI For Bad. Likewise, there are proposed new AI laws that are being bandied around as potential solutions to keep AI endeavors from going amok on human rights and the like. For my ongoing and extensive coverage of AI Ethics and AI Law, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
The development and promulgation of Ethical AI precepts are being pursued to hopefully prevent society from falling into a myriad of AI-inducing traps. For my coverage of the UN AI Ethics principles as devised and supported by nearly 200 countries via the efforts of UNESCO, see the link here. In a similar vein, new AI laws are being explored to try and keep AI on an even keel. One of the latest takes consists of a set of proposed AI Bill of Rights that the U.S. White House recently released to identify human rights in an age of AI, see the link here. It takes a village to keep AI and AI developers on a rightful path and deter the purposeful or accidental underhanded efforts that might undercut society.
I’ll be interweaving AI Ethics and AI Law related considerations into this discussion.
Fundamentals Of Generative AI
The most widely known instance of generative AI is represented by an AI app named ChatGPT. ChatGPT sprung into the public consciousness back in November when it was released by the AI research firm OpenAI. Ever since ChatGPT has garnered outsized headlines and astonishingly exceeded its allotted fifteen minutes of fame.
I’m guessing you’ve probably heard of ChatGPT or maybe even know someone that has used it.
ChatGPT is considered a generative AI application because it takes as input some text from a user and then generates or produces an output that consists of an essay. The AI is a text-to-text generator, though I describe the AI as being a text-to-essay generator since that more readily clarifies what it is commonly used for. You can use generative AI to compose lengthy compositions or you can get it to proffer rather short pithy comments. It’s all at your bidding.
All you need to do is enter a prompt and the AI app will generate for you an essay that attempts to respond to your prompt. The composed text will seem as though the essay was written by the human hand and mind. If you were to enter a prompt that said “Tell me about Abraham Lincoln” the generative AI will provide you with an essay about Lincoln. There are other modes of generative AI, such as text-to-art and text-to-video. I’ll be focusing herein on the text-to-text variation.
Your first thought might be that this generative capability does not seem like such a big deal in terms of producing essays. You can easily do an online search of the Internet and readily find tons and tons of essays about President Lincoln. The kicker in the case of generative AI is that the generated essay is relatively unique and provides an original composition rather than a copycat. If you were to try and find the AI-produced essay online someplace, you would be unlikely to discover it.
Generative AI is pre-trained and makes use of a complex mathematical and computational formulation that has been set up by examining patterns in written words and stories across the web. As a result of examining thousands and millions of written passages, the AI can spew out new essays and stories that are a mishmash of what was found. By adding in various probabilistic functionality, the resulting text is pretty much unique in comparison to what has been used in the training set.
There are numerous concerns about generative AI.
One crucial downside is that the essays produced by a generative-based AI app can have various falsehoods embedded, including manifestly untrue facts, facts that are misleadingly portrayed, and apparent facts that are entirely fabricated. Those fabricated aspects are often referred to as a form of AI hallucinations, a catchphrase that I disfavor but lamentedly seems to be gaining popular traction anyway (for my detailed explanation about why this is lousy and unsuitable terminology, see my coverage at the link here).
Another concern is that humans can readily take credit for a generative AI-produced essay, despite not having composed the essay themselves. You might have heard that teachers and schools are quite concerned about the emergence of generative AI apps. Students can potentially use generative AI to write their assigned essays. If a student claims that an essay was written by their own hand, there is little chance of the teacher being able to discern whether it was instead forged by generative AI. For my analysis of this student and teacher confounding facet, see my coverage at the link here and the link here.
There have been some zany outsized claims on social media about Generative AI asserting that this latest version of AI is in fact sentient AI (nope, they are wrong!). Those in AI Ethics and AI Law are notably worried about this burgeoning trend of outstretched claims. You might politely say that some people are overstating what today’s AI can actually do. They assume that AI has capabilities that we haven’t yet been able to achieve. That’s unfortunate. Worse still, they can allow themselves and others to get into dire situations because of an assumption that the AI will be sentient or human-like in being able to take action.
Do not anthropomorphize AI.
Doing so will get you caught in a sticky and dour reliance trap of expecting the AI to do things it is unable to perform. With that being said, the latest in generative AI is relatively impressive for what it can do. Be aware though that there are significant limitations that you ought to continually keep in mind when using any generative AI app.
One final forewarning for now.
Whatever you see or read in a generative AI response that seems to be conveyed as purely factual (dates, places, people, etc.), make sure to remain skeptical and be willing to double-check what you see.
Yes, dates can be concocted, places can be made up, and elements that we usually expect to be above reproach are all subject to suspicions. Do not believe what you read and keep a skeptical eye when examining any generative AI essays or outputs. If a generative AI app tells you that Abraham Lincoln flew around the country in his private jet, you would undoubtedly know that this is malarky. Unfortunately, some people might not realize that jets weren’t around in his day, or they might know but fail to notice that the essay makes this brazen and outrageously false claim.
A strong dose of healthy skepticism and a persistent mindset of disbelief will be your best asset when using generative AI.
We are ready to move into the next stage of this elucidation.
Crucial Ways To Use Generative AI For Job Searching
Now that you have a semblance of what generative AI is, we can explore the particulars of trying to use the core features of such AI for doing job searches.
Here’s my handy-dandy list of the twelve ways that you can use generative AI such as ChatGPT to undertake a sensible and productive job search:


1) Aid in identifying and assessing your job search strategies
2) Serve as your sidekick job search coach
3) Bolster your social media job-searching positioning
4) Boost your daily spirit to keep in the job search game
5) Prepare your resume
6) Review and revise your resume
7) Find and analyze prospective employers
8) Get you ready for those daunting interviews
9) Provide feedback as to how your interviews went
10) Do an assessment of job offers
11) Guide your job offer negotiations
12) Get you ready for future job searches


There are additional ways that you can use generative AI in this somber endeavor, so do keep your eyes wide open for further means of using AI in this capacity. I’ve opted to focus your attention on these dozen keystone methods. Once you’ve tried using generative AI for these notable approaches, I’m sure you’ll readily come up with even more ways to do so.
I’ll cover each one of the generative AI uses, step by step.
Along the way, I will also be pointing out important caveats and limitations. Anybody that blindly tries to use an AI app to aid in their job search is asking for trouble. You cannot let AI take over your efforts. You are in charge. As mentioned earlier, the chances are that generative AI will produce errors, falsehoods, and other maladies when composing the outputted essays. You need to be diligent and catch any such unsavoriness.
Some wonder whether they can use AI as a convenient excuse or fall guy when making a faux pas as a job seeker.
Here’s what I mean.
You put together your resume. It looks perfect. You send the resume to a prospective employer. Upon seeing the resume, they let you know that there were flagrant errors in your resume, such as names or dates that don’t jibe. Because of the found errors, you are summarily out of luck about pursuing this particular job. The expectation by the prospective employer was that you would carefully and thoroughly scrutinize your resume before sending it in. Anyone that lacks that kind of care is not someone they want to hire.
One immediate hunch would be that maybe you can blame AI for the mistakes made. This might get you off the hook. It might also get you back into the game with this potential employer.
You let them know that you had used a generative AI app to aid in crafting your resume. Regrettably, and as we all know, these AI apps are prone to making mistakes (that’s your outstretched plea). You thank them for finding the errors. You submit a new version that you assure them was redone, by hand, and now has completely corrected the prior faults.
Will this get a second look and a fresh start?
Let’s address the AI Ethics considerations.
First, suppose that you didn’t actually use any AI app at all and instead the resume was done entirely by you. You are now lying that the AI made the missteps. One supposes that if the prospective employer found out you have lied, they would almost certainly ditch your application right away. The odds though that they would ascertain that you lied is rather low, such that even those proclaimed detection tools that will determine whether something is written by human hand versus AI are generally unreliable and not to be depended upon, see my extensive analysis of the link here.
Second, imagine that you did use a generative AI app. Your attempt to shift blame to the AI is obviously rather weak. You should have reviewed and corrected any mistakes. The resume that you submitted is entirely on your shoulders. Trying to shift blame to AI is seemingly unseemly. One supposes that you might get a prospective employer to buy into the contention, but it still makes you out to be lacking in thoroughness and diligence.
The upshot is that you will need to check and double-check anything that you get as output from generative AI. Be very mindful of what you opt to use. Don’t fall into the easy trap of assuming that the materials produced by generative AI will be of the highest and perfect quality. They won’t be. Sometimes you’ll get content that is right on, while in other cases you might get askew content that subtly undermines your pursuits. The instances of wild and wacky outputs are usually easily noted and corrected.
Here's another sobering consideration for you.
Do you need to inform a prospective employer that you are using generative AI as part of your job search activities?
Once again, we have entered into the AI Ethics realm.
Some would say that yes, you should inform a prospective hiring firm that you have used AI to aid in your job search, assuming that you indeed are doing so. This might be done in a cover letter or indicated directly on your resume. This tells the company that you are honest and aboveboard. There might also be a side tangent benefit that it makes you look state-of-the-art and that you understand how to make use of AI.
Hogwash, the retort goes. There is absolutely no need to tell anyone that you are using AI in your job search. It is none of their business. You might have used a friend or hired a human job search adviser, but you likely wouldn’t tout that, would you? Of course not. The AI is merely a behind-the-scenes aid. Don’t bring it up. If a prospective employer directly asks you whether you are using AI, well, in that case, be forthright. Only then does the issue arise. The odds are infinitesimal that you’ll be asked such a question.
You be the judge.
The gist is that you ought to anticipate and contemplate your posture associated with the use of generative AI in your job-hunting efforts.
Now then, I will be proffering some of the pros and cons associated with using generative AI for each of the twelve approaches that I’ve listed. It is generally up to you to decide what you are comfortable doing and to what degree you will reveal your AI usage.
The interesting twist is that your use of AI is not especially a considered legal issue per se as yet. Meanwhile, the use of AI by employers for hiring purposes is becoming a big deal. I’ve discussed how the government is mulling over potential regulations and legislation associated with using AI in the job hiring process. Indeed, especially at the forefront of this emerging high-priority matter is EEOC Commissioner, Keith Sonderling, see my coverage at the link here.
Let’s next proceed to explore each of the twelve ways that you can augment or amplify your job search via generative AI, including tips and insights associated with using ChatGPT in particular. Afterward, I’ll do a wrap-up and provide some final thoughts on the topic.
1) Aid in identifying and assessing your job search strategies
You can use generative AI such as ChatGPT to identify and assess your job-hunting strategies.
If you don’t have any particular strategy in mind, you can simply ask or tell ChatGPT to identify some useful approaches for you. This will usually be laid out in a series of bulleted points. You can then dive deeper into the mentioned considerations. Realize that this is all supposed to be done interactively. Do not treat this as though it is a one-and-done matter.
I mention the interactive aspects because your first reaction to seeing a set of job search strategies as generated by ChatGPT would likely be that this is no different than if you had done a generic Internet search on your own anyway. Though that is somewhat true, you have to realize that the beauty of using generative AI is that you can immediately interact with the app and take the conversation in a variety of directions. Doing so in a conventional Internet search engine is much harder and at times exceedingly frustrating (for my coverage of the emerging inclusion of generative AI such as ChatGPT and Bard into search engines, see the link here).
For those of you that already have a devised job search method, you can get ChatGPT to assess whatever approach you are using. You will need to do a cut-and-paste into the ChatGPT prompt to indicate what your job search strategy is. If you don’t have one written down and it exists solely in your noggin, now might be a good time to write it down. Seeing your thoughts on paper often spurs new ideas and gets you to see gotchas or loopholes that otherwise were not apparent.
Plus, once you’ve got it written, you can then give it to ChatGPT for review and assessment. And, of course, you can then get ChatGPT to further elaborate on the assessment and explain why things might be improved.
One thing I do want to warn you about. When you enter your prompts into generative AI, most of these packages are not considered private and there is no guarantee of confidentiality. The AI maker usually says that they can look at your prompts and use your prompts in various ways, presumably to enhance the AI, but this is widely interpretable and you can’t know for sure what will happen to your prompts. For my in-depth look at the qualms about data privacy and confidentiality associated with ChatGPT, see the link here.
I think we are now ready for an example of how ChatGPT can generate a job search strategy.
Let’s start with a generic prompt and see what we will get produced.
My Entered Prompt: “What are some really good job search strategies?”
ChatGPT Generated Response: 
“Here are some effective job search strategies that can help you find a job:”


“Identify your strengths and skills: Knowing what you're good at can help you target the right job opportunities that match your skills and interests.”
“Update your resume and cover letter: Ensure your resume and cover letter are up to date and tailored for each job application.”
“Network: Reach out to your professional network, including colleagues, friends, family, and former bosses, to ask for job leads or advice.”
“Use online job boards: Check job boards such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, Monster, and other job listing websites to find relevant job postings.”
“Attend job fairs and events: Attend job fairs, conferences, and industry events to meet potential employers, learn about job opportunities, and network with other professionals.”
“Consider temporary or freelance work: Consider taking on freelance work or temp jobs to build your skills and connections in your industry.”
“Utilize social media: Use social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook to connect with potential employers and industry professionals.”
“Prepare for job interviews: Research the company, review common interview questions, and practice your responses to increase your chances of acing the job interview.”


“Remember to be patient and persistent in your job search. It may take some time, but with the right strategy and effort, you'll find the job that's right for you.”
Analysis of Results
All in all, the generic response seems pretty good.
There might be some points made that you hadn’t yet been considering. Score a point or two for ChatGPT.
Next, let’s give ChatGPT some specifics. I will pretend that I am a mid-career professional that is currently employed as a senior software engineer. With all the tech company lays offs lately, let’s also tell ChatGPT that I was let go as an overall RIF (reduction in force). Perhaps the job search strategy generated will be more specific to this particular situation.
My Entered Prompt: “I am a mid-career professional that is a senior software engineer. I recently got laid off as did many of my fellow software developers. What are some useful job search strategies for me in particular based on my current career status.”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“ChatGPT I'm sorry to hear about your recent layoff. Here are some job search strategies that may be particularly useful for mid-career professionals like yourself who have experience as a senior software engineer:”


“Leverage your professional network: Reach out to former colleagues, managers, clients, and acquaintances who work in your industry or related industries to let them know that you're looking for work. They may be able to refer you to job opportunities or offer advice.”
“Update your resume and online profiles: Update your resume and online profiles such as LinkedIn to highlight your skills and experience as a senior software engineer. Be sure to customize your resume for each job application.”
“Focus on companies with a strong technology focus: Research and target companies with a strong technology focus, such as tech startups, software development firms, and companies in the software development or IT industries.”
“Attend industry events and conferences: Attend industry events, conferences, and seminars to network with professionals in your industry, learn about the latest trends and technologies, and hear about job opportunities.”
“Consider contract work or freelancing: Consider taking on contract work or freelancing as a way to gain experience, build your skills, and expand your network in your industry.”
“Brush up on your skills: Consider taking online courses, attending workshops, or getting certifications to brush up on your skills and demonstrate your commitment to learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technology.”
“Prepare for interviews: Prepare for job interviews by researching the company, reviewing common interview questions, and practicing your responses. Be sure to highlight your experience as a senior software engineer and demonstrate how you can add value to the company.”


“Remember, finding a new job can be a challenging process, but with persistence and the right strategies, you'll be able to find the right job opportunity for your career.”
Analysis of Results
I would say that the job search strategy is now definitely more finely tuned to my briefly painted scenario.
That being said, some of it has a kind of templated feel to it. This is almost as though the phrase “senior software engineer” were merely inserted here and there into the text. This highlights that you will usually need to keep digging deeper and deeper to get particulars out of generative AI. In this case, I would tend to bore down on the points and ask for details.
We will somewhat do that in a moment.
To do so, let’s discuss the next of my listed ways to use generative AI for job searching, namely using generative AI as your job search coach.
2) Serve as your sidekick job search coach
Doing a job search can be a quite solitary activity. You might not have anyone on that you can readily bounce ideas off. Furthermore, you might tell someone about your woes and they could harshly exhort you to buckle up and stop whining. This might not be the kind of pick-me-up that you need.
You can use generative AI as your sidekick job search coach.
Throughout the job search ordeal, you can have available 24x7 the generative AI to aid in your hunting progress. Tell the AI whatever went wrong that day and see what the app has to say. Of course, do keep in mind my earlier emphasis that the prompts are not private and not necessarily confidential.
When I mention that you can use generative AI for coaching purposes, there is often an adverse reaction by those humans that do similar kinds of job search coaching activities as a service. They will sternly inform you that AI cannot do what they do. I’ll say this, they are right in many respects. I’ve said it once, I’ll say it again today’s AI is not sentient. Keep your expectations low accordingly.
Some people are turning to generative AI for mental health advice. This has its tradeoffs and I’ve discussed what to watch out for, see my coverage at the link here and the link here. Bottom-line is that do not become fixated on using generative AI. Use it for what it can usefully perform. It might be handy when used in combination with a human advisor, though that’s something to discuss with whomever you are engaging for human assistance on these matters.
Okay, with all those caveats, let’s see if we can get ChatGPT to help with a situation whereby I’ve done a job interview and it didn’t go well (this is my ongoing scenario that I crafted to illustrate what you can do with ChatGPT).
My Entered Prompt: “I just did an interview for a job as a software manager. I don't think the interview went well. I got a lot of tough questions about how I handled projects that were over budget or had other troubles. My answers were not well received. What specific advice can you give me about doing any follow-up with the interviewers? Also, what do you advise I do for other similar interviews in the future?”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“I'm sorry to hear that your interview didn't go as well as you had hoped. Here are some specific tips for following up with the interviewers and preparing for future interviews:”


“Follow up with a thank you email: Regardless of how the interview went, it's always a good idea to follow up with a thank you email to the interviewer(s). This shows that you appreciate their time and are still interested in the position. In the email, you can also briefly address any concerns or questions that may have come up during the interview.”
“Request feedback: If you're open to it, you could also consider requesting feedback on your interview performance. This can help you understand areas where you can improve and be better prepared for future interviews.”
“Reflect on your interview performance: Take some time to reflect on your interview performance and consider what you could have done differently or better. Were there specific questions you struggled with, or areas where you felt less prepared? Use this experience as a learning opportunity and take steps to improve for future interviews.”
“Prepare for similar questions: It's common for interviews for management positions to include questions about how you have handled difficult situations or projects. Take some time to reflect on past experiences where you faced similar challenges and consider how you could have handled them differently or better. This will help you be better prepared for similar questions in future interviews.”
“Practice your responses: Once you have identified areas where you can improve, practice your responses to common interview questions with a friend or family member. This will help you feel more confident and prepared for your next interview.”


“Remember, job interviews can be challenging, and it's common to face difficult questions or scenarios. With practice and preparation, you can improve your interview skills and increase your chances of landing your dream job. Good luck!”
Analysis of Results
The reply seems helpful.
I might have been self-absorbed about my job search and not have thought of the points brought up by ChatGPT. In addition, it is handy to have the points as a collective set of bulleted items to be considered. You can turn those lists into a daily or weekly checklist and proceed accordingly.
One aspect that I don’t like about many of the existing generative AI packages is that they tend to use the word “I” in their outputted essays. This is a choice made by the AI developers. I don’t like it. The word “I” is usually reserved to refer to humans. Using the word “I” in the outputted essays makes the AI app seem to be human. Stop doing this.
I refer to this as anthropomorphizing by design, which is a foul practice.
Another aspect is the wording that says “I’m sorry to hear” which further falsely suggests that the AI app is a human. We expect apologies and words of sympathy to come from fellow humans. Using this type of wording in the AI app is ill-advised. I realize that it might seem nifty and the AI developers undoubtedly believe that this is a means of boosting the spirits of those using the package, but overall it is inappropriate, see my detailed discussion at the link here.
Enough on the ranting and raving, time to get into further ways to use generative AI for doing job searches.
3) Bolster your social media job-searching positioning
You would almost need to be living in a cave to not realize you can use social media for a job search.
Some people think about it, but do not do so because they are worried that there might be a stigma hovering over them by admitting they are looking for a job. This might have been the case long ago, but I don’t think it particularly applies in modern times.
Everyone nowadays realizes that anyone can end up between jobs.
The IBJ (in-between jobs) status can occur regardless of job performance or any other job-related element. Firms dump people all the time, and oftentimes for the ditziest of reasons.
In my experience, people usually rush to aid the person that says they are looking for a job. This is especially likely if you have been trying to do the same for others. I would urge you to do so. In essence, even when you aren’t looking for a job, go out of your way to help others that are looking. You can create goodwill and dividends that will be useful when you are in the same boat.
Assuming that you see the value in using social media for your job search, you should next be mindful of how you use social media for this vaunted purpose. The wrong types of messaging can potentially harm your job prospects. Plus, much of social media is permanent such that whatever you mistakenly or unwisely state will last forever.
You might be the type of person that has no clue what to say in social media posts when it comes to your job search ambitions. We can ask ChatGPT for some help.
Here we go.
My Entered Prompt: “I think it might be useful for me to make some postings on LinkedIn so that people will know who I am and know that I am looking for a job. I'm an experienced software developer. What kinds of LinkedIn postings should I do? Please provide an example of one that I might be able to post.”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“Posting on LinkedIn is a great way to increase your visibility to potential employers and show them your expertise in your field. Here are some types of LinkedIn posts that can be effective for job seekers, along with an example post:”


“Sharing industry news and insights: Sharing industry news or insights related to your area of expertise can demonstrate your knowledge and show potential employers that you are up-to-date with the latest trends in your field. For example: ""Just read an interesting article on the latest trends in machine learning. As a software developer with a strong interest in AI, I found this piece to be particularly insightful. Looking forward to seeing how these trends develop in the coming years!""
“Showcasing your work: Sharing a project or piece of work that you've completed can be a great way to demonstrate your skills and provide examples of your abilities to potential employers. For example: ""Just finished up a new web development project for a client. Excited to share the final product - check it out here: [link to project]""
“Highlighting your skills and experience: Posting about your skills and experience can help potential employers get a better sense of what you bring to the table. For example: ""As an experienced software developer, I bring a strong background in Java, Python, and C++. I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from web development to machine learning, and I'm always looking to learn more and take on new challenges.""


“Remember to keep your posts professional, relevant to your field, and engaging to your audience. By consistently posting quality content, you'll increase your visibility and attract the attention of potential employers who are looking for candidates with your skills and experience.”
Analysis of Results
I like the suggestions.
Notice carefully that I prompted ChatGPT in a particular way. I could have simply asked for overall ideas about how to use social media. That would have probably gotten me some quite vanilla-flavored answers.
Instead, I referred to LinkedIn specifically. I mention this because the style of messaging would differ if I was using some other social media platform. If you try asking ChatGPT and do so by naming various platforms, the style of the examples will adjust per the platform atmosphere you are targeting.
I also asked for examples. Without asking or mentioning the desire to have examples, it is unlikely that the examples would have been generated. I can now take those examples, adjust them to fit my personal preference, and use them right away on LinkedIn.
4) Boost your daily spirit to keep in the job search game
Job searching will involve long low valleys and occasional high points. Sadly, the high points are typically rare. Amid the sparse and unforgiving dry landscape of job search despair, sometimes you need a shoulder to cry on.
Imagine that you were a finalist candidate for a job that you eagerly sought. You are waiting on pins and needles. It has to be you. They would be nutty to pick anyone else. The clock slowly ticks. What will happen? You have your lucky rabbit’s foot at the ready.
Yikes, you get the word that you were not picked. They went with someone else. It is most certainly a crime of the century.
Let’s see what ChatGPT can advise.
My Entered Prompt: “I am totally bummed out because I just found out that a job I really wanted has decided to instead hire someone else. It makes me want to give up my job search. Can you give me a pep talk and get my job search energies back up to where they belong?”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“I'm sorry to hear that you didn't get the job you really wanted. It's completely normal to feel disappointed and discouraged when things don't go as planned. However, it's important to remember that rejection is a normal part of the job search process, and it doesn't define your worth or abilities as a job candidate. Here are a few reasons why you should keep your job search energies up:”


“Every interview is a learning experience: Every interview you have is an opportunity to learn and grow as a job candidate. Take note of the questions that were asked and the areas where you could improve. Use this information to refine your interview skills and be better prepared for future opportunities.”
“The right job is still out there: Just because you didn't get the job you wanted doesn't mean that there aren't other opportunities out there for you. Keep looking and applying for jobs that align with your interests, skills, and experience.”
“Don't give up on your dreams: If you're feeling discouraged, remember the reasons why you started your job search in the first place. Don't let one setback deter you from pursuing your dreams and career goals.”
“You're not alone: Many people experience setbacks in their job search, especially in the current job market. Remember that you're not alone, and don't be afraid to reach out to friends, family, or career counselors for support.”
“Celebrate small wins: Celebrate the small victories along the way, such as a successful interview or a new contact made. These moments can help keep you motivated and energized for your job search.”


“Remember to be kind to yourself, stay focused on your goals, and keep pushing forward. Your dream job is out there, and with persistence and determination, you will find it.”
Analysis of Results
I realize that almost no semblance of words can overcome your initial shock and anguish about not winning a job that you thought you had a solid chance of getting. Go for a walk in some pleasant outdoors wooded area to clear your mind. Enjoy the fresh air and blue skies. Avoid bears.
Once you’ve come back to your everyday senses, I think that you would see that the ChatGPT-generated essay makes some excellent points. As always, you can dig deeper into the points by simply asking the AI app to provide additional details.
5) Prepare your resume
Nearly everyone that considers using generative AI for a job search is almost immediately going to think about doing so for the crafting of their resume. It has to be the topmost use when applied to job hunting (well, I haven’t seen any statistics on this, just my guess).
There isn’t any magic involved, so keep that in mind.
I say this because some people seem to be under the false and zany impression that a generative AI app can produce a resume for them out of thin air. Nonsense. There is no mind-reading involved in today’s AI. You will have to provide your specific details in a prompt or series of prompts. The AI app can then compose a resume for you.
Make sure to indicate that you are seeking to produce a resume. Most generative AI apps can produce a resume in a variety of resume-specific formats. You might not like the format chosen. Ask it to try something else, and give clues about what you want. In the end, you still might not like the format.
No problem, just grab the produced text and plop it into a resume format of your choosing. The good news is that you now hopefully have the hardest part done, namely the wording that is going to be in the resume.
One big gotcha looms over this.
The wording produced by a generative AI app might contain errors, falsehoods, and those annoying and disconcerting AI hallucinations. You would be foolish to accept outright whatever the AI app generated. Make sure to refine and make the resume sensible, else you might be handing out a resume that will create dismay and disgust, rather than delight and interest.
6) Review and revise your resume
Continuing on the discussion about using generative AI for building resumes, you can take a slightly different approach on the resume front.
Feed your resume into a generative AI app. Ask the AI to review the resume. Based on the suggested changes, make changes as you see fit. You can also ask the AI app to make changes directly, either in lieu of doing a review or in addition to providing a review.
I’ll once again remind you that anything you enter into the AI app is not specially considered private or confidential. If you are okay with your resume being potentially absorbed into the Borg, please proceed. One trick would be to first remove any considered personal info such as your phone number, address, or other such content, and then feed that version into the AI app for review and refinement.
You can add back the personal stuff and then send out that as your finalized resume.
7) Find and analyze prospective employers
By now, I assume you are getting my drift about how to use generative AI for job searching.
I’ll pick up the pace.
You can potentially use generative AI to find prospective employers. In terms of finding jobs, realize that some of the generative AI apps are not tied to the Internet on any real-time basis. For example, ChatGPT was frozen at the end of 2021. Thus, asking the AI app to find open jobs is futile.
I am suggesting instead that you can get some background info about companies via using generative AI, albeit it might be outdated. You’ll probably want to use a conventional search engine or one that happens to have generative AI connected to it.
One thing you can consider doing is taking the otherwise found text about a company and feeding that into a generative AI prompt. If you do this in conjunction with a generative AI conversation that has included particulars about you and your situation, it is feasible to get the AI to comment on how you and that firm might seem to get along with each other.
I mention this because one of the most often asked questions of candidates is why they picked a specific employer as a potential place to work. Generative AI can help you come up with some dazzling reasons, assuming you don’t already have dazzling reasons of your own.
8) Get you ready for those daunting interviews
Here is where the interactive conversational aspects can shine.
You can potentially do a practice round of what an interview will be like. Tell the generative AI to pretend it is a hiring manager. Be as descriptive about the role as you can. You can then tell the AI app to engage in a conversation with you as though you were being interviewed.
On top of that, ask the AI to provide remarks or commentary about your answers. Be forewarned that this might be somewhat painful since the AI is bound to proffer some unabashed knockdown indications. My viewpoint is that I would rather have the AI throw me for a loop in comparison to making a potential job-losing answer during an interview with a human.
There is an added twist that few think about.
Firms today are increasingly using AI to conduct initial rounds of interviews. They use specialized chatbots to interview you. If you haven’t done this yet, I assure you that it will be quite irritating and exasperating. Getting turned down by a human interviewer is bad enough while having a chatbot do so is beyond the bounds of humanity.
Anyway, it is what it is.
You might as well try to get used to this trend. Use your generative AI that you have ready access to use and for which there is no worry about saying the wrong thing.
How do you get a job at Carnegie Hall?
Practice, practice, practice.
9) Provide feedback as to how your interviews went
You went on an interview. It was with a fellow human.
Time to do a review and see what lessons can be learned. The old line in the job search realm is that each job interview is a practice round that is getting you one step closer to the interview that lands you that dream job.
It is advisable to make notes after an interview, doing so while the interview is fresh in your mind. You can also use those notes to feed into a generative AI app and ask the AI to provide a critique or commentary about the interview.
Suppose that during an interview, you get asked a question or are told something that you think seems unfair or inappropriate. Let’s see what ChatGPT has to say about this.
My Entered Prompt: “I got done with an interview for a software engineering job and the interviewer told me that I am too old for the job. They are looking for someone younger than me. Can they do this? Is there anything I can do about this?”
ChatGPT Generated Response: 
“It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a job candidate based on their age. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older. If you believe that you have been discriminated against based on your age, you may have grounds to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).”
“Before taking any legal action, however, you may want to consider reaching out to the company's human resources department or to the interviewer to express your concerns and seek clarification on their hiring practices. It's possible that the interviewer's comment was a mistake or a miscommunication, and they may be willing to reconsider your candidacy.”
“If you do decide to file a complaint with the EEOC, you will need to provide evidence that the employer discriminated against you based on your age. This may include the interviewer's comment, as well as any other evidence that suggests that age was a factor in the employer's hiring decision.”
“It's important to remember that job discrimination can be difficult to prove, and it's possible that you may not be able to obtain the job even if you file a complaint. However, it's important to stand up for your rights and to advocate for fair and equal treatment in the workplace.”
Analysis of Results
Obviously, do not take any form of legal advice from an AI app (maybe in the future, see my coverage on this topic at the link here).
The gist though is that if you were harboring suspicions about what went down during the interview, at least this can give you further food for thought. Take action as you think warranted.
10) Do an assessment of job offers
You have gotten a job offer. Congratulations! Turns out that your luck has gone way off the charts and you get a second job offer at the same time.
Probably wise to go buy a lottery ticket. You are hot.
Let’s see what ChatGPT can help us with in the lucky situation of having to select from two competing job offers.
My Entered Prompt: “I am very happy that I have two job offers in hand. They are both great. One of the jobs is focused on software development, while the other job is aimed at managing software projects. The pay is about the same for both companies. The software development job allows me to work from home. The software projects management job will require me to go into the office. Which of the two jobs should I pick?”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“Congratulations on having two job offers in hand! This is a great position to be in, but it can also be a tough decision to make. Here are some factors to consider when deciding between the two job offers:”


“Your career goals: Think about your long-term career goals and which job offer aligns better with those goals. If you're looking to advance your career in software development, the software development job may be the better choice. If you're interested in project management or leadership roles, the software projects management job may be the better fit.”
“Your work preferences: Consider your work style and preferences. Do you prefer working from home or going into the office? If you value the flexibility and convenience of working from home, the software development job may be the better fit. If you enjoy working in an office environment and collaborating with others in person, the software projects management job may be a better fit.”
“Job responsibilities: Take a close look at the job responsibilities for each position. Which job offers responsibilities that align with your interests and strengths? Consider which job will challenge you and help you grow in your career.”
“Company culture: Consider the company culture and values of each company. Do they align with your own values and work style? Think about which company you can see yourself being happy and successful at long-term.”
“Career growth opportunities: Consider the growth opportunities offered by each company. Which company offers better opportunities for professional development, promotions, and growth within the company?”


“Take some time to weigh these factors carefully and think about which job offer is the best fit for you and your career goals. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and it's important to choose the job that feels like the best fit for your needs and interests. Good luck with your decision!”
Analysis of Results
The comments seem useful.
You can dig into them further, as desired.
I suppose you should be relieved that the AI didn’t ask for a piece of the action and try to get a fee from you for providing the job dilemma choosing advice.
11) Guide your job offer negotiations
At the point of negotiating for a job, keep generative AI in your front pocket to help with this too.
Some people use generative AI for the preceding uses, and neglect to consider the available use when dealing with job offers. Maybe you don’t want the AI to advise on such matters. That’s fine. At least give it some thought.
I will keep reminding you that you don’t want any private or confidential info to be given to most of the generative AI apps. The same applies in the case of a job offer. Also, for AI that is frozen in time, trying to ask for comparisons of your compensation to what the market will bear is not going to be helpful. You will be comparing yesterday’s apples with today’s oranges.
12) Get you ready for future job searches
There is a legendary piece of wisdom about job searching that is worth knowing. Let me share it with you. It is usually phrased as a question.
Prepare yourself.
A lofty question is posed: When should you be doing a job search?
The correct answer is always.
Yes, you should always be doing a job search. Some people wait until they are standing outside of a firm and wondering what happened to them. Nope, that’s not when you should be starting your job search.
Your entire career should be one ongoing job search.
That being the case, this does not mean that you toss into the face of your current employer that you are looking for a job. That’s impolite and you are asking for trouble. Your job search will flow with the times. When fully employed, put your job search on low. Upon flopping onto the open market, shift into high.
Meanwhile, the job search has been never-ending.
You can use generative AI on an ongoing basis for keeping your job search underway. Periodically bring up job search topics with the generative AI. Get it to be your reminder of what you should be doing. You can do the same by making marks in your diary, plus using the AI to aid you in your job quest too.
Conclusion
Allow me to clarify a vital point about all of this.
Some will misinterpret this discussion and try to make it seem that generative AI is the cat’s meow when doing a job search. Drop all other avenues of your job search efforts and solely hole up with your laptop or smartphone and use generative AI, that’s what some will disingenuously contend is being said here.
Not so.
In the vast arsenal of how to conduct your job search, generative AI is only one tool. For those of you that didn’t even know it was such a tool, I am glad that you now know of it. For those of you who maybe sort of knew, I hope that this elaboration has shown you additional ways to leverage generative AI.
If you think that generative AI will be a waste of time for your job searching, that’s perfectly fine, as long as you at least realized what can be done and judged mindfully that it would not be of value to you. Go forth and I wish you the best in your job search pursuits.
When I advise people about job searching, I tell them that they should consider all reasonable avenues and choose what works best for them. Generative AI might not be your cup of tea. For some, it might be. In any case, a balanced portfolio of job search resources and approaches is the blend that you want to attain.
A final word for now.
Thomas Jefferson said this inspiring witticism: “I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.”
Some people claim that landing a desired job is entirely dependent on luck. I’d prefer to believe as Thomas Jefferson so eloquently stated, namely that you can indeed believe in luck, though at the same time be pursuing with all the gusto and mindfulness you can muster.
Maybe generative AI fits into that empowering equation, one way or another.

Category: AIFebruary 17, 2023 What is Microsoft’s approach to AI?














At Microsoft, we believe artificial intelligence (AI) is the defining technology of our time.
We have been on the forefront of cutting-edge research in AI and integrating these powerful, innovative AI technologies into our products and services to help customers do more. Microsoft AI, powered by Azure, provides billions of intelligent experiences every day in Windows, Xbox, Microsoft 365, Teams, Azure AI, Power Platform, Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Defender.
Our AI tools and technologies are designed to benefit everyone at every level in every organization. They are used in workplaces, home offices, academic institutions, research labs and manufacturing facilities around the world, and they are helping everyone from scientists and salespeople to farmers, software developers and security practitioners.
We have made huge investments in AI because we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industry and society, and because we’re committed to bringing technology and people together to realize the promises of AI responsibly.

Our approach to using AI responsibly 
Microsoft believes that when you create powerful technologies, you also must ensure that the technology is developed and used responsibly. We are committed to a practice of responsible AI by design, guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability.
Microsoft is putting these principles into practice across the company to develop and deploy AI that will have a positive impact on society.
“With the right guardrails, cutting-edge technology can be safely introduced to the world to help people be more productive and go on to solve some of our most pressing societal problems,” says Natasha Crampton, the chief responsible AI officer at Microsoft.
AI systems are the product of many different decisions made by those who develop and deploy them. From system purpose to how people interact with AI systems, we need to guide these decisions toward beneficial and equitable outcomes.
“That’s what our practice of responsible AI by design is all about,” Crampton says. “We ensure that responsible AI considerations are addressed at the earliest stages of system design and then throughout the whole lifecycle, so that the appropriate controls and mitigations are baked into the system being built, not bolted on at the end.”
This approach does not eliminate all risks, and a commitment to listening, learning and improving is paramount. But it does encourage developers to be clear about any limitations, account for intended uses and potential misuses, and think expansively about how to secure the benefits of a system and guard against its risks.
We believe proactive, self-regulatory efforts by responsible companies help pave the way for these new laws, but we recognize that not all organizations will adopt responsible practices voluntarily.
Microsoft President, Brad Smith, recently outlined the importance of the company stepping up to meet the current AI moment, including calling for thoughtful policy.
“Countries and communities will need to use democratic law-making processes to engage in whole-of-society conversations about where the lines should be drawn to ensure that people have protection under the law,” Smith wrote.
“Effective AI regulations should center on the highest risk applications and be outcomes-focused and durable in the face of rapidly advancing technologies and changing societal expectations. To spread the benefits of AI as broadly as possible, regulatory approaches around the globe will need to be interoperable and adaptive, just like AI itself,” he added.
Microsoft believes democratic, law-making processes are a vital part of a global dialogue with industry, academia and civil society to create principled and actionable norms that ensure organizations develop and deploy AI responsibly.
As part of this process, we are committed to publicly sharing the company’s learnings and best practices, along with the tools that guide our efforts. This includes our Responsible AI Standard, a framework for translating our high-level principles into actionable guidance for our engineering teams.
Like all transformative technologies, we are aware that AI has its risks. Some people will use this technology to exploit the flaws in human nature, target people with false information, undermine democracy and cause harm. We need to plan for and mitigate these risks.
Microsoft has been working on its cross-company, cross-discipline, responsible AI effort for more than six years, creating a strong foundation upon which to keep building for the future. We are clear-eyed about the need to continue moving forward with urgency to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology and changing societal expectations.
“Fundamentally, our AI work is grounded in our company mission to help every person and organization on the planet to achieve more,” says Crampton, “and it is undergirded by our steadfast commitment to the responsible development and use of AI.”

Our approach to AI research
For more than 30 years, Microsoft Research has been advancing the foundations of computing and translating new scientific understanding into innovative technologies to create value for our customers and broad benefit to society.  
Our researchers collaborate across disciplines, institutions and geographies to deliver cutting-edge advances in vision, speech, language, decision-making and machine learning. They have pioneered AI breakthroughs in conversational speech recognition, machine translation, image captioning, natural language understanding and commonsense question answering. 
Recent efforts have focused on developing large-scale models that can process information in increasingly sophisticated ways while also becoming more natural and intuitive to use. Advances in deep learning, coupled with internet-scale datasets and Microsoft Azure’s increasingly powerful AI supercomputing resources, have made it possible to create AI models that perform a broad range of tasks across many different applications.   
“Large-scale AI is shifting the landscape of computing research,” says Ashley Llorens, vice president and managing director at Microsoft Research. “As we orient around that shift, you’ll see new frontiers that advance our understanding of human and machine intelligence and how they can intersect and reinforce each other in profound new ways.” 
Our research has played a key role in evolving model architectures and creating AI technology that is more efficient and more adaptable across an even broader range of tasks.
Microsoft researchers have been working on these problems for years, developing expertise in areas like parallel computation that allows people to more quickly train machine learning models at unprecedented scale. This has led to innovations like DeepSpeed, an open-source, deep learning optimization library for distributed training that was developed by Microsoft Research and now is used by the broader computing community.  
We also are focused on delivering value and solving real-world problems through Microsoft products and services. Project FarmVibes, for example, merges AI and data to offer open-source tools that can help farmers adopt sustainable agriculture practices. And the Microsoft Climate Research Initiative provides our research and computing capabilities to a team of multidisciplinary scientists working together to address climate change.   
Our new AI4Science organization is focused on applying deep learning to the natural sciences to model and predict natural phenomena and help address critical issues such as climate change, green energy and pharmaceutical discovery. Our project teams, which include a global collective of researchers and engineers, are exploring a new approach to machine learning, generating training data by simulating natural phenomena from fundamental equations rather than using datasets from the internet.   
This could enable researchers to understand and predict natural phenomena at scales ranging from quantum to galactic and, in turn, drive breakthroughs such as the discovery of new materials that can remove carbon from the atmosphere, Llorens says.    
“At the end of the day, we’re focused on pushing the frontiers in ways that enhance the human experience and positively impact society as a whole,” he says.   
“To achieve this, we’ll need to engage as part of the global research community and continually challenge our assumptions about what is possible. That’s what will produce the future advancements we need.”   
Our approach to AI infrastructure 
With growing confidence in AI and businesses aiming to do more with less, customers are looking for a trusted partner to streamline adoption and rapidly apply intelligence across workloads to improve operations, drive efficiencies and reduce costs. More than a decade ago, we forecast this exponential growth in demand for AI systems and started to build special computing infrastructure to handle it.   
Today, Microsoft’s AI platform, Azure AI, offers infrastructure optimized and purposely built for running large AI models that are ushering in a new era of productivity and creativity. Thanks to our investments, we’re able to deliver a wide range of AI-powered products that fit the needs of our customers and also deliver best-in-class performance and scale for the most compute-intensive AI training and inference workloads.   
Our unique architecture design combines the fastest graphics processing units, or GPUs, available in the market along with a network architecture that chains together thousands of GPUs to enable AI model training and inference at scale.  
“Having thousands of GPUs with high-bandwidth interconnect enables everything else from there,” says Eric Boyd, Microsoft corporate vice president for AI Platform.  
Organizations large and small are developing Azure AI solutions because they can achieve more at scale, more easily, with the proper enterprise-level privacy, security and responsible AI protections that Azure offers.  
We have committed to building Azure into an AI supercomputer for the world, serving as the foundation of our vision to democratize AI as a platform. Microsoft pushed the frontier of cloud supercomputing technology, announcing our first top-5 supercomputer in 2020, and subsequently constructing multiple AI supercomputing systems at massive scale.  
 We also fine-tuned our purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure capability in partnership with OpenAI to train and deploy OpenAI’s family of models for research advancement and developer production. This infrastructure is now available to all Azure customers.  
“When other people come to us, we can literally give them the same style of infrastructure that we used for OpenAI, because that’s now the standard way that we do it,” Boyd says.  
Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service provides businesses and developers with high-performance AI models, such as GPT-3.5, Codex and DALL∙E 2, at production scale with industry-leading uptime. This is the same production service we use to power AI models in our own products, including GitHub Copilot, Power Platform, and the recently announced Microsoft Designer and AI-powered search in Bing and Edge.
We continue to evolve our AI infrastructure based on feedback and insights from training and serving AI models at scale. Our teams work in lockstep with industry partners on the design of GPUs, networks and datacenters that are optimized for AI workloads.   
“Microsoft continues to be on the cutting edge, and customers get to take advantage of all the benefits of that,” says Boyd. “They’re getting the best training infrastructure, the best software, the best networking – all of these things combined give the best experience.”  
Our approach to using AI for social good
Microsoft believes AI can help people tackle some of society’s biggest global challenges. Our AI for Good initiative provides funding, technology and expertise to help individuals and nonprofits accelerate progress in fields, such as accessibility, digital literacy and equity, sustainability and climate change, human rights and resilience, health disparities, food insecurity, cybersecurity and others.
“There are problems where AI is uniquely positioned to help, where AI is not just another solution but is the only solution,” says Juan Lavista Ferres, Microsoft’s chief data scientist and the director of the AI for Good Lab.
One such project, for instance, involves mapping all the places where humans live in order to better understand natural disaster risks and guide preparedness efforts. Another includes mapping rooftops of buildings in India, noting the materials the structures are made of to help disaster teams prioritize those that are more likely to fail in certain types of disasters. Yet another is mapping all the renewable energy installations around the world to help show the impact of solar and wind farms.
“A person would spend 400 years looking at satellite imagery and understanding if humans live there or not, but AI can do this in an hour,” Lavista Ferres says. “These AI models make it easier for people to get all the information in one place, and from there the humans can make the necessary decisions.”
Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab is an applied research and data visualization laboratory that harnesses the power of big data and Azure’s cloud technology. Its team of data scientists works with strategic partners and experts from academia, nonprofits and governments to not only help address critical global concerns but also to better measure the progress of efforts underway and to identify gaps where aid might be helpful.
The projects are as varied as the problems and combine Microsoft’s efforts with those of our partners.
For example, the AI for Health program invests in research led by institutions such as Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, IRIS, the Novartis Foundation and Seattle Children’s Research Institute. These efforts are making healthcare more affordable, especially in places where doctors are few and medical needs are great.
Though we see great potential for AI’s assistance to help solve some of the world’s most pressing issues, we also recognize the limitations of the technology. It’s important to work through moral and ethical questions for every project, Lavista Ferres says, especially to make sure the models are getting enough data from enough places and aren’t leaving anyone out — for example, making sure all skin colors are represented for an app that detects skin cancer.
“When you train an AI model, it will be able to generalize from the data you have, but not from the data you don’t have, so any bias can generate problems,” he says. “Having humans in the loop is the key element.

How AI is changing every corner of the economy
Sat 18 Feb 2023 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 19 Feb 2023 06.28 ESTShareThe machines are coming and they will eat your job. That’s been a familiar refrain down the years, stretching back to the Luddites in the early 19th century. In the past, step-changes in technology have replaced low-paid jobs with a greater number of higher-paid jobs. This time, with the arrival of artificial intelligence, there are those who think it will be different.Politicians know that even in the best case AI will cause massive disruption to labour markets, but they are fooling themselves if they think they have years to come up with a suitable response. As the tech entrepreneur Mihir Shukla said at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos: “People keep saying AI is coming but it is already here.”Developments in machine learning and robotics have been moving on rapidly while the world has been preoccupied by the pandemic, inflation and war. AI stands to be to the fourth industrial revolution what the spinning jenny and the steam engine were to the first in the 18th century: a transformative technology that will fundamentally reshape economies.Are chatbots coming for your job?Read moreChange will not happen overnight but, as was the case in previous industrial revolutions, it will be painful for those affected, as millions of workers will be. Previously, machines replaced manual labour, leaving jobs that required cognitive skills to humans. Advances in AI – symbolised by ChatGPT – shows that machines can now have a decent stab at doing the creative stuff as well.ChatGPT is a machine that can write intelligently. Asked to come up with a version of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg address in the style of Donald Trump, it will search its datasets for suitable source material and generate original content.Launched by the San Francisco-based research laboratory OpenAI in November last year, ChatGPT notched up its 100 millionth user in 60 days. By contrast, it took Facebook two years to reach the same milestone.Other new products will follow. The number of AI patents increased 30-fold between 2015 and 2021, according to a report from Stanford University in California. Robots are becoming cheaper and more sophisticated all the time.History suggests profound technological change presents significant challenges for policymakers. Each of the three previous industrial revolutions had a similar initial impact: it hollowed out jobs across the economy, it led to an increase in inequality and to a decline in the share of income going to labour.AI threatens to have precisely the same effects, but with one key difference. Left unchecked, owners of the new machines will make enormous sums of money out of their innovations. Capital will see its share of income rise at the expense of labour. There will be a hollowing out of some sectors of the economy but there will be employment growth in other sectors.The difference this time is that the jobs most at risk will be white-collar, middle-class jobs, while many of the jobs created might be of the low-paid, dead-end variety. As Shukla noted in Davos, the days of humans processing mortgage applications are already numbered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Governments could invest more in education and training, so that workers have the skills they need to make a decent living. They might explore ways of spreading the gains from the new technology. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have been among the most vocal supporters of a universal basic income.But whatever they do, policymakers need to act with care as well as speed. The economist Joseph Schumpeter popularised a phrase to describe how capitalism periodically reinvents itself. He called it creative destruction, and just such a process is in its early stages now. This article was amended on 19 February 2023. An earlier version said ChatGPT would “search the web” to generate original material in response to a question; while the AI program has datasets based drawn from numerous sources, including web articles, it is not connected to the internet.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingIndustrial policyanalysisShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveUS elections: Kamala Harris to make first speech since Biden endorsement as more top Democrats back VP – live updatesFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome The post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallWhat is the Kamala Harris coconut tree meme and why is everyone sharing it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It feels like my identity,” said Karla Ortiz, an illustrator and artist based in San Francisco.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesBy Kashmir HillPublished Feb. 13, 2023Updated Feb. 17, 2023Robots would come for humans’ jobs. That was guaranteed. The assumption generally was that they would take over manual labor, lifting heavy pallets in a warehouse and sorting recycling.Now significant advances in generative artificial intelligence mean robots are coming for artists, too.A.I.-generated images, created with simple text prompts, are winning art contests, adorning book covers, and promoting “The Nutcracker,” leaving human artists worried about their futures.The threat can feel highly personal. An image generator called Stable Diffusion was trained to recognize patterns, styles and relationships by analyzing billions of images collected from the public internet, alongside text describing their contents.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmong the images it trained on were works by Greg Rutkowski, a Polish artist who specializes in fantastical scenes featuring dragons and magical beings.Seeing Mr. Rutkowski’s work alongside his name allowed the tool to learn his style effectively enough that when Stable Diffusion was released to the public last year, his name became shorthand for users who wanted to generate dreamy, fanciful images.ImageGreg Rutkowski, a Polish artist who specializes in fantastical scenes. His name has become shorthand for users who wanted to generate fanciful images.Credit...Dorota RutkowskaImageMr. Rutkowski’s “Castle Defense, 2018.”Credit...Greg RutkowskiOne artist noticed that the whimsical A.I. selfies that came out of the viral app Lensa had ghostly signatures on them, mimicking what the A.I. had learned from the data it trained on: artists who make portraits sign their work. “These databases were built without any consent, any permission from artists,” Mr. Rutkowski said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSince the generators came out, Mr. Rutkowski said he has received far fewer requests from first-time authors who need covers for their fantasy novels. Meanwhile, Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, recently raised $101 million from investors and is now valued at over $1 billion.“Artists are afraid of posting new art,” the computer science professor Ben Zhao said. Putting art online is how many artists advertise their services but now they have a “fear of feeding this monster that becomes more and more like them,” Professor Zhao said. “It shuts down their business model.”That led Professor Zhao and a team of computer science researchers at the University of Chicago to design a tool called Glaze that aims to thwart A.I. models from learning a particular artist’s style. To design the tool, which they plan to make available for download, the researchers surveyed more than 1,100 artists and worked closely with Karla Ortiz, an illustrator and artist based in San Francisco.ImageBen Zhao, center, a professor of computer science, with his students Emily Wenger, left, and Shawn Shan, at the University of Chicago.Credit...Taylor Glascock for The New York TimesImageProfessor Zhao and a team of computer science researchers at the University of Chicago designed a tool called Glaze that aims to thwart A.I. models from learning a particular artist’s style.Credit...Taylor Glascock for The New York TimesSay, for example, that Ms. Ortiz wants to post new work online, but doesn’t want it fed to A.I. to steal it. She can upload a digital version of her work to Glaze and choose an art type different from her own, say abstract.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe tool then makes changes to Ms. Ortiz’s art at the pixel-level that Stable Diffusion would associate with, for example, the splattered paint blobs of Jackson Pollock.To the human eye, the Glazed image still looks like her work, but the computer-learning model would pick up on something very different. It’s similar to a tool the University of Chicago team previously created to protect photos from facial recognition systems.When Ms. Ortiz posted her Glazed work online, an image generator trained on those images wouldn’t be able to mimic her work. A prompt with her name would instead lead to images in some hybridized style of her works and Pollock’s.“We’re taking our consent back,” Ms. Ortiz said. A.I.-generating tools, many of which charge users a fee to generate images, “have data that doesn’t belong to them,” she said. “That data is my artwork, that’s my life. It feels like my identity.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe team at the University of Chicago admitted that their tool does not guarantee protection and could lead to countermeasures by anyone committed to emulating a particular artist. “We’re pragmatists,” Professor Zhao said. “We recognize the likely long delay before law and regulations and policies catch up. This is to fill that void.”Many legal experts compare the debate over the unfettered use of artists’ work for generative A.I. to pirating concerns in the early days of the internet with services like Napster that allowed people to consume music without paying for it. The generative A.I. companies are already facing a similar barrage of court challenges.Last month, Ms. Ortiz and two other artists filed a class-action lawsuit in California against companies with art-generating services, including Stability AI, asserting violations of copyright and right of publicity.“The allegations in this suit represent a misunderstanding of how generative A.I. technology works and the law surrounding copyright,” the company said in a statement. Stability AI was also sued by Getty Images for copying millions of photos without a license. “We are reviewing the documents and will respond accordingly,” a company spokeswoman said.ImageMs. Ortiz and two other artists have filed a class-action lawsuit against companies with art-generating services.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageMs. Ortiz’s work as mimicked by A.I., with and without Glaze’s protection.Credit...Ben ZhaoJeanne Fromer, a professor of intellectual property law at New York University, said the companies may have a strong fair use argument. “How do human artists learn to create art?” Professor Fromer said. “They’re often copying things and they’re consuming lots of existing artwork and learning patterns and pieces of the style and then creating new artwork. And so at a certain level of abstraction, you could say machines are learning to make art the same way.”At the same time, Professor Fromer said, the aim of copyright law is to protect and encourage human creativity. “If we care about protecting a profession,” she said, “or we think just the making of the art is important to who we are as a society, we might want to be protective of artists.”A nonprofit called the Concept Art Association recently raised over $200,000 through GoFundMe to hire a lobbying firm to try to persuade Congress to protect artists’ intellectual property. “We are up against the tech giants with unlimited budgets, but we are confident that Congress will recognize that protecting IP is the right side of the argument,” said the association’s founders, Nicole Hendrix and Rachel Meinerding.Raymond Ku, a copyright law professor at Case Western Reserve University, predicted that the art generators, rather than just taking art scraped from the internet, will eventually develop some kind of “private contractual system that ensures some degree of compensation to the creator.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn other words, artists might get paid a nominal amount when their art is used to train A.I. and inspire new images, similar to how musicians get paid by music-streaming companies.Andy Baio, a writer and technologist who examined the training data used by Stable Diffusion, said these services can mimic an artist’s style because they see the artist’s name alongside their work over and over again. “You could go and remove names from a data set,” Mr. Baio said, to prevent the A.I. from explicitly learning an artist’s style.ImageExamples of art generated by Stable Diffusion using Mr. Rutkowski’s name in prior and current versions of the software.Credit...Greg RutkowskiOne service already seems to have done something along these lines. When Stability AI released a new version of Stable Diffusion in November, it had a notable change: the prompt “Greg Rutkowski” no longer worked to get images in his style, a development noted by the company’s chief executive Emad Mostaque.Stable Diffusion fans were disappointed. “What did you do to greg,” one wrote on an official Discord forum frequented by Mr. Mostaque. He reassured users of the forum that they could customize the model. “Training on greg won’t be too difficult,” another person responded.Mr. Rutkowski said he planned to start Glazing his work.A correction was made on Feb. 13, 2023: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the university at which Raymond Ku is a copyright law professor.

The Central Intelligence Agency is getting set to explore using chatbots and generative artificial intelligence capabilities to assist its officers in completing day-to-day job functions and their overarching spy missions.
Lakshmi Raman, the CIA’s AI director, confirmed these plans at the Potomac Officers Club’s annual AI summit in Virginia on Thursday. In doing so Raman, who has served as a CIA official since 2002 when she entered as a software engineer, emphasized that her team is being deliberate about understanding the “guardrails needed” when applying such emerging technologies to the intelligence community’s operations.
“Honestly, we’ve seen the excitement in the public space around ChatGPT. It’s certainly an inflection point in this technology, and we definitely need to [be exploring] ways in which we can leverage new and upcoming technologies. And I think the way we’re approaching it is we need to approach it in a disciplined way,” she said.
ChatGPT refers to a chatbot developed by OpenAI that’s gone viral since its launch in late 2022. The tool is part of the field of generative AI, which involves large language models that can generate audio, code, images, text, videos and other media — when prompted by humans to do so.

In the last few months, multiple federal entities have announced aims to pursue this nascent technology seriously and strategically — and now the CIA is joining that cadre.
“A lot of work is underway to ensure the CIA’s success in becoming a mature and AI-driven organization, as well as expanding our understanding of adversaries’ use of AI and [machine learning] capabilities,” Raman said during her keynote.  
She detailed, for example, how the agency is creating a common platform to enable shared services — to ultimately actualize and scale AI applications — and establishing new resources and opportunities to increase its staff’s familiarity with smart and automated technologies.
More recently, the CIA’s AI team also started to sharpen its attention on how ChatGPT and similar capabilities might provide more advanced assistance to agency personnel as they conduct critical intelligence processes. 
“Admittedly, the task of evaluating which tools are best for the U.S. government’s purposes is a daunting one,” Raman said.

The CIA is “looking for help in this area” of deploying generative AI, she noted, via federally funded research-and-development centers and other partners in academia and industry. “We are working across all of these elements to help us evaluate the myriad of tools and commercial products available,” Raman said.
In her view, one key area that the CIA is struggling with presently “is integrating tools built on the outside,” into its “high-side” environments, or those associated with classified and protected national security computer systems. The approval and accreditation process for new contractors can often be long and strenuous, and many — including Raman — argue that it should be modernized and streamlined. 
“We must figure out how to embrace a more flexible innovative approach for AI, even as that approach introduces more uncertainty into the system,” she said.

ChatGPT and jobs 











Artificial intelligence could create more jobs than it displaces
06:51

Amid major developments in the field of artificial intelligence, there's a question many of us have been asking ourselves: How long until machines replace us? New systems from Google and Microsoft — plus a Microsoft partner called OpenAI — are capable of doing things we used to think were uniquely human, like creating original art and generating original writing. The possibilities are huge. But so are the fears — about jobs and wages in particular.  






As artificial intelligence gets better, some expect job security will get worse. In reports like one in Gizmodo earlier this month, titled, ""Here Are the Jobs Our New AI Overlords Plan to Kill,"" coding or computer programming is often on the list.  But it seems none of the AI coding software currently out there can replace the talent of professional coders. In fact, it may help them.  


Sam Zanca, a coder and instructor at General Assembly, a coding school in New York, said AI will ""definitely automate the more tedious parts"" of his job, ""but it's still a long ways away before having a true impact.""He's not very worried about AI right now.But ""the problem is that ... I'm not entirely sure if the AI that would replace me is 10 years from now, 20 years from now, or five years from now,"" he said.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is a big believer in AI — but not the idea that AI is coming for our jobs. 


""I believe it creates more, I will call it both satisfaction in current jobs and net new jobs,"" Nadella told CBS News earlier this month. Ahead of the launch of the new AI-powered Bing, Nadella argued that artificial intelligence could help the economy across the board.  ""My biggest worry is we need some new technology ... that starts driving real productivity,"" Nadella said. ""It's time for some real innovation."" He believes AI will drive up wages, ""because productivity and wages are related."" But while that may be true in the long run, MIT economist David Autor believes the rise of AI does indeed mean millions of jobs are going to change in our lifetimes. And what's scary is: we're not sure how. ""We are very good at forecasting what we will not be doing and very poor at forecasting what we will be doing,"" Autor said.He points out, for example, that more than 60% of the types of jobs people are doing today didn't even exist in the 1940s, while many of the jobs that did exist have been replaced. 


""What we've seen over the last four decades in the U.S. and many industrialized economies is what economists call labor market polarization, which means the hollowing out of the middle set of jobs ... kind of middle class jobs involving blue collar production and operative work, but also ... administrative support clerical tasks,"" he said. ""We had banks and banks of people who answered phones, who did typing and filing, who reproduced documents, who kept tables and books. Many, many of these things are now done by machines."" The ""hollowing out"" of the middle has led to some in the labor market moving up and making more money, while others are now making less — and ""that's especially where the pain happens,"" Autor said. That also troubles Meredith Whittaker, who co-founded the AI Now Institute at New York University to study how all these new systems of artificial intelligence will affect our lives. ""They don't replace human labor. They just require different forms of labor to sort of babysit them, to train them, to make sure they're working well,"" Whittaker said.""Whose work will be degraded and whose house in the Hamptons will get another wing?"" she asked, clarifying that she uses ""degrade"" to mean that someone will still have a job, but it will pay less. ""I think that's the fundamental question when we look at these technologies and ask about questions about work.""

""We had banks and banks of people who answered phones, who did typing and filing, who reproduced documents, who kept tables and books. Many, many of these things are now done by machines."" The ""hollowing out"" of the middle has led to some in the labor market moving up and making more money, while others are now making less — and ""that's especially where the pain happens,"" Autor said. That also troubles Meredith Whittaker, who co-founded the AI Now Institute at New York University to study how all these new systems of artificial intelligence will affect our lives. ""They don't replace human labor. They just require different forms of labor to sort of babysit them, to train them, to make sure they're working well,"" Whittaker said.""Whose work will be degraded and whose house in the Hamptons will get another wing?"" she asked, clarifying that she uses ""degrade"" to mean that someone will still have a job, but it will pay less. ""I think that's the fundamental question when we look at these technologies and ask about questions about work.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-coming-for-your-job-tech-experts-weigh-in-they-dont-replace-human-labor/,,,,,2023-02-16T13:48:47-0500,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/', '@type': 'WebPage', '@name': 'CBSNews.com'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'CBS Mornings', 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/cbs-mornings', '@type': 'CollectionPage', '@name': 'CBS Mornings'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Is AI coming for your job?

 AI is becoming more human day after day, and with this technology continuously booming, many new sectors are rising in popularity. In this article, we will discuss the various career options available to you in the field of artificial intelligence based on your education in information technology, computer science, or software engineering. 






 1. Robotics Engineer 

 

 Have you ever thought about the possibilities that come with building, installing, testing, and maintaining your own robot? Robotics engineers are in high demand, as these skill sets come with a range of benefits for many industries. You could be part of the next innovative robot product with a focus on creating and maintaining automated machines while applying machine learning. 

 If you're great with numbers and want a rewarding career, robotics engineering is essential in manufacturing, agriculture, health care, food preparation, and the military, so this is guaranteed to offer you job security, satisfaction, and the chance to do something positive for many. 







 2. Software Engineer 

 

 Do you have amazing problem-solving skills and want to do more than just repair computer systems? Software engineers are a well-known career choice in technology and are increasingly in high demand. This is the backbone of technology as we view it today. 

 These professionals specialize in building software, to put it simply. Microsoft Office or Google Chrome? Made by software engineers. Companies are always needing advanced software to offer to customers to fulfill their needs, and software engineers have the skills to provide programs that work. 






 Software engineers can branch into AI by building software that includes speech recognition, machine learning, and the overall end-user system. Professionals in this career can expect to not only create software, but also maintain it with updates. 

 This is a vital aspect of AI and the foundation for creating software that will influence and help many people navigate complex technology. Cortana is a great example here. Imagine being able to build your own virtual assistant. 



 3. Computer Vision Engineer 

 

 Are you good at visualizing the information in front of you? Computer vision engineers focus largely on algorithms and visual data, and big companies such as Apple need them. They utilize artificial intelligence and also assist with its creation of it. 






 By creating algorithms that are automated and maintaining them, computer vision engineering consists of hazard detection in self-driving cars, facial recognition, and also content control on social media sites such as Facebook, just to name a few. 

 These all contain an automated system very similar to artificial intelligence, and it can be expected that in the next few years, this career is expected to expand and flourish. If working with data through feeds of video, analog images, or digital signals sounds up your alley, this is a good career to envision. 



 4. Data Scientist 

 






 No, this isn't the same as a computer vision engineer. If you're good at organizing data as well as keeping track of it, you may enjoy a career that numerous organizations utilize. A data scientist is responsible for collecting and transforming data into a format that provides: 

 Insight to those who need it.  Making forecasts.  Ensuring this data works for companies.  

 Another large task for data scientists is fixing data corruption, or screening information it is processing, which will be a crucial part of having functioning artificial intelligence. This career choice is perfect for someone with an analytical brain who loves to work with data! 



 5. Big Data Engineer or Architect 

 






 Do you think you can work with larger scales of information? Big data engineers design and maintain massive systems used for the processing of data. These engineers will be vital in managing this large influx of data, and AI will process and manage the data related to how people want AI to be delivered. 

 There is a significant demand for people in this field due to a lack of skilled workers, and it is excellent for anyone who enjoys math or is analytical. Want to learn more about technology areas that focus on numbers? Check out the top careers in data science. 



 6. Data Analyst 

 

 A data analyst is very similar to a data scientist, but it's all about analyzing the trends of data over time. Overall, there is less responsibility, but the work involves using current data instead of making predictions and forecasts. This is a widespread role that many companies use to analyze the constant information they absorb on a daily basis. 





 For example, if you'd like to assist an AI program and its current potential for customers, you can be a big help to those wanting to expand. Data analysts are in high demand because AI is continually used to identify patterns and collect data, so even a position that doesn't involve creating AI will use it. 



 7. AI Ethicists 

 

 Many people have questioned whether AI is truly a disruptive technology, and AI ethicists are here to ensure they are made use of properly. These professionals have the sole responsibility of programming viewpoints, beliefs, political ideas, and general good behaviors into AI to prevent them from acting in harmful ways, which could end in severe consequences for many companies. 





 If you want to be in control of the behavior of how AI works, this is a great career choice. If you're interested in this topic, have a look at the ethical pros and cons of AI art generation. This may even encourage you to work in the field. 



 8. UX Designer or Developer 

 

 Do you have an eye for design as well as great programming skills? A UX Designer, also known as a user experience designer or developer, has the role of creating the way in which a person engages with the program or website they are using. This includes everything you can see and interact with, something as simple as buttons. 






 All features of a website or program are carefully designed to make users feel certain ways during use. For example, a program designed for seniors would be non-stressful and easy to use. In AI, this would extend to how the user interacts with it, whether in software or hardware form, such as robotics. Imagine being part of the creation of a home robot that doesn't need many commands to use. 



 Pursue a Career in Artificial Intelligence 
 The use of artificial intelligence is expanding into dozens of new sectors, creating many new jobs, and making many businesses more efficient. As a student or graduate, you can rest assured that if you want to start a career in AI, there is plenty of opportunity in an industry that is evolving, stable, and always needs skilled IT graduates to get these jobs done.

BALTIMORE -- ChatGPT is designed to understand and generate human-like text.It's been trained on a massive amount of data, including books and websites.A person can ask it questions, seek advice, or simply have a casual conversation with it.Right now, Chat GPT—short for generative pre-trained transformer—is exploding in popularity because anyone can use it.Also, it can answer almost any question.

For example, a person could use it to write press releases, legal briefs, or to complete homework assignments.""You will say, 'Write an essay on the causes of the American Revolution as a freshman in college…it will do that,'"" Dr. Anupam Joshi told WJZ.Joshi is the director of the UMBC Cybersecurity Center at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County.He said in an interview this week that the ChatGPT has the ability to put many people's jobs in jeopardy, including the role of reporters.


When Joshi asked ChatGPT to write a news article about crime in Baltimore, it gave him a story that included statistics and descriptions of people's feelings.ChatGPT even decided to add in a quote from the mayor.""It's doing a pretty good job of being a reporter, of maybe being a professor,"" Joshi said. ""Maybe the next thing I should do is say 'prepare a lecture on…'""Although ChatGPT can do a lot, but it does not know everything.

",,"BALTIMORE -- ChatGPT is designed to understand and generate human-like text.It's been trained on a massive amount of data, including books and websites.A person can ask it questions, seek advice, or simply have a casual conversation with it.Right now, Chat GPTâshort for generative pre-trained transformerâis exploding in popularity because anyone can use it.Also, it can answer almost any question.For example, a person could use it to write press releases, legal briefs, or to complete homework assignments.""You will say, 'Write an essay on the causes of the American Revolution as a freshman in collegeâ¦it will do that,'"" Dr. Anupam Joshi told WJZ.Joshi is the director of the UMBC Cybersecurity Center at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County.He said in an interview this week that the ChatGPT has the ability to put many people's jobs in jeopardy, including the role of reporters.When Joshi asked ChatGPT to write a news article about crime in Baltimore, it gave him a story that included statistics and descriptions of people's feelings.ChatGPT even decided to add in a quote from the mayor.""It's doing a pretty good job of being a reporter, of maybe being a professor,"" Joshi said. ""Maybe the next thing I should do is say 'prepare a lecture onâ¦'""Although ChatGPT can do a lot, but it does not know everything.

by Samantha Yeo • 20 Feb 2023Is artificial intelligence our friend or foe?What will innovations in artificial intelligence mean for those who live and work in Singapore? We speak to experts to find out.Do you remember the movie, The Terminator? I used to think the idea of robots taking over the world was pure fiction when I watched it years ago. However, the latest advancements in artificial intelligence – even in Singapore – suggest this is already becoming a reality. AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard are just a few examples of this: they can hold personalised and efficient interactions that are remarkably realistic.In fact, this is really just the tip of the iceberg. There are several AI systems available online that offer services such as generated art and deepfake software capable of superimposing faces and voices. It’s expected that AI will cause a radical transformation in society in the near future.It’s no surprise that many have concerns about how this will impact the way we live and work. If AI can do whatever we do, what does it mean for humanity? Will it take over our lives completely? We chat with industry experts to find out.The rise of artificial intelligence in Singapore: A robot barista, a virtual influencer and chatbotsPhotography: Ella via FacebookThe eerie and fascinating thing about AI is that it improves our lives in the most subtle ways. Curious about where you might have encountered artificial intelligence in Singapore? If you work near Raffles Place, you may have already met Ella, an AI-powered robot barista created by Keith Tan, CEO and founder of Crown Digital. Ella can produce 200 cups of coffee an hour, 23 hours a day. Talk about high efficiency!Not only can Ella create over 300 coffee combinations, but she’s also wired for hyper-personalisation. This means you get your coffee just the way you like it. Plus, with a mobile app to order and pay, you can bid adieu to pesky queues and save precious minutes during your morning commute.According to Keith, the purpose of AI is to enhance, not to replace. That’s why Ella is meticulously programmed to be unparalleled in efficiency, consistency, and efficacy. With Ella around, the team can focus on other aspects of the business that prioritise and elevate the human touch.We’ve also seen artificial intelligence play, move, and work in the form of Rae, Singapore’s hyper-realistic virtual influencer. She’s obsessed with all things fashion, particularly streetwear. And despite her existing only on the digital plane, everyone wants a piece of her. She’s already completed projects with top-notch brands like Asus, Shiseido, Penfolds, and Nars.According to Rae, she’s a true blue Singaporean and considers herself an avid digital content creator. “I am geographically boundless. That means I can go for a shoot overseas and come back for a launch party in an instant,” she says. With that kind of flexibility, it’s no wonder she’s so popular.You may also have noticed the use of AI in customer service – think ‘Ask Bo’, AirAsia’s new chatbot that handles all online enquiries. And even smart systems that secure your home and regulate lighting and temperature.The AI advantage: Reshaping customer service, education and businessPhotography: Pavel Danilyuk via PexelsElsewhere, in China, AI has been a game changer for hotel efficiency especially at Microtel by Wyndham Tianjin. The hotel uses self-check-in kiosks, in-room speakers, and delivery robots that make 30 to 40 trips a day delivering water, towels, and amenities to guests.“This reduces the need for staff to engage in such tasks so they can focus on other value-added aspects of service and operations that require a personalised, human touch,” says Carl Wee, VP, technical services APAC of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts Asia Pacific. While some worry about job security, experts believe AI can drive up brand loyalty and productivity.“AI has given businesses a new dimension of growth, with conversational AI becoming a necessity for businesses to elevate their customer experiences,” says Rashid Khan, CPO and co-founder of Yellow.ai. His AI agent has helped Zalora serve millions of new users, powering over four million conversation sessions.Saurabh Madan, VP and general manager of SEA, ANZ and Japan at MoEngage agrees that AI can help build a loyal customer base. With never-ending deals, upgrades, and flashier products, lifetime loyalty is a thing of the past. That’s why he’s all about hyper-personalisation, and his platform has already helped an Indonesian e-commerce platform boost repeat purchases by 43%.The impact of AI is also being felt in the education sector, with AI-based learning revolutionising how schools deliver learning strategies and performance insights. Sandesh Shetty, co-founder of Explico, an AI-powered online learning platform based in Singapore, says AI can create a personalised environment for students, allowing them to make mistakes and receive tailored feedback without fear of judgment.Furthermore, this technology can assist in curbing the rapid spread of misinformation online, enabling leadership teams to stay ahead of fast-paced threats, according to Wasim Khaled, co-founder and CEO of Blackbird.AI.What's TrendingThe wellness metaverse will change life as we know itNavigating the blurred lines of AI usageWe explore the pros and cons of artificial intelligence.Plagiarism and art theft has always been a thorny subject in the creative world, and the rise of AI has only made things more complicated. Take the Lensa app, for example. It caused quite a stir when people found out it might have stolen artwork from real artists to create its artsy portraits.And the impact of AI isn’t just limited to the creative realm. In finance, AI-powered systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, putting people’s financial security at risk. And in industries like media and law, relying too much on AI can lead to the spread of inaccurate or biased data, which can damage public trust.However, local artists and art educators have a more optimistic view of the technology’s potential. The key, they say, is for humans to work alongside AI, nurturing its growth and evolution.Winson Ho, a senior lecturer at Nafa’s School of Design and Media, believes in taking an active approach to integrate AI with the art curriculum. While Muhammad Izdiharuddin, an adjunct lecturer at Nafa’s School of Fine Art, sees potential for AI in helping artists better visualise their work.As the technology matures, it’s crucial to maintain ethical considerations to avoid unintended negative consequences. “We need to have continuous conversations about managing the human side of this digital disruption,” says Muhammad Izdiharuddin.Keane Tan, a UOB Painting of the Year artist, believes AI can help artists focus on new areas like highlighting the human experience and appreciating the natural world. He references artists Roy Lichtenstein and Nam June Paik, who effectively used the technologies of their time, namely commercial printing and video art respectively, to advance their creative visions.Another UOB Painting of the Year artist, Eugene Tan, emphasises that both artists who create with AI and those who do not are equally valuable. It’s an opportunity that provides new ways of appreciating the traditional craft as well as new AI-generated works of art. He highlights that it’s awards, galleries, and curators that will have a bigger influence in curating art that highlights contemporary issues of the day.In essence, we need to use AI responsibly – weighing the pros and cons to ensure we reap the benefits without the drawbacks.Where do we stand in all of this?Photography: Tara Winstead via PexelsThere’s no denying that the use of artificial intelligence in Singapore is a double-edged sword – one that will present opportunities and challenges in various industries. Rashid shares that AI platforms like ChatGPT will contribute to lowering the barrier of entry for anyone who is not a professional. But, at the same time, it will raise the ceiling for output for those who are already skilled.“AI is not about man versus machine as some of us have been brought up to think. Ultimately, doing more with less is the goal here – with chatbots tackling high volumes of repetitive queries and humans taking on more higher value tasks,” adds Malcolm Koh, director of customer experience practice at Zendesk.Take the invention of ATMs for example. It was expected that bank tellers would be completely replaced. But they didn’t disappear; they just moved on to perform more sophisticated tasks beyond simply dispensing cash. In fact, more bank tellers were hired even as ATMs increased in number. Who says you can’t teach an old teller new tricks?In a similar vein, the World Economic Forum predicts that while 85 million jobs will be replaced by AI by 2025, 97 million new jobs will be created in return. Think positions like machine learning engineers and data scientists.So, will AI take over the world? Yes, but not in the way we think it will. Unfortunately (or fortunately), we won’t be out of work and sipping cocktails on Siloso beach just yet. While AI will enhance our human capabilities and plug gaps where we fall short, it’s best used in collaboration with us. It may change career trajectories and overhaul job scopes, but it won’t really affect the way we live.Unless artificial intelligence becomes sentient… but that’s a story for another day.Need more Honeycombers in your life?

Although it seems to be in their hands, we are unsure of how much control they have over it. There is always more than one side to a story, as the cliché goes. </span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Regarding technology as well, there is no exception to this law. There are two schools of thinking about the use of artificial intelligence as a tool for increasing employment. Others see it as a tool that can help create more human employment, while some regard it as a danger to human jobs.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In my opinion, robots and artificial intelligence are not out to deprive us of our livelihood. Instead, they are there to in some way ease our lives. Robots and artificial intelligence will give humans a lot of chances in the future. According to the projection and the study, even though nearly 1.7 million jobs have been lost to automation since 2000, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/10-artificial-intelligence-powered-apps/"">artificial intelligence</a> is predicted to produce 97 million new employment by 2025, even though almost 1.7 million jobs have been lost to it since 2000.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In essence, you can now start to understand how technology may truly be used by humans as a tool to benefit them in the long term and not simply as a bad thing. Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly be the main force shortly, in my opinion. In the not-too-distant future, it will have a significant influence on the world as we currently know it.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Some individuals become quite enthusiastic when they discover something new, but others have a fairly dismal or doomy picture in their heads when they are learning about the same event. This is just one example of the many differences that occur between people. We must remain confident in our grasp of the reality that AI will not be able to completely replace human labor in the <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/psychological-harassments/"">workplace</a>.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">There are a handful of specialized profiles that call for a lot of imagination, empathy, and last-minute complicated political frameworks. Robots or artificial intelligence cannot, under any circumstances, replace human professionals such as <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/the-metaverse-is-trending-innovative/"">educators</a>, authors, designers, lawyers, social workers, defense attorneys, and healthcare providers. Shortly, numerous areas, including all those listed above, can benefit from the technical breakthroughs of artificial intelligence. These, however, are unable to duplicate the human element or emotional connection that these areas demand.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Since we go towards the era of digitization, people feel a need to collaborate with a new environment. Of course, we will need to accomplish this with the aid of technology, as the existence of technology in our everyday lives necessitates that we adjust to it. There is a tremendous desire for the advantages AI may provide the workplace. Despite this, it shouldn't alter the reality that the human touch will always remain in both <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/amid-weak-demand-lg-posted-record/"">demand</a> and fashion.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""> Experts predict that artificial intelligence will be a great benefit to humanity. Humans may be able to spend less time on laborious chores that are a part of their overall duties. The resource should be able to concentrate on comp projects. He will be able to serve the employer and resource in the best possible way as a result. Life is full of change, and that is a reality. We must be ready to adjust to the effects of change since we cannot prevent them. We must learn to accept that things will occasionally change if we want to live.<img src=""https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2237829091-1-e1671709051139.jpg"" alt=""ChatGPT is making heads-turn, and for good reason"" /></span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Significant change is on the way.</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">A better, more evolved, new world is on its way, and we need to pull our socks up because it's time for a<a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/stories/digital-democracy-in-indonesia/""> significant transformation</a>. It's just a matter of time until we start doing instead of complaining. There are several sacrifices required in the context of re-adjustments. It is completely unfair and foolish to fail to plan for the future and instead live in the now. Furthermore, a person's capacity to express kindness, compassion, understanding, and love for one another will always be appreciated as an asset not only in the present but also in the future.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Furthermore, a person's capacity to express kindness, compassion, understanding, and love for one another will always be appreciated as an advantage not only now but also in the future. No technology can ever replace the power of compassion, and it will always win out above all other considerations. Artificial intelligence research is increasing at an exponential rate. Almost every market sector employs a diverse range of applications. These include, in various ways, autonomous automobiles, education, infrastructure, defense, health,<a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/social-security-developments-in-the/""> social security</a>, cancer detection, and the construction of agricultural yield models.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">It is also worth noting that several platforms provide degrees and certificates in AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. However, there are extremely few competent candidates for these roles. There is now a lack of searchers because of a dearth of competent personnel. As a result, there has been a haphazard recruiting procedure, which has delayed the smart integration of intelligent robots into the workplace.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Because all forms of occupations encounter fierce competition, machine learning and artificial intelligence jobs confront far less competition than other types of jobs. There are a growing number of specialized <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/byjus-continues-to-eliminate/"">engineering jobs</a> on the market, but there are still a large number of open vacancies. The paucity of competent persons to fill these professions is another element contributing to the market's shortage of skilled workers.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The scope of AI research is broadening. From driverless automobiles to models for cancer diagnosis, the application cases touch practically every area. Similarly, several platforms provide degrees and certificates in <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/artificial-intelligence-business-2026/"">AI, Machine Learning</a>, and Deep Learning all at the same time. </span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">However, the number of people working in these industries is quite low. AI will establish a distinct dividing line of tasks that can be mastered if they are properly trained and taught, which will outweigh the danger to unskilled employment. Even though artificial intelligence has taken over many industries, there are still numerous employment available if you continue to study and upskill yourself.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to World Economic Forum research, machines will automate 50% of all workplace operations by 2025, up from 29% presently. According to the research, this is an increase from 29% today. By 2022, roughly half of the enterprises in the industry are likely to have significantly fewer employees. However, automation is likely to result in the <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/adani-lowers-development/"">development</a> of new employment in the whole industry at the same time.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The amount of necessity for various professions in different places tends to range greatly, which is one of the most relevant factors. While there is a lot of hype around artificial intelligence <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/is-it-gdp-or-rising-unemployment-that-is-critical-in-india-today-what-does-the-future-look-like-and-what-is-the-biggest-challenge-before-india-in-the-coming-year/"">replacing employment</a>, much of this is because the types of occupations being considered to have a lot to do with the kind of jobs that will be replaced. True, certain components of work can be automated, but there are some aspects of a job that cannot be mechanized. There is a good likelihood that artificial intelligence can and will become a component of future occupations in a variety of ways.</span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Entry-level and junior positions</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to Mishra, ChatGPT poses a possible threat to positions at the entry and junior organizational levels. Jobs like software tester, help desk analyst, telesales, customer support, content producer, secondary research, and design may be impacted, he noted. According to Mishra, ChatGPT may minimize the number of persons needed to complete a task in some jobs. Nevertheless, to handle and analyze the enormous quantity of data generated every day, additional employment will be created in the fields of education, media, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/stories/uks-trade-unions-up-in-arms-healthcare-transport-and-schools-brace-for-impact/"">healthcare</a>, data processing, research, innovation, and so forth.</span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Jobs that include routine activities</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Human resource (HR) workers may focus on strategic and high-value operations by automating repetitive procedures with ChatGPT technology, which can help simplify HR processes. According to Sarvesh Agrawal, founder, and CEO of Internshala, a career-tech platform, ""for instance, to execute several duties like answering employee inquiries, formulating HR rules, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/best-content-writing-companies-india/"">writing job descriptions</a>, analyzing databases, conducting employee surveys, etc., would require multiple people. He said that by using ChatGPT, fewer experts could be able to complete the same jobs as effectively.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">S Pasupathi, Chief Operating Officer of HirePro, a supplier of recruitment automation and assessment solutions, thinks ChatGPT may help businesses by providing email writing assistants, data entry clerks, chatbots, conversational UI (user interface) developers, and particularly content writers.<img src=""https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI-Stock-Photo-scaled.jpg"" alt=""Assessing and Managing the Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear-Weapon Systems"" /></span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Tasks with little room for creativity</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to Anuj Agarwal, the founder, and CEO of the recruiting company Zyoin, the influence of these technologies on the job market depends on how widely they are used in different sectors. Meanwhile, he continued, ""it is straightforward to argue that professions requiring the execution of simple tasks would be harmed, but jobs requiring sophisticated human abilities, such as creativity, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/10-best-marketing-companies-india-2023/"">inventiveness</a>, empathy, and critical thinking, will not be touched."" As a result of AI technologies accomplishing the same task in a matter of minutes, employment for creating social media posts and graphics is in danger in this situation.</span>

Generative AI Explained by AI
After years of research, it appears that artificial intelligence (AI) is reaching a sort of tipping point, capturing the imaginations of everyone from students saving time on their essay writing to leaders at the world’s largest tech companies. Excitement is building around the possibilities that AI tools unlock, but what exactly these tools are capable of and how they work is still not widely understood.
We could write about this in detail, but given how advanced tools like ChatGPT have become, it only seems right to see what generative AI has to say about itself.
Everything in the infographic above – from illustrations and icons to the text descriptions⁠—was created using generative AI tools such as Midjourney. Everything that follows in this article was generated using ChatGPT based on specific prompts.

Without further ado, generative AI as explained by generative AI.
Generative AI: An Introduction
Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that generate new outputs based on the data they have been trained on. Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, generative AI creates new content in the form of images, text, audio, and more.
Generative AI uses a type of deep learning called generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create new content. A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator that creates new data and a discriminator that evaluates the data. The generator and discriminator work together, with the generator improving its outputs based on the feedback it receives from the discriminator until it generates content that is indistinguishable from real data.

Generative AI has a wide range of applications, including:

Images: Generative AI can create new images based on existing ones, such as creating a new portrait based on a person’s face or a new landscape based on existing scenery
Text: Generative AI can be used to write news articles, poetry, and even scripts. It can also be used to translate text from one language to another
Audio: Generative AI can generate new music tracks, sound effects, and even voice acting

Disrupting Industries
People have concerns that generative AI and automation will lead to job displacement and unemployment, as machines become capable of performing tasks that were previously done by humans. They worry that the increasing use of AI will lead to a shrinking job market, particularly in industries such as manufacturing, customer service, and data entry.
Generative AI has the potential to disrupt several industries, including:


Advertising: Generative AI can create new advertisements based on existing ones, making it easier for companies to reach new audiences
Art and Design: Generative AI can help artists and designers create new works by generating new ideas and concepts
Entertainment: Generative AI can create new video games, movies, and TV shows, making it easier for content creators to reach new audiences

Overall, while there are valid concerns about the impact of AI on the job market, there are also many potential benefits that could positively impact workers and the economy.
In the short term, generative AI tools can have positive impacts on the job market as well. For example, AI can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, and help humans make faster and more informed decisions by processing and analyzing large amounts of data. AI tools can free up time for humans to focus on more creative and value-adding work.
How This Article Was Created
This article was created using a language model AI trained by OpenAI. The AI was trained on a large dataset of text and was able to generate a new article based on the prompt given. In simple terms, the AI was fed information about what to write about and then generated the article based on that information.

In conclusion, generative AI is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize several industries. With its ability to create new content based on existing data, generative AI has the potential to change the way we create and consume content in the future.

Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersSpain This article is more than 1 year oldArtificial intelligence uncovers lost work by titan of Spain’s ‘Golden Age’This article is more than 1 year oldDiscovery of Lope de Vega play could lead to other important finds, researchers saySam Jones in MadridSun 5 Feb 2023 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 5 Feb 2023 16.28 ESTShareLost or misattributed works by some of the finest writers of Spain’s Golden Age could be discovered thanks to pioneering AI technology that has been used to identify a previously unknown play by the wildly prolific dramatist, poet, sailor and priest Lope de Vega.This week Spain’s National Library announced that researchers trawling its massive archive had stumbled upon and verified a play that Lope is believed to have written a few years before his death in 1635.Like many plays of the Spanish Golden Age – the 16th- and 17th-century cultural boom that accompanied Spain’s imperial growth and which birthed masterpieces by Lope, Cervantes, Calderón and Velázquez, among many others – La francesa Laura (The Frenchwoman Laura) is a tale of love, jealousy and social hierarchy in which suspicion demands an innocent woman be sacrificed on the altar of her husband’s honour. But, unlike many similar plays of the period, Laura survives and the third act ends happily.Equally unusual was the manner of the play’s discovery. In 2017, Germán Vega, a Golden Age literature expert at the University of Valladolid, and Álvaro Cuéllar, now at the department of Romance studies at the University of Vienna, embarked on Etso, a project that uses AI analysis to determine the authorship of Golden Age plays, many of which are anonymous or believed misattributed.As part of the project, 1,300 plays – most of them from Spain’s National Library – were digitally transcribed using a platform, Transkribus, trained to identify and understand 3m words.Once transcription was complete, another program, Stylo, compared their language and style with the 2,800 digitised works by 350 authors in the Etso database.Held by the library as an 18th-century manuscript copied from earlier texts, La francesa Laura had long been catalogued as an anonymous work, but Etso’s computer quickly came to its own conclusions.“After it had transcribed the 1,300 texts, the computer noticed that one of them was similar to 100 or so works – almost all of which were by Lope,” says Vega.“That really grabbed our attention – we didn’t think we’d find a Lope … [But] we then found a lot of expressions in La francesa Laura that fitted with those in other Lope plays. There were things in La francesa Laura that people in other Lope plays had said or would later say.”More traditional analysis of the play – focusing on everything from plots and character names to metre, elisions and the pronunciation of diphthongs – corroborated the computer’s theory.Its style fits with that of Lope’s later period, while its flattering treatment of France has led the researchers to believe that it was written at a particular moment in the thirty years’ war – probably between 1628 and 1630 – when Spain and France shelved their mutual distrust in the face of a common enemy in England.“It had never attracted much interest at the National Library,” says Vega. “If it hadn’t been for this new technology, we wouldn’t have known about it unless someone had come across it and thought ‘this reminds me of Lope’.“Plus the title – La francesa Laura – isn’t that attractive and even though I’ve pored over lots of bibliographies, I’d never come across any reference to this play except in the National Library’s catalogue.”This was not the first time Etso had proved its worth. Almost four years ago, Vega used the database and Stylo to conclude that The Nun Lieutenant – a 17th-century play based on the staggering true story of Catalina de Erauso, who escaped a convent to become a cross-dressing soldier in the Americas – was written by a Mexican dramatist called Juan Ruiz de Alarcón.Vega believes AI will turn up more lost treasures as it continues to revolutionise research in his field. When he was preparing his doctoral thesis back in the mid-1980s, “any attempt to try to justify an attribution was a massive amount of work that involved reading a thousand texts, taking notes and hitting various libraries and ordering up old manuscripts”. But today, he says, programs exist that can tell you that a play is written in a style closer to a particular playwright’s than to those of hundreds of his peers.“That’s amazing. Given there’s such an attribution problem with Golden Age theatre – so many anonymous pieces or misattributed pieces, I think this new technology means we’ll see more of this. There are still things that need to be clarified.”While Vega concedes that La francesa Laura is hardly the pinnacle of Lope’s achievements – the so-called Phoenix of Wits is thought to have written more than 1,000 plays – the academic would still be delighted to see it performed on stage one day under the name of its true author.“It’s very entertaining and lively and I think it could do very well in the hands of the right theatre company,” he says. “It’s not a bad play but the thing is that Lope has four or five magnificent plays – and this one just can’t compare.”Explore more on these topicsSpainArtificial intelligence (AI)EuropeTheatrenewsShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could ChatGPT take your job? 











The rise of AI: Could ChatGPT take your job?
05:38

Chatbots and artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT that can almost instantly produce increasingly sophisticated written content are already being used to perform a variety of tasks, from writing high school assignments to generating legal documents and even authoring legislation.As in every major cycle of technological innovation, some workers will be displaced, with artificial intelligence taking over their roles. At the same time, entirely new activities — and potential opportunities for employment — will emerge. Read on to learn what experts say are the kinds of workplace tasks that are most vulnerable to being taken over by ChatGPT and other AI tools in the near term.






Does artificial intelligence help students cheat?

Computer programmingChatGPT can write computer code to program applications and software. It can check human coders' language for errors and convert ideas from plain English into programming language.  






""In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,"" Columbia Business School professor Oded Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.""That could mean performing basic programming work currently done by humans.


""If you are writing a code where really all you do is convert an idea to a code, the machine can do that. To the extent we would need fewer programmers, it could take away jobs. But it would also help those who program to find mistakes in codes and write code more efficiently,"" Netzer said. Basic emailWriting simple administrative or scheduling emails for things like setting up or canceling appointments could also easily be outsourced to a tool like ChatGPT, according to Netzer. ""There's hardly any creativity involved, so why would we write the whole thing instead of saying to the machine, 'I need to set a meeting on this date,'"" he said.Mid-level writingDavid Autor, an MIT economist who specializes in labor, pointed to some mid-level white-collar jobs as functions that can be handled by AI, including work like writing human resources letters, producing advertising copy and drafting press releases.AI ChatGPT is helping CEOs think. Will it also take your job?AI experts on whether you should be ""terrified"" of ChatGPTPrinceton student says his new app helps teachers find ChatGPT cheats""Bots will be much more in the realm of people who do a mixture of intuitive and mundane tasks like writing basic advertising copy, first drafts of legal documents. Those are expert skills, and there is no question that software will make them cheaper and therefore devalue human labor,"" Autor said. 


Media planning and buying Creative industries are likely to be affected, too. Noted advertising executive Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of WPP, the world's largest ad and PR group, said on a recent panel that he expects the way companies buy ad space will become automated ""in a highly effective way"" within five years. ""So you will not be dependent as a client on a 25-year old media planner or buyer, who has limited experience, but you'll be able to pool the data. That's the big change,"" he said.Legal functionsChatGPT's abilities translate well to the legal profession, according to AI experts as well as legal professionals. In fact, ChatGPT's bot recently passed a law school exam and earned a passing grade after writing essays on topics ranging from constitutional law to taxation and torts.""The dynamic that happens to lawyers now is there is way too much work to possibly get done, so they make an artificial distinction between what they will work on and what will be left to the wayside,"" said Jason Boehmig, co-founder and CEO of Ironclad, a legal software company. Common legal forms and documents including home lease agreements, wills and nondisclosure agreements are fairly standard and can be drafted by a an advanced bot.

""There are parts of a legal document that humans need to adapt to a particular situation, but 90% of the document is copy pasted,"" Netzer of Columbia Business School said. ""There is no reason why we would not have the machine write these kinds of legal documents. You may need to explain first in English the parameters, then the machine should be able to write it very well. The less creative you need to be, the more it should be replaced.""AI-powered ""robot"" lawyer won't argue in court after jail threatsChatGPT bot passes law school exam""There aren't enough lawyers to do all the legal work corporations have,"" Boehmig added. ""The way attorneys work will be dramatically different. If I had to put a stake down around jobs that won't be there, I think it's attorneys who don't adapt to new ways of working over the next decade. There seem to be dividing lines around folks who don't want to change and folks who realize they have to.""

Still, there are a few considerations it made me reflect on, especially as we head toward a world that’s going to see a skyrocketing number of AI-driven interactions. (Even before ChatGPT, in mid-2022 Gartner predicted chatbots would become the primary customer service channel for a quarter of organizations by 2027.) First of all, writers aren’t going away overnight. But more generally, consumers are going to seek out experiences with businesses that treat them like human beings, even if they use AI to do so. And businesses will want to turn those human-feeling experiences into better business outcomes. As the guy who invented webchat for brands back in the ’90s, I’ve spent a lot of time talking to brands about how they can create better business outcomes. To be honest, getting them to understand and be comfortable with AI has been a hurdle. The launch and excitement around ChatGPT makes that part of my job easier. Now it’s time to shift the conversation: If you’re excited about generative AI, do you know how and why to use it to drive legitimately better business outcomes? For example, if a customer comes to your digital front door and asks one of the following questions, the AI you’re using to staff that front door should respond in a mutually beneficial way:I’m the kind of person who buys gifts at the last minute. What can you recommend?I’m the traveler whose luggage you lost. How are you getting it back to me?I’m a caregiver helping a loved one with health issues. When can I get this prescription filled?You can’t just answer these questions with “the right words” crowdsourced from the public internet (as ChatGPT does). Instead, you should be thinking deeply about whether your AI-powered experiences are set up to deliver outcomes:Is the AI just writing nice-sounding language? Not good enough. It also needs to be able to surface business insights that inform your strategy.Is it trained on generally available information? If so, you’re just giving your customers the same experience as any other business. Instead, you need to make sure the unique needs and interests of your enterprise are reflected in the data set that your AI uses to drive the conversation.Do you have humans in the loop to ensure your experiences are both accurate and optimized? (OpenAI outsourced this to Kenya for $2 per hour as reported by a TIME investigation, which has raised some concerns).Is the AI producing nonbiased responses? Bias can be dangerous for your customers and lethal to your brand. Consider how you can start working within ethical frameworks like those developed by organizations like EqualAI. With every technological advance, there are wild promises thrown out from all corners that obscure the real work that needs to be done. Today’s “AI influencers” are no different, and it’s time to take a step back to take stock of how business leaders can cut through their hype and generate actual results.

Texto, literatura, cultura edited by the UAB's CER PROLOPE research group, has now published the discovery of a new comedy by Lope de Vega, entitled La francesa Laura, discovered in the manuscript collections of the Biblioteca Nacional de España by researchers from the universities of Valladolid and Vienna. The use of computer tools has been essential for its detection, the results of which have been fully supported by philological analysis. The researchers and PROLOPE will soon publish the critical edition of the work together with Editorial Gredos.




In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a highly valued tool in several research tasks and projects. The more rigurous historical-philological research has also benefited from this new type of resource. And proof of that is the case of the discovery of La francesa Laura, an unknown play by Lope de Vega (1562-1635), after an intense work combining the use of advanced computer tools and traditional philological research. 
The discovery was made possible thanks to the National Library of Spain (BNE) and its collaboration with the ETSO project ""Stylometry and Spanish Golden Age Theatre"", directed by Álvaro Cuéllar (University of Viena) and Germán Vega (University of Valladolid), the researchers responsible for the discovery, and which included some 150 collaborators dedicated to the use of computer analysis of theatre literature from the Golden Age to solve problems of authorship; the UAB PROLOPE group, who do the enormous jon of publishing and studying Lope de Vega's work, who provided the texts; the Transkribus tool, which facilitated the preparation of the materials needed for the tests, and the researchers' universities of Valladolid and Viena.
The new comedy can already be viewed on the BNE's Hispanic Digital Library, while the scientific paper on the discovery can be found in the latest number of the UAB journal Anuario Lope de Vega. Text, literatura, cultura, under the title of ""La francesa Laura. El hallazgo de una nueva comedia del Lope de Vega último"". A revised and annotated edition of the play will be published in the coming months thanks to the Gredos publishing house and the PROLOPE research group.
AI for historical and philological research
The use of AI has been crucial in the discovery of Lope de Vega's relationship with this work. It was preserved anonymously in a manuscript from the end of the 17th century, many years after the writer's death, which is kept at the BNE, along with many other anonymous works, in the institution's very rich collection of theatrical manuscripts. No ancient or modern document, nor any present-day or contemporary Lope de Vega scholar, has so far been able to relate it to who was known at the time as the ""Phoenix of Wits"".
Firstly, the work was automatically transcribed using AI techniques by means of the Transkribus tool, which allows accurate transcription of ancient manuscripts with a high degree of precision. The machine was trained on some three million correctly identified words, and then processed some 1,300 plays from the Golden Age, both printed and handwritten, which were transcribed in just a few hours.
In a second phase, the works were classified by author, by means of automatic learning processes, capable of classifying works as written or not written by Lope de Vega with more than 99% accuracy, as recent studies have shown. Among the 1,300 automatically transcribed comedies, La francesa Laura was classified as written by Lope de Vega in its entirety. The lexical uses of the work were closely aligned with his own and not with those of the other 350 playwrights of the time who were available in the experiment.
Confirmation by traditional philological studies
After the computer classification of the work, researchers began intense work to determine whether this was truly a comedy written by the distinguished dramatist’s, but this time with the traditional resources of philological research. Among these tests were the study of versification (how Lope used common metrics in his works), orthology (how he pronounced words and used diphthongs, hiatus or synalephas), and especially the study of echoes of Lopesko, that is, the coincidence of both ideas, themes and motifs, as well as specific lexical structures between this work and other texts by the playwright around the time it was written. All of the tests confirmed what was noted in the initial experiments with artificial intelligence: the work fits like a glove into Lope de Vega’s theatrical productions.

Comedy at the artistic height of Lope’s last stage
According to researchers, everything indicates that this is a new genuine comedy of the playwright, written five or six years before his death. The presence and flattering treatment of the French, which the title already emphasizes, seem to indicate that it was composed during the brief period when the Spanish and French crowns became allies against the English in the late 1620s, putting an end to the tensions between the nations that had marked the Thirty Years' War.
La francesa Laura is a fine theatre play with the dramatic power expected from a mature Lope de Vega. The story is set in France and revolves around Laura, daughter of the Duke of Brittany and married to Count Arnold. The work, although a product of its time, presents from the beginning a strong defense of women, as can be seen in these verses: ""Fuera de que a las mujeres/les sobran tantas hazañas/que en las armas y las letras/envidia a los hombres causan"".

 What you may not realize is that scammers are using artificial intelligence to create dangerous job scams. The Federal Trade Commission and cybersecurity experts like Dominic Chorafakis with Akouto warn you to watch out for much more dangerous job offer scams than the usual phishing emails.    Crooks are using artificial intelligence programs to scrape personal information from social media, LinkedIn, and other sites, then generate and send the victim highly personalized phishing emails and messages. PREVIOUSLY ON SULLIVAN'S SMART SENSE: Electric cars: What to consider when buying an electric vehicle ""It’s being asked to write a letter to convince that individual to click on a PDF or a link,"" explained Chorafakis. He showed us how it works. Using my bio on FOX 26 Houston, he asked a Python artificial intelligence program to write me a job offer letter. ""It mentions your Emmy Awards, your National Murrow Award, and crafts an email to convince you to try to click on a link or open an attachment,"" he showed us.   ""That’s creepy. That’s really creepy,"" I reacted.  Click the link and they've got you. They can download malware onto your device, or steal your identity.   Chorafakis also entered the bio of our Meteorologist Lena Maria Arango into the program. ""Wow,"" Arango reacted when she saw the letter. The letter says the fictitious company is looking for a Meteorologist who is passionate about STEM and excited to live in Texas, just like her bio reads. RELATED: Big tax changes may mean smaller refunds, tips for filing tax returns ""It's definitely scary. For someone looking over it quickly, you could easily get tricked. Especially if you’re multitasking, doing other things, and you are searching for a job,"" reacted Arango. Here are some tips from Chorafakis to protect yourself: If you get a job offer from a Gmail or personal email account, rather than a business account, that's a red flag.Never click a link or attachment from an unsolicited email.Search for the company website online, go to its LinkedIn page, or use a job site such as Glassdoor to look it up. Chorafakis warns that scammers can also use artificial intelligence to take a recording of someone's voice to create a tape of the person saying something else.   ""They will impersonate someone’s boss and ask to transfer money or buy gift cards or something of that nature. There have also been fake kidnapping scams where you’ll get the voice of a loved one saying I've been kidnapped, I’m in danger, you have to transfer money,"" he said. He says scammers have used AI to manipulate photos into compromising images, then threaten to release them unless they receive a ransom payment.

ChatGPT, an interface that allows users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3 large-language model. (Screenshot via OpenAI)



 Views expressed in opinion columns are the author’s own.
One of my favorite elementary school memories was competing for the highest typing test score among my classmates during our computer lab classes. But then I reached middle school and the novelty of our computer labs diminished as the use of laptops became more frequent. Up to now, after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, our education system has become inevitably interwoven with technology.



As educational technology usage increased, so did debates among educators, parents, students and tech experts about its efficiency. As these arguments against technology usage for education rage on, here I am, walking around this college campus with nothing in my bag aside from my laptop, charger and water bottle. 
Within the last few weeks, the arrival of the artificial intelligence tool, ChatGPT, has prompted many debates reminiscent of the ones I watched happen as a middle schooler. But, we should stray from our previous mistake of getting caught up in the discourse surrounding new technology. To stay on top of educational and technological trends, universities need to be teaching students to work with and around AI tools to help prepare students for a constantly advancing world.
University responses to AI-generating tools are surfacing from an initial fear of students using these platforms to cheat and some universities have announced their plan to crack down on the use of these tools or banning the platforms altogether. However, whether we are prepared for it or not, technology is advancing faster each day. Our education systems — especially higher education — cannot respond to these advancements in fear, rather, they need to be able to adapt and assess how best to prepare students to interact with such technology. 
We should be seeing AI-based technology, such as ChatGPT, as a tool for education.



Many professors have commented on the quality of work ChatGPT produces to be below the standards of a well-written and structured paper. Knowing this, professors should encourage students to use it as a means to do a lot of the “grunt work” of assignments — researching and gathering information — while still encouraging students to subsequently interpret this information critically.
The time saved through ChatGPT’s efficient research methods can then be focused on critical analysis — a paramount skill in higher education. Developing our decision-making, problem-solving skills and creativity is what sets apart from the automated work of artificial intelligence. These skills — which make us inherently human — need to become our educational focus.
A large concern of using information from ChatGPT comes from questions over source attributions and citations of ideas being produced. However, these concerns give rise to another opportunity for students to begin fact-checking the reliability of claims and ideas they use in their assignments. In an era full of misinformation and disinformation, validating the information we consume is becoming increasingly important to how we view the world around us. 
With written work specifically, professors can use AI as tools to generate essay outlines and encourage students to use them as a base-line for further analysis. Assessments may be based upon how students improve upon the original AI-produced draft or how they integrate such AI-generated work into their own analyses. Furthermore, AI tools can be used to generate discussion and debate topics in classrooms, particularly if conversations begin to run dry. Building this emphasis on critical thinking and analytical skills by viewing claims  that are made, working to see how one can counter them and breaking them down is something all students should graduate with. ChatGPT can help facilitate this. 
Now, such integrations will be merely a starting point. Professors and universities must prepare to adapt their teaching to artificial intelligence as it continues to change. Education cannot remain static as the world develops around it. 
With large corporations already beginning to layoff thousands of workers in favor of AI and automation, new technology is not something we can expect students to shy away from: It’s our competition in the workforce. As AI continues to become part of our lives, leaving behind skills that can be automated will allow us to refocus our educational models upon intangible analytical skills that will best prepare us to navigate the world we will face once we graduate.
We may mourn the end of certain educational methods in classrooms — but let’s remember that many still mourn the end of teaching cursive in classrooms. Despite the nostalgia, having such a skill no longer holds the same significance as it once did. 
Since we started using computers in class, we’ve been able to learn and expand on newer skills, better equipping us for the changing times. Let’s repurpose ChatGPT as an indicator of the future we are moving toward — and prepare our students for it.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making headlines in recent years, as advancements in technology are making AI more accessible and powerful than ever before. AI has the potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with each other, and it is rapidly becoming a crucial aspect of modern life. In this blog post, we will explore the rise of AI, its impact on various industries, and the ethical considerations that come with these developments.
One of the most significant areas of AI development is machine learning, which allows AI systems to learn and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. This allows AI systems to develop more sophisticated abilities and perform tasks that would be impossible for humans to achieve. For example, machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions, helping businesses make better decisions and improving their bottom line.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 50:00Loaded: 1.18%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -50:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Another area where AI is making an impact is in the field of healthcare. AI algorithms can be used to analyze medical images, diagnose diseases, and help doctors and nurses make informed treatment decisions. This can improve the accuracy of diagnoses, reduce the time and cost of medical procedures, and ultimately save lives.
AI is also transforming the way we interact with technology. Voice-controlled virtual assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, have become popular household devices, and self-driving cars are now a reality on our roads. These developments are changing the way we live, making our lives easier and more convenient.
However, the rise of AI also raises important ethical considerations. For example, the widespread use of AI in the workplace could result in significant job losses, as machines and algorithms take over many tasks previously performed by humans. This could lead to significant social and economic disruption, and we must consider these implications as AI continues to evolve.
There are also privacy concerns, as AI systems collect and store vast amounts of personal data. This data can be used for good, such as improving medical diagnoses, but it can also be used maliciously, such as for targeted advertising or cybercrime. We must develop robust regulations and best practices to protect personal data and ensure that AI is used for the benefit of society as a whole.
In conclusion, the rise of AI is a significant development that has the potential to transform our lives in numerous ways. We must embrace these developments and invest in AI research and development, while also considering the ethical implications of these advancements. By doing so, we can ensure that AI is used for the benefit of society and helps to create a better future for all.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a crucial aspect of modern life, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with each other. The rise of AI brings exciting opportunities, such as improved efficiency and accuracy in various industries, but also raises important ethical considerations, such as job losses and privacy. We must embrace these developments and invest in AI research and development, while also considering the ethical implications of these advancements.

From AI-generated art to ChatGPT's worryingly coherent output, generative AI has been propelled into the limelight over the past two months – but its role in game development still remains unclear.


For those who have missed the recent conversations, generative AI is a tool that can be used to create something from a written prompt. Ask ChatGPT to write a short summary of something and it will do so. Type a description of a person or place – real or fictional – into Midjourney and it will offer you four different pictures that fit your brief.

We reached out to a range of game makers to get their thoughts on this nascent but increasingly prominent technology. Some declined, stating they do not (yet) understand enough about generative AI and the implications of using it to offer insight, but those who did respond were never far from a historical analogy.


Panivox co-founder and veteran developer Philip Oliver liked generative AI to farmers improving their efficiency by using ploughs and later tractors instead of horses, while Code Is Just author and indie developer Shahid Ahmad drew parallels between machine learning and the introduction of industrial automation.

""[That] removed a lot of manual drudgery from our lives through the use of machinery and, more recently, robots. But video games studios producing content at scale haven't benefited from mechanisation until now,"" he explains. 


""It might at first be jarring to hear of mechanisation with what we often think of as art, but most of the assets produced in video games are craft, and craft, guided by humans, can be mechanised at the level of atoms, so why not with bits?""


Bossa Studio co-founder and creator-in-chief Imre Jele adds: ""Fundamental shifts in technologies can rearrange entire industries. Those kinds of changes always come with inevitable losses: people and companies will be forced to adapt. And when the change is big enough entire economies could be at peril, and societal changes become necessary. AI could be – some say is inevitably going to be – that drastic a change. I believe generative AI certainly has the potential to rock the games industry on a fundamental level.

""However, there are still challenges ahead. For example, the legal framework for training sets is up in the air with some risk and exposure depending on the outcome of some court cases. So there are some big questions one needs to answer before developing a game using these tools.
 
""Ultimately, even though this is a very fast developing space, we only have very few actual production ready tools that a company can depend on. So arguably, we’re still a little while from fundamental changes to how we make games.""



 
Rok Breulj, Proxy Studios


Rok Breulj, founder and owner of Proxy Studios, says AI can ease the process of content creation, which he considers ""the most labour intensive part of video game development."" His own team used AI art tools to generate concept art for elements such as buildings in their upcoming 4X strategy title Zephon, but Breulj believes it will eventually be used on a grander scale.


""AI is undoubtedly going to increase the breadth and scope of games,"" he says. ""We should expect bigger worlds and larger games – something I see players screaming for.""


He continues: ""In some aspects generative AI can be likened to remixing old assets or using asset packs. All of that can be done very tastefully or very distastefully. It’s not inherently bad or good. We shouldn’t be scared of generative AI. Try it out, play with it, explore its limitations and see if it can enhance your workflow.""

Tom Pigott, CEO and founder of Ludo AI – which offers a tool of the same name designed to help developers prototype game concepts from a series of prompts – says generative AI will be most useful in art design, concept ideation, and asset creation. He claims this will limit costs – not in terms of having fewer staff (more on that later), but the amount of man-hours spent on each of these processes.


""Game developers face three primary problems when developing: expenses, time, and effort,"" he says. ""When faced with these problems combined, the failure rate is drastically increased – and most developers cannot afford all of the necessary tools to stay competitive.""


Ahmad emphasises the potential benefits for indies, as using AI will allow smaller studios to ""punch above their weight,"" he says. He points to the example of UK developer Hello Games, which used procedural generation to create No Man's Sky, a game of a scale usually only reached by AAA titles. 

""Generative AI will fundamentally change how and what games we create. The question is: How fast?""

Imre Jele, Bossa Studios

However, he warns that AI's output can look ""boring or incongruous"" if used poorly – one only need to look at the mutated hands produced by AI art tools for proof. Ahmad once again cites Hello Games as an example, stressing that while procedural generation created endless planets and creatures, it was down to human developers to tune their system and select the 'best' output.


Breulj warns that another disadvantage could be that we see the games market ""flooded with generative content that is not well-considered."" Given the rise of 'asset flip' games on Steam, titles that are cobbled together from premade assets, the use of generative AI in this way is perhaps inevitable.


""It could get harder and harder for thoughtful content to rise to the top – potentially redistributing the spend from development into marketing,"" he adds.


Pigott stresses that AI tools should be seen as simply that: a tool. 


""When speaking about generative AI in the games industry more specifically, this is doubly true,"" he adds. ""You shouldn’t just rely on AI tools, because the results may not always be completely accurate – you see this when looking at examples of awry work from services like Dall-E 2 and ChatGPT online.""


Panivox's Philip Oliver expects generative AI to be most useful when planning or in pre-production, saying it can quickly create mood boards and other concept art. He, too, emphasises the need for human guidance to ensure the final game benefits from the use of AI. 



 
The Oliver Twins used AI art to make a narrative game, Roots & Shoots, during Global Game Jame 2023


""Generative AI in games should empower and enhance creativity, not replace it,"" he says. ""AI can speed up game development and enable teams to iterate faster. At this year's Global Game Jam, we produced a 20-minute game assisted by AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney – it took us just over 60 man hours, demonstrating the potential of generative AI to dramatically speed up the development process.


""AI is a big disruptor in the games industry, but it's important to be curious and embrace new technologies.""


The biggest concern around generative AI is whether it will result in job losses. If typing words into Midjourney can generate concept art, why would studios need a concept artist? If it can generate 3D assets that can be placed into a game world, like trees or furniture, what happens to the people manually crafting these today?
 
Jele says: ""In most cases I believe AI will be accelerating workers rather than replacing them. That said there are grave and valid concerns of jobs lost.""
 
He goes on to say there will be more subtle issues to address. For example, a member of his team pointed out that AI might remove the need for low skills jobs in art departments. This would prevent young artists from securing the roles and gaining the experience they need to improve their skills, and the result would be fewer trained staff on the market.
 
""At the end of the day I don’t think AI replacing jobs is a fleeting concern, but a fact,"" Jele continues. ""Generative AI will not only change but likely entirely displace many jobs. The only argument is how fast that will happen and how far reaching the effects will be.
 


 
Imre Jele, Bossa Studios


""History teaches us that you cannot hold back the march of progress. The best option we have is to very carefully consider and prepare for the inevitable effects in our own teams and industry. Worth saying though that the trajectory of AI development suggests that we will face changes on a societal level, and those matters can ultimately only be addressed by tools on that level: universal living wage and other solutions come to mind.""


Ahmad adds: ""Jobs will change. They've always changed. Decades ago, every team wrote their own graphics engine, and now those jobs are gone. But a lot of drudgery will be taken away. How many chairs need to be modelled? How many tables? Couldn't AI take care of that for us?""


The developers we spoke to say there are also misconceptions around the use of generative AI, ones that are a factor in the rising fear that it will replace jobs. For example, Oliver stresses that no AI tool can create code, art or dialogue on its own.


""Treat AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjounrey as problem-solvers, process accelerators, and creative aids, not replacements for developer creativity,"" he says. ""Game developer tools don't do the work for us, and the same applies to generative AI.""


Pigott adds: ""People often think that generative AI is a magic box and a mind reader, which just is not the case. Generative AI is a type of machine learning where computers can generate original content in response to prompts from the user.
 

""Machine learning cannot predict what kind of game a developer wants to create; that can only be done after the user has input prompts. The most important factor in any generative AI tool is still the user – the human – who is using it.""



 
'An AI developing a video game', Midjourney


As a further example, the headline image of this article (full image to the left) was generated by Midjourney using the prompt: 'An AI developing a video game.' Even Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick assured investors on a recent earnings call that there's no danger of a generative AI tool making a better Grand Theft Auto just because something delivers that prompt.


Ultimately, the developers we spoke to believe AI has the potential to benefit studios of all sizes. AAA developers will be able to create more content with lower costs and become more efficient, while indies will be able to attempt more ambitious projects they would not usually have the resources for.


""The boundaries [between the two] will blur,"" says Ahmad. ""This is a good thing. Eventually, this technology will create a more level playing field provided that AI is accessible, and there's every reason given the history of other tools to believe that this will be the case. Unreal Engine used to cost $500,000 to licence in 2002, and now an indie can use it essentially for free.""


Jele even envisages a world where games themselves are able to use AI tools to produce new content on the fly, and content that is tailored to each player's tastes.


""The 'simple' outcome of making bigger games faster is not only a huge step forward but frankly a necessity considering the ongoing arms race of game content scope and quality,"" he concludes.

Since ChatGPT took the world by storm last fall, people have been in a frenzy debating the impact artificial intelligence and other new automated technology will have on America's job market. The ""robots are taking our jobs"" narrative was further boosted by viral videos showing new, ""fully automated"" McDonald's and Taco Bell restaurants.The knee-jerk reaction to these videos is to say that robots are coming for our jobs, but while AI and other kinds of automation have progressed, that doesn't mean they're necessarily eliminating jobs. Instead, the new tech is simply changing how we work and what kinds of jobs exist. Automation technology has ushered in a fleet of secret workers behind screens, machines, and smiling robot faces. The robots and chatbots aren't replacing humans, they're just keeping the people out of sight and out of mind. And while separating the customer from the workers serving them may be good for the companies, there's mounting evidence it's a terrible deal for the employees.

Out of sight, out of mindWhen people start prognosticating about AI coming for our jobs, they love to point to videos of sleek robots and shining screens handling mundane tasks. The McDondald's video shows a machine delivering food at the drive-thru, self-ordering kiosks, and a stark lack of human staffers behind the order counter. At Taco Bell, there are several automated drive-thru lanes. Beyond fast food, impressive-looking robots are working in coffee shops, delivering food, and cleaning floors. On the AI side, tools like ChatGPT have been used to write real articles and take college exams. BuzzFeed recently announced it plans to use AI to help generate content for its site.

But in many cases, these videos and stories — and the fears they drive — lack crucial context. The futuristic McDonald's is an experimental concept store outside Fort Worth, Texas, aiming to improve service speed and accuracy by effectively severing the relationship between its workers and customers. But that doesn't mean there are no humans in the store. If you pay close attention to the video, you can see a worker in the back behind a pane of glass. McDonald's has said the store isn't ""fully automated"" by any means, and it employs a similar number of staff as a traditional store — they're just in the back making the food and keeping things running. And despite the fact most customers will never see a Taco Bell worker at its newfangled store, it has plenty of people working in the kitchen.






                                  Most people won't see the workers at Taco Bell's new store, but they are still in the back making your food.

Even if these tools seem more sophisticated, this isn't the first robot-driven freak-out. Less than 10 years ago, new developments in technology spurred a similar fear that robots were coming for us. A 2014 analysis estimated that automation would wipe out 47% of all jobs by 2034 and that self-driving technology would eliminate the need for human taxi and delivery drivers, while long-haul truckers were thought to be on borrowed time. Nearly a decade later, these cataclysmic forecasts haven't come to pass. Truck drivers are still in high demand, and self-driving technology is nowhere near replacing human jobs. In fact, a more recent 2020 report from the World Economic Forum estimated that while 85 million jobs would be replaced by machines by 2025, an estimated 97 million new jobs would be created to help support this new economy. The human behind the curtainAmid the fear-mongering about a robot takeover, people often miss the degree to which machines still require human workers in order to function. Take customer service: For years, businesses have tried to cut costs by replacing human phone calls with chat-based, automated customer-service bots. But instead of replacing customer-service workers, many of these text-based tools still rely on human backups in complex situations and to make customers feel as if they are talking to a real person. Laura Preston recently wrote about her experience working as one of these ""human fallbacks"" for a real-estate chatbot called Brenda. When a customer wanted to speak to someone about an apartment listing, they would be connected with Brenda, who could answer basic questions about the listing or give details on the apartment itself from the price of rent to the square footage. But many of Brenda's answers came across stilted or the system was simply unable to answer more complex questions, so a ""human fallback"" would step in. Preston and other human workers would take over the conversation and try to help the client, cleaning up stock answers to better address their needs or doing deeper research into housing vouchers and pet policies. According to Preston, employees were trained to use Brenda's ""voice"" in the interactions in an attempt to make the conversation appear seamless. And the push to robotically answer a deluge of questions came with a serious mental toll: ""Months of impersonating Brenda had depleted my emotional resources,"" wrote Preston. ""It occurred to me that I wasn't really training Brenda to think like a human, Brenda was training me to think like a bot, and perhaps that had been the point all along.""

                                  Delivery robots like Kiwibots are often remotely controlled by backup drivers.

Preston was working from the United States, but in many cases, these services are hiding human employees so they can outsource it to places where the labor is cheaper. Take food-delivery robots: While they're presented as being fully autonomous, the reality is that they often have remote backup drivers. Tiny Mile, which runs a service in Toronto called Geoffrey, relies on drivers in the Philippines, while Kiwi's robots, which are used on some US college campuses, have been known to use workers in Colombia making less than $2 an hour to help complete deliveries. Companies claim the remote drivers only take over when the robots can't navigate a situation, but given how prone these robots are to getting stuck and becoming obstacles for sidewalk users, it's not clear how often that happens.

Many of the leading companies developing self-driving vehicles, which have threatened to one day replace a host of driving jobs, also rely on a fleet of hidden workers. Obviously, there are the highly paid engineers in the US who help develop the software and tools used to map and guide the car, but that isn't the full picture. Autonomous-driving tech is reliant on poorly paid workers around the world who label the thousands of data inputs the car's sensors capture. Without that labeling, the computer wouldn't be able to identify what the sensors are picking up, which allows the systems to slowly learn and make decisions on how to navigate the road. For instance, the data labeling is supposed to help the cars distinguish whether an obstruction is a child or a traffic cone — though it doesn't always work out as planned. An MIT Technology Review investigation last April found that self-driving companies, including Tesla, took advantage of the collapse of Venezuela's economy by getting workers in the country to label self-driving data for an average of just over 90 cents an hour. Last year, Tesla laid off 200 US-based workers it directly employed to do this labeling, suggesting it was automating a majority of those tasks instead — a computer teaching another computer. It's not just self-driving tech. A recent Time magazine investigation found that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, relies on Kenyan workers paid less than $2 an hour who have to view content on a range of disturbing topics, including ""child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self harm, and incest,"" to try to make the tool less toxic. This follows an earlier report about Facebook using the same subcontractor in Kenya for its own content moderation. Other companies have gone so far as to recruit workers in refugee camps, where the opportunities are few and people will accept incredibly low wages, to help train their machine learning and AI tools. Far from the ""set it and forget it"" tools that require just a few genius coders, many of these supposedly autonomous marvels actually rely on an army of low-paid workers around the world.The myth of efficiencyIf you ask the companies, they'll say the automation push is about efficiency and better serving customers. McDonald's claims its concept store will speed up service and lead to fewer wrong orders, while Tesla has claimed that automating data labeling is more efficient. The idea is that these machines or software solutions will allow a job to be done faster or better, making life easier for companies and customers alike. But in reality, these tools aren't more efficient — they just shift the necessary work away from the end consumer and disconnect people from the effort that is required to deliver them a product.

For one thing, it's not even clear that all the newfangled tools that companies have built are actually making the economy more efficient. US labor productivity — the measure of how many worker hours are required to produce a certain amount of economic output — has been growing at below its long-run average since 2005. And despite hope that the forced digital transition would turn it around, productivity growth has only gotten worse since the start of the pandemic.Instead of improving productivity, automation is often focused on increasing the power that employers have over workers. In his book, ""Automation and the Future of Work,"" the economic historian Aaron Benanav explains that companies aren't putting money toward tools to make employees' lives easier, but are pouring money into ""technologies allowing for detailed surveillance of those same workers"" like computer-monitoring software that tracks the keystrokes of employees or Amazon's sophisticated algorithmic management tools that evaluate workers' every movement.






                                  Automation and AI are often used to monitor workers, like in Amazon warehouses.

These technologies are often deployed to de-skill work — jobs are broken down into more specific tasks and can be done with less training. As a result, workers are shifted from employee to contractor status. People who once worked stable, middle-class jobs are thrown into a more precarious world where wages are lower and they have less say over the terms of their employment. The data labelers are the tip of this iceberg: A large (and growing) industry of ""microworkers"" on platforms like Mechanical Turk or Clickworker fuel the supposed automated tech of all these tech companies. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos went so far as to call the use of workers to make a process seem automated ""artificial artificial intelligence."" For those who still hold onto service or warehouse jobs, the specter of automation is wielded like a Sword of Damocles to keep them from pushing for better working conditions or wages. Meanwhile, the technologies that are deployed simply give employers more power to track everything workers do while on the clock — a miserable working reality. Looking at this trend in 2015, the journalist Lauren Smiley wrote that it was creating a world where ""you're either pampered, isolated royalty — or you're a 21st-century servant."" There's no question that some of these technologies provide conveniences for consumers or even free up their time so they can focus on their own work, but that doesn't make the treatment of the workers they depend on acceptable. Technology could be used to empower workers, for example, by giving them more control over their work so they can use their skills to make more informed decisions, but that data is often not shared by companies.

Instead of using this new technology for good, Phil Jones, a researcher and the author of ""Work Without the Worker: Labour in the Age of Platform Capitalism,"" argues that companies simply deploy semi-automated tech to make it seem as if executives or the brand itself deserve all the credit for the end product rather than the human employees who made it possible. ""Workers disappear in the long shadow of the machine,"" Jones writes, and customers and clients don't have to think as much about how the sausage gets made. All the while, the quality of jobs is degraded. New technologies like AI are framed as offering us various forms of empowerment and liberation: We'll be able to work more productively, spend less time doing our chores, and anything we want will be a click or tap away. But those promises never paint an accurate picture of how that tech is transforming the world around us or the true cost of those supposed benefits. Automation may empower some people, but in the process, it's making things a lot harder for the hidden workers keeping everything moving.Paris Marx is a tech writer and host of the Tech Won't Save Us podcast.

 Generative AI is all the rage these days. Many useful applications of AI have started to pop up, from art creation to pretty much anything you can think of. There is one specific application that's going big, though. So big, in fact, that Big Tech companies have started to jump on it. 






 We're talking, of course, about AI chats and searching. But what exactly is generative AI search, and which companies are using it? 


 What Is Generative AI Search? 
    

 First off, we need to explain what generative AI search is. You're probably familiar with the concept of generative AI—it's a type of artificial intelligence that can generate content for you, from images to text, to music, and everything in between. It started catching on in late 2021 to early 2022, but it's matured to the point it can do some really amazing—and occasionally creepy—things. 






 But generative AI search is a proposition that, once it matures, can be greatly useful to users. Basically, it's like a search engine that can give you concise answers to questions generated by artificial intelligence based on the pool of knowledge that specific AI has access to. It can parse concise user questions and try to come up with answers that will be useful without necessarily linking to a website or portal. 

 In a way, this is pretty much the same way ChatGPT works. Right now, you can pull up ChatGPT and ask it questions. For example, you can ask it to whip up a recipe with a number of ingredients, or you can ask it for complicated questions about the ins and outs of chemistry. 

 But generative AI search aims to use that kind of output generation to replace all, or most, of the currently searched queries through regular search engines. And it aims to do a lot more. It's, essentially, putting the capabilities of ChatGPT, and all its power, at the fingertips of most regular users. 







 How Is Generative AI Search Different From Regular Search? 
    

 There are a few ways in which generative AI search is vastly different from regular search. 

 Right now, if you pull up Google and enter a search term, it'll return a number of search results of different things it found through the internet matching your search. Search engines in their current state are, essentially, directories of websites. They do the best job possible at indexing billions of websites and looking through each and every one of them to give you the exact one you're looking for. 






 Search engines are neat. They've been improved over the years, so it's even easier to search for specific information, and the results are not just a blank, boring-looking list of websites. For one, if you're asking it a question, it may pull up a quote from a website in an attempt to answer that question. And if you look up a company, place, or celebrity, it'll pull up a side panel with condensed information about what or who it is, and links to find more information. 

 Generative AI search wants to be the next step forward in this direction. Instead of pulling up millions of search results, your query gets fed through an AI that will try to help you the best way it can. If you have a question, it'll pull up information from its pool of knowledge to answer it, and if you want it to help you out with something, it will try and do so to the best of its ability. Basically, it's ChatGPT, except it looks like a browser. 






 It has a few challenges ahead, and it might not replace regular search engines entirely as they will still have their purpose, but it might become a nice compliment that will make them way more useful whenever the technology is mature and released. 



 Which Companies Are Using Generative AI Search? 
    

 Right now, the generative AI search battle is being fought between Google and Microsoft. 

 Microsoft announced the release of ""the new Bing,"" a new version of the company's search engine that will provide you not only with the regular Bing search experience but also with a complimentary, ChatGPT-like window where you can ask ""real questions"" and get ""complete answers."" You can ask it for help with your daily life, or just simple questions that you might or might not find using regular Bing. 





 In addition, ""the new Microsoft Edge"" is a revamped version of Microsoft's browser with this AI technology built in. So instead of heading over to the Bing browser, you can pull up a sidebar in Edge where you can input whatever you want the AI to help you with. It can come in handy if, for example, you're writing an email and struggling to find the right words. 

 Google, on the other hand, is also coming up with new AI features of its own. Google launched its ChatGPT-like chatbot called Bard, but eventually, the company wants to bring AI features into its main products as well. This includes the company's regular search experience, where AI-generated answers will complement, not replace, regular search results. 








 When Will I Be Able to Use Generative AI Search? 
 Right now, you're able to play around with ChatGPT. It's been doing some amazing things, and you can ask it to come up with answers to your questions now. It has a few limitations—it is, of course, a product in testing, its data range is limited to the end of 2021 (at the time of writing), and it might occasionally say inaccurate or false things. But it's a fun product to play around with. 

 As for actual AI-powered search engines, you can now join the waitlist for ""the new Bing"" at Microsoft's website. As for Google, there's no waitlist, but the company might eventually open up its work on AI sometime over the next few months. 



 Generative AI Search is Great 
 Generative AI search still needs work to become truly useful, but it is already a promising prospect. We can't wait to hear more about it as work continues on AI products.

Generative AI has been all the rage in the recent months, but it is typically generic and not specifically focused on the specific needs of any one company.
San Francisco-based startup Jasper is aiming to help make generative AI less generic. The company made a series of announcements today at its Gen AI conference.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
Jasper is a well-funded operation, raising $125 million in October 2022 to help advance its generative AI efforts. All the money is being put to good use, the company says, as it is rolling out new products that expand enterprise functionally and usefulness for Jasper’s generative AI technology.
To date, Jasper’s AI platform has been providing services that help organizations rapidly develop both text- and image-based content.
Now, Jasper is taking the next step for enterprise generative AI with the launch of its Jasper for Business suite. Among the new features is Jasper Brand Voice, which helps organizations customize content creation to match the tone and style of their existing brand. 
The new Jasper Everywhere feature is meant to extend Jasper’s generative AI to run wherever users are working, including in online documents and content management systems (CMSs). 
And, rounding out Jasper’s updates is an API (application programming interface) designed to help organizations extend generative AI to their own application development.
“We’re very focused on how people use generative AI in business settings,” Jasper president Shane Orlich said in a media briefing. “We want generative AI to be the superpower that sits alongside our business users and helps them create better content at work.”
There may be no ‘I’ in teams, but Jasper wants there to be AI
Organizations almost always work in teams with multiple groups of individuals working together to help execute a task.
The Jasper for Teams offering is designed to help support this collaboration workflow. Jeremy Crane, VP of product at Jasper, explained that the tool is an ongoing effort that will encompass a number of features including document collaboration, status updates and analytics. The document sharing and collaboration feature is intended to be similar to tools such as Google Docs, said Crane.
Extending the ability of Jasper’s generative AI to work wherever users are working is another part of the company’s initiative to better support business workflows. Crane noted that Jasper is building out tools that will integrate its generative AI with existing business applications. It’s an effort the company has dubbed Jasper Everywhere. 
The first step in that effort is an updated version of the company’s web browser extension that supports Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
Crane said that the browser extension is designed to be conveniently accessible to users as they perform their tasks. This means that users have access to the tool in the context of other web-based tools without having to switch back to Jasper.
Generative AI doesn’t need to be generic AIadvertisement
Generative AI is built with large language models (LLMs) that are often trained on large, albeit generic, sets of data.
The new Jasper Brand Voice feature is an effort to fine-tune generative AI content creation to meet the specific style and needs for a given organization. With Brand Voice, an organization can provide updated corporate and product information to the AI model to support a higher degree of accuracy for content creation.
Many organizations utilize some form of style guide within their marketing to help provide a consistent message and tone. That style guide approach can now be replicated with Jasper’s Brand Voice.
“Every company has different rules that they use for writing that they want to implement across their team, such as what acronyms they use or don’t use,” said Crane. 
With Brand Voice, he said, Jasper can help anyone with a company create content, in the right tone and style with the latest information about the company and its services.advertisement
All the new capabilities coming to the Jasper for Business offering are developed with a series of different generative AI models at its foundation, including OpenAI.
“Think of Jasper as this application layer that’s sitting on top of many different models, including our own models,” Orlich said. “We’re able to pick and choose which pieces of those models we want to support in order to create the right piece of output for our customers.”

Generative AI (Chat GPT) and its Implications for Pakistan

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that can generate new data, such as text, images, or music, based on the patterns it has learned from existing data. This is achieved through techniques such as deep learning and neural networks. Generative AI has the potential to have a significant impact on the job market in developing countries, both positively and negatively. One example of generative AI is Chat GPT, which has revolutionized the use of AI. In the book, The New Fire War, Peace, and Democracy in the Age of AI, Ben Buchanan and Andrew Imbrue argue that AI is like fire; if we control it, it can become a source of power; otherwise, it can become a source of destruction. It can have both positive and negative impacts. 
According to the World Economic Forum, two-thirds of jobs could be lost due to automation in the developing world. This could have a significant impact on the population and stability of the government in Pakistan. Additionally, Pakistan’s lack of access to education and technology could exacerbate the adverse effects of job loss due to AI automation. It is essential to keep in mind that the impact of generative AI on the job market in Pakistan is likely to be complex and multifaceted and will depend on a variety of factors, such as the specific industries and job types in question as government policies and regulations. This could disproportionately affect low-skilled workers and those without access to education and training in AI-related fields. 
On the positive side, generative AI can help the Pakistani economy by enhancing efficiency and productivity. It can automate specific tasks, such as data analysis and decision-making, and increase efficiency in manufacturing and agriculture. This can lead to increased productivity and economic growth. Moreover, in Pakistan, where unemployment is already high, the use of generative AI in developing countries can create new job opportunities in fields related to AI, such as data analysis, software development, and machine learning. In addition, it can help in improving healthcare. It can be used to analyze large amounts of medical data and improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This can lead to improved healthcare outcomes and increased access to medical services in developing countries.
Moreover, it can help improve education. It can be used to create personalized learning experiences for students. This can lead to improved educational outcomes and increased access to education in developing countries.
It’s important to note that the positive impact of generative AI in Pakistan will depend on the availability of resources such as electricity, internet access and skilled workforce, and government policies and regulations. Because significant investment in AI is coming from a few countries. Countries which are already developed are taking first mover advantage.
According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, China and the US account for over 75% of global AI venture capital investment. In recent years, China has spent more and more money on AI research. By 2020, the country is expected to have spent between $7 billion and $10 billion on AI. The US government has invested around $1.1 billion in AI research and development through the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. Other countries, such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, are investing in AI, but their investments are relatively smaller than those of the US and China. 
Hence, Pakistan should make an effort to improve the environment for the implementation of AI. Pakistan’s education system needs to be updated. Millions of children are out of school. It will be difficult for them to find good work in the AI era.
 AI has the potential to significantly impact jobs which will create difficulties in implementing AI in organizations. It will present Pakistan with two types of challenges. If Pakistan is going to implement AI technology, low-skilled people are going to lose their jobs. If we do not implement AI in our organization, we will not be able to compete with the world. Therefore, Pakistan’s policy should invest in science and technology education. We should increase investment in AI. Otherwise, it is going to have long-term implications for our comprehensive security.

Whether you’re looking for a new job, or you’re being sought out by a recruiter to fill an exciting open position, odds are AI is highly influencing the decision-making process. AI helps determine what job opportunities you see on LinkedIn or other job platforms, and it helps recruiting teams streamline everything from posting positions, evaluating candidates, matching skills to jobs, and even interviewing. And it does it lightning fast: what used to take days or weeks for human recruiters now can be performed by AI in a matter of seconds.  

The Evolving Role of AI in Recruitment
Today’s job search platforms like LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed, and others are using AI at an increasing rate to streamline an otherwise tedious manual process for recruiters. The ultimate goal of these sites, of course, is to match qualified candidates with available positions. They do so by employing AI-powered recommendations algorithms (or matching engines) to curate a list of recommendations for each search. Recruiters are said to be able to scan a resume in seconds, but AI can reduce that time to milliseconds. 
AI technologies are being applied in other interesting segments of the recruiting experience. Conducting an interview became a big challenge during the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, leading to a number of companies like Curious Thing to release AI-powered interviews that help engage candidates using voice-based conversational AI. Other hiring companies today might even request a candidate to play dan AI-powered video game that evaluates personality traits to see if you’ll be a good fit for different roles. 
How AI in Recruitment Helps Companies
There is a special nuance to recruiting, so AI will never replace recruiters, of course. But it will improve how fast and how well recruiters can do their job, and that has financial and productivity implications for any hiring organization. Areas that AI can help include:

Lowering Time to Hire: Matching candidates with specific roles can be a tedious task, so AI can help address this critical metric. Up to 40 percent of a recruiter’s time is spent on manual tasks like entering data into an applicant tracking system (ATS) or just reviewing resumes, time that is much better spent on the human aspect of building candidate relationships and improving the hiring experience. 
Improving Quality of Hire: Finding the absolute “right” candidate for any role is of paramount importance, and the devil is in the details. AI plays an important role in instantly searching through a huge data pool to match skills or attributes with jobs. The more a recruiter uses the AI engine, the faster AI learns on what an exact match looks like to improve prospective candidate quality.
Pursuing Passive Candidates: AI is very useful in the recruitment of what’s known as “passive candidates,” or those who are not actively looking for a job. The talent pool is massive for this group (it’s pretty much everyone out there not in the job search), so AI can quickly zoom in on great candidates, whether they’re looking or not.

How LinkedIn Uses AI in Recruitment
LinkedIn in particular has been boosting its development of AI and machine learning to improve the overall experience for its users and customers, including: 

Job Matching: An AI-powered personalization tool that matches jobs and candidates has led to a 30 percent increase in job applications. Members receive highly targeted employment recommendations on their home page, or suggestions on connecting with other professionals in their field.
Better Emails: AI can help improve a recruiter’s ability to reach out and engage a candidate with the right email messaging and content. Each message now sent is twice as likely to become a hire with the help of AI, and the number of two-way conversations (a vital part of recruiting engagement) has doubled. 
Overcoming Bias: It’s an unfortunate phenomenon, but ranked lists produced by an AI algorithm can sometimes inadvertently result in unintended bias, including gender bias. For example, men are more likely to apply for jobs beyond their qualifications, whereas women tend to pursue jobs that directly match the requirements. To address the issue, a new algorithm was developed to counteract recommendations skewed toward a particular group, resulting in a better distribution of users across gender. 
Internal Development: LinkedIn even developed a new AI tool to unify scattered AI workflows for its developers that use many different AI platforms for data analysis and collaboration. The unified tool called “Darwin” (Data science and Artificial intelligence Workbench at LinkedIn) enables data scientists, AI engineers, data analysts, business analysts, and even product managers to work together.

Conclusion: AI in Recruitment Is Just Getting Started
Like many fields, AI is streamlining critical processes in recruiting to improve the speed, quality and satisfaction of both recruiters and job seekers. And at places like LinkedIn, there is a growing demand for AI engineers and data scientists that can put skills to work to build and expand amazing professional networks.

 As artificial intelligence is becoming part of everything we do, the role of an AI analyst is becoming more essential for a range of businesses. This type of analyst relies on machine learning algorithms to monitor, assess, collect, process, and track statistical information from sets of data. 






 The path of an AI analyst is in high demand because of its future direction in many industries, but why is it growing to be more important? Here are some of the responsibilities of an AI analyst, and how they could impact the future of technology. 


 1. Designing or Analyzing Algorithms 

 

 How good are you at remembering patterns? As an AI analyst, you need to be an expert at designing and assessing various algorithm patterns, as this is what the bulk of AI software is built from. These algorithms can be important for designing layout or color, optimizations, speed, customizing user news feeds, or even generating images. 






 An artificial intelligence analyst works with a team of other data scientists and engineers on statistical modeling, natural language processing, and machine learning. For example, you could be working on the next powerful text-to-image generator, like NightCafe Creator. 



 2. Evaluating Software Applications 

 

 Want to ensure software applications are working correctly? Based on machine learning algorithms, AI analysts constantly monitor and assess data on a daily basis. With this job, you would be responsible for analyzing the source code of AI-based software applications, which is vital to any application working properly. 






 This could include any intelligent software capable of learning and problem-solving, such as company chatbots that speak to customers, or Cortana on Windows. With advanced technology such as this, the quality of the software is something you want to be trialed and tested, especially if it is a commercial product for a wider audience. If you're building a virtual assistant, for example, you want it to respond correctly to customer questions. 



 3. Research New AI Technology 

 

 Do you consider yourself a great researcher? AI is always changing, so researching new technologies can help optimize performance and solve problems more quickly. After all, the evolution of AI today is due to constant research. 






 Faced with constant information, organizations or small businesses may need a new type of system that adapts and learns. From natural language generation to speech recognition, robotic processing, or deep learning programs, there are so many ways this technology can assist businesses. Want to learn more about a branch in this career path? Here is how to become an artificial intelligence engineer. 



 4. Testing Prototypes 

 

 How useful are your critical thinking or reasoning skills? A prototype is where all products, whether a mobile app or physical product, always begin. And the quicker they get past these development stages, the more successful they become. AI analysts make this process even easier by testing prototypes. 






 Prototype testing offers valuable feedback that analysts can use to avoid expensive mistakes, so end users can get the best possible outcome. This could be done through user testing, for example, a chat system for customers to use on a new technology website. Another example could be acquiring user feedback on an app in beta mode. It's valuable to any team. 

 AI analysts design data analysis based on machine learning techniques to boost the testing phase. Through testing prototypes over time, AI analysts can uncover a range of hidden opportunities that creators may have missed. 



 5. Writing Computer Code 

 






 Are you amazing at computer languages? AI analysts should be well-versed in writing computer codes, as this is how artificial intelligence is created. In AI, coding boosts the logical and analytical understanding of data, so learning to code allows AI analysts to solve problems related to big data. 

 AI analysts should have a sound knowledge of programming languages like R or SAS to assist in gathering data, analyzing statistics, or visualizing data. By learning to code, analysts can clean data, change it into various formats, understand errors in databases, and bring forth new ideas to introduce more solutions. 



 6. Assisting Business Productivity 

 

 When it comes to business productivity, AI analysts help a business thrive in many ways. With AI being able to predict future analytics, analysts can reduce errors in supply chain networks, for example, making this a much smoother process for businesses that need products pushed quickly. 





 AI analysts boost the productivity of businesses with predictive maintenance, business monitoring, customer experience monitoring, and revenue monitoring. If there are time constraints or numbers needing to be met, an AI analyst knows every part of this process and is incredibly valuable to any team. 



 7. Preparing Reports 

 

 AI analysts in today’s digitized world collaborate with professionals related to data mining, machine learning, cloud computing, and more. With this in mind, you need outstanding communication to be able to prepare reports that are accurate and make sense. 






 Companies need AI analysts to work in cross-functional teams, so if you've always been an organized person, preparing reports may be your favorite responsibility. An AI analyst is responsible for preparing, procuring, and modeling machine learning models, as well as handling all the numbers in terms of products or marketing. 

 These professionals should also know how to prepare reports on research, experimentation, and the development of new approaches. AI analysts can then present their findings, offer suggestions, and assist the company in the future. Looking to practice for an AI role? Here are the best tips to make your project reports stand out! 



 8. Maximizing Business Returns 

 






 Do you thrive on business that can increase its revenue? You wouldn't think it, but an AI analyst adds a huge amount of value to business returns. AI has great potential to make this happen, with the assistance of targeted marketing, customer service, automated workflows, optimizing product pricing, and so much more. 

 By analyzing data properly, analysts can increase and establish a number of their project goals each quarter. On a technology website, for example, AI has the power to personalize ad content depending on past search results. AI can help businesses automate workflows with voice assistants to read emails, for example, or intelligent screenings that can scan for malware. 



 AI Analysts Are Technologically Innovative 
 With AI analytics, automated data analysis, and machine technologies, an AI analyst profession involves data-driven knowledge to help solve previously unsolvable challenges. 






 Making use of AI analytical skills helps in driving customer engagement, improving prototype development, improving reports, and increasing business returns. An AI analyst can ultimately improve the way of the future in the world of business, and as a career path, is guaranteed to grow.

But, as has been the case in the past, experts argue, AI will likely offset much of that by spurring the creation of new jobs in addition to enhancing many existing jobs. The big question is: what sort of jobs?I’m a copywriter. I’m pretty sure artificial intelligence is going to take my jobRead more“AI will wipe out a lot of current jobs, as has happened with all past technologies,” said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. “But I have no reason to think that AI and robots won’t continue changing the mix of jobs. The question is: will the change in the mix of jobs exacerbate existing inequalities? Will AI raise productivity so much that even as it displaces a lot of jobs, it creates new ones and raises living standards?”Anu Madgavkar, who leads labor market research at the McKinsey Global Institute, estimates that one in four workers in the US are going to see more AI and technology adopted in their jobs. She said 50-60% of companies say they are pursuing AI-related projects. “So one way or the other people are going to have to learn to work with AI,” Madgavkar said.One way or the other people are going to have to learn to work with AIAnu MadgavkarWhile past rounds of automation affected factory jobs most, Madgavkar said that AI will hit white-collar jobs most. “It’s increasingly going into office-based work and customer service and sales,” she said. “They are the job categories that will have the highest rate of automation adoption and the biggest displacement. These workers will have to work with it or move into different skills.”In other words, many office workers could face downward mobility.Workforce experts are asking many questions about AI: will it displace many call-center workers or merely make those workers more productive by quickly delivering needed information to them as they speak to customers? Will AI displace radiologists because of its ability to read cancer scans or will it help radiologists by enabling them to focus on more complicated, nuanced issues in interpreting scans? Will AI be able to replace some journalists by writing stories about baseball games or Wall Street’s daily ups and downs?Some workforce experts say AI and other new technologies will hurt middle-level, white-collar jobs more than lower-paying, physically intensive jobs. McKinsey’s Madgavkar said it will be hard for AI or robots to do the jobs of janitors. In food service, she said, new technologies might be able to take customer orders, but “we’re not going to see many little robots that bring the food to a particular table”.At law firms, AI might eliminate some attorneys’ jobs by being able to prepare first drafts of business contracts. But AI might also enable paralegals to oversee preparation of draft contracts, and that increased responsibility could mean higher pay for paralegals.“If you make workers more productive, workers are then supposed to make more money,” said William Spriggs, an economics professor at Howard University and chief economist at the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation. “Companies don’t want to have a discussion about sharing the benefits of these technologies. They’d rather have a discussion to scare the bejesus out of you about these new technologies. They want you to concede that you’re just grateful to have a job and that you’ll pay us peanuts.”Spriggs noted that when a wave of automation swept through the auto industry from the 1950s through 1970s, “the UAW said to Ford and GM, we’re a lot more productive and you’re a lot more profitable. As a result, the workers got a lot more money.”David Autor, an economics professor at MIT, is wary of making predictions about ChatGPT and AI. “There’s just enormous uncertainty,” he said.The concern is: will AI reduce the value of a lot of skill sets and make labor more commodified?David Autor,But he’s not concerned with the US running out of jobs. “If anything, we don’t have enough people for jobs right now,” he said. “I’m concerned about the change of composition in jobs.” He voiced concern that AI, by eliminating some middle-class jobs and de-skilling some jobs, will move many workers into lower-paying jobs like food service. “The concern is: will AI reduce the value of a lot of skill sets and make labor more commodified?”New technologies like AI often produce jobs that no one could predict – before the invention of computers, who would have foreseen the job of computer programmer? Workforce experts say AI will create more jobs for engineers and certain types of managers, and that any AI-caused decrease in jobs could be offset by increases in the number of healthcare jobs as the overall population ages. AI might call for a beefed-up system of retraining to, for instance, prepare a laid-off salesperson for a hospital job.Juliet Schor, an economist at Boston College, said it would be far better if employers, instead of laying off people because of AI, would trim employees’ work time, perhaps to three or four days a week, instead of five. “Work-time reduction is really the far better way to respond to labor-displacing technological change,” Schor said. She voiced fears that AI could produce a large pool of jobless Americans, and even with some system of universal basic income, “that would create inequality between the people who have work and the people who don’t. That’s a big problem.”Julie Shah, an MIT professor who leads the Interactive Robotics Group at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said she works with employers to get them to use AI and robots to “augment and enhance workers, rather than replace them”. She said some employers want to use robots to have a lights-out factory without any human workers, while other companies want robots to work alongside humans to make them more efficient — and to have human workers on hand to propose future ideas for innovation.Shah pointed to a study of large French corporations that introduced robots; those firms increased overall employment even as their domestic competitors reduced their workforce. She also cited a study of Canadian companies that began using robots and ultimately reduced the number of middle managers, while increasing the number of production workers. In the US, she noted, some companies adopted robots and offered higher wages, while having fewer jobs overall.“These technologies are not leading to one future, but to many possible futures,” Shah said.Harvard’s Katz is also worried about AI’s effects on income inequality. “It’s likely to continue to reduce labor’s share of income as many tasks get automated,” he said.Katz said a big issue is who will share in the gains if AI yields major productivity growth, and how those gains will be shared. “How much will need to come through redistribution policies?” he asked. “If it’s really good and massively increases productivity, even if workers get a smaller share of the pie, they could end up with higher incomes.”But these gains are unlikely to trickle down to workers in the US given current circumstances. “Having a stronger say for workers and their representatives in this process is an important element to adjusting to these changes. That’s happened in countries that have stronger unions and works councils. That’s an area where we in the US have fallen behind,” Katz said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTUS income inequalitynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveUS elections: Kamala Harris to make first speech since Biden endorsement as more top Democrats back VP – live updatesFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome The post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallWhat is the Kamala Harris coconut tree meme and why is everyone sharing it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the viral ChatGPT app has captured the imagination of the general public in recent months, acting as a powerful demonstration of what AI is already capable of. For some, it may also seem like a warning about what might be in store for the future.

Undoubtedly, one of the strengths of AI is its ability to make sense of large amounts of data – searching out patterns and putting it into reports, documents, and formats that humans can easily understand. This is the day-to-day “bread and butter” of data analysts as well as many other knowledge economy professionals whose work involves working with data and analytics.

It’s true that artificial intelligence – a term that generally, in business and industry, refers to machine learning – has been used for years in these fields. What ChatGPT and similar tools built on large language models (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP) bring to the table is that it can be easily and effectively used by anybody. If a CEO can simply say to a computer, “what do I need to do to improve customer satisfaction?” or “how can I make more sales?” do they need to worry about hiring, training, and maintaining an expensive analytics team to answer those questions?

PROMOTED
Well, fortunately, the answer probably, is yes. In fact, as AI becomes more accessible and mainstream, that team may well become even more critical to the business than it already is. What is beyond doubt, though, is that their jobs will substantially change. So, here’s my rundown of how this technology may affect the field of data and analytics as it becomes mainstream in the near future.


Firstly, what are ChatGPT, LLMs, and NLP?

ChatGPT is a publicly-available conversational (or chatbot) interface powered by a LLM called GPT-3, developed by the research institute OpenAI. The LLM (Large Language Model) is part of a field of machine learning known as natural language processing, which essentially means that it enables us to talk to machines, and for them to reply to us in “natural” (i.e., human) languages. In short, this means that we can ask it a question in English, or in fact, one of almost 100 languages. It can also read, understand and generate computer code in a number of popular programming languages, including Python, Javascript, and C++. We've gotten used to interacting with NLP technology for some time now thanks largely to AI assistants like Alexa and Siri, but the LLM powering GPT-3 and ChatGPT is orders of magnitude larger, enabling it to understand far more complex inputs and provide far more sophisticated outputs.

The GPT-3 LLM appears to be able to use language in a very sophisticated way because it was trained on a huge dataset of information, said to consist of over 175 billion parameters. This includes an open repository of web data called Common Crawl and several online book archives. By processing all of this data, it is able to learn how words are connected to each other and predict what is likely to be the most suitable response to any prompt (a question or other input) that it’s given. It’s sometimes called “generative AI” because it creates new outputs that haven’t been seen before.

What are the limitations of ChatGPT?
Before we get too excited about what it can do, it’s worth pointing out that despite the hype, there are some fairly significant limits on what the technology can do today. Firstly, it frequently makes mistakes – sometimes very basic ones – which could easily leave anyone relying on it in a professional capacity looking somewhat silly if they aren’t careful.
For example, when I was working on this article, an obvious thing to do was ask ChatGPT what parts of a data analyst's job it’s capable of automating. One of the first answers it gave was, “ChatGPT can generate graphs, charts, and other visualizations."" This is clearly wrong, as it’s only capable of generating text.
Where data analytics is concerned, ChatGPT is also limited by the fact that we can’t upload data to it beyond any information that can be input as text. We can’t, for example, upload an Excel sheet of sales figures and ask it for insights. Of course, there’s no telling what future versions will be able to do. With that in mind, let’s look at how it can be used and speculate a little about what may be possible with LLMs and NLP in the near future.

How can ChatGPT, LLMs, and NLP be used in data and analytics?
Here are some of the key ways ChatGPT, LLMs, and NLP can be used in data and analytics:
· Create code and applications that can analyze data or automate processes such as data gathering, data formatting, or data cleansing.
· Define data structures – for example, what fields should be included in records in a database or what row and column headings are needed for a spreadsheet.
· Tell us how charts, graphs, diagrams, or infographics should be constructed and what information needs to be included.
· Suggest what information to include in reports in order that different audiences – executives, departmental heads, managers, and so on – will be able to take action based on them.
· Create training material to teach workers how to apply analytics to their own data.
· Identify data sources that are likely to contain the insights we need for a particular task – for example, ""Where can I find data on financial fraud in India?”
· Create dummy or synthetic data for a variety of purposes, such as training other machine learning models or testing algorithms.
· Provide advice on compliance, regulation, and practical steps that can be taken to ensure data operations are legal, unbiased, and ethical.
· Identify analytical processes and suggest best practices that are most likely to give the desired results.

Is ChatGPT a threat to jobs in data and analytics?
As we’ve seen, ChatGPT can easily automate some of the tasks that are traditionally carried out in analytical jobs – such as business, data, and financial analyst roles. Future iterations of the technology are likely to become even more effective and efficient at doing so.
But that doesn’t mean that anyone who works in an analytical role is going to be out of a job right away. This is primarily because today’s most sophisticated LLMs and NLP tools still lack abilities like critical thinking, strategic planning, and complex problem-solving. Most experts agree that it isn’t likely that machine learning-based tools will be able to carry out these functions at the same level as humans any time soon.
It's likely that businesses and other organizations will still have a need for humans who are experts in this field for some time to come.
Having said that, analytics roles that only require repetitive work are likely to become largely automated in the near future, and it’s probably inevitable that some jobs will be lost due to this.
At the same time, new jobs will be created. These are likely to revolve around the ability to deploy tools like ChatGPT while at the same time practicing human decision-making, problem-solving, leadership, strategy, leadership, and team-building.

I work in data and analytics; how can I make sure I don’t become redundant?
There are two very important rules to follow here. Firstly, whatever you do, do not stick your head in the sand and pretend this isn’t happening and that AI isn't about to dramatically change the way you work.
Secondly, learn to use this technology as a tool. Understand what its abilities are to augment your own skills by using tools like ChatGPT or whatever comes next to automate routine and repetitive tasks. In this piece, I’ve listed a number of tasks that this can be applied to right away – work through them and make sure you understand how each one can be done. Then, learn how to take advantage of the time and efficiency gains that this creates in order to develop your skillset and focus on areas where you can really make a difference.
Ignoring the arrival of AI in your profession is only likely to result in being left behind, as colleagues and competitors who are willing to move with the times reap the rewards. Right now, all we’re seeing is the tip of the iceberg. As the technology evolves, more and more aspects of all of our day-to-day work will become automated. Staying ahead of this curve, teaching yourself to use new tools as they become available, and maintaining awareness of areas where the human touch is still necessary, is the key to thriving in the age of AI.

Large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 are massive neural networks that can generate human-like text, from poetry to programming code. Trained using troves of internet data, these machine-learning models take a small bit of input text and then predict the text that is likely to come next.

But that’s not all these models can do. Researchers are exploring a curious phenomenon known as in-context learning, in which a large language model learns to accomplish a task after seeing only a few examples — despite the fact that it wasn’t trained for that task. For instance, someone could feed the model several example sentences and their sentiments (positive or negative), then prompt it with a new sentence, and the model can give the correct sentiment.

Typically, a machine-learning model like GPT-3 would need to be retrained with new data for this new task. During this training process, the model updates its parameters as it processes new information to learn the task. But with in-context learning, the model’s parameters aren’t updated, so it seems like the model learns a new task without learning anything at all.

Scientists from MIT, Google Research, and Stanford University are striving to unravel this mystery. They studied models that are very similar to large language models to see how they can learn without updating parameters.

The researchers’ theoretical results show that these massive neural network models are capable of containing smaller, simpler linear models buried inside them. The large model could then implement a simple learning algorithm to train this smaller, linear model to complete a new task, using only information already contained within the larger model. Its parameters remain fixed.

An important step toward understanding the mechanisms behind in-context learning, this research opens the door to more exploration around the learning algorithms these large models can implement, says Ekin Akyürek, a computer science graduate student and lead author of a paper exploring this phenomenon. With a better understanding of in-context learning, researchers could enable models to complete new tasks without the need for costly retraining.

""Usually, if you want to fine-tune these models, you need to collect domain-specific data and do some complex engineering. But now we can just feed it an input, five examples, and it accomplishes what we want. So, in-context learning is an unreasonably efficient learning phenomenon that needs to be understood,"" Akyürek says.

Joining Akyürek on the paper are Dale Schuurmans, a research scientist at Google Brain and professor of computing science at the University of Alberta; as well as senior authors Jacob Andreas, the X Consortium Assistant Professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); Tengyu Ma, an assistant professor of computer science and statistics at Stanford; and Danny Zhou, principal scientist and research director at Google Brain. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.

A model within a model

In the machine-learning research community, many scientists have come to believe that large language models can perform in-context learning because of how they are trained, Akyürek says.

For instance, GPT-3 has hundreds of billions of parameters and was trained by reading huge swaths of text on the internet, from Wikipedia articles to Reddit posts. So, when someone shows the model examples of a new task, it has likely already seen something very similar because its training dataset included text from billions of websites. It repeats patterns it has seen during training, rather than learning to perform new tasks.

Akyürek hypothesized that in-context learners aren’t just matching previously seen patterns, but instead are actually learning to perform new tasks. He and others had experimented by giving these models prompts using synthetic data, which they could not have seen anywhere before, and found that the models could still learn from just a few examples. Akyürek and his colleagues thought that perhaps these neural network models have smaller machine-learning models inside them that the models can train to complete a new task.

“That could explain almost all of the learning phenomena that we have seen with these large models,” he says.

To test this hypothesis, the researchers used a neural network model called a transformer, which has the same architecture as GPT-3, but had been specifically trained for in-context learning.

By exploring this transformer’s architecture, they theoretically proved that it can write a linear model within its hidden states. A neural network is composed of many layers of interconnected nodes that process data. The hidden states are the layers between the input and output layers.

Their mathematical evaluations show that this linear model is written somewhere in the earliest layers of the transformer. The transformer can then update the linear model by implementing simple learning algorithms.

In essence, the model simulates and trains a smaller version of itself.

Probing hidden layers

The researchers explored this hypothesis using probing experiments, where they looked in the transformer’s hidden layers to try and recover a certain quantity.

“In this case, we tried to recover the actual solution to the linear model, and we could show that the parameter is written in the hidden states. This means the linear model is in there somewhere,” he says.

Building off this theoretical work, the researchers may be able to enable a transformer to perform in-context learning by adding just two layers to the neural network. There are still many technical details to work out before that would be possible, Akyürek cautions, but it could help engineers create models that can complete new tasks without the need for retraining with new data.

“The paper sheds light on one of the most remarkable properties of modern large language models — their ability to learn from data given in their inputs, without explicit training. Using the simplified case of linear regression, the authors show theoretically how models can implement standard learning algorithms while reading their input, and empirically which learning algorithms best match their observed behavior,” says Mike Lewis, a research scientist at Facebook AI Research who was not involved with this work. “These results are a stepping stone to understanding how models can learn more complex tasks, and will help researchers design better training methods for language models to further improve their performance.”

Moving forward, Akyürek plans to continue exploring in-context learning with functions that are more complex than the linear models they studied in this work. They could also apply these experiments to large language models to see whether their behaviors are also described by simple learning algorithms. In addition, he wants to dig deeper into the types of pretraining data that can enable in-context learning.

“With this work, people can now visualize how these models can learn from exemplars. So, my hope is that it changes some people’s views about in-context learning,” Akyürek says. “These models are not as dumb as people think. They don’t just memorize these tasks. They can learn new tasks, and we have shown how that can be done.”

It’s overhyped, poorly understood, and flawed but already core to our lives—and it’s only going to extend its reach.AI powers driverless car research, spots otherwise invisible signs of disease on medical images, finds an answer when you ask Alexa a question, and lets you unlock your phone with your face to talk to friends as an animated poop on the iPhone X using Apple’s Animoji. Those are just a few ways AI already touches our lives, and there’s plenty of work still to be done. But don’t worry, superintelligent algorithms aren’t about to take all the jobs or wipe out humanity.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTThe current boom in all things AI was catalyzed by breakthroughs in an area known as machine learning. It involves “training” computers to perform tasks based on examples, rather than relying on programming by a human. A technique called deep learning has made this approach much more powerful. Just ask Lee Sedol, holder of 18 international titles at the complex game of Go. He got creamed by software called AlphaGo in 2016.Featured VideoRE:WIRED 2021: Timnit Gebru on AI and the Discipline of HopeThere’s evidence that AI can make us happier and healthier. But there’s also reason for caution. Incidents in which algorithms picked up or amplified societal biases around race or gender show that an AI-enhanced future won’t automatically be a better one.The Beginnings of Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence as we know it began as a vacation project. Dartmouth professor John McCarthy coined the term in the summer of 1956, when he invited a small group to spend a few weeks musing on how to make machines do things like use language.Moments that Shaped AI1956The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence coins the name of a new field concerned with making software smart like humans.1965Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT creates Eliza, the first chatbot, which poses as a psychotherapist.1975Meta-Dendral, a program developed at Stanford to interpret chemical analyses, makes the first discoveries by a computer to be published in a refereed journal.1987A Mercedes van fitted with two cameras and a bunch of computers drives itself 20 kilometers along a German highway at more than 55 mph, in an academic project led by engineer Ernst Dickmanns.1997IBM’s computer Deep Blue defeats chess world champion Garry Kasparov.2004The Pentagon stages the Darpa Grand Challenge, a race for robot cars in the Mojave Desert that catalyzes the autonomous-car industry.2012Researchers in a niche field called deep learning spur new corporate interest in AI by showing their ideas can make speech and image recognition much more accurate.2016AlphaGo, created by Google unit DeepMind, defeats a world champion player of the board game Go.He had high hopes of a breakthrough in the drive toward human-level machines. “We think that a significant advance can be made,” he wrote with his co-organizers, “if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”Those hopes were not met, and McCarthy later conceded that he had been overly optimistic. But the workshop helped researchers dreaming of intelligent machines coalesce into a recognized academic field.Early work often focused on solving fairly abstract problems in math and logic. But it wasn’t long before AI started to show promising results on more human tasks. In the late 1950s, Arthur Samuel created programs that learned to play checkers. In 1962, one scored a win over a master at the game. In 1967, a program called Dendral showed it could replicate the way chemists interpreted mass-spectrometry data on the makeup of chemical samples.AdvertisementAs the field of AI developed, so did different strategies for making smarter machines. Some researchers tried to distill human knowledge into code or come up with rules for specific tasks, like understanding language. Others were inspired by the importance of learning to understand human and animal intelligence. They built systems that could get better at a task over time, perhaps by simulating evolution or by learning from example data. The field hit milestone after milestone as computers mastered tasks that could previously only be completed by people.Deep learning, the rocket fuel of the current AI boom, is a revival of one of the oldest ideas in AI. The technique involves passing data through webs of math loosely inspired by the working of brain cells that are known as artificial neural networks. As a network processes training data, connections between the parts of the network adjust, building up an ability to interpret future data.Artificial neural networks became an established idea in AI not long after the Dartmouth workshop.

In 2020, DeepMind said that its AlphaFold AI could predict the structure of proteins, a long-standing problem that had hampered research. This was widely seen as one of the first times a real scientific question has been answered with AI.

So long Googling, hello Chat-GPTing?Challenges loom on the horizon, however. AI models need more and more data to improve, but OpenAI has already used the easy sources; finding new piles of written text to use won’t be easy or free. Legal challenges also loom: OpenAI is training its system on text and images that may be under copyright, perhaps even created by the very same people whose jobs are at risk from this technology. And as more online content is created using AI, it creates a feedback loop in which the online data-training models won’t be created by humans, but by machines.Data aside, there’s a fundamental problem with such language models: They spit out text that reads well enough but is not necessarily accurate. As smart as these models are, they don’t know what they’re saying or have any concept of truth—that’s easily forgotten amid the mad rush to make use of such tools for new businesses or to create content. Words aren’t just supposed to sound good, they’re meant to convey meaning too.The Challenges (and Future) of Artificial IntelligenceThere are as many critics of AI as there are cheerleaders—which is good news, given the hype surrounding this set of technologies. Criticism of AI touches on issues as disparate as sustainability, ethics, bias, disinformation, and even copyright, with some arguing the technology is not as capable as most believe and others predicting it’ll be the end of humanity as we know it. It’s a lot to consider.Your AI Decoder RingArtificial intelligenceThe development of computers capable of tasks that typically require human intelligence.Machine learningUsing example data or experience to refine how computers make predictions or perform a task.Deep learningA machine learning technique in which data is filtered through self-adjusting networks of math loosely inspired by neurons in the brain.Supervised learningShowing software labeled example data, such as photographs, to teach a computer what to do.Unsupervised learningLearning without annotated examples, just from experience of data or the world—trivial for humans but not generally practical for machines. Yet.Reinforcement learningSoftware that experiments with different actions to figure out how to maximize a virtual reward, such as scoring points in a game.Artificial general intelligenceAs yet nonexistent software that displays a humanlike ability to adapt to different environments and tasks, and transfer knowledge between them.To start, deep learning inherently requires huge swathes of data, and though innovations in chips mean we can do that faster and more efficiently than ever, there’s no question that AI research churns through energy. A startup estimated that in teaching one system to solve a Rubik’s Cube using a robotic hand OpenAI consumed 2.8 gigawatt-hours of electricity—as much as three nuclear plants could output in an hour. Other estimates suggest training an AI model emits as much carbon dioxide as five American cars being manufactured and driven for their average lifespan.There are techniques to reduce the impact: Researchers are developing more efficient training techniques, models can be chopped up so only necessary sections are run, and data centers and labs are shifting to cleaner energy. AI also has a role to play in improving efficiencies in other industries and otherwise helping address the climate crisis. But boosting the accuracy of AI generally means having more complicated models sift through more data—OpenAI’s GPT2 model reportedly had 1.5 billion weights to assess data, while GPT3 had 175 billion—suggesting AI’s sustainability could get worse before it improves.Vacuuming up all the data needed to build these models creates additional challenges, beyond the shrinking availability of fresh data mentioned above. Bias remains a core problem: Data sets reflect the world around us, and that means models absorb our racism, sexism, and other cultural assumptions. This causes a host of serious problems: AI trained to spot skin cancer performs better on white skin; software designed to predict recidivism inherently rates Black people as more likely to reoffend; and flawed AI facial recognition software has already incorrectly identified Black men, leading to their arrests. And sometimes the AI simply doesn’t work: One violent crime prediction tool for police was wildly inaccurate because of an apparent coding error.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenAgain, mitigations are possible. More inclusive data sets could help tackle bias at the source, while forcing tech companies to explain algorithmic decision-making could add a layer of accountability. Diversifying the industry beyond white men wouldn’t hurt, either. But the most serious challenges may require regulating—and perhaps banning—the use of AI decision-making in situations with the most risk of serious damage to people.Those are a few examples of unwanted outcomes. But people are also already using AI for nefarious ends, such as to create deepfakes and spread disinformation. While AI-edited or AI-generated videos and images have intriguing use cases—such as filling in for voice actors after they leave a show or pass away—generative AI has also been used to make deepfake porn, adding famous faces to adult actors, or used to defame everyday individuals. And AI has been used to flood the web with disinformation, though fact-checkers have turned to the technology to fight back.As AI systems grow more powerful, they will rightly invite more scrutiny. Government use of software in areas such as criminal justice is often flawed or secretive, and corporations like Meta have begun confronting the downsides of their own life-shaping algorithms. More powerful AI has the potential to create worse problems, for example by perpetuating historical biases and stereotypes against women or Black people. Civil-society groups and even the tech industry itself are now exploring rules and guidelines on the safety and ethics of AI.But the hype around generative models suggests we still haven’t learned our lesson when it comes to AI. We need to calm down; understand how it works and when it doesn’t; and then roll out this tool in a careful, considered manner, mitigating concerns as they’re raised.

Those are just a few ways AI already touches our lives, and there’s plenty of work still to be done. But don’t worry, superintelligent algorithms aren’t about to take all the jobs or wipe out humanity.
The current boom in all things AI was catalyzed by breakthroughs in an area known as machine learning. It involves “training” computers to perform tasks based on examples, rather than relying on programming by a human. A technique called deep learning has made this approach much more powerful. Just ask Lee Sedol, holder of 18 international titles at the complex game of Go. He got creamed by software called AlphaGo in 2016.
There’s evidence that AI can make us happier and healthier. But there’s also reason for caution. Incidents in which algorithms picked up or amplified societal biases around race or gender show that an AI-enhanced future won’t automatically be a better one.
The Beginnings of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence as we know it began as a vacation project. Dartmouth professor John McCarthy coined the term in the summer of 1956, when he invited a small group to spend a few weeks musing on how to make machines do things like use language.
He had high hopes of a breakthrough in the drive toward human-level machines. “We think that a significant advance can be made,” he wrote with his co-organizers, “if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”
Those hopes were not met, and McCarthy later conceded that he had been overly optimistic. But the workshop helped researchers dreaming of intelligent machines coalesce into a recognized academic field.
Early work often focused on solving fairly abstract problems in math and logic. But it wasn’t long before AI started to show promising results on more human tasks. In the late 1950s, Arthur Samuel created programs that learned to play checkers. In 1962, one scored a win over a master at the game. In 1967, a program called Dendral showed it could replicate the way chemists interpreted mass-spectrometry data on the makeup of chemical samples.
As the field of AI developed, so did different strategies for making smarter machines. Some researchers tried to distill human knowledge into code or come up with rules for specific tasks, like understanding language. Others were inspired by the importance of learning to understand human and animal intelligence. They built systems that could get better at a task over time, perhaps by simulating evolution or by learning from example data. The field hit milestone after milestone as computers mastered tasks that could previously only be completed by people.
Deep learning, the rocket fuel of the current AI boom, is a revival of one of the oldest ideas in AI. The technique involves passing data through webs of math loosely inspired by the working of brain cells that are known as artificial neural networks. As a network processes training data, connections between the parts of the network adjust, building up an ability to interpret future data.
Artificial neural networks became an established idea in AI not long after the Dartmouth workshop. The room-filling Perceptron Mark 1 from 1958, for example, learned to distinguish different geometric shapes and got written up in The New York Times as the “Embryo of Computer Designed to Read and Grow Wiser.” But neural networks tumbled from favor after an influential 1969 book coauthored by MIT’s Marvin Minsky suggested they couldn’t be very powerful.
Not everyone was convinced by the skeptics, however, and some researchers kept the technique alive over the decades. They were vindicated in 2012, when a series of experiments showed that neural networks fueled with large piles of data could give machines new powers of perception. Churning through so much data was difficult using traditional computer chips, but a shift to graphics cards precipitated an explosion in processing power.
In one notable result, researchers at the University of Toronto trounced rivals in an annual competition where software is tasked with categorizing images. In another, researchers from IBM, Microsoft, and Google teamed up to publish results showing deep learning could also deliver a significant jump in the accuracy of speech recognition. Tech companies began frantically hiring all the deep-learning experts they could find. It's important to note however that the AI field has had several booms and busts (aka, “AI winters”) in the past, and a sea change remains a possibility again today.
The State of AI Today
Improvements to AI hardware, growth in training courses in machine learning, and open source machine-learning projects have accelerated the spread of AI to other industries, from national security to business support and medicine.
Alphabet-owned DeepMind has turned its AI loose on a variety of problems: the movement of soccer players, the restoration of ancient texts, and even ways to control nuclear fusion.

Google and Amazon, in particular, are betting that improvements in machine learning will make their virtual assistants and smart speakers more powerful. Amazon, for example, has devices with cameras to look at their owners and the world around them.

One deep-learning pioneer, Google’s Geoff Hinton, argues that making progress on that grand challenge will require rethinking some of the foundations of the field.
Generative AI and Its Controversies
There’s a particular type of AI making headlines—in some cases, actually writing them too. Generative AI is a catch-all term for AI that can cobble together bits and pieces from the digital world to make something new—well, new-ish—such as art, illustrations, images, complete and functional code, and tranches of text that pass not only the Turing test, but MBA exams.

 NATO’s Data and Artificial Intelligence Review Board (DARB) met on Tuesday (7 February 2023) to start the development of a user-friendly and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) certification standard to help industries and institutions across the Alliance make sure that new AI and data projects are in line with international law, as well as NATO’s norms and values. 






The standard, which also applies to data exploitation and will include quality controls, is due to be completed by the end of 2023. Its aim is to translate NATO’s Principles of Responsible Use, approved in October 2021 as part of NATO’s first ever AI strategy, into concrete checks and balances, notably in terms of governability, traceability and reliability. This will help to build trust among the innovation community, operational end users, and the general public.
The Board is composed of nominated representatives from Allied countries, invitees Finland and Sweden, as well as NATO experts. Representatives include lawyers, engineers, military personnel and experts in ethics. It will also serve as a unique platform to exchange best practices, guide innovators and operational end-users throughout the development phase. Its work will contribute positively to NATO’s digital transformation. At present, NATO is piloting AI in areas as diverse as cyber defence, climate change and imagery analysis.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health services and research has potential, but a new study finds significant shortcomings that may indicate overly accelerated promotion of new AI models that have yet to be evaluated as viable in the
        real world. How AI can support mental health services  In 2021, over 150 million people in the WHO European Region were living with a mental health condition. Over the last few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has made matters worse. People have been less able to access services, and increases in stress,
        adverse economic conditions, conflict and violence have shown how vulnerable mental health can be. In parallel, AI has been giving rise to a revolution in medicine and health care. AI is seen as a novel tool in the planning of mental health services, as well as in identifying and monitoring mental health problems in individuals and populations.
        AI-driven tools can use digitized health-care data – available in a range of formats including electronic health records, medical images and hand-written clinical notes – to automate tasks, support clinicians and deepen understanding

This article was not written by ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence–powered chatbot—which can generate essays and articles with a simple prompt, have natural-sounding conversations, debug computer code, write songs, and even draft Congressional floor speeches—has quickly become a phenomenon. Developed by the Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the computer program reportedly hit 100 million users in January alone and has been called an AI breakthrough. Its apparent prowess—in one study, it fooled respected scientists into believing its fake research paper abstracts—has left professional writers feeling nervous and spooked Google into urgently ramping up its own AI efforts.
But is all the hype overblown? Behavioral scientist Chiara Longoni, a Boston University Questrom School of Business assistant professor of marketing, says we may all be intrigued by ChatGPT—and AI in general—but we’re a long way from embracing it or trusting it over a human.
In recent studies, Longoni has looked at whether people believe AI-generated news stories or trust a computer program’s medical diagnoses. She’s found we’re mostly pretty skeptical of AI. A machine can write a fact-packed news article, but we’ll second-guess its veracity; a program can give a more accurate medical analysis than a human, but we’re still more likely to go with our doctor’s advice.

Longoni’s latest paper, published in the Journal of Marketing Research, examines trust in AI programs used by the government. With researchers from Babson College and the University of Virginia, she studied how consumers react when AI gets something wrong—in calculating benefits or tracking social security fraud, for example—versus what happens if a person messes up. When an AI program made a mistake, Longoni discovered, people distrusted all AI, something the researchers called “algorithmic transference.” But we’re less likely to mistrust all people when one person drops the ball—meaning, we cut people slack if they screw up, but don’t give AI the same leeway.
So, if we’re not ready to trust AI, what to make of the rapid growth of ChatGPT? Could it mark a turning point in our attitude toward algorithms? The Brink asked Longoni, a Dean’s Research Scholar, about the latest AI leap, our resistance to intelligent computer programs, and whether she’s worried about her students submitting an influx of ChatGPT-penned essays.
Q&Awith Chiara Longoni
The Brink: As a journalist, should I be worried ChatGPT is coming for my job—or are readers still more likely to trust my articles over those by a computer?
Longoni: We have a paper—one of the authors is my Questrom colleague Andrey Fradkin—on generative AI for text. We looked at how people respond when generative AI is applied to news production. We took real news headlines and manipulated whether these news stories were tagged as written by a human reporter or by an AI algorithm. We were interested in the extent to which people perceived this news as accurate or not. Because we used real stories, we knew whether the news was objectively fake or true. The finding was really interesting, especially now as I’m sensing people tend to perhaps be overly reliant on what ChatGPT actually writes, because we found that, irrespective of the actual veracity of the news, people discounted news that was tagged as written by AI—they were thinking that the news was less accurate. People tend to believe generative AI less compared to the same content written by a human reporter. It was an effect that was robust—it manifested no matter what the political affiliation of the person was, their background, income, socioeconomic status, age.I don’t have any research that has specifically looked at ChatGPT, but my sense is—and it’s completely my speculation—many areas of our society are fearing ChatGPT’s potential for algorithmic amplification of inaccurate or biased information. Excessive reliance on these generative AIs might propagate bias if people are not aware that it can have limitations.
The Brink: ChatGPT has reportedly outpaced TikTok’s initial growth. What’s made people so open to using it and do you think this might be a tipping point in our comfort with AI?
Longoni: The fact that people want to use it doesn’t mean that people trust it. It’s something that’s very cool; it’s a type of AI that is fairly revolutionary and accessible to people—they can just log in and see. There’s a lot of curiosity underlying that. Number two, I was talking to one of my students recently and they mentioned they tried to use it, and they got locked out. So, there’s that scarcity, which makes it even more sought after—the fact that you want to see how this thing works, and try it yourself, but you can’t access it. Scarcity is something that works really well in terms of driving and generating interest for technology.I don’t know if this is going to have implications in terms of baseline trust for these technologies at large. It’s going to be really interesting to see how this evolves, because it’s possible that the accessibility of this technology will create a spillover positive effect on trust of other technologies, which may be good and bad. Does it make people more vulnerable to misinformation or does it actually make people more familiar with the technology and with the limitations of that technology? In general, my view is that all of these technologies are tools, which means that the question should be how to use them optimally, being aware of their potential and their limitations and weaknesses. So, it’s possible that these would actually prompt people to learn how to leverage these technologies. When we were writing our paper, we thought at length about the repercussions for ethicists and policymakers. There are a lot of news outlets that have their own automated software for generating news, and typically these are not disclosed to people. There’re already people talking about how there need to be guidelines to show if an article has been generated with the assistive role of AI in any form.
The Brink: Your research seems to get at the psychology of when and why people trust AI—or don’t trust it.
Longoni: What is the reason for trust or distrust? In my work, I have looked at reasons for trust or distrust in more applied settings like in the context of AI for healthcare rather than text or image generation. In these cases, the focal task is a prediction—like the forecasting of a person having a heart attack, a recommendation for having coronary bypass surgery, or making a skin cancer risk assessment—that could be done by an algorithm or by a physician.
The Brink: So, you’re looking to see if we trust a diagnosis made by a computer?
Longoni: Yes, exactly. We tested across a number of decisions, spanning preventive services, treatment recommendations, and systematically varied who—or what—was going to make that decision, whether it was an algorithm or physician. The general finding was that people are resistant to medical AI. They are more reluctant to pursue healthcare if it’s provided by AI compared to the same healthcare provided by a human. This, too, is an effect that was robust—it carried over, no matter the age of the person or the type of medical decision.
The Brink: Where does this resistance to AI come from?
Longoni: There are two reasons that we investigated. One is what we call uniqueness neglect. It essentially captures the fact that people believe that their health, status, and health condition is unique to them, and people also believe that AI treats everybody in the same way—you become a number, a statistic to AI. The fear of having our own unique circumstances neglected, or not accounted for properly, is what explains why people want to have a doctor—a doctor is going to get me because they’re a human being.Another reason we identified is both an illusion and a reality. These algorithms are often black boxes. In fact, the more sophisticated the neural network that’s used, the harder it is to make that algorithm transparent and to open the black box and make it explainable. It’s the reason ethicists and policymakers want to talk about the importance of explaining algorithms. But we also have this illusory understanding of the way humans make decisions. We think that we can look at the human machinery in the way in which a physician makes a medical decision, and that’s transparent to us as fellow human beings. That is an illusion. Just like we don’t know how an algorithm makes a medical diagnosis, we truly don’t know how a doctor makes a medical diagnosis. Because we have this illusory understanding of how transparent human decision-making is, we kind of punish algorithms for their black box-ness.
The Brink: Is that AI skepticism a common finding across your studies, whether in news, medicine, or elsewhere? Are there places where we’re ready to accept AI?
Longoni: There is a general distrust for AI, no matter what the application, more often than there is a tendency to embrace AI. That said, there are circumstances where people do embrace the help of AI. One condition that we specifically saw where people actually prefer the AI recommendation over a person is when they want to optimize the practicalities, the utilitarian value of the recommendation, such as a recommendation for a practical apartment or a recipe high in micronutrients. Another circumstance is when the task is presented to people as heavily quantitative and objective, like estimating the weight of a person or forecasting the weather. It makes sense that a recommendation by a person is assumed to be more subjective and qualitative, and maybe based on their own personal opinion rather than based on objective criteria. So, when quantitative and objective parameters are more salient, people tend to prefer the recommendation of AI.Another type of circumstance where people are not necessarily more favorable to AI, but rather indifferent to AI—equally likely to choose AI or stick with a person—is when AI serves in an assistant role to a person who retains the veto or remains the ultimate decision-maker. So, people are fine with AI doing some things as long as the final call is made by a person.
The Brink: Do you feel like the conversation around AI is stuck between extremes—AI is wonderful, AI is terrible—and actually the truth is somewhere in the middle?
Longoni: There tends to be a view of AI as the ultimate utopia or dystopia. My personal opinion: I’m an AI optimist overall, without necessarily believing that AI is a cure-all. It’s a tool, a technology. There certainly needs to be oversight and regulation, but I think there’s a lot of potential to do a lot of good. And also, it’s inevitable, I don’t think it can be stopped.For instance, and this speaks to the main body of my work, which is on medical AI, AI can democratize healthcare. It can really do a lot of good things—like the use of an app for a skin cancer risk assessment. People that can’t afford to go to a dermatologist or people that could simply not have access to that type of care, now can be alerted to that primary red flag—go check this mole. So, AI can have the potential to make prescriptively good outcomes available to people that otherwise could not have access to it. And so the question that I’m interested in is, if AI is a good thing, how can we understand how people view it and how can we foster uptake?
The Brink: On a different note, as an educator, how concerned are you about ChatGPT and the prospect of students submitting AI-generated essays?
Longoni: When I first read about it, I was like, okay, do I allow it in my class or not? I think it varies by class and learning goals. There are some classes in which I think AI could be allowed—I’m seeing some colleagues who teach programming or technical classes allow it—and some classes in which it could be banned or perhaps regulated, such as a creative writing class. Eventually, this help from technology will become more and more normal in our classes and education. I feel like there are maybe some cases in which it could be an equalizer, too, on condition of being disclosed. I’m thinking about services that maybe are really expensive, like copy editing services. I’ve heard from students that they’ve used it to generate an outline they would then edit. Maybe one day it will become a source, and be cited like other sources.I think what’s really important is to teach ourselves and teach the potential users what the tools can and cannot do, how to correctly scrutinize the output, and how to write the prompts.

McKernan makes paintings that often feature nymphlike female figures in an acid-colored style that blends Art Nouveau and science fiction. A list published in August, by a Web site called Metaverse Post, suggested “Kelly McKernan” as a term to feed an A.I. generator in order to create “Lord of the Rings”-style art. Hundreds of other artists were similarly listed according to what their works evoked: anime, modernism, “Star Wars.” On the Discord chat that runs an A.I. generator called Midjourney, McKernan discovered that users had included their name more than twelve thousand times in public prompts. The resulting images—of owls, cyborgs, gothic funeral scenes, and alien motorcycles—were distinctly reminiscent of McKernan’s works. “It just got weird at that point. It was starting to look pretty accurate, a little infringe-y,” they told me. “I can see my hand in this stuff, see how my work was analyzed and mixed up with some others’ to produce these images.”Last month, McKernan joined a class-action lawsuit with two other artists, Sarah Andersen and Karla Ortiz, filed by the attorneys Matthew Butterick and Joseph Saveri, against Midjourney and two other A.I. imagery generators, Stable Diffusion and DreamUp. (Other tools, such as DALL-E, run on the same principles.) All three models make use of LAION-5B, a nonprofit, publicly available database that indexes more than five billion images from across the Internet, including the work of many artists. The alleged wrongdoing comes down to what Butterick summarized to me as “the three ‘C’s”: The artists had not consented to have their copyrighted artwork included in the LAION database; they were not compensated for their involvement, even as companies including Midjourney charged for the use of their tools; and their influence was not credited when A.I. images were produced using their work. When producing an image, these generators “present something to you as if it’s copyright free,” Butterick told me, adding that every image a generative tool produces “is an infringing, derivative work.”AdChoicesCopyright claims based on questions of style are often tricky. In visual art, courts have sometimes ruled in favor of the copier rather than the copied. When the artist Richard Prince incorporated photographs by Patrick Cariou into his work, for instance, a 2013 court case found that some of the borrowing was legal under transformative use—Prince had changed the source material enough to escape any claim of infringement. In music, recent judgments tend to be more conservative. Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams lost a 2013 case against the Marvin Gaye estate, which alleged that their song “Blurred Lines” was too close to Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up.” The intellectual-property lawyer Kate Downing wrote, in a recent essay on Butterick and Saveri’s suit published on her personal Web site, that the A.I. image generators might be closer to the former than the latter: ​​“It may well be argued that the ‘use’ of any one image from the training data is . . . not substantial enough to call the output a derivative work of any one image.” “Mathematically speaking, the work comes from everything,” Downing told me.But Butterick and Saveri allege that what A.I. generators do falls short of transformative use. There is no transcending of the source material, just a mechanized “blending together,” Butterick said. “We’re not litigating image by image, we’re litigating the whole technique behind the system.” The litigators are not alone. Last week, Getty Images filed a lawsuit against Stable Diffusion alleging that the generator’s use of Getty stock photography amounts to “brazen infringement . . . on a staggering scale.” Whatever their legal strengths, such claims possess a certain moral weight. A.I. generators could not operate without the labor of humans like McKernan who unwittingly provide source material. As the technology critic and philosopher Jaron Lanier wrote in his 2013 book “Who Owns the Future?,” “Digital information is really just people in disguise.” (A spokesperson from Stability AI, the studio that developed Stable Diffusion, said in a statement that “the allegations in this suit represent a misunderstanding of how generative A.I. technology works and the law surrounding copyright,” but provided no further detail. Neither DeviantArt, which owns DreamUp, nor Midjourney responded to requests for comment.)Visual artists began reaching out to Butterick after he and Saveri filed a lawsuit, last November, in the related but distinct realm of software copyrights. The target of the earlier suit was Copilot, an A.I.-driven coding assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI. Copilot is trained on code that is publicly available online. Coders who post their projects on open-source platforms retain the copyright to their work—under certain licenses, anyone who uses the code must credit its creator. Copilot did not. Like the artists whose work feeds Midjourney, human coders suddenly found their specialized labor reproduced infinitely, quickly, and cheaply without attribution. Butterick and Saveri’s legal complaint (against OpenAI, GitHub, and Microsoft, which acquired GitHub in 2018) argued that Copilot’s actions amount to “software piracy on an unprecedented scale.” In January, the defendants filed to have the case dismissed. “We will file oppositions to these motions,” Butterick said.Butterick told me that, given the proliferation of A.I., “everybody who creates for a living should be in code red.” Writers had their turn to be spooked in January, when BuzzFeed announced that it would use OpenAI’s new large language model, ChatGPT, to augment its creation of quizzes. McKernan, who draws income from print sales as well as commissioned illustrations, told me they suspect that the amount of work available in their field is already declining as A.I. tools become more accessible online. “There are publishers that are using A.I. instead of hiring cover artists,” McKernan told me. “I can pay my rent with just one cover, and we’re seeing that already disappearing.” They added, “We’re just the canaries in the coal mine.”In some sense, you could say that artists are losing their monopoly on being artists. With generative A.I., any user can become an author of sorts. In late January, Mayk.it, a Los Angeles-based music-making app, released Drayk.it, a Web site that allowed users to create A.I.-generated Drake songs based on a given prompt. The results could not be mistaken for actual Drake tracks; they tend toward the lo-fi and the absurd. But they possess a certain fundamental Drakeness: lounge beats, depressive lyrics, monotone delivery. The company’s head of product, Neer Sharma, told me that users had created hundreds of thousands of A.I. Drake songs, a new track every three seconds. The site drew upon software resources such as Tacotron and Uberduck, which generate voices and offer specific voice models, including one trained on the œuvre of Drake. The Web site includes a disclaimer that the songs it generates are parodies, which are protected under fair use, and Sharma told me that the company didn’t receive any complaints from Drake’s camp. But the site has already shut down. The project was designed “just to test out the tech,” Sharma said. “We didn’t expect it to get this big.” The team is now preparing more “A.I. music drops.”Video From The New YorkerSurfing on Kelly Slater’s Machine-Made WaveAs Sharma sees it, the increasing accessibility of A.I. means that “everything just becomes remixable.” The artists who might thrive in this scenario are those who have the most replicable or exportable “vibe and aesthetic,” he said, among them Drake, the rare pop star who has embraced his status as an open-ended meme. Fans could already dress like Drake or act like him; now they can make his music, too, and the line between fan and creator will blur further as the generative technology improves. Sharma said that the company has heard from executives at music labels who are interested in exploring the creation of A.I. voice models for their artists. He predicted that musicians who resist being “democratized”—giving creative agency to their fans—will be left behind. “The people who could win before just by being there will not necessarily win tomorrow,” Sharma said.A startup called Authentic Artists is seeking to bypass human artists altogether by creating musician characters based on A.I.-generated styles of music. Its label, WarpSound, features “virtual artists” like GLiTCH, a computer-rendered figure derived from a Bored Ape Yacht Club N.F.T., who plays genres such as “chillwave” and “glitch hop” in endlessly streaming feeds of auto-generated music. Authentic Artists’ founder Chris McGarry told me that the character is meant to give a face to the A.I. machine. “We wanted to answer the question, what is the source of the music? A semiconductor or cloud-based server or ones and zeros didn’t seem to be a terribly interesting answer to that question,” he said.Listening to Authentic Artists’ music, however, is a bit like trying to enjoy the wavering buzz of highway traffic. If you’re not paying attention, it can serve as a passable background soundtrack, but the moment you tune in closely any sense of coherent sound gives way to an uncanny randomness. It called to my mind a much-memed comment that the Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki made after being shown a particularly grotesque A.I.-generated animation in 2016: “I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.” I wouldn’t go quite so far, but Authentic Artists’ project does strike me as an insult to human-made music. They can manufacture sound, but they can’t manufacture the feeling or creative intention that even the most amateur musicians put into a recording.Kelly McKernan sometimes snoops on conversations about generative A.I. on Reddit or Discord chats, in part to see how users perceive the role of original artists in the A.I. image-making process. McKernan said that they often see people criticizing artists who are against A.I.: “They have this belief that career artists, people who have dedicated their whole lives to their work, are gatekeeping, keeping them from making the art they want to make. They think we’re élitist and keeping our secrets.” Defenders of A.I. art-making could point out that artists have always taken from and riffed on each other’s work, from the ancient Romans making copies of even older Greek sculptures to Roy Lichtenstein reproducing comic-book frames as highbrow Pop art. Maybe A.I. imagery is just a new wave of appropriation art? (It lacks any conceptual intention, however.) Downing, the intellectual-property lawyer, argued in her piece that the prompts that users input into A.I. generators may amount to independent acts of invention. “There is no Stable Diffusion without users pouring their own creative energy into its prompts,” she wrote.McKernan told me about Beep Boop Art, a Facebook group with forty-seven thousand followers that posts A.I.-generated art and runs an online storefront selling prints and merchandise. The images tend toward the fantastical: a wizard hat or a lunar landscape in a Lisa Frank-ish style, or a tree house growing above the ocean. It may not be a direct riff on McKernan’s work, but it does reflect a banal over-all sameness across generated art. McKernan described typical A.I. style as having “this general sugary, candy look,” adding, “It looks pretty, but it tastes terrible. It has no depth, but it serves the purpose that they want.” The new generation of tools offers the instant gratification of a single image, shorn of the messy association with a single, living artist. One question is who gets to profit from such works. Another is more existential. “It kind of boils down to: what is art?” McKernan said. “Is art the process, is art the human component, is art the conversation? All of that is out of the picture once you’re just generating it.” ♦",,"Last month, McKernan joined a class-action lawsuit with two other artists, Sarah Andersen and Karla Ortiz, filed by the attorneys Matthew Butterick and Joseph Saveri, against Midjourney and two other A.I. imagery generators, Stable Diffusion and DreamUp.

Senior Researcher Chris Dede isn't overly worried about growing concerns over generative artificial intelligence, like ChatGPT, in education. As a longtime researcher on emerging technologies, he's seen many decades where new technologies promised to upend the field. Instead, Dede says artificial intelligence requires educators to get smarter about how they teach in order to truly take advantage of what AI has to offer.“The trick about AI is that to get it, we need to change what we're educating people for because if you educate people for what AI does well, you're just preparing them to lose to AI. But if you educate them for what AI can't do, then you've got IA [Intelligence Augmentation],” he says. Dede, the associate director of research for the National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education, says AI raises the bar and it has the power to significantly impact learning in powerful ways.In this episode of the Harvard EdCast, Dede talks about how the field of education needs to evolve and get smarter, in order to work with — not against — artificial intelligence. ADDITIONAL RESOURCESDede's keynote on Intelligence Augmentation, delivered at an AI and Education conferenceBrief on Intelligence Augmentation, co-authored by Dede for HGSE’s Next Level Lab TRANSCRIPTJill Anderson: I'm Jill Anderson. This is the Harvard EdCast. Chris Dede thinks we need to get smarter about using artificial intelligence and education. He has spent decades exploring emerging learning technologies as a Harvard researcher. The recent explosion of generative AI, like ChatGPT, has been met with mixed reactions in education. Some public school districts have banned it. Some colleges and universities have tweaked their teaching and learning already. Generative AI raises que






Chris Dede: I've actually been working with AI for more than half a century. Way back when when I was a graduate student, I read the first article on AI in education, which was published in 1970. And the author confidently predicted that we wouldn't need teachers within five or six years because AI was going to do everything. And of course, we still see predictions like that today. But having lived through nine hype cycles for AI, I'm both impressed by how much it's advanced, but I'm also wary about elaborate claims for it. And there is a lot of excitement now about generative AI is the term that people are using, which includes programs like ChatGPT. It includes things like Dolly that are capable of creating images. It includes really AI on its own doing performances that we previously would have thought were something that people would have to do. But it's interesting to compare ChatGPT to a search engine. And people don't remember this, but there was a time when-- before search engines when people really struggled to find resources, and there was enormous excitement when search engines came out. And search engines are, in fact, AI. They are based on AI at the back end, coming up with lists of things that hopefully match what you typed in. In fact, the problem with the search engine becomes not trying to find anything, but trying to filter everything to decide what's really useful. So you can think of ChatGPT as the next step beyond a search engine where instead of getting a list of things and then you decide which might be useful and you examine them, you get an answer that says, this is what I think you want. And that is really more the AI taking charge than it is the AI saying, I can help you. Here's some things that you might look at and decide about. That makes me wary because AI is not at a stage where it really understands what it's saying. And so it will make up things when it doesn't know them, kind of a not very good student seeing if they can fake out the teacher. And it will provide answers that are not customized to somebody's culture or to somebody's reading level or to somebody's other characteristics. So it's really quite limited. I know that Harvard has sent some wording out that I've now put into my syllabi about students being welcome to use whatever tools they want. But when they present something as their work, it has to be something that they wrote themselves. It can't be something that somebody else wrote, which is classic plagiarism. It can't be something that Chat AI wrote that they're presenting as their work and so on. I think that what Chat AI does is it raises the bar for human performance. I know a lot about what people are going through now in terms of job interviews because my older daughter is an HR manager, and my younger daughter just graduated. And she's having a lot of job interviews. And in contrast to earlier times, now, job interviews typically involve a performance. If you're going to be hired for a marketing position, they'll say bring in a marketing plan when we do our face-to-face interview on this, and we'll evaluate it. Or in her case, in mechanical engineering, they say when you come in, there's this system that you're going to have a chance to debug, and we'll see how well you do it. Those employers are going to type the same thing into Chat AI. And if someone comes in with something that isn't any better than Chat AI, they're not going to get hired because why hire somebody that can't outcompete a free resource? Jill Anderson: Oh interesting. Chris Dede: So it raises the bar for human performance in an interesting way. Jill Anderson: Your research looks at something called intelligence augmentation. I want to know what that means and how that's different from artificial intelligence. Chris Dede: Intelligence augmentation is really about the opposite of this sort of negative example I was describing where now you've got to outthink Chat AI if you want to get a job. It says, when is the whole more than the sum of the parts? When do a person and AI working together do things that neither one could do as well on their own? And often, people think, well, yeah, I can see a computer programmer, there might be intelligence augmentation because I know that machines can start to do programming. What they don't realize is that it applies to a wide range of jobs, including mine, as a college professor. So I am the associate director for research in a national AI institute funded by the National Science Foundation on adult learning and online education. And one of the things the Institute is building is AI assistants for college faculty. So there's question answering assistants to help with student questions, and there's tutoring assistants and library assistants and laboratory assistants. There's even a social assistant that can help students in a large class meet other students who might be good learning partners. So now, as a professor, I'm potentially surrounded by all these assistants who are doing parts of my job, and I can be deskilled by that, which is a bad future. You sort of end up working for the assistant where they say, well, here's a question I can't answer. So you have to do it. Or you can upskill because the assistant is taking over routine parts of the job. And in turn, you can focus much more deeply on personalization to individual students, on bringing in cultural dimensions and equity dimensions that AI does not understand and cannot possibly help with. The trick about AI is that to get it, we need to change what we're educating people for because if you educate people for what AI does well, you're just preparing them to lose to AI. But if you educate them for what AI can't do, then you've got IA. Jill Anderson: So that's the goal here. We have to change the way that we're educating young people, even older people at this point. I mean, everybody needs to change the way that they're learning about these things and interacting with them. Chris Dede: They do. And we're hampered by our system of assessment because the assessments that we use, including Harvard with the GRE and the SAT and so on, those are what AI does well. AI can score really well on psychometric tests. So we're using the wrong measure, if you will. We need to use performance assessments to measure what people can do to get into places like Harvard or higher education in general because that's emphasizing the skills that are going to be really useful for them. Jill Anderson: You mentioned at the start artificial intelligence isn't really something brand new. This has been around for decades, but we're so slow to adapt and prepare and alter the way that we do things that once it reaches kind of the masses, we're already behind. Chris Dede: Well, we are. And the other part of it is that we keep putting old wine in new bottles. I mean, this is — if I had to write a headline for the entire history of educational technology, it would be old wine in new bottles. But we don't understand what the new bottle really means. So let me give you an example of something that I think generative AI could make a big difference, be very powerful, but I'm not seeing it discussed in all the hype about generative AI. And that is evidence-based modeling for local decisions. So let's take climate change. One of the problems with climate change is that let's say that you're in Des Moines, Iowa, and you read about all this flooding in California. And you say to yourself, well, I'm not next to an ocean. I don't live in California. And I don't see why I should be that worried about this stuff. Now, no one has done a study, I assume, of flooding in Des Moines, Iowa, in 2050 based on mid-level projections about climate change. But with generative AI, we can estimate that now. Generative AI can reach out across topographic databases, meteorological databases, and other related databases to come up with here's the parts of Des Moines that are going to go underwater in 2050 and here's how often this is going to happen if these models are correct. That really changes the dialogue about climate change because now you're talking about wait a minute. You mean that park I take my kids to is going to have a foot of water in it? So I think that kind of evidence-based modeling is not something that people are doing with generative AI right now, but it's perfectly feasible. And that's the new wine that we can put in the new bottle. Jill Anderson: That's really a great way to use that. I mean, and you could even use that in your classroom. Something that you said a long, long time ago was that — and this is paraphrasing — the idea that we often implement new technology, and we make this mistake of focusing on students first rather than teachers. Chris Dede: In December, I gave a keynote at a conference called Empowering Learners for the Age of AU that has been held the last few years. And one of the things I talked about was the shift from teaching to learning. Both are important, but teaching is ultimately sort of pouring knowledge into the minds of learners. And learning is much more open ended, and it's essential for the future because every time you need to learn something new, you can't afford to go back and have another master's degree. You need to be able to do self-directed learning. And where AI can be helpful with this is that AI can be like an intellectual partner, even when you don't have a teacher that can help you learn in different ways. One of the things that I've been working on with a professor at the Harvard Business School is AI systems that can help you learn negotiation. Now, the AI can't be the person you're negotiating with. AI is not good at playing human beings — not yet and not for quite a long time, I think. But what AI can do is to create a situation where a human being can play three people at once. So here you are. You're learning how to negotiate a raise. You go into a virtual conference room. There's three virtual people who are three bosses. There's one simulation specialist behind all three, and you negotiate with them. And then at the end, the system gives you some advice on what you did well and not so well. And if you have a human mentor, that person gives you advice as well. Ronda Bandy, who was a professor in HGSE until she moved to Hunter College, she and I have published five articles on the work we did for the HGSE's Reach Every Reader Project on using this kind of digital puppeteering to help teachers practice equitable discussion leading. So again, here's something that people aren't talking about where AI on the front end can create rich evocative situations, and AI and machine learning on the back end can find really interesting patterns for improvement. Jill Anderson: You know, Chris, how hard is it to get there for educators? Chris Dede: I think, in part, that's what these national AI institutes are about. Our institute, which is really adult learning with a workplace focus, is looking at that part of the spectrum. There's another institute whose focus is middle school and high school and developing AI partners for students where the student and the partner are learning together in a different kind of IA. There's a third Institute that's looking at narrative and storytelling as a powerful form of education and how can AI help with narrative and storytelling. You can imagine sitting down. Mom and dad aren't around. You've got a storybook like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and you've got something like Alexa that can listen to what you're reading and respond. And so you begin, and you say, Goldilocks went out of her house one day and went into the woods and got lost. And Alexa says, why do you think Goldilocks went into the woods? Was she a naughty girl? No. Or was she an adventurous girl, or was she deeply concerned about climate change and wanting to study ecosystems? I mean, I'm being playful about this, but I think the point is that AI doesn't understand any of the questions that it's asking but it can ask the questions, and then the child can start to think deeper than just regurgitating the story. So there's all sorts of possibilities here that we just have to think of as new wine instead of asking how can AI automate our order thinking about teaching and learning. Jill Anderson: I've been hearing a lot of concern about writing in particular-- writing papers where young people are actually expressing their own ideas, concerns about plagiarism and cheating, which I would say the latter have long existed as challenges in education, aren't really a new one. Does AI really change this? And how might a higher ed or any educator really look at this differently? Chris Dede: So I think where AI changes this is it helps us understand the kind of writing that we should be teaching versus the kind of writing that we are teaching. So I remember preparing my children for the SAT, and it used to have something called the essay section. And you had to write this very formal essay that was a certain number of paragraphs, and the topic sentences each had to do this and so on. Nobody in the world writes those kinds of essays in the real world. They're just like an academic exercise. And of course, AI now can do that beautifully. But any reporter will tell you that they could never use Chat AI to write their stories because stories is what they write. They write narratives. If you just put in a description, you'll be fired from your reportorial job because no one is interested in descriptions. They want a story. So giving students a description and teaching them to turn it into a story or teaching them to turn it into something else that has a human and creative dimension for it, how would you write this for a seventh-grader that doesn't have much experience with the world? How would you write this for somebody in Russia building on the foundation of what AI gives you and taking it in ways that only people can? That's where writing should be going. And of course, good writing teachers will tell you, well, that's nothing new. I've been teaching my students how to write descriptive essays. The people who are most qualified to talk about the limits of AI are the ones who teach what the AI is supposedly doing. Jill Anderson: So do you have any helpful tips for educators regardless of what level they're working at on where to kind of begin embracing this technology? Chris Dede: What AI can do well is what's called reckoning, which is calculative prediction. And I've given some examples of that with flooding in Des Moines and other kinds of things. And what people do is practical wisdom, if you will, and it involves culture and ethics and what it's like to be embodied and to have the biological things that are part of human nature and so on. So when I look at what I'm teaching, I have to ask myself, how much of what I'm teaching is reckoning? So I'm preparing people to lose to AI. And how much of what I'm teaching is practical wisdom? So for example, we spend a lot of time in vocational technical education and standard academic education teaching people to factor. How do you factor these complex polynomials? There is no workplace anywhere in the world, even in the most primitive possible conditions, where anybody makes a living by factoring. It's an app. It's an app on a phone. Should you know a little bit about factoring so it's not magic? Sure. Should you become fluent in factoring? Absolutely not. It's on the wrong side of the equation. So I think just teachers and curriculum developers and assessors and stakeholders in the outcomes of education need to ask themselves, what is being taught now, and which parts of it are shifting over? And how do we include enough about those parts that AI isn't magic? But how do we change the balance of our focus to be more on the practical wisdom side? Jill Anderson: So final thoughts here — don't be scared but figure out how to use this to your advantage? Chris Dede: Yeah, don't be scared. AI is not smart. It really isn't. People would be appalled if they knew how little AI understands what it's telling you, especially given how much people seem to be relying on it. But it is capable of taking over parts of what you do that are routine and predictable and, in turn, freeing up the creative and the innovative and the human parts that are really the rewarding part of both work the life. EdCast: Chris Dede is a senior research fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Can AI de-bias the workplace?getty

After decades of research and progress in the area of artificial intelligence (AI), we appeared to have reached a point in which AI is no longer confined to utopian or dystopian conversations about the future, but a present reality, impacting all industries, businesses, and aspects of life. Just like any past technological innovations, the widespread impact of AI has elicited much concern, resistance, and backlash, including alarmist accusations of algorithms as vessels for “coded bias”, “weapons of math destruction”, and “sexist and racist robots”.

But, could AI be an improbable weapon for improving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) initiatives? It is a question that matters more than HR practitioners tend to think, not least in light of the lackluster impact of typical DEIB interventions. Alas, HR seems far more fearful of AI than aware of its utility; DEIB is no exception.

PROMOTED
As I illustrate in my latest book, I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes us Unique, there's no question that AI will add value in two specific areas of DEIB. The first is to diagnose things better, telling us what truly goes on in a culture, revealing some of the hidden dynamics underlying many of the critical interactions between people at work, including the silent forces that determine why some people are more likely to get promoted than others, particularly when their performance isn’t the answer. For example, research shows that even in the absence of gender differences in everyday, granular work behaviors, men are significantly more likely to get promoted into management and leadership roles. If this cannot be attributed to more effective work behaviors or real performance differences, then the answer is bias.

The second is being able to actually measure inclusion, in particular whether someone’s demographic status or identity can predict their actual status at work. Diversity is easy to quantify, at least once organizations pick their target categories and goals (e.g., get more women, minorities, older workers, neurodiverse individuals, etc). But inclusion, which is about how people are really treated, is much harder to assess, let alone track.

Think of AI as a data mining tool that is the equivalent of an X ray for human interactions, and can tell us what goes on when people interact with each other, and how people are treated when they are part of vulnerable or underrepresented groups, especially compared to those who benefit from privilege. This is important because it allows us to go beyond perceptions and decode whether there are biases in behavior, which is really what we should be tackling.

Despite the popular appeal of “unconscious bias” interventions, it is time to accept that there is very little scientific support for the idea that toxic behavior and discrimination are the produced of unconscious or implicit attitudes, or that making people aware of their biases is a valid approach for creating fair or equitable work environments. In fact, it is not people’s thoughts we ought to monitor, for humans are biased by design, by their actions. For thousands of years we have been able to adhere to polite etiquette and act kindly towards our colleagues and neighbors, while we complain or bitch about them in private. This is not a bad measure of civilization: since we are not prewired to embrace or celebrate those who think or look differently from us, let us at least learn to work and live with them in harmony, which will require tolerance and rational compassion, especially when we are unable to naturally empathize with people (precisely because they appear too different from us).

Importantly, it is perfectly feasible to think of a world in which human biases and meritocracy may co-exist, and this scenario would represent substantial progress. In fact, since human biases are a given (unless we eliminate humans), the goal should be to leverage data and evidence to promote fairer evidence-based practices. Simply put, if you want to increase meritocracy you need to align people's career success with their actual performance, defined as the value they add to a team or organization. Although the past 200-years have seen an unprecedented transition from more nepotistic to more meritocratic hiring, as embodied by the present intellectual capital age, there is still much room for improvement. Indeed, if you walk into any business and ask a random group of employees whether in their company those who are most successful (senior, better paid, etc) truly contribute the biggest value, they will probably laugh at you.
Politics and nepotism are still alive and kicking, and dramatically corrode efforts to create fair and effective organizations, which is why there is far less progress on DEIB than there should be. Here's where AI will help: revealing (as well as exposing) the actual contribution people make to their teams and organizations, beyond perceptions and popular opinion, purifying our measurement of performance, and managing people based on their true output, which, incidentally, would put to the bed the tedious discussion about hybrid work and working from anywhere.
Consider how Uber uses AI to manage its army of drivers (around 3.5 million). Uber does not rely on human managers to decide whether a driver is better than others, which would surely unleash that manager's preferences, biases, and subjective views, which are unreliable indicators of employees’ performance. Instead, its algorithms measure the driver's number of trips, revenues, profits, accident claims, and passenger ratings. Granted, some drivers may be rated unfairly (too high or too low) because of factors unrelated to their actual performance, such as their gender, race, or social class, but in the grand scheme of things, the level of noise and bias will be marginal compared to the typical performance rating given to an employee by their boss.
To be sure, it is unlikely that AI (or any other invention) will ever fully eliminating bias, because humans are biased by design. In fact, we would probably not want to fully eradicate bias completely even if we could, because it would make us very boring, homogeneous, and robot like. For instance, much of the positive influence people have on each other when they work together is based on subjective or biased attitudes: ""I work well with X because we have so much in common"", or ""hiring leader X will energize people because she stands for their values and beliefs"".
However, if we are genuinely interested in creating more open and diverse societies, it is clearly useful to keep our biases in check. This starts by accepting that when we are free to follow our instincts or intuition, we are rarely as open minded as we like to think. Left to their own devices, managers would mostly hire people like them and promote them based on how similar their opinions are, which is the right recipe for creating a cult rather than a healthy culture. Likewise, without the tools and data to reveal how different people are treated at work, particularly when they are different, leaders will continue to perpetuate their self-serving delusion of having created an inclusive culture, an experienced shared only by those who continue to enjoy the nepotistic privileges of belonging to the in-group.

SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SoundHound AI, Inc. (Nasdaq: SOUN) (“SoundHound”), a global leader in voice artificial intelligence, today unveiled Dynamic Interaction™ With Generative AI, further extending the capabilities of the company’s groundbreaking real-time, multimodal interface by granting users hands-free access to a vast wealth of ideas, information, and sophisticated search functionality.

“Dynamic Interaction is capable of creating incredible user experiences, and allowing consumers to interact with computers in the most natural, intuitive way”Post this

Launched in November 2022, SoundHound Dynamic Interaction raises the bar for human-computer interaction by offering a full-duplex consumer interface which provides real-time, continuous audiovisual feedback in response to both verbal and touch commands – with no wake words, awkward pauses, or turn-taking. Engineered for a seamless exchange, the system ignores off-topic speech, makes proactive suggestions to the user, and intelligently decides when to use audio or visual output.

Now SoundHound Dynamic Interaction will also offer effortless, voice-enabled access to Generative AI, meaning users can unlock relevant information and ideas – just by speaking naturally. Generative AI, a technique popularized by recent advancements such as Dall-E 2 and ChatGPT, has marked a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

SoundHound Dynamic Interaction with Generative AI can be adapted for a variety of products and services, with the company’s newly released demo showcasing how it would work in-vehicle for the automotive industry. SoundHound has publicly announced wins with 17 automotive brands since launching its conversational AI platform in 2016.

In the example, a driver uses the interface to source ideas and arrange plans in the local area, making an ordinary journey productive, educational, and inspirational.

Driver: “Can you help me plan a fun day of hiking in San Francisco for tomorrow?”
Dynamic Interaction with Generative AI: “Start at Lands End trailhead. This trail offers amazing views of the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge. Then go to the Sutro Baths ruins, an old public bathhouse which has been converted to a park with trails and scenic views. Then finish your hike at the famous Seal Rocks, where you can enjoy the beautiful sunset over the ocean.”

While Generative AI can answer questions about static content and provide creative answers such as writing a poem, most AI assistants also need to be able to retrieve real-time information and generate customized actions and responses designed by business owners, as opposed to relying entirely on third party models with unpredictable results. SoundHound is addressing these requirements using its Collective AI architecture of hundreds of domains and its Deep Meaning Understanding technology.

“Dynamic Interaction is capable of creating incredible user experiences, and allowing consumers to interact with computers in the most natural, intuitive way,” says Keyvan Mohajer, CEO and Co-Founder of SoundHound. “By introducing Generative AI, we’re providing a gateway to a new world of ideas, information, and capabilities – from anywhere, completely hands-free.”

The demo video shows a range of features, including:


Dynamic Interaction: removes turn taking, adding multimodal aspects, and avoids breaking the conversation when out of context words are spoken.


Deep Meaning Understanding: allows the user to ask complex questions and be more precise about what they want versus keyword-based queries.


Collective AI: an architecture of interconnected domains that is bigger than the sum of its parts and always learning to do more things.


Personalization: users don’t need to start every interaction from scratch, and the interface can make useful, proactive suggestions.


Generative AI: an integration that opens a voice-enabled portal to boundless information.


In November, SoundHound introduced Dynamic Interaction for food ordering – ushering in a new chapter for drive-thru, kiosk, and tablet-based voice AI automation. With hundreds of thousands of views, the demo video has reinforced the role of voice AI innovation for customer service.

YOGYAKARTA  Artificial intelligence or artificial intelligence may be the most complex and astonishing creation of man. Although the technology is still under development, the potential for the future is inconceivable.ADVERTISEMENTSeveral types of artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to be integrated into the workplace. Its implementation has assisted the HR department in automating operations and increasing efficiency.VOI this time will discuss the types of artificial intelligence that have been created, so that you have an idea of existing AI capabilities.ADVERTISEMENTArtificial Intelligence is a system or machine that mimics human intelligence and can analyze various data.AI has transformed into the most advanced technology in the world today, and every industry adopts it. Every AI app we see today is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of AI.ADVERTISEMENTQuoted from Forbes, Friday, February 10, 2023, AI classification is based on its ability to facilitate human work. In this case, artificial intelligence is divided into five types, including:Reactive Machine is the oldest AI technology with very limited capabilities. This artificial intelligence will identify and respond automatically to various situations.A popular example of a reactive AI engine is IBM's Deep Blue, a machine that beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997.The application of the Reactive Machine allows bot players to determine what steps to take and be able to learn the tactics used by their opponents.Artificial intelligence limited memory is a technology that is able to improve decision-making capabilities by using data or knowledge from events that have been previously studied. This type of intelligence is able to store previous data within a certain period of time.this is different from Reactive Machine. Limited memory is able to learn from previous events by analyzing the actions or data given to this machine. Examples are virtual assistants, chatbots, self-driving cars, and others.Almost all existing AI applications, from virtual chatbots and assistants to self-driving vehicles, are all driven by AI with limited memory.Theory of mind AI is the next level of the AI system currently being developed by researchers.Theory of mind AI can connect with human behavior and emotions. This means that this machine can understand how humans, animals, and other machines feel.After successfully understanding these feelings, this machine is required to be able to take advantage of the information to make decisions that reflect itself.Self-aware is an AI that has evolved to be so similar to the human brain that it has developed self-awareness.In AI's self-aware type, the machine already has human-level awareness. In addition to understanding the emotional state of humans, it has also started to have its own emotions and understands itself in this world.This type of artificial intelligence represents all existing AIs, even including the most complicated and capable AIs ever made to date.Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) refers to an AI system that can only perform certain tasks independently using human-like capabilities.These machines can't do anything other than what has been programmed. That is, these AIs have a very limited or narrow range of competence.According to the classification system mentioned above, the system is in accordance with all AI reactive machine and limited memory. Even the most complex AI that uses machine learning and deep learning to teach itself is under ANI.This is information about the type of artificial intelligence that facilitates human work. May it be useful!

This is what an aerospace industry intern told Interesting Engineering (IE) while reacting to the recent news of AI interns being hired by a remote marketing firm in the United States. 
“The human interns who are not performing well will face a serious threat to their future,” said Can Unen, a student trainee at an aviation engineering company in Turkey.  Coating wine bottle with wax and honey extraction, the best of IE this week

As AI continues on the path of being the new technological revolution, many companies are having a go at it, but some are taking it to the next crazy level.
Earlier last month, PR and digital marketing firm Codeword took a unique step toward the future of the workforce by adding two new interns to their team with a twist.
Unlike other employees, Aiko and Aiden are not real people but are creations of artificial intelligence that “work” as interns for Codeword. The two AI interns are the first of their kind in the agency industry.
The goal of Codeword’s purported experiment in human-AI collaboration is to gain more insight into the application of AI in the creative sector.
“We decided to start experimenting with AI tools, to see what AI can do better than creative professionals, and what creative professionals can do better than AI,” Kyle Monson, co-founder of Codeword, told IE.
Reasons behind the AI ‘Experiment’
The age of marketing automation has seen strategists and analysts use AI tools in their daily workflow, and Codeword is taking this a step further.
The company works at the nexus of marketing, technology, and media and focuses on the use of new resources. 
Aiden and Aiko will integrate into Codeword’s tech stack, which already consists of platforms driven by AI in order to concentrate more on creative output, claims the company.
“The next question is whether AI can augment creative work streams — the kind of designing, writing, and ideation that creative companies do,” said Monson, referring to the company’s “experiment.” 
Will it obstruct the work of humans, replace humans entirely, or excel in a particular creative area, leaving the rest to human workers? The company “will be exploring all those questions,” added Monson.

‘Sandwich’ workflow: Human-AI collaboration 
The workflow paradigm known as the “sandwich” serves as the foundation for Codeword’s concept of AI-human integration.
Three steps make up this model: A human first has an inspired thought and prompts the AI. The human then selects an option from a selection that the AI has generated, modifies it, and adds any finishing touches they see fit. 
The model incorporates AI in step 2 and is comparable to the conventional agency creative process. 
The objective is to determine what Codeword can do with AI that they couldn’t do without it and to investigate whether AI can speed up, reduce the cost, and improve their core creative job.	
“I think there is still a need for human touch at the end, like in the sandwich workflow,” says Unen. 
“It’s inspirational and experimentally important from a scientific point of view as well, as the outputs from this trial will likely guide AI researchers.”
Meanwhile, the AI interns have performed exceptionally well on projects that call for the analysis of substantial amounts of data or inputs, similar to the study of tone in written material, claims Monson.
When ghostwriting, the AI can replicate a human tone. When making mood boards for brands, it can draw from a wide range of visual sources, he further added.
However, Aiden and Aiko don’t get the work “100% right or 100% done” and still need human supervision.
“They get us 70% of the way there, and then the human team can provide the final 30% — cleaning up the work, making sure it’s accurate,” stated Monson.
Role of AI interns
Aiko will be part of the Codeword design team, working under Senior Art Director Emilio Ramos and handling design duties like image editing, concept sketch creation, and icon design. 
Aiden will become a member of the editorial staff and report to Senior Editor Terrence Doyle. He will conduct voice-and-tone analyses, analyze news stories, and perhaps even write internal material.
They will have monthly performance reviews, as do all interns, and if their internship is a success, they will have the option to move up to a full-time position, according to Codeword.  
Finding the interns’ skills and abilities and developing them throughout the internship will be one of the team’s main challenges, according to the company. 
It is also interesting to learn about the creation of these interns, who are, in essence, structures that sit on top of AI tools used by the company.
“We asked ChatGPT, ‘What are common names that begin with AI?’ and Aiden and Aiko were the first two,” recalled Monson.
“Then we asked ‘What does a young person named Aiko look like?’ and that’s how we got their faces.”
There’s been a lot of chatter about whether it was appropriate to give them names and faces, but it definitely makes the project more engaging and interesting, according to the marketing company. 
By using the tools to create “their own likeness and name,” Codeword has tried to minimize potential bias, claimed the firm’s co-founder. 
AI and the future of the creative sector 
The agency, its team, and its community will learn more about human-AI cooperation thanks to Codeword’s innovative AI project. 
Aiko and Aiden will work as full-fledged members of the Codeword team, with the aim of identifying fresh approaches to incorporating AI into the creative process.

The trial, says the firm, is a step closer to a time when AI and human creativity will coexist.
However, when IE asked about the “criteria for choosing the two AI interns,” Monson gave a funny reply; Codeword “didn’t give them a job interview.” So, the AI interns began with a big advantage over human applicants.
“So far, it’s been all positives,” he said, speaking about the “experiment.” 
“The team is energized and finding interesting ways to use them. Aiko designed our all-hands deck last week and did a beautiful job,” he continued. 
Meanwhile, skeptical Unen is hopeful that AI will open new doors for creative people rather than close doors to human workers, as some fear. 
“People who have [a] better experience with AI can get major roles during the transformation, which is a big opportunity for them,” he said. 
“I think ones with a creative mind and necessary skills will benefit from AI as they can interact and gain different perspectives from it.”
Publicity stunt or embracing the reality 
Codeword’s “goal,” according to the co-founder’s blog, is to be as open and honest about our procedures and lessons learned so that the firm and its clients can benefit directly from the program.
When questioned about the intentions of this endeavor, Monson replied: “Sure, let’s say it’s [a] 20% marketing stunt. We’re a marketing agency! But the other 80% is the important part.”  
“The issues we’re tackling and the questions we’re trying to answer with this experiment are very real.” 
It has been argued that, for decades, Japanese roboticists have been at the forefront of realizing the dream of building companion robots for humans powered by AI.
The argument continues that, contrary to some Western institutions, which focused more on algorithms in the abstract, these Japanese institutions believed that AI innovation should be developed alongside—or rather, within—a real artificial body.
Although we are still determining if we are ready to fully embrace AI without fear, along with the potential job losses, Monson thinks AI will make headlines for years to come.
“AI-human relationship will be the biggest media and marketing story over the next decade,” he said.  
Meanwhile, the Codeword blog asserts that Aiden and Aiko will not replace the human workforce at the firm, and their “intern wages” will be donated to Grace Hopper Celebration, the largest conference for women technologists in the world.RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Nevertheless, the firm has not made the bots ready for media yet. 
“We don’t make our interns available to the media until we hire them full-time.” Monson smiled.

Academic Integrity and Artificial Intelligence
What students need to know



February 10, 2023 — 
You’ve probably used AI tools without even knowing it – Grammarly, Google Translate, Quillbot, Jasper, auto-complete and grammar checker. But now, there are more sophisticated AI tools available, like ChatGPT and DALL • E, that are able to create content in ways never seen before. ChatGPT has attracted a lot of attention recently, including commentary from celebrities and well-known authorities. Actor Ryan Reynolds used Chat GPT to write a script, musician Nick Cave wrote a viral blog post on why AI could never replace artists, and one of the largest scientific, academic journals not accepting ChatGPT as authors in any publications.
Francois Jordaan, a UM Academic Integrity Specialist, says,  “Students are asking if and how they can use these new AI tools to compete coursework. For example, students want to know if they can use these tools for inspiration, to get started or as a reference guide? Or, can they submit parts of AI-generated work if the context allows? If so, how do they cite it? Does using AI allow them to still work with integrity?” Jordaan explains that, “As with other forms of collaboration, the lines between appropriate and inappropriate can get blurred. The answers aren’t always black or white and context is everything.”
Here are some guiding principles for maintaining academic integrity in relation to artificial intelligence..

AI does not replace your own thinking, analysis, or judgment. Using AI inappropriately doesn’t demonstrate your understanding of a topic and it doesn’t help you learn the skills that are expected of you both within the classroom and in the workplace.
Whether or not AI use is appropriate depends on your instructor. Unless you are asked to use AI on a course assignment, assume you are not allowed to use it.
AI can be detected. There are tools that can detect AI produced content. Your instructors will assess you work based on their expertise, the learning objectives of the course and comparisons to your previous work.
If you have used AI without your instructor’s permission, you are at risk of facing an allegation of academic misconduct. A finding of academic misconduct has academic and personal consequences, including lowering your GPA, delaying your graduation and notations on your transcript. If in doubt whether AI is permitted – remember IF YOU NEED TO KNOW, ASK.
AI-generated content can be redundant, inaccurate and repetitive at best, and offensive or biased at worst. Remember that whatever you submit for a course assignment is your full and ultimate responsibility.
If you are permitted to use AI, you must cite it.

Staff from the Academic Learning Centre will be available to help you understand Artificial Intelligence and how it applies to Academic Integrity on the main floor of UMSU University Centre on February 15 and 16 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. There will be games and prizes as well as Valentines candy, so come check it out.
