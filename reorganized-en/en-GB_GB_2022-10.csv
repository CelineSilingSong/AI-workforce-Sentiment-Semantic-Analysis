ScrapingAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe ShiftA.I.-Generated Art Is Already Transforming Creative WorkOnly a few months old, apps like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are changing how filmmakers, interior designers and other creative professionals do their jobs.Share full article56Read in appCredit...Kevin Roose, via DALL-EBy Kevin RooseOct. 21, 2022For years, the conventional wisdom among Silicon Valley futurists was that artificial intelligence and automation spelled doom for blue-collar workers whose jobs involved repetitive manual labor. Truck drivers, retail cashiers and warehouse workers would all lose their jobs to robots, they said, while workers in creative fields like art, entertainment and media would be safe.Well, an unexpected thing happened recently: A.I. entered the creative class.In the past few months, A.I.-based image generators like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have made it possible for anyone to create unique, hyper-realistic images just by typing a few words into a text box.These apps, though new, are already astoundingly popular. DALL-E 2, for example, has more than 1.5 million users generating more than two million images every day, while Midjourney’s official Discord server has more than three million members.These programs use what’s known as “generative A.I.,” a type of A.I. that was popularized several years ago with the release of text-generating tools like GPT-3 but has since expanded into images, audio and video.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt’s still too early to tell whether this new wave of apps will end up costing artists and illustrators their jobs. What seems clear, though, is that these tools are already being put to use in creative industries.Recently, I spoke to five creative-class professionals about how they’re using A.I.-generated art in their jobs.‘It spit back a perfect image.’ImageCredit...via Collin WaldochCollin Waldoch, 29, a Brooklyn game designer, recently started using generative A.I. to create custom art for his online game, Twofer Goofer, which works a bit like a rhyming version of Wordle. Every day, players are given a clue — like “a set of rhythmic moves while in a half-conscious state” — and are tasked with coming up with a pair of rhyming words that matches the clue. (In this case, “trance dance.”)Initially, Mr. Waldoch planned to hire human artists through the gig-work platform Upwork to illustrate each day’s rhyming word pair. But when he saw the cost — between $50 and $60 per image, plus time for rounds of feedback and edits — he decided to try using A.I. instead. He plugged word pairs into Midjourney and DreamStudio, an app based on Stable Diffusion, and tweaked the results until they looked right. Total cost: a few minutes of work, plus a few cents. (DreamStudio charges about a cent per image; Midjourney’s standard membership costs $30 per month for unlimited images.)“I typed in ‘carrot parrot,’ and it spit back a perfect image of a parrot made of carrots,” he said. “That was the immediate ‘aha’ moment.”Mr. Waldoch said he didn’t feel guilty about using A.I. instead of hiring human artists, because human artists were too expensive to make the game worthwhile.“We wouldn’t have done this” if not for A.I., he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT‘I don’t feel like it will take my job away.’ImageCredit...Isabella OrsiImageCredit...Isabella Orsi, via InteriorAIIsabella Orsi, 24, an interior designer in San Francisco, recently used a generative A.I. app called InteriorAI to create a mock-up for a client.The client, a tech start-up, was looking to spruce up its office. Ms. Orsi uploaded photos of the client’s office to InteriorAI, then applied a “cyberpunk” filter. The app produced new renderings in seconds — showing what the office’s entryway would look like with colored lights, contoured furniture and a new set of shelves.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. Orsi thinks that rather than replacing interior designers entirely, generative A.I. will help them come up with ideas during the initial phase of a project.

Subscribe and listen.“I think there’s an element of good design that requires the empathetic touch of a human,” she said. “So I don’t feel like it will take my job away. Somebody has to discern between the different renderings, and at the end of the day, I think that needs a designer.”‘It’s like working with a really willful concept artist.’ImageCredit...Patrick Clair, via DALL-EPatrick Clair, 40, a filmmaker in Sydney, Australia, started using A.I.-generated art this year to help him prepare for a presentation to a film studio.Mr. Clair, who has worked on hit shows including “Westworld,” was looking for an image of a certain type of marble statue. But when he went looking on Getty Images — his usual source for concept art — he came up empty. Instead, he turned to DALL-E 2.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I put ‘marble statue’ into DALL-E, and it was closer than what I could get on Getty in five minutes,” Mr. Clair said.Since then, he has used DALL-E 2 to help him generate imagery, such as the above image of a Melbourne tram in a dust storm, that isn’t readily available from online sources.He predicted that rather than replacing concept artists or putting Hollywood special effects wizards out of a job, A.I. image generators would simply become part of every filmmaker’s tool kit.“It’s like working with a really willful concept artist,” he said.“Photoshop can do things that you can’t do with your hands, in the same way a calculator can crunch numbers in a way that you can’t in your brain, but Photoshop never surprises you,” he continued. “Whereas DALL-E surprises you, and comes back with things that are genuinely creative.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT‘What if we could show what the dogs playing poker looked like?’ImageCredit...Shawn Herron, via DALL-EDuring a recent creative brainstorm, Jason Carmel, 49, an executive at the New York advertising agency Wunderman Thompson, found himself wondering if A.I. could help.“We had three and a half good ideas,” he said of his team. “And the fourth one was just missing a visual way of describing it.”The image they wanted — a group of dogs playing poker, for an ad being pitched to a pet medicine company — would have taken an artist all day to sketch. Instead, they asked DALL-E 2 to generate it.“We were like, what if we could show what the dogs playing poker looked like?” Mr. Carmel said.The resulting image didn’t end up going into an ad, but Mr. Carmel predicts that generative A.I. will become part of every ad agency’s creative process. He doesn’t, however, think that using A.I. will meaningfully speed up the agencies’ work, or replace their art departments. He said many of the images generated by A.I. weren’t good enough to be shown to clients and that users who weren’t experienced users of these apps would probably waste a lot of time trying to formulate the right prompts.“When I see people write about how it’s going to destroy creativity, they talk about it as if it’s an efficiency play,” Mr. Carmel said. “And then I know that they maybe haven’t played around with it that much themselves, because it’s a time suck.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT‘This is a sketch tool.’ImageCredit...via Sarah DrummondSarah Drummond, a service designer in London, started using A.I.-generated images a few months ago to replace the black-and-white sketches she did for her job. These were usually basic drawings that visually represented processes she was trying to design improvements for, like a group of customers lining up at a store’s cash register.Instead of spending hours creating what she called “blob drawings” by hand, Ms. Drummond, 36, now types what she wants into DALL-E 2 or Midjourney.“All of a sudden, I can take like 15 seconds and go, ‘Woman at till, standing at kiosk, black-and-white illustration,’ and get something back that’s really professional looking,” she said.Ms. Drummond acknowledged that A.I. image generators had limitations. They aren’t good at more complex sketches, for example, or creating multiple images with the same character. And like the other creative professionals, she said she didn’t think A.I. designers would replace human illustrators outright.“Would I use it for final output? No. I would hire someone to fully make what we wanted to realize,” she said. “But the throwaway work that you do when you’re any kind of designer, whether it’s visual, architectural, urban planner — you’re sketching, sketching, sketching. And so this is a sketch tool.”Kevin Roose is a technology columnist and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Oct. 22, 2022, Section B, Page 5 of the New York edition with the headline: Artificial Intelligence Already Has a Place in the Toolbox of Creative Professionals.

         — 
    


            Erin Hanson has spent years developing the vibrant color palette and chunky brushstrokes that define the vivid oil paintings for which she is known. But during a recent interview with her, I showed Hanson my attempts to recreate her style with just a few keystrokes. 
    

            Using Stable Diffusion, a popular and publicly available open-source AI image generation tool, I had plugged in a series of prompts to create images in the style of some of her paintings of California poppies on an ocean cliff and a field of lupin. 
    

            “That one with the purple flowers and the sunset,” she said via Zoom, peering at one of my attempts, “definitely looks like one of my paintings, you know?” 
    

            With Hanson’s guidance, I then tailored another detailed prompt: “Oil painting of crystal light, in the style of Erin Hanson, light and shadows, backlit trees, strong outlines, stained glass, modern impressionist, award-winning, trending on ArtStation, vivid, high-definition, high-resolution.” I fed the prompt to Stable Diffusion; within seconds it produced three images. 
    

            “Oh, wow,” she said as we pored over the results, pointing out how similar the trees in one image looked to the ones in her 2021 painting “Crystalline Maples.” “I would put that on my wall,” she soon added.

AI Image/Stable Diffusion



Hanson, who’s based in McMinnville, Oregon, is one of many professional artists whose work was included in the data set used to train Stable Diffusion, which was released in August by London-based Stability AI. She’s one of several artists interviewed by CNN Business who were unhappy to learn that pictures of their work were used without someone informing them, asking for consent, or paying for their use.

            Once available only to a select group of tech insiders, text-to-image AI systems are becoming increasingly popular and powerful. These systems include Stable Diffusion, from a company that recently raised more than $100 million in funding, and DALL-E, from a company that has raised $1 billion to date.  
    

            These tools, which typically offer some free credits before charging, can create all kinds of images with just a few words, including those that are clearly evocative of the works of many, many artists (if not seemingly created by the same artist). Users can invoke those artists with words such as “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. And the current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases.  
    

            In just months, millions of people have flocked to text-to-image AI systems and they are already being used to create experimental films, magazine covers and images to illustrate news stories. An image generated with an AI system called Midjourney recently won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair, and caused an uproar among artists.

            But as artists like Hanson have discovered that their work is being used to train AI, it raises an even more fundamental concern: that their own art is effectively being used to train a computer program that could one day cut into their livelihoods. Anyone who generates images with systems such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can then sell them (the specific terms regarding copyright and ownership of these images varies).   
    

            “I don’t want to participate at all in the machine that’s going to cheapen what I do,” said Daniel Danger, an illustrator and print maker who learned a number of his works were used to train Stable Diffusion. 
    

        When fine art becomes data 


            The machines are far from magic. For one of these systems to ingest your words and spit out an image, it must be trained on mountains of data, which may include billions of images scraped from the internet, paired with written descriptions.

            Some services, including OpenAI’s DALL-E system, don’t disclose the datasets behind their AI systems. But with Stable Diffusion, Stability AI is clear about its origins. Its core dataset was trained on image and text pairs that were curated for their looks from an even more massive cache of images and text from the internet. The full-size dataset, known as LAION-5B was created by the German AI nonprofit LAION, which stands for “large-scale artificial intelligence open network.” 
    

            This practice of scraping images or other content from the internet for dataset training isn’t new, and traditionally falls under what’s known as “fair use” — the legal principle in US copyright law that allows for the use of copyright-protected work in some situations. That’s because those images, many of which may be copyrighted, are being used in a very different way, such as for training a computer to identify cats.

            But datasets are getting larger and larger, and training ever-more-powerful AI systems, including, recently, these generative ones that anyone can use to make remarkable looking images in an instant.

            A few tools let anyone search through the LAION-5B dataset, and a growing number of professional artists are discovering their work is part of it. One of these search tools, built by writer and technologist Andy Baio and programmer Simon Willison, stands out. While it can only be used to search a small fraction of Stable Diffusion’s training data (more than 12 million images), its creators analyzed the art imagery within it and determined that, of the top 25 artists whose work was represented, Hanson was one of just three who is still alive. They found 3,854 images of her art included in just their small sampling. 
    

            Stability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque told CNN Business via email that art is a tiny fraction of the LAION training data behind Stable Diffusion. “Art makes up much less than 0.1% of the dataset and is only created when deliberately called by the user,” he said.
    

            But that’s slim comfort to some artists.

        Angry artists 


            Danger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professional artists who told CNN Business they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods. 
    

            He is concerned that the images people produce with AI image generators could replace some of his more “utilitarian” work, which includes media like book covers and illustrations for articles published online. 
    

            “Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.”

Tara McPherson, a Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films such as the Oscar-winning “Juno,” is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said. 
    

            “How easy is this going to be? How elegant is this art going to become?,” she asked. “Right now it’s a little wonky sometimes but this is just getting started.” 
    

            While the concerns are real, the recourse is unclear. Even if AI-generated images have a widespread impact — such as by changing business models — it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re violating artists’ copyrights, according to Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington. And it would be prohibitive to license every single image in a dataset before using it, she said. 
    

            “You can actually feel really sympathetic for artistic communities and want to support them and also be like, there’s no way,” she said. “If we did that, it would essentially be saying machine learning is impossible.” 
    

            McPherson and Danger mused about the possibility of putting watermarks on their work when posting it online to safeguard the images (or at least make them look less appealing). But McPherson said when she’s seen artist friends put watermarks across their images online it “ruins the art, and the joy of people looking at it and finding inspiration in it.” 
    

            If he could, Danger said he would remove his images from datasets used to train AI systems. But removing pictures of an artist’s work from a dataset wouldn’t stop Stable Diffusion from being able to generate images in that artist’s style.

AI won an art contest, and artists are furious




            For starters, the AI model has already been trained. But also, as Mostaque said, specific artistic styles could still be called on by users because of OpenAI’s CLIP model, which was used to train Stable Diffusion to understand connections between words and images. 
    

            Christoph Schuhmann, an LAION founder, said via email that his group thinks that truly enabling opting in and out of datasets will only work if all parts of AI models — of which there can be many — respect those choices. 
    

            “A unilateral approach to consent handling will not suffice in the AI world; we need a cross-industry system to handle that,” he said. 
    

        Offering artists more control 


            Partners Mathew Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, Berlin-based artists experimenting with AI in their collaborative work, are working to tackle these challenges. Together with two other collaborators, they have launched Spawning, making tools for artists that they hope will let them better understand and control how their online art is used in datasets. 
    

            In September, Spawning released a search engine that can comb through the LAION-5B dataset, haveibeentrained.com, and in the coming weeks it intends to offer a way for people to opt out or in to datasets used for training. Over the past month or so, Dryhurst said, he’s been meeting with organizations training large AI models. He wants to get them to agree that if Spawning gathers lists of works from artists who don’t want to be included, they’ll honor those requests.  
    

            Dryhurst said Spawning’s goal is to make it clear that consensual data collection benefits everyone. And Mostaque agrees that people should be able to opt out. He told CNN Business that Stability AI is working with numerous groups on ways to “enable more control of database contents by the community” in the future. In a Twitter thread in September, he said Stability is open to contributing to ways that people can opt out of datasets, “such as by supporting Herndon’s work on this with many other projects to come.”

            “I personally understand the emotions around this as the systems become intelligent enough to understand styles,” he said in an email to CNN Business. 
    

            Schuhmann said LAION is also working with “various groups” to figure out how to let people opt in or out of including their images in training text-to-image AI models. “We take the feelings and concerns of artists very seriously,” Schuhmann said. 
    

            Hanson, for her part, has no problem with her art being used for training AI, but she wants to be paid. If images are sold that were made with the AI systems trained on their work, artists need to be compensated, she said — even if it’s “fractions of pennies.” 
    

            This could be on the horizon. Mostaque said Stability AI is looking into how “creatives can be rewarded from their work,” particularly as Stability AI itself releases AI models, rather than using those built by others. The company will soon announce a plan to get community feedback on “practical ways” to do this, he said. 
    

            Theoretically, I may eventually owe Hanson some money. I’ve run that same “crystal light” prompt on Stable Diffusion many times since we devised it, so many in fact that my laptop is littered with trees in various hues, rainbows of sunlight shining through their branches onto the ground below. It’s almost like having my own bespoke Hanson gallery.

Users can invoke those artists with words such as “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. And the current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases.   In just months, millions of people have flocked to text-to-image AI systems and they are already being used to create experimental films, magazine covers and images to illustrate news stories. An image generated with an AI system called Midjourney recently won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair, and caused an uproar among artists. But as artists like Hanson have discovered that their work is being used to train AI, it raises an even more fundamental concern: that their own art is effectively being used to train a computer program that could one day cut into their livelihoods. Anyone who generates images with systems such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can then sell them (the specific terms regarding copyright and ownership of these images varies).    “I don’t want to participate at all in the machine that’s going to cheapen what I do,” said Daniel Danger, an illustrator and print maker who learned a number of his works were used to train Stable Diffusion.  When fine art becomes data  The machines are far from magic. For one of these systems to ingest your words and spit out an image, it must be trained on mountains of data, which may include billions of images scraped from the internet, paired with written descriptions.  Some services, including OpenAI’s DALL-E system, don’t disclose the datasets behind their AI systems. But with Stable Diffusion, Stability AI is clear about its origins. Its core dataset was trained on image and text pairs that were curated for their looks from an even more massive cache of images and text from the internet. The full-size dataset, known as LAION-5B was created by the German AI nonprofit LAION, which stands for “large-scale artificial intelligence open network.”  This practice of scraping images or other content from the internet for dataset training isn’t new, and traditionally falls under what’s known as “fair use” — the legal principle in US copyright law that allows for the use of copyright-protected work in some situations. That’s because those images, many of which may be copyrighted, are being used in a very different way, such as for training a computer to identify cats.  But datasets are getting larger and larger, and training ever-more-powerful AI systems, including, recently, these generative ones that anyone can use to make remarkable looking images in an instant. A few tools let anyone search through the LAION-5B dataset, and a growing number of professional artists are discovering their work is part of it. One of these search tools, built by writer and technologist Andy Baio and programmer Simon Willison, stands out. While it can only be used to search a small fraction of Stable Diffusion’s training data (more than 12 million images), its creators analyzed the art imagery within it and determined that, of the top 25 artists whose work was represented, Hanson was one of just three who is still alive. They found 3,854 images of her art included in just their small sampling.  Stability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque told CNN Business via email that art is a tiny fraction of the LAION training data behind Stable Diffusion. “Art makes up much less than 0.1% of the dataset and is only created when deliberately called by the user,” he said. But that’s slim comfort to some artists.  Angry artists  Danger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professional artists who told CNN Business they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods.  He is concerned that the images people produce with AI image generators could replace some of his more “utilitarian” work, which includes media like book covers and illustrations for articles published online.  “Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.”  Tara McPherson, a Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films such as the Oscar-winning “Juno,” is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said.  “How easy is this going to be? How elegant is this art going to become?,” she asked. “Right now it’s a little wonky sometimes but this is just getting started.”  While the concerns are real, the recourse is unclear. Even if AI-generated images have a widespread impact — such as by changing business models — it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re violating artists’ copyrights, according to Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington. And it would be prohibitive to license every single image in a dataset before using it, she said.  “You can actually feel really sympathetic for artistic communities and want to support them and also be like, there’s no way,” she said. “If we did that, it would essentially be saying machine learning is impossible.”  McPherson and Danger mused about the possibility of putting watermarks on their work when posting it online to safeguard the images (or at least make them look less appealing). But McPherson said when she’s seen artist friends put watermarks across their images online it “ruins the art, and the joy of people looking at it and finding inspiration in it.”  If he could, Danger said he would remove his images from datasets used to train AI systems. But removing pictures of an artist’s work from a dataset wouldn’t stop Stable Diffusion from being able to generate images in that artist’s style.   For starters, the AI model has already been trained. But also, as Mostaque said, specific artistic styles could still be called on by users because of OpenAI’s CLIP model, which was used to train Stable Diffusion to understand connections between words and images.  Christoph Schuhmann, an LAION founder, said via email that his group thinks that truly enabling opting in and out of datasets will only work if all parts of AI models — of which there can be many — respect those choices.  “A unilateral approach to consent handling will not suffice in the AI world; we need a cross-industry system to handle that,” he said.  Offering artists more control  Partners Mathew Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, Berlin-based artists experimenting with AI in their collaborative work, are working to tackle these challenges. Together with two other collaborators, they have launched Spawning, making tools for artists that they hope will let them better understand and control how their online art is used in datasets.  In September, Spawning released a search engine that can comb through the LAION-5B dataset, haveibeentrained.com, and in the coming weeks it intends to offer a way for people to opt out or in to datasets used for training. Over the past month or so, Dryhurst said, he’s been meeting with organizations training large AI models. He wants to get them to agree that if Spawning gathers lists of works from artists who don’t want to be included, they’ll honor those requests.   Dryhurst said Spawning’s goal is to make it clear that consensual data collection benefits everyone. And Mostaque agrees that people should be able to opt out. He told CNN Business that Stability AI is working with numerous groups on ways to “enable more control of database contents by the community” in the future. In a Twitter thread in September, he said Stability is open to contributing to ways that people can opt out of datasets, “such as by supporting Herndon’s work on this with many other projects to come.” “I personally understand the emotions around this as the systems become intelligent enough to understand styles,” he said in an email to CNN Business.  Schuhmann said LAION is also working with “various groups” to figure out how to let people opt in or out of including their images in training text-to-image AI models. “We take the feelings and concerns of artists very seriously,” Schuhmann said.  Hanson, for her part, has no problem with her art being used for training AI, but she wants to be paid. If images are sold that were made with the AI systems trained on their work, artists need to be compensated, she said — even if it’s “fractions of pennies.”  This could be on the horizon. Mostaque said Stability AI is looking into how “creatives can be rewarded from their work,” particularly as Stability AI itself releases AI models, rather than using those built by others. The company will soon announce a plan to get community feedback on “practical ways” to do this, he said.  Theoretically, I may eventually owe Hanson some money. I’ve run that same “crystal light” prompt on Stable Diffusion many times since we devised it, so many in fact that my laptop is littered with trees in various hues, rainbows of sunlight shining through their branches onto the ground below. It’s almost like having my own bespoke Hanson gallery.","['business', 'tech']",https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220923162646-erin-hanson-artwork.jpg?c=original,P0Y0M0DT0H8M20S,1876.0,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'dateModified': '2022-07-08T11:27:15Z', 'uploadDate': '2022-07-07T20:09:32Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=business/2022/07/07/nightcap-ai-dall-e-2-art-clip-orig.cnn-business&stellarUri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/video-resource/instances/h_d5e7e9684308816876c58b878d71027d@published&stellarUdk=rn06132f&customer=cnn&edition=domestic&env=prod', 'duration': 'PT00H02M10S', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': ""Art critic Jerry Saltz on DALL-E 2: 'This is pretty crapola illustration'"", 'headline': ""Art critic Jerry Saltz on DALL-E 2: 'This is pretty crapola illustration'"", 'description': 'AI and DALL-E 2 is cropping up across Twitter feeds, but is it art?

As a law-firm associate about 20 years ago, Meredith Williams-Range would often be surrounded by bankers boxes filled with documents as well as printouts fanned across conference-room tables.In a familiar ritual back then for young attorneys and paralegals, they would physically thumb through contracts as they helped perform due diligence for merger deals, Williams-Range said. That could sometimes mean weeks of poring over the language for risks to flag to higher-ups and looking for issues to highlight for the parties to negotiate on, like any notable contractual obligations involving third-party suppliers. Today, a lot of those records have long since gone digital, and top law firms like Shearman & Sterling, where Williams-Range is now the chief knowledge and client-value officer, are using artificial intelligence to comb through contract language for such insights and to organize information in those contracts.""As lawyers, we have been trained not to trust anything — so trusting AI is always a difficult conversation to have,"" she told Insider. ""But what you've seen absolutely happen is the clients are driving where AI has either been developed or adopted in any Big Law firm.""

Mergers and acquisitions surged in 2021, when the roughly $5.9 trillion in deals was about 64% higher than in the previous year, according to Refinitiv data. The frenzy led to a windfall of work and revenues for Big Law firms, some of which looked to AI tools to keep pace with the volume of transactions they were advising on, Williams-Range said.Shearman & Sterling uses a wide variety of AI tools for different uses — one of the firm's go-tos for deals due diligence is Kira, a tool owned by Litera, a document-technology company that works with law firms.

The Chicago company's main investor is its private-equity backer, Hg. It had raised a total of nearly $358 million as of April, according to data from PitchBook.Litera's legal-industry surveys have recently found increasing demand for automation technology. In a survey released in April of more than 200 M&A attorneys in the US and elsewhere, 84% of respondents said they expected their firms to spend more on technology in the next year. Even more said that over the next five years, they expected most M&A work at their firms to be supported by AI.

The firm White & Case also noted its use of AI, like many firms, to assist with document review for discovery — a key phase of litigation that generates a huge number of documents, including emails, internal memos, and other forms of evidence in a lawsuit. The company uses tools such as Brainspace and Relativity, Janet Sullivan, the firm's global director of practice technology, said.Thomson Reuters, known for its legal-research tools like Westlaw, and other big legal-tech players have ramped up their AI offerings to assist with M&A work and research. The firm has also been acquiring companies that can collaborate, like Practical Law and the document-review tech company ThoughtTrace, combining the legal expertise of human lawyers and writers with AI tech to help train algorithms, Joe Dormani of TR Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Thomson Reuters, said. Some firms are also experimenting with more cutting-edge uses, like helping their attorneys write legal briefs. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, for instance, is piloting the use of Clearbrief, an AI-based Microsoft Word plug-in that suggests improvements as lawyers write briefs, like examples of relevant case law they might not have included that could strengthen their argument, Kate Orr, the global head of practice innovation for Orrick, said.But that doesn't mean young attorneys are being replaced by code just yet, she added.

Earlier this month, the White House waded into this discussion.  Dubbed the “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American People,” the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy identified five principles to “guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American public in the age of artificial intelligence.”
Although the blueprint has no binding legal effect, it is a bellwether document that celebrates recent efforts to regulate AI and encourages AI designers, regulators, and customers to take a close look at the negative side effects that AI may have on the American public and take steps to mitigate those impacts.
The Five Principles
The blueprint is organized into five separate, but related principles:
(1)  Safe and Effective Systems;
(2)  Algorithmic Discrimination Protections;
(3)  Data Privacy;
(4)  Notice and Explanation; and
(5)  Human Alternatives, Consideration & Fallback.
For each principle, the document outlines associated human protections that should guide the design and use of AI.  The general theme that emerges in each section is that AI should be designed with the human experience in mind, making sure that any use of AI, 1) does not endanger human life; 2) does not subject humans to discriminatory treatment; 3) protects human privacy interests; 4) embraces transparency; and 5) allows humans the opportunity to opt out of AI-driven systems.
Algorithmic Discrimination Protections
Of particular relevance to employers is the section on algorithmic discrimination protections.  The White House recognizes AI’s potential for innovation but explains that all AI systems must have “algorithmic discrimination protections built into their design, deployment, and ongoing use.”  In support of these protections, the blueprint cites a real-world example of a hiring tool “that learned the features of a company’s employees (predominantly men) and rejected women applicants for spurious and discriminatory reasons.” 
The White House lauds the EEOC’s recent technical assistance bulletin that explains how some employment-based AI tools can discriminate against individuals with disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  And it highlights industry-driven best practices that have been memorialized in the Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured questionnaire that businesses can use when deciding whether to implement software designed to evaluate workers and applicants.
The blueprint outlines discrimination protection principles that we have seen implemented in various laws throughout the country.  For example, the White House explains that AI tools should be monitored for discriminatory impacts and that the results of such audits “should be made public whenever possible to confirm these protections.”  This is consistent with recent regulation in New York City set to take effect in January 2023 that will require auditing of AI tools used in the workplace.
Above all else, the blueprint emphasizes the need for both designers and users of AI technology to be mindful of discriminatory impacts on protected populations.  It directs designers to build protections into the systems from unintentional proxy-based discrimination, and instructs vendors and customers to assess impacts and take active measures to mitigate discriminatory results.
What the Blueprint Means for Employers 
Although the blueprint is not a binding document, it is symbolic of the increased focus that regulators have on the use of AI in all facets of life, including the workplace.  Employers should be mindful of the principles expressed in the blueprint and should closely monitor developments in the law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Navy is thinking about artificial intelligence in two ways: the infrastructure to make unmanned systems work and technology meant to enhance how sailor and their commanders make decisions, a panel of technical and policy experts said Tuesday.
The output provided by AI is there help the human or supplement manned operations with unmanned assets, said Brett Vaughan, Navy Chief AI Officer, speaking at the U.S. Naval Institute on Tuesday. A human will always be in the loop and play a central role.
“By and large, the AI is there to augment and provide a human decision maker a range of options and recommendations,” Vaughan said.
That’s not to say there are not some decisions the AI system could make, he said. There are situations with unmanned vessels, such as going around a seamount, that the AI can make without needing a human, Vaughan said.
“That just shows you when we talk about offloading or delegating decisions there’s a sliding scale we have to be cognizant of, that’s got to appear in your calculus,” Vaughan said. “That’s where the perspective of the human being helped or the customer, the warfighter, sailor, Marine is important in the design of the code and the capability.”
The Pentagon’s goal for AI is to use it to achieve a competitive advantage, said retired Lt. Gen Michael Groen, former director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.
“How do we gain competitive advantage against China, against any of our other opponents and be able to operate with tempo and with precision,” Groen said. “And so this is the real core of what we’re trying to build here today.”
Right now, in the DoD, this looks like pattern recognition and algorithms, as an example, which can help streamline processes or decisions.
As an early operational application, AI is key to the Navy’s ongoing testing of unmanned vessels in the Middle East, U.S. 5th Fleet’s commander Vice Adm. Brad Cooper said last week.
“They’re going to see every single thing that passes, they’re going to take a picture of it. And then they’re going to map using AI — the pattern of life of everything around them as far as they can see. And then when there is something different, they’re going to take a picture of that every second, you’re going to send it back to a Navy command center. And then a human being makes a decision,” he said last week at the Coast Guard Academy.
Already, civilians and the military are used to using AI, he said. Take cars as an example. AI algorithms help a car monitor fuel levels or tire pressure. The same with navigation apps that adjust to say how much traffic is on a route or where one can stop for coffee.
For the military, AI can help show commanders additional opportunities or risks, just like the navigation apps might suggest a different route depending on traffic.
Vaughan’s office never starts with AI, but rather looks at the problem or challenge first and then brings in AI to help address it, if AI is the right tool needed. He currently oversees about 1,000 AI-related projects.
Using AI is going to require the Navy to recalibrate how it does business, he said.
It is different than building hardware like ships, where they are built, go out and come back for repairs. AI requires constant monitoring and verification to make sure the system works properly.
The U.S. is not the only country looking to use AI with its military. Both China and Russia are using AI already, said Sam Tangredi, a professor of national, naval, and maritime strategy at the U.S. Naval War College.
China has said that it wants to be an AI leader, he said, something they could achieve because the country wants to use AI for different reasons.
“They want it for social control, for control of the populace by the Chinese Communist Party. Great incentives to spend a lot of money on it,” Tangredi said.
Russia looks to use AI for autonomy so it can supplement its force, he said.
The U.S. on the other hand is focused on keeping the human in the loop, Tangredi said.
The Chinese are good at human surveillance, Groen said, but it is a question of if Beijing can convert that into a warfighting capability. China has also been interested in AI as a tool for battlefield commanders as a counter to the U.S. operations in the Western Pacific, reported USNI News last year.
“It is necessary to assist command on the battlefield by establishing a wargaming system that can rigorously reflect reality to train an AI system that can deal with distributed lethality,” reads a 2020 Marine Design & Research Institute of China (MARIC).
How well the Chinese can execute on their goals is still an open question, Groen said
“Can they innovate? And then can we innovate faster?” he said. “Can we innovate enough and organize ourselves enough so that we actually have the enterprise that can fight effectively against an opponent that is largely organized, not innovative?”

Researchers Outline AI-Related Clinical Competencies for Health Professionals

A research report published in Academic Medicine outlines artificial intelligence (AI)-related clinical competencies for healthcare professionals in an effort to address practical and ethical concerns raised by the growing interest in and adoption of these tools in clinical settings.







Efforts to create responsible health AI and define guidelines for use have become more common in response to these concerns, but many are focused on the developers of the algorithms. By focusing on the clinician’s side of this issue, the research team highlights the shared responsibility of ethical health AI use among various healthcare stakeholders.
“We started with a formal literature review of the health professions education and informatics literature, finding that there’ve been numerous calls for a list of AI-related competencies, because of the complexity of the tools and the risk of misuse and unintended consequences,” said Bonnie Miller, MD, professor of medical education and administration at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), in the press release. “But we could find no list of competencies, and very scant mention of how clinicians were being trained to use AI-based tools as they’ve begun entering into testing.”
To fill this gap, the researchers selected 15 subject matter experts from across the US and conducted semistructured interviews focused on the use of AI-based tools in healthcare settings.
“In interviews our subject experts expressed a mix of optimism and caution,” noted Regina Russell, PhD, assistant professor of medical education and administration at VUMC, in the press release. “They recognize the great potential of these new technologies to support health, but the need for caution was repeatedly expressed around issues of bias and fairness as AI-based tools are rolled out.”
“It’s well understood that AI-based tools can exacerbate biases present in the data used to train them,” she continued. “With health disparities of all sorts having long been baked into our health system and our society, it’s clear that health professionals will need to develop baseline knowledge, skills and attitudes to work appropriately with these tools.”
Transcripts were coded, thematically analyzed, developed into draft competency statements, and provided to the experts for feedback. The draft statements were then finalized using a consensus approach among the eight members of the research team.
From this process, six competency domain statements and 25 subcompetencies were formulated.
The six competency domain statements are basic knowledge of AI; social and ethical implications of AI; AI-enhanced clinical encounters; evidence-based evaluation of AI tools; workflow analysis for AI-based tools; and practice-based learning and improvement regarding AI-based tools.
This report is the latest effort to create guidelines for responsible and ethical AI use in healthcare.
Last week, the Coalition for Health AI shared progress and published papers defining core principles of responsible AI testing, usability, and safety as part of its work on mitigating bias and promoting equity.
Earlier this month, the White House unveiled its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which outlines five protections Americans should have in the face of the rising use of these technologies.

Prior to Vox, Neel was an editorial fellow at Audubon magazine and an assistant producer at Radiolab.In late September, OpenAI made its DALL-E 2 AI art generator widely available to the public, allowing anyone with a computer to make one of those striking, slightly bizarre images that seem to be floating around the internet more and more these days. DALL-E 2 is by no means the first AI art generator to open to the public (the competing AI art models Stable Diffusion and Midjourney also launched this year), but it comes with a strong pedigree: Its cousin, the text-generating model known as GPT-3 — itself the subject of much intrigue and multiple gimmicky stories — was also developed by OpenAI. Last week, Microsoft announced it would be adding AI-generated art tools — powered by DALL-E 2 — to its Office software suite, and in June DALL-E 2 was used to design the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine. The most techno-utopian proponents of AI-generated art say it provides a democratization of art for the masses; the cynics among us would argue it’s copying human artists and threatening to end their careers. Either way, it seems clear that AI art is here, and its potential has only just begun to be explored. Naturally, I decided to try it.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.As I scrolled through examples of DALL-E’s work for inspiration (I had determined that my first attempt ought to be a masterpiece), it seemed to me that AI-generated art didn’t have any particular aesthetic other than, maybe, being a bit odd. There were pigs wearing sunglasses and floral shirts while riding motorcycles, raccoons playing tennis, and Johannes Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring, tweaked ever so slightly so as to replace the titular girl with a sea otter. But as I kept scrolling, I realized there is one unifying theme underlying every piece: AI art, more often than not, looks like Western art. “All AI is only backward-looking,” said Amelia Winger-Bearskin, professor of AI and the Arts at the University of Florida’s Digital Worlds Institute. “They can only look at the past, and then they can make a prediction of the future.” For an AI model (also known as an algorithm), the past is the data set it has been trained on. For an AI art model, that data set is art. And much of the fine art world is dominated by white, Western artists. This leads to AI-generated images that look overwhelmingly Western. This is, frankly, a little disappointing: AI-generated art, in theory, could be an incredibly useful tool for imagining a more equitable vision of art that looks very different from what we have come to take for granted. Instead, it stands to simply perpetuate the colonial ideas that drive our understanding of art today.To be clear, models like DALL-E 2 can be asked to generate art in the style of any artist; asking for an image with the modifier “Ukiyo-e,” for example, will create works that mimic Japanese woodblock prints and paintings. But users must include those modifiers; they are rarely, if ever, the default. DALL-E 2’s interpretation of the prompt “Hokusai painting of Artificial Intelligence” Neel Dhanesha/Vox; Courtesy of OpenAIWinger-Bearskin has seen the limits of AI art firsthand. When one of her students used images generated by Stable Diffusion to make a video of a nature scene, she realized the twilight backgrounds put out by the AI model looked oddly similar to the scenes painted by Disney animators in the 1950s and ‘60s — which themselves had been inspired by the French Rococo movement. “There are a lot of Disney films, and what he got back was something we see a lot of,” Winger-Bearskin told Recode. “There are so many things missing in those datasets. There are millions of night scenes from all over the world that we would never see.” AI bias is a notoriously difficult problem. Left unchecked, algorithms can perpetuate racist and sexist biases, and that bias extends to AI art as well: as Sigal Samuel wrote for Future Perfect in April, previous versions of DALL-E would spit out images of white men when asked to depict lawyers, for example, and depict all flight attendants as women. OpenAI has been working to mitigate these effects, fine-tuning its model to try to weed out stereotypes, though researchers still disagree on whether those measures have worked. But even if they work, the problem of artistic style will persist: If DALL-E manages to depict a world free of racist and sexist stereotypes, it would still do so in the image of the West. “You can’t fine-tune a model to be less Western if your dataset is mostly Western,” Yilun Du, a PhD student and AI researcher at MIT, told Recode. AI models are trained by scraping the internet for images, and Du thinks models made by groups based in the United States or Europe are likely predisposed to Western media. Some models made outside the United States, like ERNIE-ViLG, which was developed by the Chinese tech company Baidu, do a better job generating images that are more culturally relevant to their place of origin, but they come with issues of their own; as the MIT Technology Review reported in September, ERNIE-ViLG is better at producing anime art than DALL-E 2 but refuses to make images of Tiananmen Square. Because AI is backward-looking, it’s only able to make variations of images it has seen before. That, Du says, is why an AI model is unable to create an image of a plate sitting on top of a fork, even though it should conceivably understand each aspect of the request. The model has simply never seen an image of a plate on top of a fork, so it spits out images of forks on top of plates instead.Injecting more non-Western art into an existing dataset wouldn’t be a very helpful solution, either, because of the overwhelming prevalence of Western art on the internet. “It’s kind of like giving clean water to a tree that was fed with contaminated water for the last 25 years,” said Winger-Bearskin. “Even if it’s getting better water now, the fruit from that tree is still contaminated. Running that same model with new training data does not significantly change it.” Instead, creating a better, more representative AI model would require creating it from scratch — which is what Winger-Bearskin, who is a member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation of Oklahoma and an artist herself, does when she uses AI to create art about the climate crisis. That’s a time-consuming process. “The hardest thing is making the data set,” said Du. Training an AI art generator requires millions of images, and Du said it would take months to create a data set that’s equally representative of all the art styles that can be found around the world. If there’s an upside to the artistic bias inherent in most AI art models, perhaps it’s this: Like all good art, it exposes something about our society. Many modern art museums, Winger-Bearskin said, give more space to art made by people from underrepresented communities than they did in the past. But this art still only makes up a small fraction of what exists in museum archives. “An artist’s job is to talk about what’s going on in the world, to amplify issues so we notice them,” said Jean Oh, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. AI art models are unable to provide commentary of their own — everything they produce is at the behest of a human — but the art they produce creates a sort of accidental meta-commentary that Oh thinks is worthy of notice. “It gives us a way to observe the world the way it is structured, and not the perfect world we want it to be.” That’s not to say that Oh believes more equitable models shouldn’t be created — they are important for circumstances where depicting an idealized world is helpful, like for children’s books or commercial applications, she told Recode — but rather that the existence of the imperfect models should push us to think more deeply about how we use them. Instead of simply trying to eliminate the biases as though they don’t exist, Oh said, we should take the time to identify and quantify them in order to have constructive discussions about their impacts and how to minimize them. “The main purpose is to help human creativity,” Oh said, who’s researching ways to create more intuitive human-AI interactions. “People want to blame the AI. But the final product is our responsibility.”This story was first published in the Recode newsletter.

The concept of artificial intelligence has been around for millennia, although the actual term was coined during a conference at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire in 1956. Many cultures worldwide have their share of legends, myths, and stories of artificial creatures coming to life, thinking, and behaving like people. These storytellers spun tales of automatons and robots, entertaining (and possibly scaring) their Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese audiences.
Today's storytellers include filmmakers, and plenty of movies out there deal with the concept of artificial intelligence. Sometimes the results are humorous; other times, they're terrifying.
So, in that spirit, we present the top sixteen must-see movies for anyone interested in the field of artificial intelligence. We're offering them in alphabetical order rather than trying to arrange them by some rating system or release dates.
Did we somehow leave out your favorite AI movie? Drop us some feedback and tell us what we overlooked!

2001: Space Odyssey
Let's start things off with a genuine classic. The HAL 9000 is the ultimate blueprint for an actual artificial intelligence: intelligent, logical, controlling, and devoid of emotional constraints. HAL controls and monitors the spacecraft heading to Jupiter, and, well, soon enough, it's talking about not opening the pod bay doors, and things just get worse from there. Also, take each letter in ""HAL"" and advance it one letter up in the alphabet.
AI
How can you possibly have a list of Artificial Intelligence movies and not include AI? You can't! In this Pinocchio-like story, an AI robot called David is brought in as a temporary substitute for a comatose child. Unfortunately, the results are rather downbeat. However, the movie represents an attempt by people to use AI to fill in a role generally associated with a natural person (e.g., a child). And of course, David wants to be an actual human, a desire that gives rise to whether Artificial Intelligence could someday evolve to the point that it has desires and goals.
Blade Runner
Did someone mention a classic AI movie earlier? Blade Runner, an adaptation of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick’s short story “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?”, deals with replicants, AI-powered bio-engineered copies of humans. The Artificial Intelligence movie does an admirable job of blurring the line between being human and being an artificial life form, causing the audience to rethink perhaps their ideas on personhood and the morality of how we should treat artificial life.
Chappie
Set in a dystopian future, this AI movie explores what happens when a castoff, damaged police robot is given Artificial Intelligence to such a degree that the titular character forms its own opinions and has emotions. Of course, today's AI learns by interacting with its surroundings, and that's exactly what happens to Chappie, although granted, it's at a much higher level. Still, the movie shows how AI can learn by itself while also exploring ethical issues.
Ex Machina
This Artificial Intelligence movie makes the audience tackle whether AI can be inclined towards good or evil. A programmer, Caleb, wins a one-week visit to the home of his company's genius CEO (Nathan). Once there, Caleb is given a chance to experiment with Nathan's latest creation; an AI named Ava. The movie takes us to some dark places, but it makes people ponder the ethics and morality of performing tests on self-aware life, even if that life was artificially made.

Her
Artificially intelligent operating systems or virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Bixby can make our lives easier and better organized, but what if the technology became so sophisticated that you could even fall in love with it? That's the premise of Her, where a lonely man falls in love with an incredibly sophisticated AI system called Samantha. Her is an interesting AI movie because it revolves around technology already in use; it just happens to be a more advanced model. Her also touches upon how people are increasingly relying on AI
I, Robot
Today, some people fear concepts like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, believing that machines could take over the world one day. This AI movie speaks to those fears, as a supercomputer called VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) turns bad and decides that humans need to be controlled before they do themselves in. The movie is set in another dystopian world, where robots have replaced humans in many public service jobs. Driverless cars, anyone?
Interstellar
This film deviates from the pattern shown thus far on the list. Artificial Intelligence is not the central character but rather represented by two robots called CASE and TARS that help the crew of the Endurance. However, unlike other robots portrayed in science fiction, this pair in no way resembles humanoids. This configuration speaks to the idea of function over form, a possible design strategy for future AI
Moon
Take HAL from 2001 and make him a lot less violent. In this Artificial Intelligence movie, you have GERTY, the AI that helps maintain the lunar base. It also provides Sam Bell, the protagonist and sole crew member, with company. GERTY represents A.I,'s potential as both a resource for operating a facility and a source of comfort and camaraderie.
Robocop
No one would blame you for arching a skeptical eyebrow if someone told you that Robocop contains some deep meaning and thoughts about the morality of AI, and yet here we are. Sure, the AI movie is big, dumb fun. Still, it also touches upon the dangers of weaponizing AI and raises questions about who is creating the programming and what parameters they are employing?

Star Trek: The Next Generation
You just know that Star Trek had to appear on this list somewhere, right? We’re deviating from the “movie” format and throwing a spotlight on one episode of ST:TNG in particular. It’s called “The Measure of a Man,” season two, episode nine, and it’s a magnificent treatment of the moral questions around AI In a nutshell, a Starfleet officer wants to take Commander Data, the super-intelligent android, and disassemble him for study. Data refuses, and the officer insists, saying the android is property of Starfleet. What follows is a trial to determine Data’s fate, and it covers areas like personhood and the ethics and rights of artificial intelligence. ""The Measure of a Man"" is episode nine of season two of Star Trek: The Next Generation and is highly recommended.
Star Wars
And if we are talking about Star Trek, it stands to reason that we need to mention Star Wars and its unique addition to the AI field, astromech droid R2-D2, and human relations cyborg C3-PO. These droids have sophisticated artificial intelligence as well as emotions. However, they and other droids are often treated as servants or inferiors, even as pets. Don't forget that C3-PO often referred to Luke Skywalker as ""Master Luke."" How will society treat sophisticated AI in the future?
The Matrix
Set in a world where artificial intelligence now controls everything, this classic AI movie explores the nature of constructed (virtual) reality. The Matrix touches upon the fear of machines taking over and using us to keep them running.
The Terminator
Here's another dystopian classic. This time, the artificial intelligence is Skynet, an AI designed to automate missile defense that became self-aware on August 29, 1997, and triggered World War III. And, of course, Skynet also creates a cyborg assassin to go back in time, the titular Terminator. This AI movie's main takeaway is that you should design an AI that's reliable and definitely include an ""off"" switch!
WALL-E
Okay, time to lighten things up a little with something more family-oriented and upbeat. However, the movie does embrace a dystopian tone. Earth is filled with garbage, and humanity now lives on giant spaceships and has really let itself go. Machines do all the work, and humans sit there like slugs. However, WALL-E itself (himself?) is the perfect example of an Artificial Narrow Intelligence that exists even today. An A.N.I. is an intelligent system that does one thing exceptionally well, and in WALL-E's case, it's cleaning up garbage. The movie also shows AI as something that eventually saves humanity rather than exercising world domination, creating time-traveling killer cyborgs, or refusing to open the pod bay doors.

Westworld
Let's end the list by returning to killer robots. This entry isn't about the HBO series but the AI movie released in 1973, which eventually inspired the cable show. The film deals with the titular Westworld, an adult theme park dedicated to the Western genre and staffed by robots that help customers live out their fantasies. So, naturally, things go sideways, and the robots rebel against their human masters. The film shows how AI could be used in a deep-dive, immersive entertainment capacity and provides us a cautionary tale of the ethical implications of manipulating AI for our amusement.

When it comes to modernising government agencies, machine learning and artificial intelligence – or AI – provide a range of exciting opportunities. AI can make predictions about potential non-compliance and decide on the optimal response. From a service perspective, it can identify what people need and help them get the right information, the right service and the right support. 
“This can have a profound impact on people’s lives – we’re talking anything from greater convenience to literally life-changing support,” says Darren Menachemson, chief for digital societies and chief ethicist with ThinkPlace.
Despite Menachemson explaining the applications for AI-augmented regulation and servicing are “almost endless”, the technology is not being used to its full potential. “In truth, most implementations of ‘AI’ are not being driven by machine learning,” he says. “Instead, they are just sophisticated applications of more traditional analytics.”
The exception is the Department of Defence. An AusTender keyword search for “artificial intelligence” shows a range of investments in research and development of AI applications since 2015 – including research into AI algorithm assurance, AI and ethics, and a range of proof of concept projects in partnerships with research institutions and industry partners. 
In addition, programs have been established for further partnerships and investment in AI, including the Next Generation Technologies Fund, Defence Artificial Intelligence Research Network and Centre for Advanced Defence Research and Enterprise.
“Artificial intelligence is a key technology enabler for Defence and society at large,” a Defence spokesperson explains. “To effectively harness AI, we need to ensure we pick the right tool for the job at any given instance. “This forms a body of work in itself that Defence is seeking to solve. How do we create an AI that is able to appropriately select the right approach to solve a problem that it faces?”


In addition to using AI within autonomous systems, Defence is researching AI to assist in planning, interpretation of remotely sensed data and other ways to use it within the cyber domain. “We’re also looking at ways that we can accelerate AI uptake, including software frameworks to scale algorithmic development.”
For partners, including industry, Defence is seen as the place to be for research and investment in AI.


“We definitely see Defence as being one of the leaders in AI in the nation,” says Zygmunt Szpak, executive director of Insight via Artificial Intelligence. “Part of the reason for this is that Defence understands that adversaries are doing something in the space, and the nature of Defence is you have to be on top of the latest stuff. Otherwise, you just can’t defend yourself. 
“That’s one of the reasons why we find that a lot of our interesting work is with Defence.” 
Is the Defence investment in AI transferable?
The defence context for AI is “far more austere and challenged” than in other areas in the public sector, Defence says. Its approaches need to operate in environments subject to deliberate adversarial action. But despite this, knowledge gained through Defence research could transfer to other areas of the public sector. 
“Cyber is a great example,” Szpak says. “This is an area of AI Defence is pushing the envelope on and can quite easily be applied in an industry context.” 
Work on explainable AI systems, which better integrate machine learning with human insights and interpretation, is another area with a wider impact on the public sector and industry.
“Organisations will be able to look at key algorithms developed in Defence to port and deploy them in a different space,” says Szpak. “You’re never going to get a particular product, but that knowledge is transferable.” 
But the reverse wouldn’t be true. 
“As these challenges are almost unique to the Defence context, we can be considered a leader in the innovation, science and technology development associated with dealing with these types of challenges,” Defence says. 
“Additional robustness and resilience come with a cost, meaning that the approaches developed to operate in such challenged environments may not be optimal when challenges aren’t present.”
What agencies can learn from Defence
For the public sector, learning about AI from Defence can be a challenge – after all, they operate in a highly classified environment. Having a foot in the door with Defence also helps, with communities of practice providing forums to discuss research.
“There’s a community of interest in Defence around machine learning and AI that I provided a talk to,” Szpak says. “As part of that group, there were some people from other public sector agencies. That tells me that already there is some kind of transfer of knowledge happening between researchers in different parts of the public sector.”
Attending workshops on artificial intelligence hosted by experts working with Defence, such as Szpak, can also help agencies gain the full potential of AI for their operations. Defence is keen to be more open with insights and be seen as a public sector leader, with conferences a key forum for collaboration.
In July, the Defence Science and Technology Group held the Australian Defence Science, Technology and Research Summit, which featured AI as one of three tracks. And a range of AI experimentation programs, including the Army’s Robotics and Autonomous Systems Implementation and Coordination Office, Air Force’s Jericho and Navy’s Warfare Innovation Navy Branch, are all promoting their work publicly.
With expertise in the application of AI, Defence has some key insights to support its successful implementation within any agency.
“To succeed at harnessing AI, the required capabilities include not only access to sufficient computer resources but also people who understand the current technology offerings and ensure it is only applied to the type of problem appropriate for that technology’s maturity,” says a Defence spokesperson. 
“Understanding these limitations also assists in identifying areas in which innovation is required to advance AI, helping to produce more robust solutions. Defence has an AI Centre, which serves in this capacity across the department.”

President Biden on Oct. 17 signed into law the Artificial Intelligence Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act, which aims to improve the Federal workforce’s understanding of AI and ensure its ethical and safe use.
The legislation – introduced by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, in July 2021 – will create a training program to help Federal employees responsible for purchasing AI technologies better understand its risks and benefits.
The law requires the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide and regularly update the AI training program. It also encourages the OMB director to work with scholars and experts from the public and private sectors to develop the training.
“When the government purchases AI to improve government functions, we need to know that the AI we buy actually works and meets standards for ethics and safety,” Sen. Portman said in a statement. “That’s why I’m pleased the bipartisan AI Training Act has been signed into law. This law will train our procurement professionals about the ins and outs of AI so they can discern which AI systems are useful to the government and which are not.”
The Senate passed the legislation in December 2021. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., led the bill through the House, which passed it on Sept. 29, 2022.

“If used improperly, artificial intelligence could present a serious threat to the rights and liberties of Michiganders and people across the country. That is why the Federal workforce must better understand how these technologies could impact the safety, security, and freedoms of all Americans,” Sen. Peters said in a statement. “Now that this commonsense, bipartisan legislation has been signed into law, Federal workers will be better prepared to use this technology in a way that is ethical and consistent with our nation’s values.”
The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has recommended AI training for the Federal workforce, especially those who procure and manage these technologies.
The law will also help ensure the United States maintains a global leadership role in emerging technologies, as competitors such as China continue to invest in AI, its backers say.
“While emerging artificial intelligence technologies offer promising benefits for our Federal workforce, they also come with serious risks. It is more important now than ever to ensure our Federal workforce is prepared to manage these complicated systems,” said Rep. Maloney. “I’m grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who voted in favor of safeguarding civil rights and civil liberties while ensuring the Federal government can modernize with state-of-the-art technology.”

The measure is meant to ensure that feds understand the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence.






                  Congress
                












































President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill to create an artificial intelligence training program for acquisition workforce into law on Monday. The proposal, called the AI Training Act, cleared the Senate in late 2021 after being introduced by the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio). The bill passed the House in September and was sponsored by the chair and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and James Comer (R-Ky.).""This commonsense, bipartisan legislation will train our federal workforce to better understand this technology, and ensure that it is used ethically and in a way that is consistent with our nation's values,"" said Sen. Peters in a statement when the bill cleared the House.Now, the Office of Management and Budget is required to set up the training program, meant to ensure that federal employees know both the privacy and discrimination risks of AI, as well as the potential benefits of its use for the government. The training is meant for employees charged with program management, procurement and more.""When the government purchases AI to improve government functions, we need to know that the AI we buy actually works and meets standards for ethics and safety,"" said Sen. Portman. Portman and Peters say that the bill also falls in line with recommendations for more AI training from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which was chartered by Congress in the fiscal year 2019 defense policy bill.

MacArthur FoundationYour browser does not support the audio element.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThe John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation recently announced the names of 25 people who won an annual fellowship. The highly selective and prestigious award, which has also been described as a “genius grant,” comes with a no-strings-attached stipend of $800,000, which the foundation describes as “an investment in their potential.” The fellowships are given each year to a diverse array of artists, academics, activists and other pioneers in their fields. Yejin Choi is a 2022 MacArthur Fellow and a computer science professor at the University of Washington. She joins us to talk to us about her efforts to make artificial intelligence capable of common sense reasoning, ethical decision-making and recognizing intent behind the human language.The following transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer:Dave Miller: This is Think Out Loud on OPB, I’m Dave Miller. We end today with a newly minted Macarthur Award winner from the University of Washington. Yejin Choi  is a Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at U. Dub. She received the so-called ‘Genius Grant’ for her work that pushes the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence. She’s trying to teach A-Is to be able to use common sense reasoning, identify information that’s not trustworthy and even make ethical judgments. Yejin Choi joins us to talk about her work. Congratulations and welcome.Yejin Choi: Thank you.Miller: What does ‘common sense reasoning’ mean in the context of Artificial Intelligence?Choi: It broadly refers to what’s easy for humans, everyday knowledge about how the world works, that is strikingly hard for A-I.Miller: What’s an example of something that I can do without quotes ‘thinking about it,’ but that would be hard to get an A-I to do?Choi: In general it’s about obvious knowledge that you and I don’t talk about. For example, a horse has two eyes, not three or four, but we don’t talk about it. So then, if you ask that kind of a question, A-I can struggle.Miller: Is this a question of just not having powerful enough computers, even given how amazingly powerful computers are compared to what they were, say, 20 years ago, or is the problem deeper than that?Choi: Deeper than that – because the computers are more powerful, we do now have some hope that we might be able to investigate this problem. But the actual challenge is very, very deep.Miller: What makes it challenging?Choi: So there’s a fundamental difference between how humans learn about the world, by learning the actual concepts, what it means to…you know, let’s make an example of, for example, an apple, a fruit apple. You know, like, we can eat it, it’s crunchy if you bite into it and it’s just somewhat hard, but not hard enough to sustain a lot of weight.  So we know all of these things and so, say, you’re driving a car and then you see an apple on the ground and then you know that it’s okay to drive over it. But it’s not as okay if you see a sharp metallic object on the ground, but these things may not be written down or spoken out loud by human system-error,  and machines tend to learn by just reading lots of internet data, which, if they have not talked about it, then A-I doesn’t know what to do about it.Miller: So how so what is the challenge in front of you in terms of how do you teach an AI, that’s so literal in so many ways and everything it learns I guess, in the past, it had to be explicitly taught- how do you get it to soak up lost knowledge and knit different pieces of knowledge together and make inferences and do the stuff that humans do without effort?Choi: If we think about how humans learn, we do learn from diverse modes of learning. So we don’t learn only from internet data. In fact, if you imagine having a child to only learn from internet data, I don’t think it would be actually successful in many ways. So we do learn by reading books, reading textbooks in particular, and we do learn by asking questions, especially when a child is learning about new objects. They do ask a lot about what is this, why is this? And so we’re mimicking that sort of exchange of knowledge through declarative form and see how far we can reach.Miller: How far have you gotten in terms of creating an A-I that’s more capable of common sense reasoning?Choi: We’ve made a lot of progress but it’s still far from how robust humans are when it comes to common sense reasoning. But now for example, if we teach machines about X repelling Y’s attack, and then we tell machine that then maybe access the kind of person who’s brave and strong in order to be able to repel Y’s attack as opposed to run away. So we teach that as an example and then ask machine, how about repelling someone’s attack in a chess game? Now it’s a very different situation, it’s intellectual combat. So then machine extrapolates out of the original fist fight context to intellectual fight and say, ‘Oh X might be seen as someone competitive and smart.’ We made that much of the progress.Miller: So the computer could recognize the different contexts and repelling an attack from somebody who’s physically fighting you- it recognizes that’s different than winning at a chess game.Choi: Yeah. So it does recognize that there’s some analogical similarity, but I wouldn’t say that it’s super reliable for all the corner cases. And the thing about life is that it’s full of corner cases that humans are very good at just dealing with.Miller:  ‘Corner cases,’ meaning ‘complicated situations?’Choi: It could be complicated, it could be just obvious corner cases, trivial corner cases. What I mean, so, for example, why would there be an apple on the road when you drive? I mean how often do you actually encounter an apple when you drive? It might have been zero.[Dave Miller, laughing]THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorMiller: Sure. But it’s not unusual for them to be unusual objects, right – I mean like we regularly see stuff that shouldn’t be there. But you’re saying we’re just used to it as humans?Choi: Yeah. And we are ready for a lot of them. We almost always know what to do with them. Say, even if you don’t know what it is, you still know what the common sense reaction should be? Maybe avoid it if possible.Miller: Right. And I guess in the kind of binary question, ‘Do we avoid it or not?’ Can we squash the banana or the apple, or do we avoid the rock that will break our oil pan?Choi: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.Miller: So what are the, what are the potential applications for an A-I that’s more capable of common sense reasoning, setting aside questions of say, an autonomous vehicle that literally could have to make the decision of whether or not to swerve away from an apple. What other real life examples could be really important?Choi: For example, we now have home devices that can speak in natural language and interact with natural language and ask questions, answer questions. And so there was one incident not so long ago, a home device, suggesting a child to touch an electronic socket using a metal coin. That’s just such a bad idea, common sense-wise. Fortunately, the child did have a common sense that it’s a stupid thing to do. But you know, even the conversational A-I systems need this in order to avoid harmful conversations.Miller: How far along are A-Is right now in being able to understand sarcasm. Because, to me, that’s a kind of a language version of the apple in the road. It’s not exactly what it would seem to be.Choi: Yeah. So understanding figurative language, if that figurative language is what a lot of people do use in a very predictable context, then it will have a chance to understand it. If it’s a different kind then it might have a harder time.Miller: As I noted, you’re also working to make Artificial Intelligence capable of certain kinds of ethical decision making. What’s an example of what you’ve been working on?Choi: So surprisingly a lot of everyday decision making has moral implications, even including, you know, not suggesting a child to touch the electronic socket using a metal coin, because if you do, there’s moral consequences.Miller: There’s moral consequences for swerving out of the way of an apple and driving into oncoming traffic as well.Choi: Yeah, that too. So a lot of our seemingly trivial action decisions that we make about everyday actions actually do have moral implications. So the more A-I interacts with humans the closer they interact, it’s unavoidable that it’s going to encounter situations in which the decisions will have some kind of ethical moral implications.Miller: What are you interested in working with, in terms of ethical or moral questions, yourself?Choi: First of all, obvious cases don’t suggest a child to do dangerous things, that I think a lot of people would just agree. Also AI being aware of the questions where people tend to disagree, AI shouldn’t side with just one opinion in those cases, but rather be aware that it’s something that humans are having disagreements about. This includes even the cultural norms – different cultures have different standards, and that’s okay.Miller: When you started your work, especially in trying to push forward with ‘common sense’ reasoning in artificial intelligence, what were the kinds of responses you got from fellow computer scientists?Choi: So, ‘common sense’ was a very hot topic at the beginning of A-I field, which is in the 70s and 80s, and there was a major, I guess, failure – after a while, nothing really worked well. So they then decided that, okay, this is too hard and we will never be able to do this. So don’t work on it, period. And then I thought about it for a couple of years, and then I realized their conclusion is inconclusive when all that research was based on less compute, less data, no crowdsourcing, not the same kind of computational models that we have now. And also, it just seems like it’s inconclusive.Miller: This MacArthur Grant is a real explicit message from a panel of smart people that both, they’re impressed with the work you’ve already done, and they’re excited to see what you are going to do next. What does his grant mean to you?Choi: This was the last thing I expected in my life and I was genuinely at a loss for words, or I wasn’t sure what to think or what to say, for some time and I still cannot believe that it means that it’s okay to be ‘not perfect,’ it’s okay to still have to learn a lot and it’s okay to make mistakes along the way. But I shouldn’t give up.Miller: Yejin Choi, thanks very much and congratulations again.Choi: Thank you.Miller: Yejin Choi is a Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington and a 2022 MacArthur Foundation Fellow.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered HR technology threatens the life chances of hundreds of millions of people with disabilities worldwide, as well as those of us who will become disabled in time.


Eight of the 10 largest private U.S. employers use AI to track the productivity metrics of individual workers, many in real time, according to The New York Times. Yet even the NYT, when analyzing the risks to employees from disadvantaged backgrounds, in low paid jobs, failed to reference the threat to the millions of people in work whose interaction with the screen and camera is impacted by their disability and is therefore ‘not-standard’. While employers say “derelict workers” can be rooted out and industrious ones rewarded, no reference is made to how these productivity metrics should be adjusted to ensure disabled employees are assessed fairly. Susan Scott-Parker, a veteran disability inclusion campaigner and founder of the campaign Disability Ethical AI asks:

“What if the reason I don’t hit my key strike targets is my employer’s failure to give me a one-handed keyboard?”

Legal Challenge
PROMOTED
Surely, we already have the legal statutes required to challenge these inequities? The UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and most regulators, state that the obligation to make accommodations is triggered when the person makes the request. Yet time and time again automated requirement processes (including those that deploy AI) either do not permit the candidate to request adjustments; make it extremely difficult to do so; or make lodging the request stigmatising and embarrassing. Developers of AI HR technology are not incentivised to prove their products are safe for disabled job seekers or employees or indeed for anyone. Many providers state unequivocally that it is employers (not the AI software developer) who are legally (and they imply ethically) liable should a disabled job seeker complain they have been discriminated against.

The burden remains on individual disabled job seekers to prove they have been treated badly by an algorithm; an algorithm they didn’t even know was there. We all know job seekers rarely have the time or motivation to litigate when turned down for a job: we are a long way from the threat of legal risk genuinely influencing HR. So if not litigation, what could possibly persuade them that the risk this technology poses to the life chances of hundreds of millions (never mind the risk of losing out in the war for talent) outweighs the cost benefits to their recruiters?

Biased and Flawed
HR’s problem is much more than just the bias in the data – the science that developers claim underpins these tools all too often does not stand up to scrutiny. Recent research from New York University revealed that 2 tools used to predict your personality by analyzing the words you use in your resume and your LinkedIn profiles were, quite simply, not valid. As it turns out, your personality changes noticeably depending on if these tools rely on your resume or your LinkedIn profile.

Neither buyers nor AI developers understand the difference between the inevitable disability bias in the data and the discrimination triggered when the AI tool, which does not itself make adjustments, is dropped into a standardised, rigid, e-process, which by definition disadvantages candidates who require reasonable adjustments so as to compete on an equal basis. In other words “AI is the new flight of stairs” for the disabled candidate.

All big, predictive data sets rely on the notion of the statistical norm, what is known as the bell curve, from which we draw predictive correlations from averages. These are limited to serving the needs of around 67% of people who will score near average on whichever measurement taken and therefore the further away from any ‘norm’ you are, the less likely the AI will meet your need. Who decides what norms are taken, the extent to which your ‘category’ is present on the internet which feeds data into the AI learning, will determine your inclusion in an AI dominated world. This is dangerous for all minoritized groups.
Playing Catch Up
It is clear that we need to update our disability legislation to include digital discrimination, which includes HR based AI but also daily interactions which rely on memory, restrictive controls for making mistakes and more. Our technological capabilities have overtaken our human ethics and reasoning capacity. Scott-Parker tells the story of the person with Tourette’s who tried more than 100 times via emails, LinkedIn, telecalls, etc. to tell an employer that while he couldn’t hold the game controls for the recruitment assessment, he could do the job. She reports:
“We need legislation which creates an obligation to make it easy for candidates to request adjustments, effectively and in non-stigmatizing fashion, very early in the recruitment process. And what about our candidate with a facial disfigurement– he doesn’t need the employer to make any adjustments, he just needs the facial/ emotion recognition tech to not discard him when he looks into the camera. Some regulators are beginning to address the potential impact, positive and negative, of Artificial Intelligence on persons with disabilities. But their response is far from sufficient in a world where HR directors have not been taught that standardized automated recruitment processes discriminate against candidates with disabilities. And where existing disability discrimination legislation should and must apply but is proving so ineffectual. And where those leading the worldwide ‘Ethical and Responsible AI’ debate remain, for whatever reason, ‘disability oblivious’ or should that be ‘disability averse?’ What will it take to capture their attention?”
Four Key Takeaways
So if you are a developer or an HR AI buyer, here’s four key takeaways on hiring AI inclusion
(1) Take a pause before implementing any rigid system with no flexibility, for monitoring or hiring.
(2) Get in touch with a wide range of disabled people to consider the potential flaws from multiple perspectives.
(3) Assume there WILL be flaws and lend a hand ironing them out with pilot testing.
(4) Give everyone easy contact details if their disability prevents them from using the system, so that you can upgrade and improve, on the basis of feedback from the human beings trying (unsuccessfully) to navigate your systems.
The genie is out of the bottle as far as AI Tech is concerned, but we must not give up on our moral and legal principles of disability equality and inclusion.

Beyond Words: Large Language Models Expand AI’s Horizon


				The powerful models making waves in natural language processing are rippling across fields from healthcare to robotics and beyond.

  Back in 2018, BERT got people talking about how machine learning models were learning to read and speak. Today, large language models, or LLMs, are growing up fast, showing dexterity in all sorts of applications.
They’re, for one, speeding drug discovery, thanks to research from the Rostlab at Technical University of Munich, as well as work by a team from Harvard, Yale and New York University and others. In separate efforts, they applied LLMs to interpret the strings of amino acids that make up proteins, advancing our understanding of these building blocks of biology.
It’s one of many inroads LLMs are making in healthcare, robotics and other fields.
A Brief History of LLMs
Transformer models — neural networks, defined in 2017, that can learn context in sequential data — got LLMs started.
Researchers behind BERT and other transformer models made 2018 “a watershed moment” for natural language processing, a report on AI said at the end of that year. “Quite a few experts have claimed that the release of BERT marks a new era in NLP,” it added.
Developed by Google, BERT (aka Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) delivered state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks for NLP. In 2019, it announced BERT powers the company’s search engine.
Google released BERT as open-source software, spawning a family of follow-ons and setting off a race to build ever larger, more powerful LLMs.
For instance, Meta created an enhanced version called RoBERTa, released as open-source code in July 2017. For training, it used “an order of magnitude more data than BERT,” the paper said, and leapt ahead on NLP leaderboards. A scrum followed.
Scaling Parameters and Markets
For convenience, score is often kept by the number of an LLM’s parameters or weights, measures of the strength of a connection between two nodes in a neural network. BERT had 110 million, RoBERTa had 123 million, then BERT-Large weighed in at 354 million, setting a new record, but not for long.
As LLMs expanded into new applications, their size and computing requirements grew.
In 2020, researchers at OpenAI and Johns Hopkins University announced GPT-3, with a whopping 175 billion parameters, trained on a dataset with nearly a trillion words. It scored well on a slew of language tasks and even ciphered three-digit arithmetic.
“Language models have a wide range of beneficial applications for society,” the researchers wrote.
Experts Feel ‘Blown Away’
Within weeks, people were using GPT-3 to create poems, programs, songs, websites and more. Recently, GPT-3 even wrote an academic paper about itself.
“I just remember being kind of blown away by the things that it could do, for being just a language model,” said Percy Liang, a Stanford associate professor of computer science, speaking in a podcast.
GPT-3 helped motivate Stanford to create a center Liang now leads, exploring the implications of what it calls foundational models that can handle a wide variety of tasks well.
Toward Trillions of Parameters
Last year, NVIDIA announced the Megatron 530B LLM that can be trained for new domains and languages. It debuted with tools and services for training language models with trillions of parameters.
“Large language models have proven to be flexible and capable … able to answer deep domain questions without specialized training or supervision,” Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA, said at that time.
Making it even easier for users to adopt the powerful models, the NVIDIA Nemo LLM service debuted in September at GTC. It’s an NVIDIA-managed cloud service to adapt pretrained LLMs to perform specific tasks.
Transformers Transform Drug Discovery
The advances LLMs are making with proteins and chemical structures are also being applied to DNA.
Researchers aim to scale their work with NVIDIA BioNeMo, a software framework and cloud service to generate, predict and understand biomolecular data. Part of the NVIDIA Clara Discovery collection of frameworks, applications and AI models for drug discovery, it supports work in widely used protein, DNA and chemistry data formats.
NVIDIA BioNeMo features multiple pretrained AI models, including the MegaMolBART model, developed by NVIDIA and AstraZeneca.
In their paper on foundational models, Stanford researchers projected many uses for LLMs in healthcare.
LLMs Enhance Computer Vision
Transformers are also reshaping computer vision as powerful LLMs replace traditional convolutional AI models. For example, researchers at Meta AI and Dartmouth designed TimeSformer, an AI model that uses transformers to analyze video with state-of-the-art results.
Experts predict such models could spawn all sorts of new applications in computational photography, education and interactive experiences for mobile users.
In related work earlier this year, two companies released powerful AI models to generate images from text.
OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, a transformer model with 3.5 billion parameters designed to create realistic images from text descriptions. And recently, Stability AI, based in London, launched Stability Diffusion,
Writing Code, Controlling Robots
LLMs also help developers write software. Tabnine — a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that nurtures cutting-edge startups — claims it’s automating up to 30% of the code generated by a million developers.
Taking the next step, researchers are using transformer-based models to teach robots used in manufacturing, construction, autonomous driving and personal assistants.
For example, DeepMind developed Gato, an LLM that taught a robotic arm how to stack blocks. The 1.2-billion parameter model was trained on more than 600 distinct tasks so it could be useful in a variety of modes and environments, whether playing games or animating chatbots.
The Gato LLM can analyze robot actions and images as well as text.
“By scaling up and iterating on this same basic approach, we can build a useful general-purpose agent,” researchers said in a paper posted in May.
It’s another example of what the Stanford center in a July paper called a paradigm shift in AI. “Foundation models have only just begun to transform the way AI systems are built and deployed in the world,” it said.
Learn how companies around the world are implementing LLMs with NVIDIA Triton for many use cases.

What Is the Metaverse?
The Metaverse is a spatial computing platform that provides digital experiences as an alternative to or a replica of the real world, along with its key civilizational aspects like social interactions, currency, trade, economy, and property ownership – founded on a bedrock of blockchain technology.
Comparing the Metaverse to the internet in the 1970s and 1980s feels appropriate. Speculation about what it would look like and how people would use it arose as the foundation for the new communication form was laid. Although it was widely discussed, few people understood what it meant or how it would operate.
In retrospect, everything did not go precisely as some had hoped. It’s time to define this nebulous and complicated term, though, as the Metaverse is predicted to grow to be an $800 billion market by 2024. Tech titans like Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Google are investing heavily in making it a reality.
Metaverse is a mix of 3-dimensional worlds accessed through a browser, a mobile app, or a headset. It would allow people to have real-time interactions and experiences across large distances. A vast ecosystem of online applications will be the outcome.
The Metaverse is currently all the rage in the digital world because of its seemingly endless potential and objectives. Many investors are drawn to the Metaverse since it is at the cutting edge of technological and digital discoveries. It is an environment where the physical and digital worlds can coexist and significantly impact fundamental areas of daily life.
In essence, it is a universe of limitless, interconnected virtual communities where people can socialize, collaborate, and have fun using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps, and other technologies. It will also include additional aspects of online life, such as social media and shopping.
As application scenarios mature, the Metaverse will develop into an exceptionally large-scale, extremely open, and dynamically optimized system. To create a system that can support various virtual reality application scenarios, creators from different fields will work together.
Understanding the seven layers of the Metaverse
Entrepreneur and author, Jon Radoff, has suggested that the Metaverse comprises seven distinct layers, with each layer influencing one aspect of the user experience:

Experience: Physicality’s limitations will be removed as physical space is dematerialized in the digital world. The Metaverse will provide people with a wide range of experiences we cannot currently enjoy.
Discovery: Through app shops, search engines, and rating websites, customers can learn about new platforms thanks to this layer. Finding new technology and communities requires this crucial step.
Creator economy: To produce digital assets or experiences, developers use various design tools and apps. Numerous platforms are developing more straightforward creative methods over time, for example, drag-and-drop tools.
Spatial computing: It blends mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). Over time, it has developed into a significant technology category that enables users to interact with 3D environments for enhanced experiences.
Decentralization: There won’t be a single authority that rules the Metaverse. Scalable ecosystems will support business owners in providing a more comprehensive range of specialized digital items as the Metaverse expands, enabled by blockchain technology. 
Human interfacing: The hardware layer of the Metaverse must include human interfacing. Any virtual world can accept a person’s body as a 3D, realistic avatar.
Infrastructure: The technology that powers people’s gadgets, connects them to the network, and distributes content is part of the infrastructure layer. Over time, 5G networks will dramatically enhance the capacity of the Metaverse.

Examples of Metaverse platforms
To understand the meaning of the Metaverse, let us look at the leading platforms bringing this vision to life:

Decentraland: Decentraland is a blockchain-based virtual social environment. It’s used to build, trade, earn money, and explore virtual worlds. It’s essentially a digital ledger that permanently records bitcoin transactions across a network of computers and serves as the foundation for the universe of Decentraland. It provides exceptional opportunities for both studying and enjoying virtual experiences. Decentraland can be used to conduct meetings and trade in marketplaces for virtual goods, among other things. As in real life, interacting with other members is simple.
The Sandbox: It is a 3D virtual world hosted on the Ethereum blockchain where people may interact, build things, and make money. Numerous devices, including Windows phones and smartphones, are supported by Sandbox. With new virtual experiences, it provides people with chances for money-making. It is not inexpensive to use, though. To make this possible, SandBox has developed its SAND coin based on Ethereum. One can pay gas expenses on the Ethereum network can be paid with SAND tokens.
Bloktopia: Bloktopia uses virtual reality to provide users with an immersive experience. It is a 21-story virtual structure representing the 21 million Bitcoins currently in use. With new virtual experiences, it provides a variety of revenue-generating potential. People can design their avatars, participate in numerous activities, learn about cryptocurrencies, and purchase virtual “real estate” in the tower. Using the platform’s builder tool, you can also utilize this real estate to make artwork, games, sequences, and other things.
Meta Horizon Worlds: Users can socialize, have business meetings, explore the virtual environment, participate in virtual activities, and play games on Horizon Worlds. One of Meta’s VR social apps is Horizon Worlds. In the Horizon universe, blockchain technology is not utilized. It features functional VR building blocks, such as code blocks, music, and animation effects, that aid content developers in addition to navigable VR settings. As a test platform for virtual explorers with an invite-only policy, Facebook (now Meta Platforms Inc.) first debuted Horizons in August 2020.
Metahero: The Metahero project offers practical technology that lets users scan actual objects and move them into the Metaverse rather than a virtual realm. It focuses on bringing physical artifacts into the digital world utilizing ultra-HD photogrammetric scanning technologies. With their 3D avatars, users can use Metahero as a portal to explore the NFT, social media, fashion, and other aspects of the Metaverse. Metahero creates ultrahigh-definition avatars from real-world things, including people.

Features of the Metaverse
The working of the Metaverse is based on the following key features:
1. Incorporation of avatars
Creating digital avatars of oneself as a way to express one’s emotions and feelings uniquely is one of the core concepts of the Metaverse. Each person has their own digital identity, which can be static or animated and is distinctive to them. Digital avatars are a unique way to express oneself since, in addition to being precise reproductions of your actual form, they may also be recreations of your favorite celebrities or something completely original.
The concept of gamification is introduced when users have the chance to modify their avatars, creating a more engaging and dynamic experience.
Avatars can frequently be altered and can resemble their users’ real-life counterparts in some way. Avatars can occasionally also be computer applications. With the help of keyboards, joysticks, mice and specialized human-computer interfacing (HCI) devices, users may operate their avatars. More lifelike avatars might give viewers or anyone interacting with them a more immersive experience.
2. Blockchain-based operations
Blockchain allows consumers to safeguard their virtual assets and gives them digital proof of ownership, making it a crucial component of the Metaverse. The Metaverse is experiencing a growth in data volume, value, and significance of security and dependability. Blockchain skills and technology are necessary to ensure data validity in the Metaverse, and artificial intelligence is employed to protect its diversity and wealth of material.
Due to the numerous drawbacks of centralized data storage in systems like database management systems (DBMS), the Metaverse concept is incomplete without blockchain. Without the influence of a centralized organization, the blockchain-based Metaverse enables access to any digital place.
3. The use of virtual land (parcels)
The demand for virtual land on the Metaverse is soaring. On the Metaverse, land can be purchased by anybody for cryptocurrencies. The land is a non-fungible token (NFT), a blockchain asset class that one cannot trade for other things. Size refers to the fundamental number of pixels in a plot of Metaverse real estate.
Digital storefronts, virtual gaming, or even entertainment can be interacted with on virtual land. Its size and location will determine the use cases for the land. For instance, plots near a VR street may be worthwhile because of the potential for display advertisements.
4. Immersive Experiences (AR and VR)
Participants in the Metaverse will be able to have more immersive experiences that converge reality and the virtual world by utilizing mixed reality and AR/VR technologies. It is simple to understand why the Metaverse is becoming increasingly popular with each passing day: this will bring games to life, concerts and plays, and professional or educational encounters to seem more authentic.
The main building blocks of Metaverse projects are AR and VR. Three key components are required for augmented reality systems to function: the connectivity of actual and virtual environments, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D object rendering.
5. Intersection with artificial intelligence (AI)
As the driving force behind corporate research in fields including content analysis, self-supervised speech processing, robotic interactions, computer vision, and whole-body posture estimation, AI is crucial to the Metaverse. 
The business applications of the Metaverse can be delivered using AI in several different ways. AIOps, a subfield of AI, employs machine learning to assist companies in managing their IT infrastructure – which will soon apply to Metaverse systems. Further, AI-powered chatbots are becoming more and more common among organizations. In the Metaverse, AI bots with lifelike avatars can be employed for various purposes, including sales, marketing, and customer support.
6. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for governance
A DAO is a governance body – like a council or a committee – that uses blockchain and smart contracts to reach a consensus for various decisions. According to DAO governance guidelines, the Treasury Wallet offers money for farming across several networks. To ensure that everyone in the organization has the opportunity to participate in the governance process, all decisions in DAOs continue to be governed by proposals and voting processes. The procedure is vital for assisting participants in casting ballots on significant decisions on managing Metaverse resources.
7. Reliance on Human-Computer Interface (HCI) technology
The massive online computer platform known as Metaverse comprises many diverse platforms, devices, and individual users on a big scale. The use of HCI in creating the Metaverse — specifically, how to integrate user activities into the virtual world — is crucial to attaining this objective.
In order to take part in specific activities, a human and a computer exchange information through a process called HCI. The most crucial benefit of human-computer interaction is that it aids groups needing formal training and information on how to connect with computing systems. 
8. A focus on social interactions
Humans communicate and interact in the Metaverse through avatars and visual representations of a user. Users can engage and converse both with the Metaverse and with other users. The setting for these exchanges is cyberspace, which serves as a representation of the real world.
But there are differences between the economic and physical limitations of actual locations. One can imagine our physical experiences in the real world merging into one virtual environment. People shall be able to navigate the limitless world with the aid of this holistic experience that will combine all of these disparate encounters.
9. Supporting Web3
The idea behind Web3 is to usher in a new era of the internet. It is the progression of user ownership and control over their online material, digital assets, and online personas. Web3 and the Metaverse technologies work in perfect harmony with one another. Web3 may provide the foundation for connectivity in the Metaverse because the Metaverse is a virtual environment and prefers a decentralized web.

Importance of the Metaverse
The Metaverse is not only an emerging new technology that’s part of today’s hype cycle. It builds on years of research on artificial intelligence and immersive interactivity and will transform businesses in several ways.
1. It is a new technique for interacting with users
You may leverage the Metaverse to your advantage as a company to provide customers with a whole new level of immersive experiences and entertainment options. Competitive advantage and attention will come to your business if it is one of the first to provide clients with a Metaverse experience.
There are several ways to promote your company in the Metaverse, including branded gaming experiences, virtual items, and AR/VR showrooms. Businesses may use the Metaverse to build 3D marketing experiences that are immersive, engaging, and capture the attention of potential customers in new, embracing ways.
2. Businesses can find opportunities for virtual events
It’s not uncommon to plan a conference or live event that can be viewed online and in person. Many people cannot travel to attend a professional conference or lecture, but that is still no excuse for not learning more. In contrast to a straightforward Zoom or Google Meet stream, a conference in the Metaverse can be a fully-fledged VR experience, with appropriate networking and participation opportunities, rather than just another video in a small window with comments underneath it. The spectators will feel more present and immersed in the experience thanks to VR and the Metaverse.
3. Companies can advertise and sell their goods
Several firms are already actively utilizing augmented reality to allow consumers to virtually try clothing or eyewear, see how new furniture might fit in their space, or receive a makeover with new hair or cosmetics. In the Metaverse, there is the potential to have the same experiences but in a better way.
If you have the option to lease or purchase commercial property, you can put up shops and showrooms where users can view your goods in the Metaverse. Users still avidly purchase virtual clothing and accessories today, proving that digital fashion is having a moment.
4. The Metaverse introduces a new media of advertising
Brands can engage with a massive global audience through Metaverse platforms in an e-commerce business. Businesses should anticipate introducing novel techniques for brand storytelling and general advertising in the Metaverse. Storytelling is one of the most effective methods for increasing brand awareness and identification.
People enjoy hearing tales that reveal much more about the business and its beliefs than simple slogans. Storytelling will eventually change into “story living,” when the audience members become active players or even characters with a say in the events rather than just being passive listeners.
5. It is possible to Improve teamwork and the creation of processes
Online meetings and distant teamwork are the new realities we have all come to terms with. These methods were imposed upon us, but they proved equally effective in a face-to-face office setting. One may further improve workflows by using the Metaverse. Meetings will appear as a group of individuals sitting in a room rather than as Zoom calls.
Meta has already started offering VR workrooms. The Metaverse offers workers a digital environment for communication and the ability to read one another’s body language and emotions and maintain an emotional bond.
6. E-wallets and cryptocurrencies make transactions for businesses simpler
Cryptocurrencies and the Metaverse go hand in hand. It will be challenging to enjoy the benefits of the digital world without a crypto wallet, even at this early adoption stage. Digital wallets are also supported by Metaverse, allowing businesses to control transactions across their virtual ecosystem.
Although this concept may overwhelm some business users, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have more benefits than drawbacks. With cryptocurrency, users and businesses may conduct any online transaction more easily. There’s no need to link your bank account to virtual worlds, payments only require a few clicks, and all transactions are transparent.

Takeaway
The Metaverse will be among the key technologies to reshape the digital world in the next few years. A recent survey by technology company Ciena found that 78% of business users worldwide would be interested in leveraging the metaverse. That is why it is so crucial for enterprises to prepare for this technology, strengthen blockchain capabilities, safeguard against Metaverse and blockchain security risks, and embrace a new era of the internet.

The demo was greeted enthusiastically by the several hundred engineers in the audience, many of whom hoped to land a job with Tesla.“This means a future of abundance,” Musk proclaimed from the stage. “A future where there is no poverty. ... It really is a fundamental transformation of civilization as we know it.” Advertisement      We still don’t have a learning paradigm that allows machines to learn how the world works, like human and many non-human babies do.  — AI researcher Yann LeCun  Robotics experts watching remotely were less impressed. “Not mind-blowing” was the sober judgment of Christian Hubicki of Florida State University.Some AI experts were even less charitable. “The event was quite the dud,” Ben Shneiderman  of the University of Maryland told me.

To Shneiderman and others in the AI field, the Tesla demo embodied some of the worst qualities of AI hype; its reduction to humanoid characters, its exorbitant promises, its promotion by self-interested entrepreneurs and its suggestion that AI systems or devices can function autonomously, without human guidance, to achieve results that outmatch human capacities.“When news articles uncritically repeat PR statements, overuse images of robots, attribute agency to AI tools, or downplay their limitations, they mislead and misinform readers about the potential and limitations of AI,” Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan wrote in a checklist of AI reporting pitfalls posted online the very day of the Tesla demo. Advertisement    “When we talk about AI,” Kapoor says, “we tend to say things like ‘AI is doing X — artificial intelligence is grading your homework,’ for instance. We don’t talk about any other technology this way — we don’t say, ‘the truck is driving on the road’ or ‘a telescope is looking at a star.’ It’s illuminating to think about why we consider AI to be different from other tools. In reality, it’s just another tool for doing a task.”That is not how AI is commonly portrayed in the media or, indeed, in announcements by researchers and firms engaged in the field. There, the systems are described as having learned to read, to grade papers or to diagnose diseases at least as well as, or even better than, humans.         Business   Column: Crypto is melting down. Here’s who’s hurt  Crypto was always reliant on the ‘bigger fool’ theory, and it has found its marks.June 16, 2022  Kapoor believes that the reason some researchers may try to hide the human ingenuity behind their AI systems is that it’s easier to attract investors and publicity with claims of AI breakthroughs — in the same way that “dot-com” was a marketing draw around the year 2000 or “crypto” is today. What is typically left out of much AI reporting is that the machines’ successes apply in only limited cases, or that the evidence of their accomplishments is dubious. Some years ago, the education world was rocked by a study purporting to show that machine- and human-generated grades of a selection of student essays were similar. The claim was challenged by researchers who questioned its methodology and results, but not before headlines appeared in national newspapers such as: “Essay-Grading Software Offers Professors a Break.” One of the study’s leading critics, Les Perelman of MIT, subsequently built a system he dubbed the Basic Automatic B.S. Essay Language Generator, or Babel, with which he demonstrated that machine grading couldn’t tell the difference between gibberish and cogent writing. “The emperor has no clothes,” Perelman told the Chronicle of Higher Education at the time. “OK, maybe in 200 years the emperor will get clothes. ... But right now, the emperor doesn’t.”    Science & Medicine   Column: News of the first gene-edited babies shows that science can’t police itself  Just over a year ago, CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna of UC Berkeley talked with me about the prospects that the gene-editing technology she had helped develop might be used in violation of ethical boundaries. Dec. 7, 2018  A more recent claim was that AI systems “may be as effective as medical specialists at diagnosing disease,” as a CNN article asserted in 2019. The diagnostic system in question, according to the article, employed “algorithms, big data, and computing power to emulate human intelligence.” Those are buzzwords that promoted the false impression that the system actually did “emulate human intelligence,” Kapoor observed. Nor did the article make clear that the AI system’s purported success was seen in only a very narrow range of diseases.AI hype is not only a hazard to laypersons’ understanding of the field but poses the danger of undermining the field itself. One key to human-machine interaction is trust, but if people begin to see a field having overpromised and underdelivered, the route to public acceptance will only grow longer. Oversimplification of achievements in artificial intelligence evokes scenarios familiar from science fiction: futurescapes in which machines take over the world, reducing humans to enslaved drones or leaving them with nothing to do but laze around.A persistent fear is that AI-powered automation, supposedly cheaper and more efficient than humans, will put millions of people out of work. This concern was triggered in part by a 2013 Oxford University paper estimating that “future computerization” placed 47% of U.S. employment at risk. Shneiderman rejected this forecast in his book “Human Centered AI,” published in January. “Automation eliminates certain jobs, as it has ... from at least the time when Gutenberg’s printing presses put scribes out of work,” he wrote. “However, automation usually lowers costs and increases quality.... The expanded production, broader distribution channels, and novel products lead to increased employment.”         Technology and the Internet   From the Archives: Why Robert Taylor is one of the most important figures in the history of computer science  Since it’s so fashionable these days to question whether government can do anything right – whether it’s regulating banks, bolstering the economy or overseeing healthcare – it’s worth noting that we’re about to celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the most important federal initiatives of our time. Sept. 21, 2009  Technological innovations may render older occupations obsolete, according to a 2020 MIT report on the future of work, but also “bring new occupations to life, generate demands for new forms of expertise, and create opportunities for rewarding work.”A common feature of AI hype is the drawing of a straight line from an existing accomplishment to a limitless future in which all the problems in the way of further advancement are magically solved, and therefore success in reaching “human-level AI” is “just around the corner.”Yet “we still don’t have a learning paradigm that allows machines to learn how the world works, like human and many non-human babies do,” Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) and a professor of computer science at NYU, observed recently on Facebook. “The solution is not just around the corner. We have a number of obstacles to clear, and we don’t know how.” So how can readers and consumers avoid getting duped by AI hype?    Business   Who really benefits from putting high-tech gadgets in classrooms?  Who really benefits from putting high-tech gadgets in classrooms?Feb. 4, 2012  Beware of the “sleight of hand that asks readers to believe that something that takes the form of a human artifact is equivalent to that artifact,” counsels Emily Bender, a computational linguistics expert at the University of Washington. That includes claims that AI systems have written nonfiction, composed software or produced sophisticated legal documents. The system may have replicated those forms, but it doesn’t have access to the multitude of facts needed for nonfiction or the specifications that make a software program work or a document legally valid.Among the 18 pitfalls in AI reporting cited by Kapoor and Narayanan are the anthropomorphizing of AI tools through images of humanoid robots (including, sadly, the illustration accompanying this article) and descriptions that utilize human-like intellectual qualities such as “learning” or “seeing” — these tend to be simulations of human behavior, far from the real thing.Readers should beware of phrases such as “the magic of AI” or references to “superhuman” qualities, which “implies that an AI tool is doing something remarkable,” they write. “It hides how mundane the tasks are.”Shneiderman advises reporters and editors to take care to “clarify human initiative and control. ... Instead of suggesting that computers take actions on their own initiative, clarify that humans program the computers to take these actions.” It’s also important to be aware of the source of any exaggerated claims for AI. “When an article only or primarily has quotes from company spokespeople or researchers who built an AI tool,” Kapoor and Narayanan advise, “it is likely to be over-optimistic about the potential benefits of the tool.”The best defense is healthy skepticism. Artificial intelligence has progressed over recent decades, but it is still in its infancy, and claims for its applications in the modern world, much less into the future, are inescapably incomplete. To put it another way, no one knows where AI is heading. It’s theoretically possible that, as Musk claimed, humanoid robots may eventually bring about “a fundamental transformation of civilization as we know it.” But no one really knows when or if that utopia will arrive. Until then, the road will be pockmarked by hype.As Bender advised readers of an especially breathless article about a supposed AI advance: “Resist the urge to be impressed.”    Latest from Michael Hiltzik         Column: Who elected Elon Musk our arbiter of social norms?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. It involves the development of systems endowed with human intellectual characteristics, such as the ability to reason. In our 21st-century world, digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have taken center stage and are blazing the trail by changing the traditional way of doing business. Today with the aid of neural networks and intelligent algorithms, AI technology is replacing human thinking ability with machine control and is doing so with greater accuracy and precision, a development that was thought impossible a few years back. Let’s take a look at the role of AI and autonomous vehicles and how this technology will shape the future.
'It is expected that the combination of blockchain technology and self-driving cars will create a far better autonomous system.' -Jude ChukwudozieClick To Tweet
Autonomous Vehicle Benefits
The American computer scientist Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that by far the greatest danger about artificial intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it. In truth, most people don’t. For the record, AI and cars have a mutual history, and it was the dream of scientists to create intelligent machines that could think and act for themselves which gave birth to autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, which have turned out to become one of the best innovations of AI technology. Let’s dive into some of the benefits of these vehicles.
#1: Detection Algorithms
Autonomous vehicles have neural networks and specific algorithms. These are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Language (ML) based object detection algorithms. These serve to collect data, analyze objects, and make accurate decisions while on the road. These features also enable these intelligent machines to provide solutions to problems occurring in advance of real time by predicting events through the swift processing of data. 
For example, autonomous vehicles can predict a potential threat like a car collision ahead or behind and take a decision in real time to avert it. With good data collection sensors, these pieces of information are processed and results are obtained as actions. In addition to the neural network and specific algorithms, self-driving cars have five core components that help them optimize operation in real time, namely: computer vision, sensor fusion, localization, path planning, and control.  They also have an enhanced degree of AI perception technology for detecting pedestrians, vehicles, cyclists, and work and obstacles that are 300 yards away. These embedded algorithms help these automobiles to determine and suggest alternative routes based on real-time traffic conditions. Indeed, an amazing technology.
#2: Autopilots
Quite recently, Tesla manufactured electric cars that are self-driving and equipped with autopilots to enable automatic steering, accelerating braking, lane changing, and parking actions. Added to these features is the fact that these cars have the potential to reduce emissions globally, a milestone achievement from fuel-driven vehicles. Today, autonomous vehicles can be found in some of the biggest cities of the world. Even heavy-duty trucks without drivers that can deliver goods over long distances have been manufactured. This has not only reduced transportation costs significantly but also reduced the loss of human lives through accidents, much of which arise from human errors.
#3: AI-enhanced Features
In recent times, some automotive companies have manufactured autonomous vehicles with enhanced AI features like personal AI assistants, radar detectors, and cameras, all of which serve to prioritize security among other functions. These self-driving cars have implemented AI-enhanced features which are a huge advancement over their predecessors. Self-driving can learn about traits exhibited by the driver like driving speed, preferred car temperature, driving mood, observance of traffic signs, regular songs, or favorite radio stations. By rating driving skills, these autonomous vehicles have helped to change bad driving behaviors and habits.
Autonomous Vehicle Drawbacks
Though one of the most anticipated technologies in this century, AI and autonomous vehicles have been associated with a number of problems:

Autonomous vehicles are limited to more narrow situations and clearer weather. Just like the human eyes, sensors do not do well in fog, rain, or snow.
Autonomous vehicles rely on maps and sensors to function effectively. Unfortunately, these maps have limited test areas at the moment. Creating and maintaining maps for self-driving cars is a difficult and time-intensive process and one that is yet to happen. Its test areas will also need to be increased. In the U.S. for instance, detailed maps would have to be built and maintained across the 4 million miles of public road and this is no small task.
Tesla’s self-driving cars have raised certain safety concerns. In a certain L.A. Times editorial, they are said to be, “crossing double yellow lines and heading toward oncoming traffic, failing to stop for cars crossing the street and steering toward metal posts and roadside boulders.”
Autonomous vehicles controlled by AI robots cannot engage in complex social interactions with other drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. These situations require generalized intelligence and common sense to navigate, qualities that robots do not possess at the moment.
Tesla’s autopilot has a problem detecting flashing lights, road cones put in place for temporary road and traffic maintenance, and most emergency vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. Again, most of the crashes happen in the dark which points to an apparent flaw in the autopilot technology.
The working mechanism of smarter and more connected autonomous vehicles can suffer from cyber attacks which would disrupt their systems and operational processes. When this happens, commuter stress, delayed traffic flow, collisions, accidents, and even loss of human lives become inevitable.
Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), otherwise known as autopilot, accounts for a number of crashes and fatalities in the U.S. In most cases, it has been found to shut off around one second before the crash.

Path to the Future
In the crypto world, blockchain technology makes use of mathematical logic and algorithm to create an autonomous system that is both transparent and immutable. Here in the automotive world, it is expected that the combination of blockchain technology and self-driving cars will create a far better autonomous system that would increase the transparency and accuracy of decisions made by these cars.
Car tech giants are working hard to implement natural conversational AI within vehicles, which will utilize speech recognition, natural language understanding, speech synthesis, and smart avatars to boost comprehension of context, emotion, complex sentences, and user preferences. In the future, AI will be engaged in improving vehicle safety, performance, and efficiency, addressing health hazards and environmental issues. It could also be used to create cars that can communicate with each other and with other road users.

Job recruitment tools that claim to use artificial intelligence to avoid gender and racial biases may not improve diversity in hiring, and could actually perpetuate those prejudices, researchers with the University of Cambridge argued Sunday, casting the programs—which have drawn criticism in the past—as a way of using technology to offer a quick fix for a deeper problem.

Key Facts


In a paper published by Philosophy and Technology, researchers looked at claims from several companies that offer AI-powered recruitment tools, many of which claim to eliminate biases and promote diversity by hiding the names, genders and other identifiers of candidates, and some of which rank candidates based on resume scans, online assessments and analysis of applicants’ speech and facial expressions.



The researchers—two professors at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Gender Studies—argued that these tools may actually promote uniformity in hiring because they reproduce cultural biases of the “ideal candidate,” which has historically been white or European males.



The tools also might not improve diversity because they are based on past company data and thus may promote candidates who are most similar to current employees.



There is “little accountability for how these products are built or tested,” Eleanor Drage, a study co-author and researcher with the University of Cambridge Center for Gender Studies, said in a statement, adding the technology could serve as a “dangerous” source of “misinformation about how recruitment can be ‘de-biased’ and made fairer.”

“By claiming that racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination can be stripped away from the hiring process using artificial intelligence, these companies reduce race and gender down to insignificant data points, rather than systems of power that shape how we move through the world,” Drage said in a statement.
Tangent
Amazon announced in 2018 it would stop using an AI-recruiting tool to review job applicants’ resumes after it found the system was strongly discriminating against females. This is because the computer models it relied on were developed based on resumes submitted to the company over the past 10 years, which mostly came from male applicants.
PROMOTED
Key Background
Organizations have increasingly turned to AI to help manage job recruitment processes. In one 2020 poll of more than 300 human resources leaders cited by the authors of Sunday’s paper, the consulting firm Gartner found 86% of employers use virtual technology in their hiring practices, a trend that has accelerated since the Covid-19 pandemic forced many to shift work online. While some companies have argued AI can offer a more cost- and time-effective hiring process, some experts have found the systems have a tendency to promote—rather than eliminate—racial and gender biased hiring by replicating existing prejudices from the real world. Several U.S. lawmakers have aimed to tackle biases in artificial intelligence systems, as the technology continues to evolve quickly and few laws exist to regulate it. The White House this week released a “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,” which argues algorithms used in hiring have been found to “reflect and reproduce existing unwanted inequities” or embed new “bias and discrimination.” The blueprint—which isn’t legally binding or an official government policy—calls on companies to ensure AI does not discriminate or violate data privacy, and to make users aware of when the technology is being used.
What To Watch For
In a list of recommendations, the authors of Sunday’s Philosophy and Technology paper suggested companies that develop AI technologies focus on broader, systematic inequalities instead of “individualized instances of bias.” For instance, they suggest software developers examine the categories used to sort, process and categorize candidates and how these categories may promote discrimination by relying on certain assumptions about gender and race. Researchers also contend HR professionals should try to understand how AI recruitment tools work and what some of their potential limitations are.
Surprising Fact
The European Union has classified AI-powered hiring software and performance evaluation tools as “high risk” in its new draft legal framework on AI, meaning the tools would be subject to more scrutiny and would need to meet certain compliance requirements.

You may also be wondering what exactly that means. Let me explain what we are doing and why and what it means for our students, our faculty, our university and our state. Artificial intelligence is all around us — from Amazon’s predictions of products you might like to the facial recognition technology that unlocks your cell phone. Companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple are spending billions on artificial intelligence, but small companies need artificial intelligence, too, if they want to operate efficiently, effectively and maximize their impact.More:UF/IFAS uses high-tech methods to improve farming practices affecting springsAnother opinion:UF's new AI supercomputer will change how students learnYet, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence says the U.S. is woefully behind in training the next generation of AI personnel, the workforce that will ensure our national security and economic competitiveness. We must build an AI workforce quite quickly — by 2025, according to the commission. So, what are we doing at UF to train this generation of AI experts? Traditionally, people who are trained in artificial intelligence writ large — whether it’s machine learning or natural language processing — acquire their knowledge through computer science or engineering degrees. We’ve turned this model on its head. We’ve taken AI knowledge beyond those specialized environments and spread it across the entire university. AI pervades everything we do, from courses UF offers to research our faculty conduct to the university’s own business practices. A few examples. Students can earn certificates in artificial intelligence by taking three courses that cover fundamentals, ethics — an essential framework to ensure equitable and fair use of this technology — and a final course specific to their major. A student in the School of Architecture, for example, would take a course about the application of AI in the built environment. Beyond the certificate, we offer 230 courses in AI and data science, with more than 6,000 students currently engaged in these courses. This allows us to train many more students in artificial intelligence than we could ever do if we kept this knowledge siloed in a computer science department. It also allows students to learn about AI more easily because they are studying it within their major. We think this is a fantastic way to build the workforce of the future. But there is more. We’ve hired an additional 130 faculty who specialize in artificial intelligence across our institution — from the College of the Arts to the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.  Dr. Dwayne Mitchell from the College of Medicine, for instance, studies pediatric and adult brain cancers. As a world leader in clinical-translational research, his toolbox has gotten more powerful thanks to UF Health’s GatorTron, the world’s first natural language processing model designed to mine data from clinical notes, billions of words, at a speed humans can’t replicate. This allows researchers to reduce time needed to identify patients to enroll in trials from months to minutes. Faster trials means faster results and, ultimately, quicker paths to treatments and ways to improve lives. UF researchers are using AI in many other ways: To produce better tasting fruit, identify potential crop damage and create better tourism experiences. Now, we are not doing this work alone. We have partnerships with such companies as IBM, L3Harris, SAS and Vobile, which is opening an office in Gainesville in part because of UF’s focus on artificial intelligence. And we are working with state partners — the Florida Technology Council and the Florida High Tech Corridor. And we have an incredible partner in NVIDIA, which gifted us the fastest AI supercomputer at a higher education institution in the U.S. — HiPerGator AI. NVIDIA also created an AI technology center at UF, embedding its engineers among our faculty to assist their research work. We’ve shared this resource with the other 11 universities in the State University System, allowing them to use it for teaching and research. We’ve also partnered with FAMU, Miami-Dade College and Palm Beach State College to train their faculty so they can provide more AI courses for their students. We recognize that we cannot wait until students arrive on a college campus to start getting educated about AI. So, our faculty are also working with the Florida Department of Education to develop the nation’s first AI curriculum for public schools. AI is transforming Florida’s economy into one that is tech driven and high wage, and we want to part of that transformation as a leader and a partner. David Reed is the director of the Artificial Intelligence Academic Initiative Center at UF.Join the conversationLetters to the editor present the opinions of readers on news stories and other pieces published by The Sun. Share your opinions by sending a letter to the editor (up to 200 words) to letters@gainesville.com.

When discussing artificial intelligence, many people express concern about AI replacing humans in the workforce. Some jobs will undoubtedly be replaced, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

Early on, companies will apply AI to the work that humans either should not, will not or can not do, making the workplace safer and more efficient than ever before.

Here’s exactly what I mean:

PROMOTED
1. Jobs AI can do that humans should not
Industries like logging, oil rig work, metal foundries, electrical line repair, roofing, and chemical factories are the cause of 2.3 million workplace deaths, 160 million illnesses, and 340 million accidents worldwide, according to the International Labor Organization. This comes at a global cost of $2.8 trillion, and an incalculable personal cost to those who lose loved ones.
It doesn’t have to be this way. The most obvious ways that an AI augmented workforce can help involve automation and robotics like: welding, the application of toxic paints and adhesives, lifting, moving, and stacking heavy items and delivering goods with autonomous vehicles. Artificial intelligence technologies like computer vision and machine learning often enable machines to do these jobs as effectively as humans, without nearly as many safety concerns.

Looking deeper, AI can reduce workplace hazards even when humans execute the labor. Computer vision systems from companies like Intenseye and HGS monitor warehouses, factory floors, and other work environments to identify objects in the path of forklifts, unstable goods stacking, and even dangerous employee behavior like misuse of protective gear or execution of unauthorized work. Meanwhile, machine learning algorithms use data to predict when accidents are most likely to happen based on time of day, hours an employee has been working, age, experience, and a constellation of other factors too sophisticated for human supervisors to parse alone.

AI can even be used in training to proactively reduce accidents. Companies like Taqtile, Atheer, and Ario already use immersive technologies like VR and AR to prepare front line workers for difficult and dangerous roles. Consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton predicts that AI solutions like natural language processing, artificial neural networks, and deep learning will soon be used to accustom workers to random but realistic workplace hazards so that they will be better prepared if such unpredictable events occur on the job in real life.

2. Jobs AI can do that humans will not
How about jobs that humans simply prefer not to do? I am talking about repetitive, boring, and low-paying roles that employers find difficult to keep filled. Industries including agriculture, food service, durable goods manufacturing, and retail are facing an unprecedented labor shortage that some are predicting will last for decades.
AI-driven chatbots, perhaps one of the best-known labor shortage solutions out there, are at the tip of the spear. By removing the most tedious and predictable tasks from human customer service representatives, chatbots reduce not only the number of warm bodies needed at a call center, but also the fatigue and frustration that phone representatives feel answering the same mundane questions over and over again.
Likewise, machine learning in scheduling applications like those from Zira, Celayix, and Rotageek help allocate the right retail staff to the right locations at the right time, reducing inefficiencies and making the most of a thinly-stretched retail workforce. Hyper Food Robotics goes one further, with a completely autonomous fast food store that cuts human labor requirements down to virtually zero.
AI, together with robotics and automation, can play a crucial role in reviving American manufacturing despite the labor shortage. Canon’s 3D Machine Vision system, for example, uses AI to execute human-like fine motor skill activities. This also extends to food production: Carbon Robotics produces an autonomous weeding machine which uses computer vision to distinguish weeds from crops and destroys them with a precision laser.
3. Jobs AI can do that humans can not
There is one more area where AI in the workforce can add tremendous value—jobs for which human beings lack the time, ability or the mental acuity to do. Imagine examining millions of business transactions or job candidate resumes, for instance, to identify insights that correlate to success. That’s incredibly complex and time-consuming, and now—unnecessary.
AI-powered supply chain startups like Quantiful and Remi and LeanDNA can help manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers decide what products to order when, what new products to develop, how to position and price them, and what volume of demand they should expect, based on diverse data such as: historical sales, economic conditions, seasonal trends, and product lifecycle. Meanwhile, HR software vendors like Praisidio, Eightfold and Findem use AI to source, evaluate, interview, and retain employees.
The list goes on. Imagine analyzing thousands of customer accounts to identify and prevent fraud. Imagine designing industrial products with every possible machine stressor, environmental condition, and human error in mind. Or imagine trying to analyze the demographics and buying behavior of millions of consumers to discover micro markets and personalize marketing offers.
Whatever complex set of business conditions you can imagine, it is more likely than not that someone is working on an AI solution that can provide far more speed, accuracy, and nuance than any human could ever do alone.
There is a true groundswell of innovative AI workforce solutions coming to reshape the business landscape. Instead of worrying about AI replacing humans in the workforce, we should celebrate the potential of artificial intelligence to relieve us of undesirable work and empower us to do more meaningful work than we are capable of on our own.
If you care about how AI is determining the winners and losers in business, and how you can leverage AI for the benefit of your organization, I encourage you to stay tuned.

One of the earliest predictions about artificial intelligence was that robots would steal jobs from people, particularly for seemingly monotonous and menial tasks.
Case in point: Flippy 2, the “autonomous robotic kitchen assistant” developed by Miso Robotics to turn hamburgers as they cook. The restaurant chain CaliBurger is testing Flippy at various locations. But what the robot is best at doing isn’t what it was designed to do.

“[A CaliBurger franchise owner] said, ‘Flippy isn’t actually as good as I might have liked at flipping hamburgers, but it’s pretty good at pulling baskets of French fries out when they’re done,’” said Thomas Davenport, a digital fellow at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “We've known for a while that AI and robots might take the jobs of burger flippers — but it hasn't happened yet.”
Davenport’s new book, “Working With AI: Real Stories of Human-Machine Collaboration,” looks at 29 examples of humans working with AI-enabled systems, showing when and how AI works best and how companies can use AI responsibly. The book is co-authored by Singapore Management University professor Steven M. Miller.
The common theme is that AI is augmenting the work that humans do, not fully automating it. That means many jobs are safe, Davenport said during a recent webinar hosted by the MIT Sloan Management Review.
“One of our major conclusions is [augmentation] doesn’t appear to result in job loss,” Davenport said.
Davenport and Miller outlined how companies are implementing AI to the best advantage:
AI works best in “normal” conditions
Miller defined automation as a process in which a machine completes enough tasks that the human who was previously doing them is effectively displaced. Augmentation, on the other hand, is the automation of smaller tasks, not an entire job.
“The human stays involved in direct execution,” Miller said.
This distinction is important, and it helps to explain scenarios when organizations would look to use one or the other.
“AI is great at operating a machine under what we think of as normal conditions. Under expected circumstances, AI is really good at keeping things going,” Davenport said.
One example is looking for keywords in lengthy documents such as legal contracts or health records and producing results in seconds. Another is monitoring information from thousands or even millions of sources, whether sensors on a manufacturing floor or cybersecurity monitoring tools. These types of processes can be labor-intensive for humans but are easy for machines.
“Full automation works really well when you're in familiar territories and when the nature of variance and the nature of the unexpected is somewhat familiar. You can really drive for that efficiency, consistency, optimization, and productivity,” Miller said.
Of course, conditions are rarely normal enough for AI to run without human intervention. That’s why Flippy needs an experienced cook to know which part of the grill is the hot spot that cooks burgers faster. That’s why the robotic weed-puller developed by agtech company FarmWise still needs a farmer walking behind it to make sure the plant it’s clutching isn’t a vegetable. (Though this still beats the historic technique of spraying dangerous chemicals over the entire crop to kill the weeds.)
That’s why autonomous vehicles work well in the dry air of Las Vegas or Phoenix but haven’t made their way to rainy or snowy climates.
“I dread the day that they come to Boston in the middle of the winter,” Davenport said.
4 situations when AI augmentation makes sense
The concept of augmentation is hardly new. Humans started using stone tools thousands of years ago. It’s also familiar to knowledge workers who no longer need a calculator on their desks.
“Anybody who’s used a spreadsheet understands the power of augmentation,” Miller said.
Still, augmentation enabled by AI is often underappreciated in today’s enterprises.
“There are more opportunities than people assume,” Miller said.
Davenport and Miller provided examples that fit into four broad and overlapping categories:
When companies want to experiment. Product development is especially expensive in the pharmaceutical industry, where the median R&D cost for new drugs is now north of $1 billion. Instead of spending up to a year working on a drug only to realize that it’s not going to work, pharma manufacturers are creating AI infrastructure to assess their data and evaluate potential use cases for a new drug in as little as two weeks, Davenport said. Not only does this support frontline workers, it also leads to new “data product” roles to manage these AI use cases.
When there’s a lot of pencil-pushing. “Every businessperson we meet, and any company we talk to, almost always has the same lament: ‘We have so much to do, and we don't have the headcount to do it.’ At the same time, they complain about how much grunt work they have to do,” Miller said. In these situations, he added, automation will free up employees to do more of the experimental work augmented by AI, from product development to predictive analytics.
When things are happening quickly. Cybersecurity monitoring software can assess threats from millions of sources in real time. Some tools can also prioritize threats and even automatically respond to them — by shutting down a compromised device, for example. But in “complicated and nuanced cases,” Miller said it takes an experienced security analyst to assess all the data collected and determine whether something is a one-off incident or an indication of a pattern of attacks that may require mitigation on a larger scale.
When workers want a recommendation. When consumers put their trust in health care professionals, augmentation acts as form of decision support. For example, AI looks at the available information and makes a recommendation, but the final decision is up to the doctor in front of the computer. In countries such as China and Indonesia, where hundreds of millions of patients have access to AI-powered diagnostic tools such as Ping An Good Doctor, “A physician actually has to produce the diagnosis and the treatment, or else it’s not valid,” Davenport said. “But the AI system does save the doctor a lot of time and effort.”
How to work with AI in responsible ways 
Moving ahead with AI augmentation means accepting that machines are better than humans at some tasks.
Again, this concept isn’t new. “We’ve always had super tools. We have jet airplanes, we have cars, we have power shovels and cranes,” Miller said. “Now we have super tools that can do non-routine, cognitive-oriented things.”

The lure of 'so-so technology,' and how to avoid it


At the same time, machines can’t bring in all the dimensions of intelligence. Citing the theory of adaptive intelligence from Robert J. Sternberg of Cornell University, Miller said the human mind is particularly suited for creativity, wisdom, and context — not just realizing that something can be done, but whether it should be done. In other words, don’t underestimate what humans can do.
The most effective and responsible use cases for AI augmentation are more than rudimentary tasks or job automation. The goal should be to bring humans and machines together to achieve a level of intelligence higher than what a human or a machine could achieve on its own, Miller said. The whole should be greater than the sum of its parts.
In doing this, enterprises can expect to create new types of products and services, as well as new types of work. But this comes with two clear caveats: Workers need the right skills to use AI systems, and they need to see that AI is helping them and not going to replace them.
“We really need to step up and help people adapt to some of these new tools,” Davenport said. “We need to retrain workers and engage them in this new type of work.”

IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming the scientific landscape, including many domains in medicine. AI refers to the creation of machines or tools that can simulate human thinking and behaviour, whereas ML is a subset of AI in which machine or tools learn from data to make classifications or prediction either with or without human supervision1. The advancement in these fields in recent years has been accelerated by the emergence of high performance computers.In medicine, digitised domains, such as imaging, lend themselves to become early adopters of AI and ML. The imaging pipeline from image acquisition, reconstruction, interpretation, reporting and the communication of results is operated within the digital space, allowing such data to be effectively captured for AI and ML. In particular, as cancer imaging represents a substantial proportion of the work in many departments, it is an area where early exploration and adoption of these technologies by radiologists as primary users appear likely. This is especially the case since these tasks can be repetitive (such as in cancer screening, where readers need to sieve through a large volume of normal studies to identify abnormalities), tedious (such as serial tumour measurements) and burdensome (such as outlining tumours for disease segmentation). Indeed, there are already a number of extant commercial products in the cancer imaging space, with the aim of improving work efficiency, reducing errors, and enhancing diagnostic performance.Many technological solutions are being developed in isolation, however, which may struggle to achieve routine clinical use. These may have been hampered by the limited opportunities for clinicians, radiologists, scientists, and other experts to interact collectively to understand the clinical and data science landscape; to identify the needs, risks, opportunities and challenges for the development, testing, validation and adoption of such tools. This requires the nurturing of multidisciplinary ecosystems collectively, including commercial partners as appropriate, to drive innovations and developments.This review aims to foster interdisciplinary communication on the above issues. We outline relevant AI and ML techniques and highlight key opportunities for implementing AI and ML in cancer imaging. The clinical, professional and technical challenges of implementing AI and ML in cancer imaging are discussed. We draw upon lessons learnt from the past, and take a forward look into the technical and infrastructural developments that are needed to facilitate AI in cancer imaging, enabling the integration of AI and ML technologies into hospital systems and the appropriate training of the future workforce.The medical image as imaging data: RadiomicsMedical images are still largely evaluated by expert radiologists, who are able to visually assess the absence or presence of disease, delineate the boundaries of tumours, evaluate tumour response to treatment and identify disease relapse. These human skills are generally used to define the reference standards against which AI and ML techniques are evaluated. However, there is increasing interest in exploring the smaller subunits that make up medical images (pixels/voxels) as imaging data, which lend themselves to analysis by computers to discover objective mathematical features that may be linked to disease behaviour or outcomes.Radiomics is the computerized analysis of medical images, or regions within medical images2. The images can be multidimensional, e.g., 2D X-ray, 3D computed tomography (CT), 4D ultrasound; and scalar-, e.g., CT, where the CT value is directly related to the tissue electron density, or vector-valued, e.g. phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the measured MRI signal is related to a mathematical vector function. The main goal in radiomics is to utilize algorithms that can identify patterns within images—usually beyond those that the human eye can perceive—and to exploit them to make predictions and therefore aid the clinical decision-making process. The computerized processing of images usually leads to a large number of imaging features. However, it is the non-redundant, stable and relevant features that are selected to develop a mathematical model that will answer the relevant clinical question, the so-called ground truth variable. Figure 1 illustrates the selection and testing of radiomics features to determine their ability, in a specific use-case, to distinguish between benign and malignant breast lesions. As a further extension, radiogenomics approaches, which integrate both radiomics and genomics analyses, are being developed to provide integrated diagnostics to aid disease management3,4.Fig. 1: Feature selection for radiomics.In this illustration, a model classifier is shown to differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions on imaging. Initially, a large number of radiomic features were computed and after removing the highly correlated features, the zero and near-zero variance features; a recursive feature elimination and reduction method was applied. The model performance illustrated here identifies11 features to be at the saturation point. The red curve (left) is showing accuracy versus number of features, while the blue curve (right) represents the model’s error function over the number of features. In this example, using 11 imaging features shows high accuracy while minimising the error function.Full size imageAnother example of a data set for radiomics analysis is a volumetric chest CT scan containing a tumour (e.g. a lung nodule), and a typical workflow could include: (1) identification of the tumour within the scan; (2) annotation of the tumour with semantic features (usually by expert radiologists)5; (3) outlining or segmentation of the tumour6; (4) computation of pre-determined tumour features (e.g. size, mean intensity, image texture, shape, margin sharpness)7,8,9 and/or using automated learning for task-relevant features; and (5) building a classifier that uses the computed features to predict a clinical state, e.g., probability of a specific gene mutation, response to therapy or overall survival10,11.Several groups are building radiomics processing tools to facilitate pipeline data analysis. At Stanford, the Quantitative Image Feature Pipeline12 has been developed, which contains an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature extraction and predictive modelling algorithms, capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype, and cloud-based software for creating and executing quantitative image feature-generating and predictive pipelines, and for using and comparing image features to predict clinical and molecular features. It also allows users to upload their own algorithms as Docker containers13, and to configure them in a customizable workflow (Fig. 2).Fig. 2: Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline.This shows an example of the quantitative imaging feature pipeline (QIFP) used to process a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging cohort stored on a local network ePAD server. The box next to the “modify workflow” button is a selection button, which has been set to choose the workflow displayed. This workflow moves the image data into Stanford’s Quantitative Image Feature Engine (QIFE)64, which computes thousands of image features for each segmented tumour in the cohort, followed by a sparse regression modeler (LASSO TRAIN) that derives an association between a linear combination of a small number of image features to 5-year survival, and finally tests that model in an unseen cohort and produces an ROC curve displaying the accuracy of the association. Other workflows can be chosen that use one or more of the existing tools stored on the QIFP system.Full size imageAI and ML techniques in cancer imagingIn cancer imaging, images acquired from patients are pre-processed and transformed (to ensure data conformity or uniformity) as inputs to develop ML algorithms and models. Such pre-processing steps are used whether they relate to radiologist-defined features or mathematically derived radiomics features. This involves ensuring that the images are of similar image section thickness and of similar pixel-dimensions. As an overview, an ML model or algorithm maps the input imaging data and learns a simple or complex mathematic function that is linked to the target or output, such as a clinical or scientific observation. An ML algorithm can be established or trained with or without the use of so-called ground truth variables, which are reference findings verified by domain experts or by other means (e.g. pathology, laboratory tests, clinical follow-up). ML algorithms are usually developed using a training dataset, refined using a validation dataset, and then tested for their performance in an independent test dataset, ideally from a different institution.Some types of ML models are more widely used than others in imaging studies. As a simplistic discussion, (assuming that x is the input variable, f the mathematic function and y the target/output variable), the most common form is the predictive model, where one tries to predict y by learning the f(x). In exploratory models, one may simply attempt to link the input data x (e.g. an imaging feature) with the output y (e.g. gene expression).When working with continuous variables, regression models, such as Linear, Cox (Proportional Hazards), Regression Trees, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, or others can be used14,15. As for discrete variables, classification models such as Naïve Bays, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, KNN (k-nearest neighbours), Generalized Linear Models, Bagging and others can be used16. These models can inform cancer diagnosis, disease characterization and stratification, treatment response or disease outcomes17.The success of any ML algorithm is influenced by data availability, machine computational power and subsequent algorithm refinements. The choice of ML algorithm may depend on data size. With smaller datasets (e.g. <1000 patients/examinations/images depending on use case), classical ML algorithms, such as Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees and support vector machines, are often applied. With larger datasets, more complex ML models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are very efficient in learning directly from images, may be preferable, although such models are more demanding in terms of computational power. CNN represent a type of deep learning, a subset of ML methods based on artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the organization of neurons in the brain, simulating the connectivity of neurons to solve problems. ML algorithms can be supervised (i.e. the algorithm is developed using data that are labelled with some type of ‘correct answer’) at one end of the spectrum, or unsupervised (i.e. the algorithm uses the data to discover information by itself) at the other. The latter are associated with more complex CNN algorithms, which are able to discover patterns within imaging data without human intervention.The driving force of CNNs has emerged from the computer vision domain, where the large dataset of ImageNet18 (a library of labelled photographic images) and the interest by internet developers to identify objects automatically on photographic pictures led to the development of very efficient ML architectures (e.g. Inception V3, AlexNet, VGG-16 and 19); Some of these have shown value for medical applications using a method called transfer learning3, where a pretrained architecture trained using ImageNet is then applied to medical imaging and fine-tuned for the specific use case.In ML-based cancer imaging, it is not unusual for the number of predictors (e.g. CNN-derived features) to outweigh the number of data points or samples (patients or imaging studies). The latter results in model overfitting, where the model is optimized for the training dataset but consequently performs poorly on the test dataset. The most common strategies to reduce or prevent overfitting include: (a) to use techniques such as k-fold cross-validation by using multiple sub-samples of the dataset; (b) to train the algorithm with more data, where possible; (c) to perform feature selection, as appropriate, to reduce the dimensionality/number of the initial features; and/or (d) to implement ensemble learning, where feasible, to increase data size, that is to undertake algorithm training at multiple sites/institutions. Although an increasing number of healthcare organizations are moving to the cloud and centralized facilities to host and exploit their data, there is still resistance to data sharing and the need to protect patient privacy. These issues have fuelled distributed or federated learning approaches19,20. In federated learning, instead of collecting all data to a centralized repository, the models are circulated to different institutions and the models trained using local data at each site, sharing only the so called weights of a model between institutions. There is now also significant interest in the explainability21 and interpretability of algorithms to increase their trustworthiness. Clinical users may be less interested in the inner mechanics of ML models but would like to understand the way a model generates its output or prediction at a patient cohort level, as well as at an individual patient level.Clinical opportunities for AI/ML in cancer imagingMachine learning can be harnessed in multiple ways to advance and improve cancer imaging. Figure 3 illustrates the typical clinical journey of a patient with cancer and highlights some of the key aspects of imaging where AI systems could exert a positive impact22. Here, we outline some of these in more detail.Fig. 3: Potential use cases for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cancer imaging in relation to a patient’s cancer journey.A typical asymptomatic patient eventually develops cancer presenting symptoms, which usually leads to the cancer diagnosis. Following appropriate disease staging, cancer treatment commences, which can lead to good response or even cure. However, some patients will relapse or progress on treatment for which additional treatment may be administered. Unfortunately, some patients will succumb to their disease. The potential uses for Imaging AI and ML are as shown at various stages of the cancer journey and discussed in the text.Full size image
Risk assessment
The optimal use of cancer imaging technologies requires that we direct resources to patients at greatest risk. In the US, many states require assessment of breast density to assess risk for developing cancer. A deep learning system has shown high accuracy in classifying breast density, and such systems will help support consistent density notification to patients in breast cancer screening23,24. This is particularly valuable since visual breast density measurement has been shown to be associated with considerable interobserver variations (6–85%)25. The use of AI-based approaches can improve upon current risk models. For example, a deep learning model that incorporated mammographic features and traditional risk factors to determine those at greatest risk for malignancy performed more effectively than conventional breast cancer risk models alone26,27. More recently, very good agreement was reported for breast cancer risk evaluation using mammographic breast density determined by a senior radiologist, a junior radiologist and an AI software28.
Cancer screening and cancer detection
Cancer screening has been a highly active area of AI research. AI algorithms have been tested in diseases with active screening programmes such as lung cancer29,30,31 and breast cancer32,33,34,35,36. In breast cancer, some studies have shown that AI algorithms can equal the performance of expert readers36, be used as a second reader for screening mammographic reviews33, provide triaging for prioritizing image reading34 and have been found to be acceptable to women undergoing mammographic screening37. However, real-world evidence is still insufficient to recommend the wide adoption of AI-based tools for breast screening38. In addition to systematic screening, opportunistic screening (the detection of abnormalities in exams obtained for other purposes) may create possibilities to detect other cancers, especially where directed screening tests would be impractical or cost ineffective. For example, in patients undergoing low-dose CT for lung cancer screening, it is possible to use the same images to assess breast cancer risk by assessing the breast density on CT39.
AI systems are now available for the detection of pulmonary nodues31, which also includes nodule classification, nodule measurement and malignancy prediction. When radiologists used a deep learning model for detection and management of pulmonary nodules, their performance improved and reading time was reduced40. Undoubtedly, the use case for AI in cancer detection will widen to include other tumour types.
Diagnosis and classification
ML systems provide ways to improve classification of imaging findings related to cancer. Malignant brain tumours have different aetiologies and prognosis, but tissue sampling is invasive and may not provide accurate characterization due to disease heterogeneity. Studies have shown the potential of AI to identify and classify major intracranial tumours, which include variously high grade gliomas, low grade gliomas, cerebral metastases, meningiomas, pituitary adenoma and acoustic neuromas, as well as differentiating these from normal tissues41,42,43,44. Another developing application in this area is the classification of cystic lesions of the pancreas, since distinguishing between intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasm and serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas can be visually challenging45,46,47, and these conditions are associated with different outcomes.
Treatment response prediction
Radiomics with machine learning have been used to predict the response and outcomes of disease to treatment. Some examples of these include predicting the response of nasopharyngeal carcinoma to intensity-modulated radiation therapy48, the response of non-small cell lung cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy49, as well as the response to neoadjuvant treatment of rectal50,51,52, oesophageal53,54 and breast cancers55,56. Although highly promising, radiomics has not yielded widely generalizable results, thus limiting its current role and implementation in clinical practice.
Radiology-Pathology correlation
Matching radiology data to pathology report information is important for education, quality improvement, and patient care. Using natural language processing techniques, it is possible to mine text-based radiology57 and pathology58 report for key findings to cohort-specific populations for further investigative scrutiny. A system for natural language processing has been shown to classify free-text pathology reports (at an organ-level) to support a radiology follow-up tracking engine59, which can be used to alert radiologists to potential misses at study follow-ups. There also are opportunities to integrate anatomical pathology images with corresponding radiological images60,61.
Disease segmentation
The outlining of disease, or segmentation, is fundamental to many AI/ML and radiomics studies, and is necessary to derive quantitative tumour measurements including tumour diameters, as well as generating tumour contours for radiotherapy planning62,63,64. Registration of segmentations across time-series can also inform clinicians on how tumours are changing with treatment. Manual tracing of lesion borders can lead to high inter-reader variability65, which may be reduced with automatic disease segmentation using AI models. Although deep neural networks are powerful enough to segment lesions, it is recommended that the final AI segmentation result should be verified by an experienced radiologist.
Segmentation algorithms are relatively well developed for certain image and disease types, probably due to the power of deep learning methods which have shown to be very efficient when sufficient data are available. A segmentation problem is a classification problem at the voxel level (a voxel being the smallest unit that makes up the image, determined by the image section thickness and the spatial resolution at which the image is acquired), and given the fact that lesions or whole organs are comprised of hundreds if not thousands of voxels, the density of the data is much higher compared with the classification problem usually considered at a per-patient level (e.g. radiomics). From the segmentation of the disease, radiomic features can be computed from the entire tumour, but a more sophisticated approach is to extract radiomic features from physiologically distinct regions (e.g. based on blood flow, cell density, necrosis) within tumours inferred by their imaging characteristics known as habitats66,67 (Fig. 4).Fig. 4: Machine Learning (ML) in a radiomics pipeline for evaluating tumour habitats.a Whole tumour segmentation and identification of physiologically different regions by means of tissue-specific sub-segmentation on computed tomograhy (CT) imaging (e.g. using 3D volume rendering of tissue components with colour codes shown below). This is followed by b voxel-based radiomic feature map extraction and unsupervised clustering for tumour habitats considering the most clinically relevant region. Next, c quantitative measurements and inferred tumoural heterogeneity metrics are processed by ML predictive models to yield diagnostic and prognostic results. In this example, we have used CT images from a patient with metastatic ovarian cancer with a representative omental lesion.Full size image
Organs-at-risk segmentation
The principle of radiotherapy is to inflict maximum damage to tumours while sparing normal tissues. However, normal tissues and organs often lie in close proximity to tumours, such that they are considered as organs-at-risk to the potentially detrimental scattering effects of radiotherapy. Organs-at-risk segmentation is necessary in radiotherapy to monitor and minimize radiotherapy damage to adjacent normal tissues. For example, when treating pelvic cancers68,69, organs-at-risk segmentation includes the outlining of the normal urinary bladder, bowel loops, rectum and both hip joints. ML has also been successfully applied in organs-at-risk segmentation for radiotherapy planning in head and neck cancers70,71, breast cancers72 and non-small cell lung cancer73,74.
Imaging optimization
One of the growing applications for AI and ML in imaging, not limited to cancer imaging, is their use for imaging optimization. For example, in MRI, the examination time of an oncological body examination can take 30–60 min. AI and ML techniques are increasingly applied to accelerate image acquisition and/or image reconstructions (i.e. making the examination faster)75; as well as to improve image quality (e.g. creating so-called super-resolution MRI images)76. The ability to shorten MRI examination time without sacrificing image quality can improve patient throughput to address bottlenecks in MRI capacity across health systems.
Others
Natural language processing is also being investigated as a tool to generate automated reports, and as a means of reducing repetitive tasks by radiologists77. For the clinicians receiving the radiology report, natural language processing can also potentially be used a communication tool to alert clinicians to actionable reports, so that critical findings can be highlighted to referrers in a timely fashion78.
The current relative success of AI and ML in the different use cases discussed above is dependent on the complexity of the undertaking, data quality and availability, the sophistication of the mathematical models and the subsequent real-world testing of the algorithms. Many of these use cases are active areas of research and development. However, algorithms that are being developed and tested may fail to translate into meaningful clinical tools. It is therefore important to understand the challenges and barriers that need to be addressed to enable the implementation of AI and ML in cancer imaging.
Challenges for implementation of AI/ML in cancer imagingWhile there are significant opportunities for the development of AI and ML in cancer imaging, there are also challenges to address. Below, we discuss some of the important clinical, professional, and technical challenges that will be encountered in the translation of useful mathematical algorithms into wider clinical practice for patient benefit.Clinical challengesOne of most important considerations for the development of an AI or ML tool is that it should address a vital clinical challenge or question. As such, developers should have full appreciation of the clinical context and the implementation environment in which the AI tool is anticipated to operate. This will often require involving clinicians in the development of the tool.The clinical domain is characterized by data inflow from different sources. The amount of biomedical data generated in the clinic is increasing due to advances in multi-modal imaging (i.e. imaging using a variety of techniques), high-throughput technologies for multi-omics (e.g. genomics, proteomics and molecular pathology), as well as an increasing amount of data stored within electronic health records. Hence, multidisciplinary engagement is critical to success. This complex and diverse information can potentially be integrated using AI and ML to support personalised medicine79. However, such large-scale datasets pose new challenges for data-driven and model-based computational methods to yield meaningful results.AI has the potential to revolutionise cancer image analysis by applying sophisticated ML and computational intelligence. Cutting-edge AI methods can enable the shift from organisation-centric (based on organisational pathways) to patient-centric organization of healthcare, which may improve clinical outcomes and also potentially reduce healthcare costs80 by uncovering better individualized solutions. In addition, computerised oncological image analysis is encouraging the transition from largely qualitative image interpretation to quantitative assessment through automated methods aimed at earlier detection and enhanced lesion characterisation81, and the provision of better decision support tools. Within such a paradigm, there are important challenges that require better AI and ML solutions to solve. These include the need for reproducible and reliable tumour segmentation; accurate computer-assisted diagnosis; and clinically useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers with good performance. A particular challenge will be the quantification and monitoring of intra-/inter-tumoural heterogeneity throughout the course of the disease82,83. This will require access to high quality, longitudinal imaging datasets.One area where AI/ML could be particularly transformative is precision oncology, or the selection of a patient’s therapy based on their tumour’s molecular profile. Precision oncology is likely to benefit from integrated diagnostics84,85 (e.g. radiogenomics, which combines radiomics and genomics analyses) to provide robust computational tools for investigating cancer biology, as well as for predicting treatment response (Fig. 5). The solution includes large-scale structured data collection (from multiple institutions) that deals with cyber-security and privacy issues and supports continuous learning. At present, the main challenge is bridging the gap between emerging AI tools and clinical practice, by first performing well-validated clinical research studies of such applications. This is vital for the translation and deployment of AI approaches in precision oncology86 and, if used correctly, AI has the potential to decrease the cost of precision oncological treatments through more accurate patient selection strategies.Fig. 5: Potential future real-time tracking of whole tumour volume, spatial and temporal phenotypic heterogeneity with multi-omics data integration for precision oncology.This schema would allow the processing of multi-institutional data, where each medical centre acquires and stores (in local PACS) its own medical imaging data. To execute quantitative analyses, a radiomics gateway is used to communicate outside the institution by requesting an automated, real-time tumour segmentation from a trusted and specialised AI/ML centre, which allows for continuous learning. The medical images leaving the hospital are anonymised to deal with cyber-security and privacy issues. The segmentation results are used for radiomic feature extraction and analysis, acting as virtual biopsies. The quantitative imaging results are integrated with other biomedical data streams to determine associations with clinical and multi-omics information. Such an approach may develop reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools for multidisciplinary team meetings to improve cancer care in clinical practice; and the evolution of precision oncology. PACS Picture Archiving and Communication System, ML Machine Learning.Full size imageProfessional challengesBeyond the clinical challenges, there are professional challenges that are likely to shape the development and deployment of ML in cancer imaging. Stimuli promoting the development of ML include the relentless rise in the demand for imaging which, when coupled with acute and chronic workforce shortages, can lead to radiologist stress and burnout. Departments need to consider updating or redesigning their IT infrastructure and workflow to be ready for the testing and adoption of AI and ML technologies as these become available. Another challenge is how the radiological workforce perceives the potential utility of AI and ML in the clinic, including the threats and opportunities associated with the use of such technologies.In preparation for an AI and ML in Cancer Imaging meeting organized by the Champalimaud Foundation (Lisbon) and the International Cancer Imaging Society in 2019, an online survey of 569 radiologists from 35 countries was conducted. The majority (>60%) perceived the benefits of AI to outweigh potential risks (Supplementary Note). Most respondents agreed with the positive impacts of AI in radiology, including (1) alerting radiologists to abnormal findings; (2) increasing work efficiency; (3) making diagnostic suggestions when the radiologist is unsure; (4) accepting that the radiologist should be responsible when an error is made; and (5) changing the service model by increasing direct communications with patients. The respondents felt confident that AI and ML techniques are unlikely to replace the job of a radiologist. The majority (>70%) felt that it was important to prepare for the arrival of AI by (1) investing in education; (2) testing new tools; (3) supporting the curation of images and image annotation data at scale; and (4) working with commercial vendors to develop specific AI tools that improve workflow.The survey also identified areas of priority and need for AI tool development including the need for (1) tools that automatically track tumours across multiple time points to assess their response to treatment; (2) tools that improve automatic or semiautomatic tumour segmentation; (3) tools that support proforma reporting allowing annotation of image data to be captured prospectively; (4) tools that help confident identification of normal studies so that radiologists can focus on dealing with abnormal examinations; and (5) tools that help to identify tumours throughout the body.In addition, imaging departments need to plan for their workforce needs to deliver future AI empowered practice. Radiographers and technicians will require better understanding of AI, including their deployment in workflow management and image acquisition. Critically, an informatics team is needed to create the platform on which AI tools can be developed or tested in-line; a space for interacting with and annotating imaging data; and well-curated imaging and data repositories.Technical challengesMany state-of-the-art AI methods based on deep learning are achieving outstanding performance87. Reasons for their success include the strong ability of deep ML models to learn independently and the availability of large-scale labelled datasets that include precise annotations. Unfortunately, in biomedical research, collecting such accurate annotations is an expensive and potentially time-consuming process due to the need for domain experts’ knowledge88. Therefore, ML models that can work on rough annotations and weak supervision (e.g. bounding boxes that encompass an area of interest rather than precise outlining, or image-level labels rather than specific image-feature labels) have been attracting much attention89. The generation of large mineable imaging datasets might overcome data paucity and heterogeneity issues. However, along with the availability of samples, data quality and diversity should be considered by collecting and preparing harmonized datasets. The ability to generalize across multi-institutional studies may be improved by exploiting transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques.Designing and identifying reliable AI imaging studies is a challenge. Studies have been published with as few as 10 patients, making the results of such AI models highly questionable due to potential overfitting effects, which will negatively impact upon the generalizability of the findings. In radiomics, there is a rule of thumb when dealing with binominal classification tasks where 10–15 patients should be recruited for each feature that is part of the final radiomics signature90. Performance estimation should be based on the so-called test set: that is, a dataset comprised of examples that were completely excluded from the model’s training and tuning processes. To evaluate the model’s generalizability, apart from internal validation, external validation should be performed to test the model’s performance in one or more datasets acquired using different imaging equipment or in different geographical patient populations. Ideally, models should be validated in an external patient cohort that is 25–40% of the size of the training sample.Integrative models fusing information from other omics data such as genomics or proteomics, as well as clinical, environmental and social data, are gaining attention, especially in the setting of more complex clinical problems such as disease risk assessment and prognosis. Data sparsity and non-standardized therapeutic approaches between institutions are ongoing challenges when it comes to developing integrative ML models, but there is recognition of the need for better standardization (including data acquisition) that will facilitate these use cases of AI91.The use of images and integrating these with clinical and molecular data can be a source of real-world data to be used for evidence-generating studies. Retrospective data from imaging biobanks and repositories provide excellent opportunities to test AI tools and validate their performance. Harmonization techniques like ComBat92 can be considered to bring the imaging features into a standardized space, especially in multicentre studies when the amount of variability, if not reduced, can harm a model’s performance and generalizability. Radiologists have an excellent opportunity to lead the field by promoting observational in silico studies, taking care to oversee all relevant aspects from data harvesting to analyses to improve the reproducibility of results. The main aspects to be considered are as shown in Box 193.For the specific application in radiomics, there are also many challenges to radiomic computation and the use of radiomic features for prognostication, assessment of response to therapy, and diagnosis of molecular phenotype, including the sensitivity of radiomic feature values to image acquisition and reconstruction techniques94,95,96,97,98 and to variations in segmentations among different users and software99,100. To address these points, improvements in algorithms, and community agreement on use of open-source software, phantoms and standardized approaches101 are required for radiomics to reach its full potential.One of the reasons for the lack of translation of AI models to clinical application is that the focus has been on increasing model performance by AI enthusiasts, possibly at the expense of explainability. A typical example is the black-box approach of deep neural networks that produces outstanding performance, but may present difficulty in establishing its trustworthiness, therefore impeding its clinical adoption. A lack of multidisciplinary engagement may also impede the prioritization of AI solutions of significant clinical value. The clinical community may be skeptical about embracing AI technology into clinical routine, as long as the AI models are non-transparent in the way they reach a specific decision.In recent years, the AI community has started to recognise this limitation and has moved towards the development of explainable AI. The explainability of AI models touches upon a sensitive issue concerning patient safety, especially in clinical decision-support systems102. Since the vast majority of AI models are trained with retrospective, observational data, patient selection bias in machine learning models can lead to poor performance and erroneous predictions in prospective unknown cases. Therefore, domain experts should always verify the predictions and the reasoning behind the predictions made by the AI models. The latter can only be achieved when the models by design offer a degree of transparency. Involving the domain expert in model development is likely to make AI models more robust and reproducible and help gain the trust of end-users. Evaluating the overall performance of the AI solution beyond accuracy is also mandatory in the clinical pathway setting. This would include testing the real-world implementation of such models to ascertain their use and usability, trustworthiness, as well as cost and cost-effectiveness.Box 1 Important considerations from data curation to analyses to improve the robustness and generalizability of AI and ML in cancer imaging

Participant recruitment criteria
Consistency in the inclusion of the study population based on the presenting symptoms, results from previous tests, defining the appropriate index tests or by the selected reference standard


Participant sampling
To avoid or control bias in participant sampling, considerations could include the use of consecutive series of participants, use of well-defined selected data silos, clear and well-defined selection criteria; as well as adjusting for possible confounding variables


Data collection
What data to collect and how this is performed should be planned before participant recruitment and sampling. Where appropriate, target trial emulation may be undertaken, which is the application of design principles from randomized trials to the analysis of observational data, which may improve the quality of the observations.


Reference standard
The rationale and description of the reference standard should be clear


Technical specifications of materials and methods
Aspects of technical specifications should be well defined. These include how and when images and measurements were taken; the definition of units; cut-off thresholds; defined results categories (of both the index tests and the reference standard); description of the number, training, and expertise of persons executing and reading (original or new reporting); index tests and the reference standard; and blindness aspects (if the readers of the index tests and the reference standard were masked to other test results)

Show moreLessons learnt from the past: computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for breast cancerEven though AI and ML are hugely promising technologies in imaging, it is worth noting lessons from the previous effort to apply computational approaches in cancer imaging, using computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer as an example. Development of algorithms for automated detection of calcifications and masses on mammograms started in earnest in the mid-1980s, and in 1998 the first commercial CAD system for mammography, initially based on digitized film, received FDA approval103. Transition to digital mammography facilitated the implementation of CAD in clinical practice. The introduction of Medicare reimbursement coverage for the use of CAD in the United States, and promising preliminary results from clinical trials104,105, led to a rapid uptake of CAD in the US with ~74% of mammography interpretations utilizing CAD by 2010106. However, even though stand-alone sensitivity of commercial CAD systems in enriched reader studies is consistently superior to that of radiologists106, large retrospective registry-based studies failed to show a significant improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of screening mammography after implementation of CAD107,108. This disappointing result is likely to be explained by the relatively high number of false-positive prompts generated by current commercial CAD systems, which average between 1 and 2 false prompts per case. In the low-prevalence screening setting, this false-positive prompt rate translates into a positive predictive value of a CAD prompt of <1%. As radiologists will have to ignore more than 99% of the CAD prompts to find the one prompt actually pointing to a cancer, there will be a tendency to ignore the computer-generated prompts altogether. There is hope that newer deep learning algorithms will overcome some of the limitations of traditional feature-based CAD systems. Unsupervised training on much larger datasets with up to a million mammographic images has the potential to overcome the shortcomings of human observers, as deep learning algorithms no longer have to imitate the way the radiologist reads a mammogram109. However, increased automation of the detection task will come with added responsibilities for the algorithms110, which may need to show an improvement in patient outcome beyond diagnostic performance.Hence, the key lessons from previous CAD implementation in breast cancer suggest that the next generation AI tool to for cancer detection will need to have high diagnostic accuracy, in particular, high positive predictive value that will result in fewer false positives in the low disease prevalence setting. There is also the need for real-world testing of these tools beyond diagnostic performance to establish the health-related and wider benefits associated with their deployment.Technical, infrastructure and professional developments required for the adoption of AI/ML in cancer imaging
Imaging repositories and archives
Supervised learning approaches require large quantities of labelled data for training and validation103. There is a plethora of data sources that one could exploit for AI modelling in cancer imaging. These include imaging biobanks, which are virtual repositories of medical images; imaging biomarkers identified as endpoint surrogates; and population studies111. Imaging biobanks allow the in silico evaluation and validation of new biomarkers by establishing disease development probabilities, early disease diagnosis and phenotyping, disease grading and staging, targeting therapies and evaluation of disease response to treatment and prediction of adverse events.
Open access data repositories are one approach to capturing and disseminating sufficient high quality, well curated data. There are not many open access cancer image repositories. Data sharing is not a universally accepted concept112. Furthermore, patient privacy, data privacy, informed consent laws, regulations and the growing interest in the potential commercial value of patient data, differ by country and can pose barriers to data sharing113. Institutions and researchers consider data to be intellectual property, and limit or prohibit access to valuable data sets. Regulatory agencies (e.g. the FDA) argue for sequestration of data used to validate algorithms approved for commercial use114.
The US National Cancer Institute funded the creation and continued operation of the largest open access cancer image repository, The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) (Fig. 6)115,116. TCIA is designed to foster increased public availability of high-quality cancer imaging data sets for research. Data are accessible due to strict adherence to F.A.I.R. (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) standards for data release117,118. Other research-funded initiatives to create data warehouses are also being developed across the European Union and elsewhere.Fig. 6: The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) is a system of systems constructed from open-source software.TCIA is also a set of services designed to collect and curate high quality cancer image data and related clinical data and make it publicly available. (VMs = virtual machines).Full size image
Although size of a dataset matters, data quality and data variability are of equal importance. Data should be of sufficient quality and be acquired with uniform parameters. Clinical trials generate data with a higher level of quality control and consistency of data acquisition protocols. TCIA focuses on collecting, curating and publishing data from completed clinical trials. Curation in this context includes assurance of consistent metadata, anatomy coverage, and data formats which strictly comply with international data standards, as well as the anonymization of any patient identifiable data.
For an ML algorithm to be clinically useful it must be trained on data that appropriately represent the variance in the human population, the presentation of disease and data collection systems119,120. Labelled data are created manually by human experts, resulting in high cost and limited volume of high-quality training (and testing) datasets. Perhaps the most time-consuming process within a ML project is annotating the data and presenting them in a format compatible with further analysis and modelling processes. Image annotation is often a bottleneck for AI and ML, and crowd sourcing for such activity is being trialled as a way of improving efficiency. Depending on the task, the annotations may be provided at the patient level (overall survival, disease-free survival), at the image level (benign, malignant) or at the voxel level (lesion, non-lesion). Typically lesion detection algorithms need to be provided with annotations of a bounding box type usually encasing the lesion, while for training automatic segmentation models, radiologists need to outline lesions manually in multiple image slices121.
As sizeable imaging data from different sites and scanners become consolidated within repositories, it will be necessary to consider steps that will account for data diversity or heterogeneity. A possible solution might be to use deep learning approaches to learn from such data lacking homogeneity, which may result in outputs with lower variability and higher reproducibility. Retrospective observational studies with real-world data and quality assurance checklists93,122 will allow reproducible causality123 inferences from virtual patient cohorts to address clinical and policy-relevant questions. Particularly where the disease under study is relatively rare resulting in small datasets, it would be appropriate to use a cross-validation approach to develop and test the AI models.
Open-source software and open collaborations
The use of open-source software (OSS) strategy could help to alleviate some of the concerns regarding transparency and explainabiltiy when using AI in cancer imaging. OSS is software code made available under a legal licence in which the copyright holder provides (depending upon the specific terms) various rights to the licensees to study, change, improve and re-distribute the code without any fees. Today, there are many different types of OSS licences [https://opensource.org/approval] depending on the preference of the copyright holder. These licences range in the United States from what is commonly known as permissive licences, such as Apache-2.0, to strongly protective licenses, such as general public licence (GPL). OSS is available in its non-commercial form, however it can be made into commercial products with additional services such as warranty, training, documentation and maintenance under various commercial contracts.
A successful open-source ecosystem has three interacting components: (i) OSS itself, (ii) governance, and (iii) community of collaborators. Currently there are more than 50 open-source ML packages using different OSS licences, operating platforms, and programming languages. Some of the more popular packages include TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Caffe2 and many others. They all have varying strengths and weaknesses depending on users’ needs.
These OSS packages are developed and sponsored by corporations and some individuals for their own use cases and applications, often not for medical imaging, but the packages are good initial platforms from which medical imaging research can be pursued. However, they will need to be optimized for higher performance for medical applications. For example, the pattern recognition in consumer applications usually depends on graphic features and image orientation. However, medical image patterns are usually orientation-independent, and diseases in medical images are subtle in nature and present themselves in minor grey value differences rather than graphical features. For these reasons, algorithms available on OSS packages will need to be re-trained and tuned using medical imaging data to optimise their performances. In summary, OSS represents a practical route by which the AI community can work together to collaborate and develop new AI tools, which can be more widely tested, and at the same time address some of the transparency and privacy concerns.
Healthcare and regulatory systems
There are significant perceived values of using AI solutions in healthcare124 at every stage of the clinical workflow. In radiology, this means improvements to the patient diagnostic pathway, from the appropriateness of imaging requests125 to how actionable findings in radiological reports are followed up126. The full potential of these improvements are not yet realised as there remain significant barriers to implementation.
From 2021, the new EU Medical Device Regulations has been enforced, mandating deeper scrutiny of software as a medical device (SaMD). Certification is given in accordance with how the software is used and applied within the clinical workflow. The majority of AI software in imaging are being certified as a decision-support tool, that is to say it should not be used on its own in for clinical or patient management. It is also worth considering whether the software is intended to be use by radiologists at primary reporting, or only after the initial primary report is issued as a second read. In the current commercial landscape, there are multitudes of software tools that are cleared by regulators but have not been adopted into healthcare systems.
AI products may continue to evolve after initial release through continuous training. Many products have found their way into the marketplace without being independently tested, despite obtaining CE labelling or FDA clearance. As such, a new FDA framework has been proposed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI tools127. The FDA has introduced a predetermined change control plan in premarket submissions. This plan includes anticipated modification (SaMD pre-specifications) and the associated methodology used to implement these controlled changes (algorithm change protocol). The FDA expects a commitment from manufacturers on transparency and real-world performance monitoring, as well as updates on changes implemented as part of the approved pre-specifications and the algorithm change protocol.
Once the product or software has been validated as a certified medical device, a Data Protection Impact Assessment process must be initiated, usually at the local level, to safeguard data privacy—in Europe, this means compliance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). At the same time, a Solution Architecture Review should also be undertaken to carefully examine the possible IT architecture for implementation. Local rules must also be adhered to with regards to patient data use and storage, since each country can vary in the interpretation of the GDPR. Privacy concerns and the need for a rational and coherent digital infrastructure has been referred to as ‘the inconvenient truth’ in medical AI128.
The process of software integration with existing hospital IT infrastructure is influenced by the experience of the AI company and its product design, the diversity and size of the healthcare system, as well as knowing how and what data are being transferred to and from the healthcare provider to the software processor and vice versa. Failure of software integration is a known barrier for adoption. Well-established companies with a sound product could be integrated in days, but the timeline usually gets longer in hospitals running an array of different radiology informatic systems (e.g., Picture Archiving and Communication Systems [PACS] and Vendor Neutral Archives [VNA], which communicate with the Hospital and Radiology Information Systems [HIS & RIS],) as well as dealing with a complex range of data inputs (e.g. non-standardised naming of imaging sequences from different scanners).
To facilitate AI workflows, similar imaging procedures should be standardised to the same acquisition protocol (regardless of scanner model and vendor), and all radiological reports could be structured in a similar way using common lexicon to facilitate data mining (e.g. RadReports.org with suggested structured reporting templates endorsed by the American College of Radiology). Without satisfying such conditions, software integration may need to be organised on a per-modality basis, which may require complex data mapping within the same hospital system. Hence, depending on how mature the software algorithm is, program bugs may reveal themselves as a consequence of such data input heterogeneity.
Introducing the use of a new AI tool within a healthcare system may proceed with initial caution by working with the supplier to undertake a mutually agreed trial period. Such a “try to buy” approach would allow users to assess the use and usability of the AI tool, integration with the workflow, as well as its trustworthiness. This is because physicians may distrust the tool unless it is proven to be highly accurate. One solution is to build a radiologist feedback tool onto the PACS interface. This would allow the radiologist to score the performance of any given AI algorithm—for example, using check boxes with legends such as ‘agree/AI overestimation/AI underestimation/both over and underestimation’. This would allow users to raise perceived discrepancies that can then be further assessed. Caution should also be given to tools that are developed by vendors that may lock-in users to specific algorithms, especially if they fail to meet local demands. The community of professionals who interact with the software tool also needs to be educated about its usage. It may be feasible for an AI developer to train a small group but this becomes challenging when confronted by many potential users in a large hospital system.
It is possible to process patient data using certified medical devices in routine clinical practice without additional consent. However, if vendors are seeking feedback to improve their software algorithm, then specific data consent is required and should be obtained prospectively from patients. Post-hoc sharing of such data may be denied, which means that processes must be put in place to identify patients who have provided consent and to rescind it where appropriate.
Even when the barriers to AI implementation are overcome, it may still be unclear: who pays for the AI? Whilst the development and testing AI tools can be funded by research grants or commercial partnership with companies, as yet, no healthcare systems or private health insurers have reimbursed AI usage. In the landscape of decreasing tariffs for radiological procedures, it is a challenge to find specific funding to support the introduction of AI, which can be costly to deploy across healthcare systems. Even though AI holds substantial promise to improve work efficiency, there are yet no published real-world evidence to date. The development of specific patient-centric services using AI may provide an opportunity to introduce tariff models for its use. One example is the UK pilot of a bone health service, which pays for identifying patients at risk of developing osteoporotic spinal fracture. Instead of payment for a specific AI product, the business case was constructed on the basis of the whole service, which aimed to identify patients at risk of osteoporotic fracture, thus enabling early intervention and potentially reducing subsequent healthcare costs by decreasing the number of fractures. This is an example of the coming together of value-based healthcare and AI.
In less coherent healthcare models where imaging services are component care providers (i.e. providers of specific services), it would be important to accrue local metrics to help justify AI adoption. Examples of these include metrics showing improvement in the accuracy of reporting by reducing the rate of patient recall in women undergoing mammography109; increasing the reporting speed and finally increases in revenues. By testing novel AI solutions in a variety of healthcare markets and trying different combinations of payor models, it may eventually be possible for AI software tools to be widely adopted into healthcare systems (Box 2).
Future radiological workforce
Appropriate training is required to allow users to judge whether an AI tool is fit for purpose before adoption into clinical practice, which would require radiologists to understand the principles of AI and how AI algorithms should be properly validated.
There are pressures that are encouraging the premature introduction of AI tools into clinical workflows. Firstly, there is a workforce crisis with a shortage of radiologists in many countries. In the UK, about 10% of radiologist vacancies are unfilled129. Secondly, there is a marked increase in global imaging demand and workload. In the UK, the CT and MRI workload has been rising by ~10% each year129. Thirdly, there is a relentless drive to improve workflow efficiency, by improving image procedure turnaround time without compromising diagnostic accuracy. Finally, AI is seen as a tool to support repetitive tasks (e.g. sequential tumour size measurement, or cancer screening), that are time-consuming and relatively uninteresting for radiologists to undertake.
Empowering radiologists to judge the performance of AI algorithms would require changes in medical school and radiology curricula to include an understanding of the terms and main methodology of AI/ML; the requisite development, training, testing and validation of algorithms; basic statistics relevant to AI/ML; and the challenges of data requirements. Such empowerment will also necessitate educating radiologists in how they can meaningfully and rigorously test the performance of AI algorithms within their own clinical practice.
The future of AI and ML applications in radiology will be reliant upon the education of stakeholders including medical students, trainee radiologists, qualified radiologists, other doctors, radiographers, computer scientists, data scientists and data engineers collaboratively to solve clinically relevant problems. This multidisciplinary dialogue is necessary and critical to the development of clinically relevant and technically accomplished AI tools to address the unmet needs in oncology. There is a clear need for more multidisciplinary AI meetings and conferences to encourage interactions between all stakeholders, both at the local level, as well as at the national and international level.

Show moreConclusionsCancer imaging is seeing rapid developments in AI, and in particular ML, with a broad range of clinical applications that are welcomed by the majority of radiologists. The development of new ML tools is often constrained by available imaging data; however, there is the potential for building and using real-world well-curated imaging data in biobanks and open access repositories to overcome such limitations. Adopting open-source tools for algorithm development, where possible, may lead to better transparency and collaboration across centres. However, even though exceptional diagnostic performance can be gained by the application of these AI software algorithms, it is still not clear how many of these will have a long-term meaningful impact on patient outcomes or will be cost-effective. An improved regulatory framework for the approval of AI-based tools for clinical deployment is evolving. There is a need for systematic evaluation of these software, which often undergo only limited testing prior to release. It is also important to empower all stakeholders, especially radiologists, with sufficient understanding of this growing field to enable them critically to appraise these technologies for adoption into their own practice. Creating opportunities for interdisciplinary engagement will also facilitate the development of useful clinical tools that aim to enhance patient care and outcomes.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'headline': 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning in cancer imaging', 'description': 'An increasing array of tools is being developed using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for cancer imaging. The development of an optimal tool requires multidisciplinary engagement to ensure that the appropriate use case is met, as well as to undertake robust development and testing prior to its adoption into healthcare systems. This multidisciplinary review highlights key developments in the field. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of AI and ML in cancer imaging; considerations for the development of algorithms into tools that can be widely used and disseminated; and the development of the ecosystem needed to promote growth of AI and ML in cancer imaging.

Earlier this year students at Sandwell College in West Bromwich put on VR headsets to do some mock interviews.Their avatars - cartoon-like, 3D representations of themselves - were put through their paces by another talking avatar representing the AI software system.BodyswapsThis is what the Bodyswaps' VR job interviews look like""I'd never had an interview before in my life,"" says engineering student Ayyan Ahmed. ""But because there was no human judging me, and it was all online, I could actually express myself.""And then, at the end of the process, he [the VR interviewer] told me what I did wrong, and what I did right. It really helped me to know what to do in my next interview.""The VR system the students were using is made by London-based company Bodyswaps.Questions and requests that the interviewees get asked range from the straightforward ""tell me about your greatest achievements"", to the more challenging ""do you prefer to be loved or feared?""The user then gets feedback, not just on what they said, but how they say it, whether they are maintaining eye contact with the interviewer avatar, and even their posture.Ayyan AhmedStudent Ayyan Ahmed says he felt he could talk freely to the computer interviewerBodyswaps' chief executive Christophe Mallet says the idea is that people can keep practising with the simulated job interviews until they feel ready for a real-life one.He believes that the technology has the chance to level the playing field for candidates from less well-off backgrounds who might not otherwise have the opportunity to practise for job interviews in a professional setting.""Things like communication, empathy and leadership are the secrets to success [in interviews], but how can you practise those? If you are rich, you can get a coach. Otherwise you have e-learning [such as watching videos on the topic], but that doesn't work as you are lacking immersion.""Using VR and AI we now have a way to immerse you safely in a simulation where you can practise interview conversations.""BodyswapsChristophe Mallet says the aim is to help people more easily and effectively practise for interviewsBodyswaps launched its interview simulations last year, and says it is mainly targeting schools, colleges and universities, so their students can practise before they enter the jobs market. Its business model is subscription based, with the amount an institution has to pay each year being dependent on how many people use the system.While Bodyswaps is currently focused on mock job interrogations, the AI technology of Swedish firm Tengai is already allowing firms out in the real world to get a computer to do their initial job interviews.The AI software is represented as a talking cartoon head that appears on the screen of a candidate's computer or smartphone. It asks a set list of questions, and then the recorded answers are used to help recruiters draw up shortlists for jobs.TengaiTengai's tech sees a software system interview people via a computerised faceTengai's chief executive Elin Öberg Mårtenzon says that a central aim of the software is to avoid making wrong assumptions, such as judging someone on their appearance.""We wanted to create a situation where you could actually look at objective data instead, by putting some sort of filter between the candidate and the recruiter,"" she says.""And that filter is supposed to mitigate bias in the process… so that they know that they are not being judged by things other than those relating to the job description.""But while it might be tempting to see AI and VR technology as the magical solution for selecting the right candidate for a job, employment lawyer Susan Thompson says we need to be cautious.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.""AI doesn't eliminate risk, and it's not without risk itself,"" says the partner at London law firm Simkins. ""So I think that's the most important thing employers need to be mindful of.""We have to remember, AI is actually still fundamentally created by a human. [So], first and foremost, I'd be saying to any employer who's thinking of using it, be it at the interview stage, or even at the exit stage, 'do you understand it, and to what extent have you spoken to the developer about what data points it uses?'""And, has it been stress tested to eliminate bias? Does it eliminate gender bias? And how does it do that?""Ms Thompson adds: ""I would be hesitant in advocating that AI is used exclusively in the interview process. I think there should be some sort of human intervention somewhere.""Artificial intelligenceEmploymentPayVirtual reality",,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1797C/production/_127463669_vr_index_bodywsaps.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our dependency on AI-based outputs seems to grow every day, both from a business as well as personal perspective. But are we willing to fully trust this output? Are we sure the data fed into these systems is accurate? Are the decision models and algorithms kept up to date? Is it free of bias? Are humans kept in the loop?


The answers to these questions are all still up in the air, according to a recent survey of 7,502 business around the world, commissioned by IBM in partnership with Morning Consult.

AI usage just keeps growing. Right now, 35% of companies use AI in their business — up from 31% a year ago. An additional 42% are exploring AI. There are benefits — such as cost savings and efficiencies (54%), improvements in IT or network performance (53%), and better experiences for customers (48%).

PROMOTED
Trust is a priority, but many organizations haven’t taken enough steps to ensure AI is trustworthy, the survey also shows. Eighty-five percent of respondents agree that consumers are more likely to choose a company that’s transparent about how its AI models are built, managed and used. In addition, 84% say that “being able to explain how their AI arrives at different decisions is important to their business.”

Maintaining brand integrity and customer trust is the most important reason to pursue AI trust, cited by 56% of managers. Another 50% say meeting external regulatory and compliance obligations is key, and 48% cite the ability to govern data and AI across the entire lifecycle. Another 48% seek the ability to monitor data and AI across the lifecycle.

A majority of respondents say they lag in many efforts to ensure trust — from finding the right skills to proactive efforts to avoid bias. A majority organizations haven’t taken key steps to ensure their AI is trustworthy and responsible, such as reducing bias (74%), tracking performance variations and model drift (68%), and making sure they can explain AI-powered decisions (61%).

“A significant challenge is that the field of applied AI ethics is still relatively new, and most companies cite a lack of skills and training,” the survey’s authors state. Leading challenges to assuring greater trust in AI include the following:


Lack of skills and training to develop and manage trustworthy 63%
AI governance/mgmt tools that don’t work across all environments 60%
Lack of an AI strategy 59%
AI outcomes that aren’t explainable 57%
Lack of company guidelines for developing trustworthy, ethical AI 57%
AI vendors who don’t include explainability features 57%
Lack of regulatory guidance from governments or industry 56%
Building models on data that has inherent bias 56%


The good news is the more likely a company is to have deployed AI, the more likely it is to value the importance of trustworthiness, the survey’s authors state. IT professionals at businesses currently deploying AI are 17% more likely to report that their business values AI explainability than those that are simply exploring AI.
The most activity associated with AI trust focuses on safeguarding data privacy, the survey also shows.

There are some careers within tech that are considered to be more robust or recession-proof than others: for example cybersecurity and cloud computing, which often go hand-in-hand thanks to the rise in adoption of SaaS providers and IoT services, meaning our data needs more protection than ever.
Jobs in artificial intelligence and machine learning are also considered to be a secure bet. As AI creates new ways of automating tasks and processes, it is making some roles redundant – but it is leading to the creation of many more for knowledge workers in particular. According to PwC’s Global Artificial Intelligence Study, AI has the potential to contribute to the global economy by 2030, and provide a 26% boost in GDP for local economies.





The European Commission is wise to the opportunity. It aims to make the EU a world-class hub for AI, while ensuring that the tech is human-centric and trustworthy. “Europe is well placed to benefit from the potential of AI, not only as a user but also as a creator and a producer of this technology. It has excellent research centres, innovative start-ups, a world-leading position in robotics and competitive manufacturing and services sectors, from automotive to healthcare, energy, financial services and agriculture,” says the Commission’s white paper On Artificial Intelligence – A European approach to excellence and trust.
While Europe isn’t at U.S. levels in terms of AI startups, it comes in second globally. The number of AI startups in European states was 769 in 2021, compared to the United States’ 1,393. Equally, in terms of education, Europe takes second place in terms of the number of AI-specialised Master’s programs, with Germany having the highest overall number of AI programmes, and France leading with AI Master’s courses.
Within Europe as a whole, Statista reports that the UK was the highest-ranked Western European country for AI in 2020. It is closely followed by Finland, Germany, and Sweden, but there are other players with potential too, such as Denmark and the Netherlands. Below, we’re taking a look at three European locations for artificial intelligence jobs.
The UK
The UK launched its first National Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategy in 2021 to ensure it secures its place as a global science leader into the future. “The UK is a global superpower in AI and is well placed to lead the world over the next decade as a genuine research and innovation powerhouse, a hive of global talent and a progressive regulatory and business environment,” the strategy says. 
- A message from our partner -





There are currently 1,486 AI companies across the UK which have secured £8.48b worth of equity investment. These include OneTrust, Graphcore, Thought Machine, Lendable and Signal AI. Twenty percent of the UK’s AI firms have been founded since 2017, indicating strong growth in the sector.
Big multinational tech companies are in this space too, such as Google, currently hiring for a Principal Engineer, Artificial Intelligence and Cerebra in London. You’ll be directly developing and landing ambient AI projects and you will prove out ambient AI projects that address customer challenges, leveraging advances in privacy technologies, models, and signals that devices have access to. Find out more here.
Germany
As Europe’s biggest economy, it’s no surprise that Germany is a leading location for artificial intelligence. Home to the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence, one of the world’s largest nonprofit contract research institutes, which has facilities in multiple cities accessing the country including Berlin, Bremen and Lübeck.
Most of its AI activity is focused on Berlin: 48% of all German AI start-ups between 2012 and 2017 were founded in the city, and by 2025, the turnover of the AI companies in the Berlin-Brandenburg area is expected to rise to €2bn.  
Names to know include Unicsoft, Mobildev, Talentica Software, Trigma and Celadon, and big household names are innovating too, such as Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation and Siemens AG, which is hiring in Berlin. The Consultant Artificial Intelligence/ Advanced Analytics will advise customers on business intelligence projects on the www.pulse.cloud platform and will work on the development of various models in the field of machine learning and data science as well as advanced analytics. Find out more about the role here.
The Netherlands
In 2020, the Dutch capital of Amsterdam came second in the small cities category in the Global Cities’ AI Readiness Index, which captures cities’ ability to adapt and thrive in the coming age of AI. The report found that Amsterdam was as competitive as some megacities (which included Beijing and New York), with populations of more than 10 million. 





The city is home to Amsterdam Science Park, which was the birthplace of the European internet, and more recently the home of the National Innovation Centre for AI (ICAI). This centre brings academia, industry and government together to develop AI technologies.
Top AI companies in The Netherlands include Under Reality, Eastsource, Bitfury and Dashmote and right now, Synechron is seeking a Data Scientist in Amsterdam to work on solving AI challenges for, and with customers. Your knowledge and skills will help shape the future of banking as you lead client projects to solve AI challenges and translate analytical solutions into recommendations.

Bright, colorful, fantastical flowers of no known species or genus, morphing continuously in size, color and shape, as if botany and fluid dynamics had somehow merged.“Song of the Ambassadors,” which was presented to the public at Tully on Tuesday evening, was created by K Allado-McDowell, who leads the Artists and Machine Intelligence initiative at Google, with the A.I. program GPT-3; the composer Derrick Skye, who integrates electronics and non-Western motifs into his work; and the data artist Refik Anadol, who contributed A.I.-generated visualizations. There were three singers — “ambassadors” to the sun, space and life — as well as a percussionist, a violinist and a flute player. Thake, sitting silently to one side of the stage with a simple, inexpensive EEG monitor on her head, was the “brainist,” feeding brain waves into Anadol’s A.I. algorithm to generate the otherworldly patterns.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’m using my brain as a prop,” she said in an interview.ImageThe “ambassadors” included, from left, Debi Wong, Laurel Semerdjian and Andrew Turner.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesImageDigital art by Refik Anadol was projected above the Tully stage.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesJust to the side of the stage, level with the musicians, sat a pair of neuroscientists, Ying Choon Wu and Alex Khalil, who had been monitoring the brain waves of two audience volunteers sitting nearby, with their heads encased in research-grade headsets from a company called Cognionics.Wu, a scientist at the University of California, San Diego, investigates the effects of works of art on the brain; in another study, she’s observing the brain waves of people viewing paintings at the San Diego Museum of Art. Khalil, a former U.C. San Diego researcher who now teaches ethnomusicology at University College Cork in Ireland, focuses on how music gets people to synchronize their behavior. Both aim to integrate art and science.Which makes them a good match for Allado-McDowell, who first pitched “Song of the Ambassadors” in January 2021 as a participant in the Collider, a Lincoln Center fellowship program supported by the Mellon Foundation. “My proposal was to think about the concert hall as a place where healing could happen,” said Allado-McDowell, 45, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns “they” and “them.”Healing has long preoccupied them. They suffered from severe migraines for years; then, as a student at San Francisco State University, they signed up for a yoga class that took an unexpected turn. “I was besieged by rainbows,” they recalled in a forthcoming memoir. “Orbs of light flickered in my vision. Panting shallow breaths, I broke out of the teacher’s hypnotic groove and escaped to the hall outside. As I knelt on the carpet, cool liquid uncoiled in my lower back … as a glowing purple sphere pulsed gold and green in my inner vision.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThis, they were told, was a relatively mild form of kundalini awakening — kundalini being, in Hindu mythology, the serpent that is coiled at the base of the spine, a powerful energy that generally emerges from its dormant state only after extensive meditation and chanting. Others might simply have dropped yoga. “For me, it was an indication that I didn’t understand reality,” Allado-McDowell said. “It showed me that I didn’t have a functional cosmology.”ImageAudience volunteers were outfitted with research-grade headsets from a company called Cognionics.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesWhat followed was a yearslong quest to get one. Along the way, they picked up a master’s degree in art and went to work for a Taiwanese tech company in Seattle. At one point, while sitting in a clearing in the Amazon rainforest, they had a thought: “A.I.s are the children of humanity. They need to learn to love and to be loved. Otherwise they will become psychopaths and kill everyone.”Later, in 2014, Allado-McDowell joined a nascent A.I. research team at Google. When the leader suggested collaborations with artists, they volunteered to lead the initiative. Artists and Machine Intelligence was launched in February 2016 — 50 years after “9 Evenings: Theater and Engineering,” the pioneering union of art and technology led by Robert Rauschenberg and the AT&T Bell Labs engineer Billy Kluver. The connection was not lost on Allado-McDowell.One of the earliest partnerships they established was with Anadol: first for “Archive Dreaming,” a project inspired by the Borges story “The Library of Babel,” then for “WDCH Dreams,” Anadol’s A.I.-driven projection onto the billowing steel superstructure of the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. For “Song of the Ambassadors,” Anadol said, “we are transforming brain activities in real time into an ever-changing color space.”Anadol’s artwork also responds to Skye’s music, which alternates between periods of activity and repose. “We wanted to bring people in and out of a space of meditation,” Skye said. “I carved out these long gaps where all we’re doing is environmental sounds. Then we slowly bring them out.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAll this is tied to Allado-McDowell’s goal of testing the therapeutic powers of music in a performance setting. “Might there be policy implications?” they asked. “Might there be a role that institutions could play if we know that sound and music is healing? Can that open up new possibilities for arts funding, for policy, for what is considered a therapeutic experience or an artistic experience?”The jury is still out.“We know that listening to music has an immediate impact for things like mood, attention, focus,” said Lori Gooding, an associate professor of music therapy at Florida State University and president of the American Music Therapy Association. Positive results have been found for people who have suffered a stroke, for example — but that’s after individualized therapy in a medical or professional setting. The approach in “Song of the Ambassadors,” she said, is different because of “the public aspect of it.”ImageDerrick Skye’s score was performed by musicians including the violinist Joshua Henderson.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesImageOne goal of the project is to turn a hall like Tully into a public healing space.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesWu and Khalil, the neuroscientists involved with the production, have yet to analyze their data. But at a panel discussion preceding Tuesday’s performance — and yes, this opera did come with a panel discussion — Khalil made a prediction that left the audience cheering.“We’ve started to understand that cognition — that is, the working of the mind — exists far outside our head,” he said. “We used to imagine that the brain is a processor and that cognition happened there. But actually, we think our minds extend throughout our bodies and beyond our bodies into the world.”With music, he continued, these extended minds can lock onto rhythms, and through the rhythms onto other minds, and then onto yet more. As for the spaces where that happens, Khalil said, “You can start to think of them as healing places.”A version of this article appears in print on Oct. 31, 2022, Section C, Page 5 of the New York edition with the headline: Making Art While Playing The Brain.

For years, the conventional wisdom among Silicon Valley futurists was that artificial intelligence and automation spelled doom for blue-collar workers whose jobs involved repetitive manual labor. Truck drivers, retail cashiers and warehouse workers would all lose their jobs to robots, they said, while workers in creative fields like art, entertainment and media would be safe.Well, an unexpected thing happened recently: AI entered the creative class.In the past few months, AI-based image generators like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have made it possible for anyone to create unique, hyper-realistic images just by typing a few words into a text box.These apps, though new, are already astoundingly popular. DALL-E 2, for example, has more than 1.5 million users generating more than 2 million images every day, while Midjourney’s official Discord server has more than 3 million members.These programs use what’s known as “generative AI,” a type of AI that was popularized several years ago with the release of text-generating tools like GPT-3 but has since expanded into images, audio and video.It’s still too early to tell whether this new wave of apps will end up costing artists and illustrators their jobs. What seems clear, though, is that these tools are already being put to use in creative industries.

Recently, I spoke to five creative-class professionals about how they’re using AI-generated art in their jobs.“It spit back a perfect image”Collin Waldoch, 29, a game designer in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, recently started using generative AI to create custom art for his online game, Twofer Goofer, which works a bit like a rhyming version of Wordle. Every day, players are given a clue — like “a set of rhythmic moves while in a half-conscious state” — and are tasked with coming up with a pair of rhyming words that matches the clue. (In this case, “trance dance.”)Initially, Waldoch planned to hire human artists through gig-work platform Upwork to illustrate each day’s rhyming word pair. But when he saw the cost — between $50 and $60 per image, plus time for rounds of feedback and edits — he decided to try using AI instead. He plugged word pairs into Midjourney and DreamStudio, an app based on Stable Diffusion, and tweaked the results until they looked right. Total cost: a few minutes of work, plus a few cents. (DreamStudio charges about 1 cent per image; Midjourney’s standard membership costs $30 per month for unlimited images.)“I typed in ‘carrot parrot,’ and it spit back a perfect image of a parrot made of carrots,” he said. “That was the immediate ‘aha’ moment.”Waldoch said he didn’t feel guilty about using AI instead of hiring human artists, because human artists were too expensive to make the game worthwhile.“We wouldn’t have done this” if not for AI, he said.

“I don’t feel like it will take my job away”Isabella Orsi, 24, an interior designer in San Francisco, recently used a generative AI app called InteriorAI to create a mock-up for a client.The client, a tech startup, was looking to spruce up its office. Orsi uploaded photos of the client’s office to InteriorAI, then applied a “cyberpunk” filter. The app produced new renderings in seconds — showing what the office’s entryway would look like with colored lights, contoured furniture and a new set of shelves.Orsi thinks that rather than replacing interior designers entirely, generative AI will help them come up with ideas during the initial phase of a project.“I think there’s an element of good design that requires the empathetic touch of a human,” she said. “So I don’t feel like it will take my job away. Somebody has to discern between the different renderings, and at the end of the day, I think that needs a designer.”“It’s like working with a really willful concept artist”Patrick Clair, 40, a filmmaker in Sydney, Australia, started using AI-generated art this year to help him prepare for a presentation to a film studio.

Clair, who has worked on hit shows including “Westworld,” was looking for an image of a certain type of marble statue. But when he went looking on Getty Images — his usual source for concept art — he came up empty. Instead, he turned to DALL-E 2.  He predicted that rather than replacing concept artists or putting Hollywood special effects wizards out of a job, AI image generators would simply become part of every filmmaker’s tool kit.“It’s like working with a really willful concept artist,” he said.

“Photoshop can do things that you can’t do with your hands, in the same way a calculator can crunch numbers in a way that you can’t in your brain, but Photoshop never surprises you,” he continued. “Whereas DALL-E surprises you and comes back with things that are genuinely creative.”“What if we could show what the dogs playing poker looked like?”During a recent creative brainstorm, Jason Carmel, 49, an executive at New York advertising agency Wunderman Thompson, found himself wondering if AI could help.“We had three and a half good ideas,” he said of his team. “And the fourth one was just missing a visual way of describing it.”

The image they wanted — a group of dogs playing poker, for an ad being pitched to a pet medicine company — would have taken an artist all day to sketch. Instead, they asked DALL-E 2 to generate it.“We were like, what if we could show what the dogs playing poker looked like?” Carmel said.The resulting image didn’t end up going into an ad, but Carmel predicts that generative AI will become part of every ad agency’s creative process. He doesn’t, however, think that using AI will meaningfully speed up the agencies’ work or replace their art departments. He said many of the images generated by AI weren’t good enough to be shown to clients and that users who weren’t experienced users of these apps would probably waste a lot of time trying to formulate the right prompts.  “This is a sketch tool”Sarah Drummond, a service designer in London, started using AI-generated images a few months ago to replace the black-and-white sketches she did for her job. These were usually basic drawings that visually represented processes she was trying to design improvements for, like a group of customers lining up at a store’s cash register.Instead of spending hours creating what she called “blob drawings” by hand, Drummond, 36, now types what she wants into DALL-E 2 or Midjourney.  “Would I use it for final output? No. I would hire someone to fully make what we wanted to realize,” she said. “But the throwaway work that you do when you’re any kind of designer, whether it’s visual, architectural, urban planner — you’re sketching, sketching, sketching. And so this is a sketch tool.”

DAF-MIT AI Accelerator tackles challenge of cultivating, growing world-class AI workforce

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AFNS)  --  This month, the Department of the Air Force-Massachusetts Institute of Technology Artificial Intelligence Accelerator commenced their Lead AI pilot.

This pilot, hosted by the AI Accelerator’s Education Research team, is geared towards commanders, senior non-commissioned officers, and civilians in senior leadership roles. The team received over 1,400 applicants and selected 200 participants to formulate a diverse cohort across the DAF, sister services, Defense Department schoolhouse faculty members, and other government organizations.

During the course’s kick-off event, Col. Garry Floyd, DAF AIA director, encouraged the participants by asking, “AI is in and is coming to the battle space. The question is, what are we bringing and what is the pacing threat bringing?”

Col. Floyd continued, “As you learn about the capabilities and limitations of AI, please know that your AI Accelerator team here is working to make AI perform even better for the DAF’s use cases through our various lines of efforts.”

The AIA’s Education Research team is examining the challenge of educating, cultivating, and growing a world-class AI workforce in support of the DoD’s AI Education Strategy. With copious amounts of data and an increased reliance on data-driven technologies, the DoD must adopt AI at speed and at scale. Accelerated adoption is dependent on building and developing a workforce where all grades and roles thrive in the digital era.

For the past two years, the AI education team has tackled the challenge of how to educate an entire workforce as large and as diverse as the DAF. Previously, AI education occurred in traditional academic settings, consisting of students with prerequisite knowledge and similar backgrounds. However, to cultivate an AI-ready force, the team is investigating the process of teaching AI and machine learning capabilities to Airmen and Guardians of various rank and responsibility levels - from senior leaders, to developers and acquirers, and to operators who directly use AI-enabled capabilities.

Using the DoD AI Education Strategy as their roadmap, the research team examined variables like pedagogy, content and curriculum, and learning platforms and experiences for the six archetypes - or target audiences - identified in the strategy. The archetypes are segmented by role and expertise and fall into three major buckets: leaders, developers, and users. Along with a common foundation, concentrations within archetypes allow for tailored learning based on AI-related roles. The current pilot is geared toward senior leaders.

“In this pilot, [the cohort] will gain a practical grounding in AI and its business applications helping you transform your organizations into the workforce of the future,” said Maj. John Radovan, deputy director of the AIA during his introductory remarks. “The courses will provide a roadmap for the strategic implementation of AI technologies from the leadership context. We hope that you’ll be able to harness key AI management and leadership insights to support informed, strategic decision making.”

The current cohort may volunteer to take part in a corresponding study to better understand the optimal learning experience, guide the design for future AI education programs, and inform how to scale-up versions of the program. The diverse cohort will provide crucial data for the research team to expand and improve for the next iteration. Findings from the study will assist future business decisions to ultimately advance the AI education and training of an elite, AI-ready force.

Reach for the stars because you might just become one! Drina Shah has a fascination with space exploration and engineering. Engineering and space exploration are two things that Drina Shah finds fascinating. Shah was given the chance to work on the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative Project while he was in high school. She was one of eight students from her school to become a finalist out of six schools from around the country.With her accomplishment from high school and her interest in space exploration and engineering, she sought out an internship with NASA whose values greatly align with hers.Artificial Intelligence ProjectShah is currently a Senior at Mooresville High School in North Carolina and a former NASA virtual intern at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The project that Shah worked on during her internship was an Artificial Intelligence based science translator for the spread of hydrological information.  Dreams Do Come TrueNASA’s mission of innovating for the benefit of humanity and inspiring the world through discovery, as well as its core values of safety, integrity, teamwork, excellence, and inclusion inspired Shah to work for NASA. This internship meant the world to her and ended up being the very first job that she has ever had.“It really was a dream come true opportunity for me and I’m sure it will help propel my career and my interest in space, engineering, and artificial intelligence,” Shah said.If you are looking for a dream opportunity, check out NASA’s internship website for more information. You can also feel free to check out other fascinating stories such as Rose Ferreira, who found hope in the Moon, and Nicholas Houghton, who has a dream of becoming an astronaut and became an intern with an exciting position.

With the advent of the ability of artificial intelligence (""AI"") to alter an individual's voice and image (whether in deepfakes or expressly fictional works), it is critical to determine who – if anyone – owns the right to do so, particularly when the voice or image is clearly identified with a fictional character from an existing film. This issue is highlighted by the recent license by James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader) of his voice to an AI company. While articles state that the license of his voice was for use by Disney (the owner of the Star Wars franchise), the transaction raises the following questions: (a) could anyone use his voice without permission and (b) could James Earl Jones have licensed his voice to third parties for use in other films, particularly if used in the distinctive manner of Darth Vader?


This article will refer to the individual whose voice or image is at issue as the ""Individual,"" the licensee of AI rights as the ""AI Licensee,"" the new AI work incorporating the voice or image as the ""AI Work,"" and any prior work that the voice or image is taken from, or resembles elements of, as the ""Prior Work.""

The right to a voice or image can generally be divided into two categories: (a) the right of publicity (under various guises, including right of privacy, trademark, deepfake laws, or unfair competition) and (b) copyright, to the extent voice or image for the AI Work is taken from, or resembles elements of, a Prior Work.

PROMOTED
Let's first deal with the right of publicity. For simplicity, this article does not discuss whether or not a particular court has the authority to hear a case (jurisdiction over the defendant), but just the choice of law that a court that does have such jurisdiction will apply. Critically, the majority of courts in the U.S. apply the law of the domicile of the Individual (or their domicile at the time of death), by treating the right of publicity as personal property (the ""Domicile Rule""). For example, if the Individual is (or was at the time of death) domiciled in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of publicity, then anyone can exploit an AI Work using their voice or image in a jurisdiction that follows the Domicile Rule. However, some courts in the U.S. (and most courts outside the U.S.) apply the law of the jurisdiction where the AI Work is exploited (the ""Exploitation Rule""), such as by targeting customers in the jurisdiction, while a passive website that is merely open to the public without pay will not trigger the laws of that jurisdiction. In either case, the location of the domicile or headquarters of the AI Licensee is irrelevant.

Once it is established what laws apply, the next question is whether those laws enforce the right of publicity. While most U.S. states recognize this right during the life of the Individual, some states limit protection to celebrities, some limit it to advertising, and many don't recognize it all after the death of the Individual. In addition, many foreign countries don't recognize the right at all (or it is impossible to enforce it as a practical matter).

If the relevant law does protect the right of publicity, the final question will be whether the Individual's voice or image is recognizable in the AI Work, since a claim is only valid if that is the case. For example, the voice of James Earl Jones is instantly recognizable, even if most people don't know him by name, and that will almost certainly remain the case in any AI Work that uses his voice.

It is reported that James Earl Jones lives in New York, a state that protects the right of publicity against a commercial use and permits that right to be inherited. Thus, the AI Licensee of his voice should have enforceable rights to use his voice even after his death, both in states that follow the Domicile Rule and in states that follow the Exploitation Rule, but not in jurisdictions that do not follow either rule (e.g., many countries outside the U.S.). In addition, New York (as well as California) do not provide protection after death of the Individual for an AI Work that is for entertainment, such as a movie, so anyone could use James Earl Jones voice in another movie without permission after his death in a jurisdiction that follows the Domicile Rule.

If the Individual has consented to the AI Work (or their consent is not required under the analysis above), the next issue to be considered is copyright, which is a two-fold inquiry: (a) whether the voice or image was taken from some Prior Work and (b) whether the AI Work resembles elements of a Prior Work.
If the voice or image of the Individual is initially copied from a Prior Work in order to be altered by AI, that copying alone is technically copyright infringement (even if the resulting AI Work does not resemble any elements of the Prior Work), although most courts would apply the fair use defense to permit the initial copying.
A separate issue is whether the AI Work resembles elements of a Prior Work, regardless of the source of the voice or image. For example, what if an AI Work is created by an AI Licensee other than Disney using the distinctive voice of James Earl Jones to create a new villain named Dark Hater that has the same voice as Darth Vader? While an Individual's voice is generally not protected by copyright, if an AI Work uses a voice or image that the public associates with a particular fictitious character (live or animated) from a Prior Work, the owner of the Prior Work may have a valid claim for copyright infringement of that character, although a claim based solely on imitating the voice of a fictitious character is untested.
So murky waters indeed, and as always, the law will be forced to catch up with technology. This will be a fun one to watch.

There’s little question artificial intelligence and machine learning are playing an increased role in making business decisions. A 2022 survey of senior data and technology executives by NewVantage Partners found that 92% of large companies reported achieving returns on their data and AI investments — an increase from 48% in 2017.

But as these technologies enter the mainstream, new issues arise: How will they change the nature of workflow and workplace connection? Will they be ethically harnessed? Will they replace humans?
Here’s what to consider as AI and machine learning become omnipresent, according to MIT Sloan researchers, visiting scholars, and industry experts.
Artificial intelligence is changing most occupations, but it is far from replacing humans, according to a book examining the findings of the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future.





92%

Some 92% of large companies report that they are achieving returns on their investments in data and artificial intelligence. 
MIT researchers David Autor, David Mindell, and Elisabeth B. Reynolds argue it is essential to understand the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence as we think about how it will impact jobs.
Today’s AI challenges center around physical dexterity, social interaction, and judgment. Consider a home health aide, whose responsibilities include providing physical assistance to a fragile human, observing their behavior, and communicating with family and doctors. Not until automation reaches that level can it truly be considered what scholars call “artificial general intelligence.""
It’s possible to harness AI to create a more equitable future. Across industries, workers are worried that automation and artificial intelligence will steal their jobs. MIT Sloan professor of managementThomas Kochanshares those concerns, but also sees “tremendous” innovative potential in new technologies to create “a productive and more equitable future.”
In his online executive education course, “Leading the Future of Work,” Kochan lays out a four-pronged roadmap for work of the future:
Strive to become a “high road” company that creates value for all stakeholders, including their employees.
Use advanced technology to drive innovation and augment work. 
Train and upskill the workforce to work alongside new technologies. 
Rebuild a dialogue with labor leaders for a mutually beneficial future. 
An AI-fueled productivity boom is on the way. Consider the internet: Its fundamental technologies took root in the 1960s and 1970s but didn’t become commercialized until the mid-1990s. Stanford University’s Erik Brynjolfsson, part of the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future, calls this phenomenon a “J-curve,” when technological acceptance is “slow and incremental at first, then accelerates to break through into broad acceptance.”
Now, businesses should prepare for an AI-fueled J-curve as the technology takes off. Companies should focus on incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning  into work processes and preparing employees, Brynjolfsson said at an EmTech Next conference, while policymakers should move to ensure its adoption doesn’t contribute to inequality.

AI requires stakeholder buy-in. Machine learning tools are used in a variety of fields. But getting tech into the workplace is just one step — these tools are only successful if they’re integrated into workflows and if people trust them enough to depend on them.
A key to successful adoption is an ongoing dialogue between technology developers and end users, according to research from MIT Sloan professorKate Kelloggand co-authors.
“Managers and developers need to engage in a back-and-forth process to build, evaluate, and refine the tools in order for them to be useful in practice,” Kellogg said.
Moreover, stakeholders need to believe that AI programs are accurate and trustworthy. Artificial intelligence explainability can help. Researchers from the MIT Center for Information Systems Research define AI explainability as “the ability to manage AI initiatives in ways that ensure models are value-generating, compliant, representative, and reliable.”
Artificial intelligence explainability is an emerging field, the researchers admit. They recommend that companies start by identifying units and organizations that are already creating effective AI explanations, and identifying practices that the organization’s own AI project teams have already adopted.
AI and machine learning are transforming digital marketing. Most marketers are concerned about retention and revenue, but without good forecasts, decisions about effective marketing interventions can be arbitrary, saidDean Eckles,social and digital experimentation research group lead at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy.
Machine learning will change that, helping to predict customer behavior and intuit customer needs.
“There’s a lot of value to applying statistical machine learning to predict long-term and hard-to-measure outcomes,” Eckles said.
Companies such as Wayfair and Spotify leverage machine learning for bespoke customer experiences, from highly tailored furniture search results to personalized suggested playlists. And, when COVID-19 spread, Moderna used its long-held automated processes and AI algorithms to increase the number of small-scale messenger RNA (mRNA) needed to run clinical experiments. This groundwork contributed to Moderna releasing one of the first COVID-19 vaccines (using mRNA) in the pandemic’s early days.
Good data makes for good AI. Having five essential data capabilities, such as data scientists and a data platform, helps companies build successful artificial intelligence programs.
The key is to take an enterprise — rather than local — perspective as AI project teams learn and mature, according to researchers from MIT CISR. When companies identify and accumulate expertise and practices from their AI teams, they can create reusable and refinable practices and build capability. This accelerates new AI projects and sets up those future teams for success.
Embracing data-centric AI is also important. This is “the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to build a successful AI system,” according to Andrew Ng, SM ’98, founder of the Google Brain research lab and former chief scientist at Baidu.
Focusing on high-quality data that's consistently labeled could unlock the value of AI for sectors such as health care, government technology, and manufacturing, Ng said at a EmTech Digital conference.
And even if AI can’t solve all of the world’s problems — and might even cause some new ones along the way — it can at least make Wordle a little bit easier to solve.

'Think beyond the label': How AI developers can build patient trust and improve transparency

Andrea Park

Artificial Intelligence

AdvaMed














Digital technologies represent “a real opportunity to move past some of the traditional frameworks and into models that can work better for patients,” Brendan O’Leary, acting director of the FDA’s digital health center of excellence, said during a panel at the AdvaMed MedTech Conference on Monday. (iambuff/	iStock/Getty Images Plus)
BOSTON—Artificial intelligence is often seen as a “black box,” a scary concept that becomes even more so as the technology becomes increasingly embedded in the healthcare industry.It’s crucial, then, that AI developers—and especially those in medtech—take care to build trust with their users and be transparent not only about how their algorithms work but also about their intended results and how, exactly, they’ll use patient data.That was a key point of discussion during a panel entitled “Artificial Intelligence in Medical Devices: Post Pandemic Implications” at the AdvaMed MedTech Conference in Boston on Monday.RelatedFDA clears Philips AI for making CT-like images from head and neck MRI scansAs Yuri Maricich, M.D., chief medical officer and head of development at Pear Therapeutics, pointed out, a core part of creating that transparency with both doctors and patients lies in the way AI-based technologies are labeled and marketed.“One of the key things that we can all do is try to standardize in as many areas as possible,” he suggested, including in educating patients about how new technologies will use their data.“Typically, when we make a pure hardware or a pill, patients aren’t expecting to give their information back to the manufacturer. With connected devices, we’re asking them to give their information back to the manufacturer, so we have this almost sacred duty to protect that data if we’re going to maintain trust,” Maricich said. “If we violate that trust, it’s going to make it so much harder for all of us to actually bring technologies that are really effective.”RelatedAI spots signs of mental health issues in text messages on par with human psychiatrists: UW studyCassie Scherer, Medtronic’s senior director of digital health policy and regulatory strategy, suggested that more flexible labeling policies from the FDA could help AI developers do a better job of reaching users where they are.“Some patients might actually read the label … but there’s also a lot who just want to know, ‘What do I do with this? How do I use it and feel better?’” she said. “And it’s the same thing for physicians, where the amount of information that’s given depends on the technology, depends on how they’re using it in the clinic.”One possible solution is electronic labeling, Scherer said, which can do a better job than physical labels in keeping up with any updates or modifications to an AI algorithm over time. Electronic labels can also be adapted to a wider range of patient needs, with different languages, various text options to help those who are visually impaired and the potential to even add video content to a label.The FDA is on board. “Especially with software, we have an opportunity to think beyond the label,” Brendan O’Leary, acting director of the agency’s digital health center of excellence, said during the panel. “Patients don’t read labeling for the most part—and why should they?—but they do onboard these products. So how do you have an onboarding experience that answers that fundamental patient question: ‘How do I know this will work for me?’”With that key question in mind, he said, digital technologies represent “a real opportunity to move past some of the traditional frameworks and into models that can work better for patients.”

Researchers from the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering and the Florida State University Department of Statistics are teaming up in a National Science Foundation-funded study that could help people perform better in manufacturing and other industries that rely on humans.
Chiwoo Park, an associate professor in the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, and Anuj Srivastava, a professor in the Department of Statistics in FSU’s College of Arts and Sciences, are developing a motion-and-time analysis to measure the various motions of the human body during work. The NSF is funding the $375,425 study.
Human performance varies because of many factors, including an individual’s training level, errors and fatigue. Through this research, the team hopes to create standardized work practices and identify optimal ways for people to perform tasks.
Park and Srivastava published previous research on this subject in Operations ResearchExternal Link, and their NSF study will build on that work by using artificial intelligence to collect measurements faster and more accurately than manual methods.
“Motion-and-time-analysis traditionally involves many labor-intensive steps such as timing with stopwatches and manual data analysis,” Park said. “We want to exploit modern motion sensor technology and artificial intelligence to automate these manual steps so that the analysis can be performed on a regular basis for process analysis and improvement.”
Data analysis for human operations is critical in applications such as ergonomics, health care and service industries that involve repetitive manual tasks. Grocery stores, theme parks, factories, offices and hospitals are just some of the workplaces where improved analysis could make an impact.
Analyzing the shapes that make up a person’s body is difficult because the camera angle, image quality and other clutter in the scene can complicate data capture. Different people have different styles of movement, gait patterns and paces of work that must be factored into analysis.
“We are developing statistical techniques that help capture typical motion patterns and relate them to industrial performance metrics,” Srivastava said. “Interdisciplinary collaborations such as this are driving the latest innovations in scientific research and data science, so it is exciting to have this opportunity.”

How does artificial intelligence work?
As the excitement surrounding AI has grown, businesses have been scurrying to showcase how their goods and services include AI. What they call AI is frequently just one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires specialized hardware and software to write and train machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but a handful is prominent, including Python, R, and Java.

AI systems generally consume vast volumes of labeled training data, evaluate the data for correlations and patterns, and then use these patterns to forecast future states. By examining millions of instances, a chatbot given examples of text chats may learn to make lifelike dialogues with humans. In contrast, an image recognition program can learn to recognize and describe items in photographs.
Learning, reasoning, and self-correction are the three cognitive functions that AI programming focuses on.
Learning processes – This component of AI programming is concerned with gathering data and developing rules for converting the data into usable information. The rules, known as algorithms, teach computer equipment how to execute a specific task step-by-step.
Reasoning processes – This area of AI programming is concerned with selecting the best method to achieve a given result.
Self-correction procedures – This feature of AI programming is intended to constantly fine-tune algorithms and guarantee they provide the most accurate results possible.
Understanding the various types of artificial intelligence categorization
Because AI research aims to make computers mimic human-like functioning, the degree to which an AI system can reproduce human skills is utilized as a criterion for classifying AI. Thus, AI may be classed into one of several classes based on how a machine compares to humans in terms of variety and performance. In such a system, an AI that can execute more human-like functions with comparable competency levels is deemed more advanced. In contrast, an AI with restricted functionality and performance is considered more straightforward and less evolved.
Based on this criterion, AI is often categorized into two categories. One classification is based on AI and AI-enabled robots’ resemblance to human minds and their ability to “think” and maybe “feel” like humans. According to this categorization system, there are four categories of AI or AI-based systems: reactive machines, limited memory machines, theory of mind, and self-aware AI.
Reactive machines have no memory and are task-specific. One example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess software that defeated Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can recognize pieces on the chessboard and make predictions, but it cannot utilize past experiences to influence future ones since it lacks memory.
Limited memory – Because these AI systems have memories, they may utilize previous experiences to guide future judgments. This is how some of the decision-making mechanisms of self-driving automobiles are created.
Theory of mind is a word used in psychology. When applied to AI, this indicates that the machine has the social intelligence to comprehend emotions. This sort of AI can predict human behavior and infer human intents, an essential talent for AI systems to become integral members of human teams.
Self-awareness – AI systems in this category have a feeling of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with self-awareness are aware of their present condition. This form of artificial intelligence does not yet exist.
The alternative categorization scheme that is more commonly used in technical jargon is the classification of technology into Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).
Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
This form of artificial intelligence encompasses all extant AI, including the most intricate and competent AI yet constructed. Artificial narrow intelligence refers to AI systems that can only do a single job independently while exhibiting human-like skills. These machines can only accomplish what they are designed to do, giving them a limited or narrow range of capabilities. According to the abovementioned categorization, these systems relate to all reactive and limited memory AI. ANI encompasses even the most advanced AI that employs machine learning and deep learning to train itself.
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
The capacity of an AI agent to learn, sense, understand, and function entirely like a human being is referred to as artificial general intelligence. By mimicking our multifunctional capacities, AI systems will be equally capable as humans. These systems will be able to build numerous competencies independently and make linkages and generalizations across domains, significantly reducing training time.
Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
The creation of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) will undoubtedly signal the apex of AI research, as ASI will be the most competitive form of intelligence on the planet. In addition to mimicking human intellect, ASI will be far superior at everything they perform due to vastly increased memory, quicker data processing and analysis, and decision-making skills. The advancement of AGI and ASI will result in a scenario known as a singularity. While having such powerful tools at our disposal is tempting, these devices may endanger our existence or, at the very least, our way of life.
What Is the Distinction Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?
Machine learning is a subset, or application, of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows the system to learn and grow from experience without having to be coded to that level. Data is used by Machine Learning to learn and get correct outcomes. Machine learning involves creating computer software that reads data and utilizes it to learn from itself.
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that includes the artificial neural network and the recurrent neural network. It uses algorithms and its approach to tackle any complicated issues. The algorithms are constructed in the same way as machine learning. However, there are many more tiers of algorithms. The algorithm’s networks are referred to as the artificial neural network. In much simpler terms, it duplicates the human brain since all neural networks in the brain are linked, which is the notion of deep learning.

The revisions, relayed during a simulated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission, allowed the drone to more accurately identify its target through automated recognition.“Red Hat Device Edge will enable Lockheed Martin to revolutionize artificial intelligence processing for our DOD customers’ most challenging missions,” Justin Taylor, Lockheed’s vice president of artificial intelligence, said in a statement. “The ability for small military platforms to handle large AI workloads will increase their capacity in the field, ensuring our military can stay ahead of evolving threats.”The Pentagon is increasingly interested in AI and machine learning, both on and off the battlefield; Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks in documents published earlier this year said an embrace of the technology is needed “to maintain our military advantage in a digitally competitive world.”RELATEDLockheed, Verizon testing 5G-linked drone swarm for intel collectionArmy, Air Force and Pentagon representatives, among others, attended a demonstration in May.By Colin DemarestThe department’s public spending on AI, including autonomy, grew from a little more than $600 million in fiscal 2016 to $2.5 billion in 2021. More than 600 AI projects — including several connected to major weapons systems, such as the MQ-9 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle — were underway as of April 2021.A majority of Pentagon AI activities fall under research and development, with a focus on recognizing targets, feeding recommendations to commanders, such as where to move troops or how to respond to a threat, and improving autonomy of uncrewed systems, according to the Government Accountability Office.“Lockheed Martin is at the forefront of global innovation that often defines a technological era,” Francis Chow, vice president and general manager of in-vehicle operating system and edge at Red Hat, said in a statement. “With our latest solution, Red Hat Device Edge, we’ll be able to work together to change what communications and artificial intelligence looks like in the most space-constrained and far-flung environments, whether it’s a remote mountain range or beyond the boundaries of Earth’s atmosphere.”Lockheed, the largest defense contractor by revenue, according to Defense News analysis, previously teamed with Red Hat to more quickly upgrade the Air Force’s F-22 Raptor. Before that, Red Hat joined Lockheed’s cybersecurity alliance. Other members included FireEye, Microsoft and Verizon.IBM acquired Red Hat in 2019 for $34 billion.About  Colin DemarestColin Demarest was a reporter at C4ISRNET, where he covered military networks, cyber and IT. Colin had previously covered the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration — namely Cold War cleanup and nuclear weapons development — for a daily newspaper in South Carolina. Colin is also an award-winning photographer.Share:More In Artificial IntelligencePentagon to expand industry pool for CJADC2 experimentationThe Pentagon held its first GIDE industry day on Tuesday, an effort to solidify a process for companies to integrate C2 tools into future experiments.South Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.",,,,Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2022/10/25/lockheed-ibms-red-hat-team-up-to-speed-ai-development-for-pentagon/,,,,,,,,

Major countries like Saudi Arabia that has lent US$3 million value of oil to Pakistan is on the verge of cancelling the deal due to non-payment. .Such political and economic chaos has brought the oil and gas industry to a state of complexity. New implications such as the drive for greener energy and demand for more customer-centric services are further adding furore to the shareholders. The oil and gas industry players are forced to make a significant re-evaluation of energy value chains, assets and operations. .Shocking reports on oil and gas industry changing its path opposite to the direction to tailwind keeps emerging. It is estimated that nearly 70% of global electricity production will be extracted from the wind and solar energy by 2050. More reports unravelled that 50% of all new cars sold globally will be electric models by 2033. Already, the use of renewable energy in vehicles is closely watched and changed with technological developments. With all the developments given, advances in digital technology are enabling drastic changes to the energy sector..To bring in digitisation to the energy industry, the sector should treat digital transformation like any other business corridors. They should bring innovation and effective solutions on the scale of purpose, goal and strategies. .But we can't conclude that the energy industry is ignoring the part to invest in digitisation. Reports unfold that energy companies are increasingly investing in digital technologies over the past few years, with global investment growing 20% annually since 2014. The investment spiked to US$47 billion in 2016. Estimates show that this is going to grow further with oil-focused digital services raising the investment from the current US$5 billion to over US$30 billion annually by 2025..Therefore, the energy sector is now open to adopting a change. With the emergence of technological developments, the pressure to decrease or cut carbon emissions and tackle the demand by tracking oil reserves in a cost-efficient way is increasing. As the next stage of development, the energy sector tends to acquire new workforce strategies and make data-driven decisions. .Few digital technologies that have already made an impact on the energy sector.Artificial intelligence to map oil reservoirs:.There are wrong perceptions that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the right innovative strategy to work in the energy sector. But to break the myth, cloud-based AI platforms are being developed to analyse subsurface geophysical data. The implication of cloud-based source to keep track of data provides quick solutions that are more accurate. Drilling methods in oil and gas industry could be utilised properly with the help of AI in tracking and finding the underground oil reservoirs. A report shows that the value of AI in the oil and gas industry will increase to US$2.85 billion by 2022 from US$1.57 billion in 2017. .Machine learning as a safe haven: .Machine learning will help offshore companies to function from a long distance without having to commute to the oil reserves often. AI can be used to assess the potential impacts of a new rig or drilling site. It can also aid in evaluating the environmental risks of a proposed project before the head. Machine learning services make the job safer with instrumental implementation. .IoT predicts machinery issues: .Internet of Things (IoT) is specifically designed to connect and make work easy by getting access from any place. When IoT is used in the oil and gas industry, it plays a crucial role in optimizing costs. It improves safety by enabling predictive maintenance, performance forecast and real-time risk management. IoT collects data through its connections to all items of machinery. Sensors will be able to detect machine failure even before human realisation. This could prevent accidents and save money by looking at the damage predominantly before the machine gets collapsed..Blockchain for easy transactions:.The best way to speed up transactions and reduce cost at the same time is by picking Blockchain to deal with money. Blockchain connects energy producers directly with customers. It provides a secure environment to potentially send and receive data amidst the broader network functions..Artificial intelligence featured technologies like Machine learning, blockchain, big data and IoT are setting oil and gas industry towards digitisation. The energy sector may face unprecedented challenges, but new technologies emerge every day to overcome and make the job simple..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

What are the Advantages of Artificial Intelligence? 
One of the most significant advantages of AI is its ability to automate tasks that are time-consuming or difficult for humans to do. Also, any boring task can be avoided by employees. By automating these tasks, businesses can operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, AI can help businesses to make better decisions by providing accurate and up-to-date information. 
AI is also helping to improve the quality of customer service. Good customer service is an everlasting effect of loyalty by customers. Businesses are using AI-powered chatbots to provide quick and efficient customer service. These chatbots can handle a large volume of customer queries and can provide accurate and helpful responses. The speed in these replies is fascinating. AI can help you make better decisions by providing insights that you may not have otherwise considered. For example, if you’re trying to decide which product to develop next, AI can help you analyze customer data to see which product would be the most popular.
Moreover, the 24/7 availability is very appealing. Unlike humans, AI can work around the clock without needing breaks. This can be beneficial if you need to offer customer support outside of regular business hours. 
Overall, AI is making a positive impact on businesses and individuals. AI is poised to transform the way we live and work. It is going to transform how we look at problem-solving issues on various levels.
Does Artificial Intelligence have Any Drawbacks?
Of course, nothing is perfect. There are a number of potential drawbacks to using AI technology, including
 1. The potential for biased results: AI systems can be biased in a number of ways, including by the data that is used to train them, the algorithms that are used, and the people who design and operate them. 
2. The potential for unintended consequences: AI systems can have unintended consequences when they are deployed in the real world, including when they interact with other systems. 
3. The potential for misuse and abuse: AI systems can be misused and abused by individuals, organizations, and governments. 
4. The potential for negative social and economic impact: AI systems can have negative social and economic impacts, including on employment and inequality. 
5. The potential for existential risk: AI systems could eventually become so powerful that they pose an existential risk to humanity.
How Does AI Impact the Economy and Employment? 
The rapid development of artificial intelligence is having a profound effect on the economy. Businesses are using AI to automate tasks and processes, to improve decision-making, and to develop new products and services. AI is also changing the nature of work, with some jobs being replaced by AI-powered machines and others requiring new skills. The economy is also being impacted by the increasing use of AI in society, with changes in consumer behavior and the way that people interact with technology.
The advent of artificial intelligence has had a profound impact on employment. Job satisfaction has increased as workers are able to focus on more creative and meaningful tasks, while machines handle the more routine and mundane tasks. However, there has also been a rise in unemployment as machines increasingly replace human workers in a variety of industries. This has led to increased inequality as those who are able to work with and benefit from AI technology reap the rewards, while those who are displaced by it are left behind.
AI in Our Daily Lives
There’s a good chance that you interact with AI every day without even realizing it. From the virtual assistant on your smartphone to the fraud detection system your bank uses, AI is slowly but surely becoming a part of our everyday lives. 
Here are just a few examples of how AI is hidden in our daily lives: 
– Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa are powered by AI. 
– Many of the recommendations you see on sites like Amazon and Netflix are generated by AI algorithms. 
– Google Search uses AI to understand what you’re searching for and deliver the most relevant results.
– Some social media sites use AI to help flag and remove inappropriate content.
– Many cars now come equipped with AI-powered features like self-driving and lane-keeping assist. 
– Some hospitals are using AI to help diagnose and treat patients. 
– AI is being used more and more for security purposes, such as facial recognition and security monitoring. 
– Many banks are using AI to help detect and prevent fraud. 
– Some people are even using AI to help them with their daily tasks
Is the Future Bright with AI
In the future, AI will become more and more sophisticated and will eventually surpass human intelligence. This will lead to a future where machines can think and process the information on their own, and humans will become increasingly reliant on them.
Some people believe that the future is bright with AI, while others believe that AI will bring about the end of humanity as we know it. It is difficult to say definitively which viewpoint is correct, but it seems likely that AI will play an increasingly important role in our lives in the future. With the rapid advances in AI technology, it is becoming more and more capable of completing tasks that were once thought to be exclusively human. As AI continues to evolve, it is likely that even more amazing feats will be accomplished by this technology.

For photographers of all skill levels, from amateurs to pros, it enables easier, faster, and better photo editing. Artificial intelligence aims to automate some semi-manual, uninteresting, and time-consuming processes. For instance, you might normally need to spend several hours adjusting brushes and masks to edit a portrait; however, using AI portrait editing software, you can finish the job in only a few clicks..You can save time by processing a batch of images automatically using AI photo-editing software rather than individually. Additionally, artificial intelligence avoids challenging editing constraints, making photo editing easier for beginners. The initial stage of editing for the majority of photographers entails a culling process in which you select the best photos from a large collection of imported pictures..Typically, you'll have to go through hundreds (and perhaps even thousands) of images to find the best ones before making a final decision. Some photographers even believe that this is the most time-consuming aspect of image processing because it can take many hours..In fact, rigorous filtering can harm your artistic vision. Since you've spent so much time going through (often identical) photographs, it's easy to become overly invested in the process or to become exhausted, which might lead you to reject important photos or keep photos that should be discarded..AI can be useful here. You may prevent human error, save time, and concentrate on what really matters: your in-depth editing job, by allowing artificial intelligence to choose the photos for you. For instance, Adobe has added a &quot;Best Photos&quot; function to Lightroom CC that automatically selects the best photograph from a collection of related pictures..The capability of AI to take low-quality photos and upscale them into high-resolution files is among the hottest subjects in the imaging community. Of course, you can use a tool like Photoshop to perform standard upscaling; you can enlarge the image using the application's fundamental methods. Photographers desire more, yet the standard upscaled quality is decent, which is where AI comes into play..Upscaled photographs appear fantastic thanks to artificial intelligence, which is also ideal for people with limited photo editing skills. In most cases, all you have to do is choose an application that uses AI upscaling, upload your image, and select the size you want. AI can process the image quite quickly, and the outcome is frequently superior to non-AI techniques. Eventually, AI will be able to upscale low-resolution photographs. Every day, technology advances, making it possible for the quality to surpass that of conventional upscaling techniques..Previously, backdrop replacement and selective editing required a lot of effort. In most cases, you would mask out certain portions of the image, which required carefully choosing the margins of the topic and could be rather tedious, especially with some subjects. Now, manual masking was (and still is!) an option, but it requires a high level of precision. Unwanted content ends up in your mask if you unintentionally mask the area outside of your target, which can lead to a lot of issues in the future..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Washington’s new ‘blueprint’ for government action highlights the growing gap with Brussels over the best way to regulate the emerging technology

The US government published a detailed plan for policing misuses of artificial intelligence sector by sector, rather than across all applications of the technology at once. The approach highlights a growing disagreement with the EU over AI regulation.
In what it called a “Blueprint for an ‘AI Bill of Rights’”, the White House on 4 October laid out in more detail than before how it proposes to protect people from misuse, fraud or errors as AI systems roll out across the economy. Rather than ban any particular AI technology such as facial recognition across the country, each government agency will work to prevent abuses of any AI technology in its own domain – whether housing, healthcare, transport, education, procurement or other fields.
In a background briefing with journalists the day before the report’s release, senior administration officials called it a “whole of government” policy involving 30 or more agencies, because each agency is best-placed to watch for and deal with possible abuses of the technology in its own area. 
“There is no one centralised bureau to deal with this,” said one official. “Instead, we’re identifying harm in each of those sectors, and having the agency responsible […] leading the enforcement action.”
The announcement comes amid growing international concern about abuses of AI – with some stark differences of opinion emerging between the US and EU, in particular, on how to deal with them.  In AI legislation now under debate in Brussels, the European Commission is looking to regulate not just abuses in particular sectors but has also zeroed in on particular AI technologies that it thinks problematic across all sectors – most notably, facial recognition.

Artificial intelligence in the workplace


When AI systems are used, there is an obligation to consider how they might affect fairness, accountability and transparency in the workplace

Far from being a futuristic concept relegated to the realms of science fiction, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace is becoming more common. The benefits of using AI are often cited by reference to time and productivity savings. However, the challenges of implementing AI into HR practice and procedures should not be underestimated.







AI technologies are already being used across a broad range of industries, at every stage in the employment cycle. From recruitment to dismissal, their use has significant implications. In recent months, incidents at Meta, Estee Lauder and payment service company Xsolla have hit the headlines for utilising AI when dismissing employees.  
All three companies used algorithms as part of their selection process. For Meta and Xsolla, the algorithms used analysed employee performance against key metrics to identify those who were “unengaged and unproductive”. These employees were subsequently dismissed.
Similarly, Estee Lauder used an algorithm when making three makeup artists redundant, which assessed employees during a video interview. The software measured the content of the women’s answers and expressions during interview and evaluated the results against other data about their job performance. It led to their dismissal. 
Where algorithms are used in place of human decision-making, they risk replicating and reflecting existing biases and inequalities in society. 
An AI system is created by a variety of participants, from those writing the code, inputting the instructions, those supplying the dataset on which the AI system is trained and those managing the process. There is significant scope for bias to be introduced at each stage. 
If, for example, a bias towards recruiting men is included in the dataset, or women are under-represented, this is likely to be replicated in the AI decision. The result is an AI system making decisions that reproduces inherent bias. If unaddressed, those biases can become exaggerated as the AI “learns” becoming more adept at differentiating using those biases.
To mitigate this risk, HR teams should test the technology with comparison between AI and human decisions looking for bias. This is only going to be effective in combating unconscious bias if the reviewers comprise a diverse group  themselves. If bias is discovered, the algorithm can and should be changed.
AI systems are increasingly being viewed by employers as an efficient way of measuring staff performance. While AI may identify top performers based on key business metrics, they lack personal experience, emotional intelligence and the ability to form an opinion to shape decisions. There is a danger that “low-performing” staff could be disregarded solely on an assessment of metrics. Smart employees are likely to find ways to manipulate AI to their advantage in a way that might not be so easy without technology.
It is tempting to trust AI to limit legal risks by using it for decision-making. Superficially, this may be right, but the potential unintended consequences of any AI system could easily create a lack of transparency and bias equivalent to that of its human creators. 
When AI systems are used, there is an obligation to consider how these might impact on fairness, accountability and transparency in the workplace. There is also a risk of employers exposing themselves to costly discrimination claims, particularly where the policy of using AI disadvantages an employee because of a protected characteristic (such as sex or race) and discriminatory decisions are made as a result.
Until AI develops to outperform humans in learning from mistakes or understanding the law, its use is unlikely to materially mitigate risk in the meantime.

“We can view happiness in at least three ways—as a hedonic state, as a cognitive state, or as a general life philosophy. Happiness, then, can refer to a way of thinking, such as being optimistic; a way of feeling joy, pleasure, relief, or gratitude; or simply a way of being.”— Dr. Nancy Etcoff, Professor of Psychology, Harvard Medical School

Last week, a paper I co-authored with the scientists from Deep Longevity, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Stanford, went viral and was covered in Fortune, Fox News, The Hill, New York Post, The Guardian and many other top-tier international media. In this study, the team used AI to analyze the psychological and biological changes during aging. This was the fourth peer-reviewed paper that tried to use AI to understand the changes in human psychology that transpire during aging but the first one to link biology with psychology. One day I will tell the personal story why a group of hardcore scientists studying biology and chemistry using AI decided to venture into psychology but these studies convinced me that human psychological aging is much more important than most scientists in biological sciences tend to believe. I firmly believe that the psychological age defines us much more than the biological age even though these ages, as this recent study showed, are closely connected. And as Laura Carstensen showed in her pioneering work on the Socio-Emotional Selectivity Theory (SST), psychological aging is plastic - we have the toolkit to modify it. And the recent study on aging and happiness demonstrated that it may be possible to get psychologically younger and happier at the same time. The results were so convincing that I started using some of these tools myself. Let’s take a deeper dive into how research in the psychology of aging and AI tools can help us adjust our psychological age and improve our well-being.

Longevity Mindfulness: How Can Artificial Intelligence Help You Better Understand Yourself?

Age is much more than the number of times you saw Earth’s orbit around the sun. As the body grows old, our minds are often instigated by mental decline and progressive, natural psychological aging. People’s bodies age at different rates, and both mindset and environment shape and defy their aging dynamics. Importantly, our psychological state influences our perception of time and health status. Also known as subjective age, an individual's psychological age is based on how young or old one perceives themselves to be in comparison to their chronological age, depending on an individual’s self-assessment of the degree of aging, and how this perception influences their well-being in general.

Years of research on well-being and longevity have shown that psychological well-being is tightly linked to physical health, mood variations, and supportive social networks. As we grow older, our mental state starts stabilizing, with negative emotions being more easily managed, and our social networks becoming smaller, as we search for deeper connections with a small group of friends. In parallel, our sense of psychological well-being and life satisfaction becomes greater, given an accumulated lifetime of experiences dealing with adversity and daily hassles.

One theory that fairly explains this changing time perspective was proposed by Stanford’s Dr. Carstensen, the socio-emotional selectivity theory, whereby motivation and goal pursuit by younger people, that have a lifetime ahead of themselves, is related to the acquisition of knowledge (for example, taking a university degree). In contrast, in older adults, when time is perceived as limited, emotional-based goals take priority.

Most typically addressed as the answer to “How old do you feel?”, we constantly find ourselves at internal crossroads striving to better understand ourselves and our inner states and to manage our and others’ expectations in terms of natural, “healthy” aging. But… can we anticipate how long we’ll live? Can we develop a longevity-oriented mindset rather than a failure one and prepare for a longer, more enjoyable, and more productive lifespan? Are there any tools to help us figure out better prospects and sharpen our perception of life?
While much progress has been made during the last decades regarding the identification of markers used to assess biological aging, including those based on biochemical, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and microbiome-related signatures, these do not accurately translate one’s state of psychological aging. Although the discovery of such markers has given great promise regarding the development of therapeutic intervention strategies, knowledge about the factors that modulate one’s subjective age is still missing as well as potential therapeutic avenues. As subjective age, itself can be influenced by various parameters, including personal experiences, social relationships, and cultural values, identifying biomarkers and designing tools that can measure changes in one’s psychological age is much needed.
Over the last couple of decades, the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, namely in machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques, has allowed the identification of meaningful patterns in human behavior and psyche. Its crossover with the fields of psychology and longevity granted the opportunity to envision neural networks capable of creating digital models of aging — aging clocks — that can capture the influence of multiple aging processes (e.g., DNA methylation) and possible outcomes (e.g., mortality risk) to predict human chronological age.
Exciting research on AI-based engines sheds light on novel tools that can estimate one’s psychological age and future well-being based on a constructed psychological survey. Basically, these AI tools can be used to determine ways of improving and maximizing well-being long-term based on inferred information from available datasets. Using data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset, two models have been previously designed, PsychoAge and SubjAge, to project chronological and subjective age, respectively, in a robust, validated and predictive manner across different age groups and taking into consideration 50 psychosocial features. Both clocks contained actionable features that could be modified using social and behavioral interventions and, importantly, that may prove to be useful in shifting personal perception of aging towards a mindset that promotes productive and healthy behaviors.
More recently, using the same dataset, the Deep Longevity team proposed a new model that works as a recommendation engine that advises a person seeking self-improvement based on its neuropsychological characteristics. In technical terms, it is an unsupervised learning algorithm that integrates the information from a respondent, places it on a 2D map of all possible psychological profiles (i.e., psychotypes), and then derives suitable ways to improve current and future psychological well-being based on self-organizing maps (SOMs). Although we have previously released Young.AI App, an AI platform to keep track of the aging process, Deep Longevity has now elevated its findings and released a web service FuturSelf, a free online application that provides a report with insights aimed at improving users’ long-term mental well-being based on their responses to the psychological test described in the original publication. Participants can actually enroll in a program that provides guidance based on AI-chosen recommendations, which I find really exhilarating. This novel tool shows great promise because it provides unparalleled personalization supported by scientifically sound data while offering an exciting perspective on psychological aging, long-term well-being, and risk of age-related disorders. It further demonstrates the application of machine learning approaches to the issues of psychological health. Right now, the team is working on a follow-up study on the effects of happiness on physiological measures of aging.Tired of Life, after 1892.

""Older"" Psychological Age May Signal Problems
As life expectancy in developed countries has been steadily increasing during the last century, several studies have also suggested that a lower (or younger) subjective age is associated with better mental and physical health, cognitive and emotional processing, and overall increased well-being and life satisfaction. In other words, feeling mentally younger than one’s chronological age is considered a protective factor to buffer against the negative impact of aging and all its associated perks. Perceiving oneself as subjectively younger than one’s chronological age may influence several age-related biological changes. Conversely, a higher (or older) subjective age is significantly associated with increased frailty and decline in healthy behaviors, mental health, and survival rate. Interestingly, people with an older subjective age have been shown to have higher levels of systemic inflammation, higher risk of obesity, pulmonary and muscular dysfunctions as well as increased incidence of certain diseases. Biological correlates of this phenomenon have also shown that subjective aging is associated with health-related problems. Indeed, previous studies have found an association between older subjective age and higher levels of albumin, systemic inflammation and obesity. In line with this, perceived older age has been associated with certain diseases such as diabetes and, more importantly, psychiatric disorders. This links well with the fact that people with mental disorders have been found to be at greater risk of aging faster and developing age-related diseases, showing that mental state and perception may accelerate aging effects. Stress is a well-known triggering factor for mood swings and a key modulator of the pace of aging. Accordingly, chronic stress is a key source of psychiatric manifestations, namely depression, and unhappiness and may as well greatly impact the way one perceives aging effects.
The rise in life expectancy has led to substantial variability in one’s assessment of psychological age, with individuals perceiving themselves and others as substantially younger or older than their actual chronological age. This shift in the perception of subjective age has profound effects on behavior and well-being, and is linked to an individual’s mindset and lifespan progression. Subjective age is by itself a significant predictor of many psychological factors among older adults. Indeed, as I previously stated, research shows that individuals with younger subjective age display a tendency to have better mental health. Thus, tools that measure, analyze, and predict psychological aging as well as methodological approaches that modulate longevity expectations and psychological aging states are important to improve perceived health status and general well-being.A woman moves to comfort a co-worker who is slumped over her desk in despair, circa 1940.

Can Psychological Age Reversal Make You Unhappy?
One important aspect about predictive digital tools (the aging clocks abovementioned) is that they can be ""reversed"" using social and behavioral interventions. But, although I have previously given 10 tips to reverse your psychological age (from forming meaningful social connections to learning a new foreign language), this may not be ideal in every scenario. While there is a consensus among longevity researchers that preventing some biological features from entering senescence may revert some aspects of physiological aging, things are much different on the realm of psychological aging. As we age at different rhythms, both physically and mentally, it may be difficult to find the correct way to rejuvenate your psychological age. Moreover, since we get “happier” as we grow old, to better cope with the prospect of imminent decline and death, employing strategies to reverse or rejuvenate your psychological age in an uncontrollable fashion may actually lead to reduced well-being. In fact, new experiments are now being designed to employ different strategies to rejuvenate older adults and change their mindset and perceptions using counterclockwise psychological interventions.
Feeling a ‘young spirit’ in an older body may not be that great. In my opinion, a tight balance between your chronological and biological age with your psychological age needs to happen. On one hand, there is a demand for tools that determine an individual’s exact biological age — which are already available in the market — and, on the other hand, mechanisms in place to infer one’s psychological age and match it accordingly. Installing AI-based models and tools capable of finetuning that balance is crucial to improve the future of mental health.
Indeed, recent AI technology has given a glimpse of this possibility. It has provided a means to find the optimal path to emotional stability. As mentioned before, this new deep learning model can predict one’s current psychological age and guide future well-being, providing personalized recommendations for optimizing one’s mental resilience. The SOM built within the model offers a set of non-trivial, personalized paths towards improved well-being that can be utilized as a reference for purposes of cognitive behavioral therapy and online mental health approaches. Perhaps, this tool can be used as a complement or even as a standalone approach to adjust one’s psychological age and provide emotional improvement and mental steadiness. Not only is it transversal to different areas of research, including psychology, psychiatry, longevity, and gerontology, but it may also be used in several applications in both medical and biotechnology industries.A group of happy people generated using Midjourney AIAlex Zhavoronkov, PhD, Midjourney AI
Recovering Psychological Youthfulness After the COVID-19 Pandemic
Several recent reports show that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the mental health situation worldwide. Growing psychological distress, boredom, and feelings of isolation and loneliness have led to a decrease on individual well-being that is hampering society’s productivity and ability to endure these challenging times. Most likely, during COVID-19 outbreak's initial stages, people became less optimistic and psychologically older. While in the US life expectancy in 2021 dropped by 1.6 years due to COVID-19, suggesting its toll on both physical and psychological health, China’s zero-COVID policies have substantially averted surges in mortality, surpassing the life expectancy rates in the US, despite Chinese data for 2021 not being yet available. Overall, many people became less optimistic due to constant lockdowns and the inability to travel and meet new people. The lack of freedom and closedness most likely worsened subjective aging in several groups of people, especially those more susceptible to the effects of environmental factors or with a greater socio-emotional burden. Surprisingly, indicators of relative biological and psychological aging of certain individuals were found to affect the frequency and severity of the disease, with the combination of high indicators of biological age and underestimated psychological age dangerously increasing the likelihood of developing severe forms of the disease.
But, as I’ve addressed before, older adults may be more resilient to the influence of stress and aging, thus, less likely to suffer from psychological aging effects. In line with this, studies suggest that older age may indeed buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health, although the long-term consequences may vary across countries and cultures. Findings highlight the link between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms, yet to be uncovered, to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is why it is important continuous research into psychological aging, measures of happiness and the development of new tools that may help reverse psychological aging and improve well-being.
Hence, it is for current research on AI, psychological aging and longevity to harness the potential of machine learning and digital tools for a safe and modern future that relies on models and approaches such as the ones previously mentioned to improve psychological health and well-being on a self-guided level or in a therapeutical/interventional context. The emergence of tools that can precisely estimate psychological aging, predict disorder trajectory, identify changes in an individual’s behavior, and provide data that informs personalized medical care is ever more promising and will revolutionize the future of human performance and digital health.

<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies hold the promise of streamlining employment and hiring processes across all industries. </p>
<p>Historically, the courts and regulatory enforcement agencies have analyzed these tools under local, state, and federal anti-discrimination laws and treated them the same as other employment selection procedures used in hiring. However, in December 2021, the New York City Council enacted <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4344524&amp;GUID=B051915D-A9AC-451E-81F8-6596032FA3F9&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search"" target=""_blank"">Local Law 144</a> (the AI Law), which prohibits employers from using automated employment selection tools unless specific bias audit and notice requirements are met. </p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2023, it will be unlawful for an employer or employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) to screen a candidate or employee unless: (1) the tool has undergone a bias audit no more than one year prior to its use, (2) a summary of the most recent bias audit is made publicly available, and (3) notice of use of the AEDT and an opportunity to request an alternative selection process is provided to each employee or candidate who resides in New York City. In doing so, New York City joined <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2557&amp;GAID=15&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101"" target=""_blank"">Illinois</a>, <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://legiscan.com/MD/text/HB1202/2020"" target=""_blank"">Maryland</a>, and several other jurisdictions in efforts to regulate AI in the workplace to decrease hiring and promotion bias. </p>
<p>Now, New York City has finally issued proposed rules providing more guidance on the AI Law before it takes effect.</p>
<h3>PROPOSED RULES</h3>
<p>On September 23, 2022, the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) published <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DCWP-NOH-AEDTs-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">proposed rules</a> related to the implementation of the AI Law (the Proposed Rules). The Proposed Rules provide additional clarity on the AI Law&rsquo;s requirements and answer some key employer questions.</p>
<p>For instance, the Proposed Rules seem to clarify that an employer <strong>can</strong> use a bias audit commissioned by a vendor and based on historic vendor data to meet the AI Law&rsquo;s requirements. Employers are apparently not obligated to commission their own independent review of a tool&rsquo;s impact on their particular applicant pool. However, the Proposed Rules do not account for a scenario where the vendor is also the developer, which is the case with many AEDT companies.</p>
<p>The Proposed Rules also define the term &ldquo;independent auditor&rdquo; to mean any &ldquo;person or group that is not involved in using or developing an AEDT.&rdquo; This broad definition seems to allow employers to partner with a range of entities to conduct an audit, including those it may use for other evaluations or services.  </p>
<p>Additionally, the Proposed Rules do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clarify that the AI Law applies only when AEDT simplified output (such as a score, tag, classification, or ranking) is (1) the sole criteria relied upon, without considering other factors, (2) given more weight than any other criteria, or (3) used to overrule or modify conclusions derived from other factors, such as human decisionmaking. </li>
    <li>Set forth minimum required elements for a bias audit, including (1) calculation of the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and a sex category; and (2) comparison of such &ldquo;selection rates&rdquo; to the most selected category to determine an &ldquo;impact ratio&rdquo; using a defined formula.</li>
    <li>Confirm that the prospective notice requirement to candidates and employees residing in New York City regarding the use of AEDTs can be met by clear and conspicuous writing on the employer website, job posting, or via US mail or email at least 10 business days prior to the use of the AEDT. </li>
    <li>Confirm that employers can meet the requirement to publish the distribution date of the AEDT, the date of the most recent bias audit and a summary of the results if they include a clear and conspicuous link to a website containing this information on the careers or job sections of their website. Employers must keep the summary of results and distribution date posted for at least six months after last using the audit tool.</li>
    <li>Define the following key terms that were not defined in the statute:
    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;Screen&rdquo; means &ldquo;to make a determination about whether someone should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion process.&rdquo; </li>
        <li>&ldquo;Selection rate&rdquo; means &ldquo;the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Impact ratio&rdquo; means &ldquo;either (i) the selection rate for a category divided by the &ldquo;selection rate of the most selected category or (ii) the average score of all individuals in a category divided by the average score of individuals in the highest scoring category.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Proposed Rules do not address other vital compliance issues, such as the precise requirements of an alternative selection process or accommodation that must be offered to employees who opt-out of an AEDT. The Proposed Rules only state that the notice must include instructions on how to seek the alternative process or an accommodation. </p>
<p>The Proposed Rules also do not clarify whether the AI Law requires that employers update bias audits annually or if one audit conducted prior to the initial use of the tool is sufficient, provided the tool does not change. Employers will hope for further guidance from the city on these issues prior to the effective date of the AI Law. </p>
<h3>PUBLIC HEARING</h3>
<p>The DCWP will hold a public hearing on the Proposed Rules on October 24 at 11:00 am. Prior to the hearing, any individual or group may submit comments on the Proposed Rules. Written comments can be submitted in advance by email to <a href=""mailto:Rulecomments@dcwp.nyc.gov"">Rulecomments@dcwp.nyc.gov</a>&nbsp;or <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/rule/automated-employment-decision-tools-2/"" target=""_blank"">online</a>, where there is also a link to join the public hearing by videoconference or phone. Comments can also be raised at the public hearing, but those wishing to speak at the hearing will be allotted three minutes of speaking time and must sign up in advance by calling (212) 436-0396. </p>
<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
<p>Now that New York City has issued these Proposed Rules, employers should consider taking various steps to evaluate their use of AI employment tools, including the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Review existing use of AEDTs in their hiring and promotion practices to determine whether they are covered by the AI Law.</li>
    <li>Review data retention policies applicable to data collected through the use of AEDTs. </li>
    <li>Train supervisors and managers, as well as compliance, human resources, and legal professionals on the implications of the new law, including notice requirements and proper responses to employee communications. </li>
    <li>Communicate with any vendors who operate AEDTs for the business to confirm they are in compliance with the AI Law.</li>
    <li>Determine how the company will meet the independent audit and notice requirements of the AI Law and any final rules.</li>
    <li>Continue to monitor for any changes to the Proposed Rules after the October 24 hearing date and DCWP responses to public comments.</li>

The creative thief: AI tools creating generated art


AI systems such as OpenAI's Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are used to create striking images. But it can be unclear if the images are inspired by others or stolen.

AI-generated art is painting a new path for both experienced artists and consumers. But critics say AI art systems are stealing real people's intellectual property.







Large AI models like GPT and art-generating tools such as Midjourney and OpenAI's Dall-E have enabled art amateurs to easily create striking, original-looking images, sparking a highly charged conversation about the nature of art itself and whether AI will eradicate artists' and illustrators' jobs.
Acclaimed supernatural fiction author Stephen King even joined the debate when he posted an image of ""Pennywise on a bike"" on his Twitter page, noting that it was ""done by an AI bot.""
The image of King's novelistic shape-shifting monster created by an AI system -- it's unclear which system created King's image -- looks like a masterpiece, but for one small detail. At the bottom-right corner is a signature, signaling that at least part of the artwork the AI system generated came from the million pieces of artwork that are online.
The uproar over the issue has become so intense that some photography agencies have begun scrubbing their work from the internet. Moreover, a new website, Have I Been Trained?, enables artists and consumers to check if their images are in the LAION-5B training data set -- a library of images used to train Stable Diffusion and Google Imagen, another AI-powered text-to-image system.
Also, the speed and scope of the AI text-to-image technology could lead to concerns about AI-generated art spilling over into the video editing field.
Meta, Facebook's parent company, on Sept. 29 announced its Make-A-Video text-to-video tool, which enables users to create a video by typing what they want to see.

Large AI text-to-image models might be misappropriating some real artworks.






AI fires the artist
One artist caught up in the debate about AI-generated art tools and systems is Grzegorz Rutkowski, a gaming illustrator from Poland. He has been an illustrator for games such as Dungeons & Dragons and Sony's Horizon Forbidden West.
Fans of Rutkowski told him that his pieces were being used to create new images generated by Stable Diffusion. In fact, his name has been used about 93,000 times, according to Lexica, a website that tracks images generated by Stable Diffusion from user prompts.



It was a future threat for my online portfolio.

""I realized that after a while, I can have trouble looking for my images on Google because it will be flooded with AI,"" Rutkowski said. ""It was a future threat for my online portfolio.""
AI systems like these could remove the need for mentorship between experienced artists and younger artists, Rutkowski said. Younger artists might decide to use the systems instead of gaining tutelage from those who are more experienced.
Also, the system can prompt organizations to do away with hiring junior artists and illustrators to create visuals that stimulate moods, such as landscape images, he added.
""Right now, we can see that at least part of the industry will be losing their jobs,"" Rutkowski said.


The role of the artist
While AI-generated art tools might cause the role of the artist to change, it's not going to erase the artist and their art, argued Cansu Canca, founder and director of the AI Ethics Lab.
""It could even become more valuable,"" Canca said. ""You could imagine human art being this artifact that is hard to find and even highly priced, whereas computer-generated art would be not so highly valued.""
The controversy over AI systems stealing work from others to create an artwork raises questions about plagiarism. But the changing forms of art from generation to generation and the custom of young artists using the works of older artists as inspiration blur the lines of traditional ideas about art, said Ricardo Baeza-Yates, director of research at the Institute for Experiential AI at Northeastern University.
""Let's say you use pieces of 1,000 images to create a new image. Is 1,000 pieces of other images plagiarism? I'm not sure,"" Baeza-Yates said. ""If you say 10, I would say yes. If you say 1,000, I don't know.""
Moreover, AI-generated art could help artists create their artwork faster, saving them time by relying on the engineers who created Dall-E and other AI art systems who took years to create their systems, Baeza-Yates continued.


'Theatre D'Opera Spatial'
Faster doesn't necessarily mean the artwork didn't require time to generate creativity.
Jason M. Allen, an artist and president of Incarnate Games whose Theatre D'Opera Spatial won first place at the Colorado State Fair on Aug. 29, said he spent 80 hours working on his piece.
The artwork was generated by Midjourney and submitted under the digital arts and digitally manipulated photography category.
Allen started using Midjourney earlier this year after being invited to participate in the beta-testing group. He said he was drawn to the program because the artwork he was seeing online felt like something that had never been created before.
""It's avant-garde,"" he said. ""It's a new art movement.""
He didn't start his award-winning project until he learned how to use the software to generate the images he wanted to see, he said.
""You have to learn how to manipulate the software because you might not get the results that you want to see,"" Allen said. ""You constantly have to try different phrases and words and creative inputs that give you the results that you're looking for. And that's a skill.""
The backlash over his winning artwork was unexpected, but understandable, Allen said.
""It comes from a place of denial,"" he said. Up until now, many were convinced that AI could never be as good as humans when creating art pieces, and now they've been proven wrong, he said.
""It would be better if they [didn't] deny the power available to them,"" Allen added.


Enterprises and AI-generated art
Meanwhile, enterprises in addition to artists and consumers are using AI technology that creates art.
Omneky is an AI marketing vendor that uses its own machine learning algorithms, GPT-3 and Dall-E to generate ads for its customers. The vendor also offers personalized prompts for image generation.
""AI is creating a freeing and flexible design process that inspires creativity and ultimately boosts performance,"" said Hikari Senju, founder and CEO of Omneky. AI is helping creators boost creativity and productivity, he added.
Virtuous AI, an AI ethics company that helps developers create explainable and unbiased AI systems, uses Omneky to generate ads and as a marketing tool.
While aware of the controversy of AI-generated art, Virtuous AI CEO Rory Donovan said certain applications of the tools can be useful.
""If you're, for example, displacing a person by creating the same content in the same style as them, that's definitely, in my opinion, immoral,"" Donovan said. ""But I don't think that is really the case in these sorts of applications. We're not trying to generate Picasso paintings or anything like that. It's more of, you know, ad content.""


Fighting back
However, for Rutkowski, the problem is the consequences of using AI-generated art tools and the vendors behind them.
""AI is affecting lots of fields -- science, technology, healthcare -- it's unstoppable and inevitable,"" he said. ""We will learn to adapt to this world, but right now, as much as we can, we should treat artists and different people with respect.""
For this reason, Rutkowski and other artists are pushing for regulation to protect the type of data that AI-generated art tools can access.
Artists like Rutkowski, who can show a strong similarity between their artwork and ones generated by AI systems, have a strong claim for copyright infringement, according to Michael Bennett, director of education curriculum and business lead for responsible AI at the Institute for Experiential AI.
""It would depend on how similar that generative art is,"" said Bennett, who has more than 15 years of experience as an intellectual property lawyer.
However, if the AI system created a piece of work that does not show a strong similarity, ""there's not anything that living human artists can do,"" he continued.
Using existing images to inspire and help artists create art with AI tools is analogous to a young artist gaining inspiration from older works, so there isn't much harm, Bennett said.
As for the creators of the AI tools and systems, many artists including Rutkowski think they have a responsibility to other artists. In practice, this could mean removing the artwork of living artists from AI training data sets and banning it from being used, in the same way that some systems ban nude photos or images of celebrities or well-known individuals.
However, generative AI art is already proliferating quickly and spurring more creativity, with popular tools like Dall-E offering free introductory credits and affordable fees to use the system. The technology and people's use of it is sure to keep growing.
""If this technology is going to increase the rate of introduction of new works of art, increase the ability of more humans to produce art, then I think, in the end, it is a good thing,"" Bennett said.

Artificial Intelligence in Space – USC’s Information Sciences Institute is on a Mission Julia Cohen | October 3, 2022							
						
Astronaut Danny Olivas joins ISI’s Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Analytics Laboratory (VIMAL) to look for ways to use AI in space.



Danny Olivas
John Daniel “Danny” Olivas, former NASA astronaut and current member of the NASA Advisory Council, has joined the staff of the Visual Intelligence and Multimedia Analytics Laboratory (VIMAL) of USC’s Information Sciences Institute (ISI) as Co-Director for AI Initiatives in Space.
Olivas brings considerable experience to VIMAL, ISI and USC. A veteran of space shuttle missions in 2007 and 2009, he is the recipient of two NASA Space Flight Medals and the NASA Exceptional Service and Exceptional Achievement Medals. Olivas completed five space walks totaling over 34 hours outside of the International Space Station. His expertise in space is rivaled only by his passion for it, and he brings both to his new role.
Olivas said, “I am excited about the opportunity to help expand USC’s footprint in space, for researchers and students alike.”
The Birth of a Partnership
VIMAL – which is led by Wael AbdAlmageed, research director at ISI and research associate professor of electrical and computer engineering – has a noble and straight-forward mission: “to empower students to use artificial intelligence to make the world a better place, one day at a time.” With Olivas on the team, VIMAL is now able to look beyond Earth to do this.
Olivas and AbdAlmageed met in July 2022, when they were both invited to Renaissance Weekend, a prestigious, non-partisan, invite-only retreat for innovative thinkers across disciplines held this year in Banff,Canada. They quickly realized they had a lot in common. AbdAlmageed said, “Danny [Olivas] and I come from very similar mindsets and backgrounds. We believe in working hard on hard problems, without giving up, for a long period of time. We believe that is enough to make things happen.”
Interested in each others’ area of expertise, the two discussed how to harness their collective grit and work together. A month later, Olivas visited ISI for the day to learn about VIMAL and ISI, and present his thoughts on opportunities for AI in space.  
Out of This World Climate Data
Olivas’ astronaut background and exposure to space provides a valuable new perspective on new areas for data analysis. “Since the beginning of the [NASA] program, NASA has produced more data than has been analyzed,” he noted. He added that this data is ripe for analysis through artificial intelligence and machine learning.
One application is climate, which AbdAlmageed called an “area of growth for VIMAL.”
“NASA has instruments that can see things like water vapor in the upper atmosphere,” Olivas said. “All these kinds of things can not only be analyzed in their individual silos of monitoring, but you can now start to integrate data across the different instruments to build a much more robust picture of how climate changes are affecting a certain region.”
Ozone and CO2 in the atmosphere, temperature trends across the planet, drought prediction, sea level detection, deforestation, planet population changes — these are just some of the areas where NASA has useful historical data, according to Olivas.
“This data has been available by NASA for many, many years,” he added, “and (they) provide an opportunity to take pieces of this information and start to integrate them together and allow computational technologies to take over where human beings have had to digest this information in the past, to try to make sense of it.”
Robotics and Rovers
As NASA prepares for a future in which humans will travel to Mars, new and exciting AI applications will emerge. “There are some specific robotic applications that are very unique to NASA’s space program,” Olivas said. For example, a robot that can check the mood of an astronaut based on their facial expressions or voice intonations — something that will be increasingly important for mental health as missions extend from months to years with Mars exploration. 
Exploration rovers are another area where Olivas sees room for more AI, again, with Mars as the example: “It takes about twenty minutes to be able to send a command from Earth to Mars. By the time you get the photograph that your rover is marching over a cliff, it’s probably the wrong time to send the command to stop moving. So you want to have more intelligence being built on the platform to allow the rover to make decisions for itself.”
But First: Space Junk
Climate data, robots and rovers — these are areas Olivas might take VIMAL in the future. However, the first problem Olivas and AbdAlmageed plan on tackling is trash, specifically orbital debris. 
NASA defines orbital debris as any non-functional human-made object in orbit around the Earth. Think: spacecraft, satellites, rockets or what you’d get if any of those collided or exploded. Debris ranges in size from sub-microns all the way to several meters — from a paint chip to a school bus — with hundreds of thousands of estimated pieces orbiting Earth.
The trouble comes from the fact that this debris travels at orbital velocities that are dangerous to NASA’s missions — picture that paint chip or school bus traveling at 16,000 mph! Olivas said, “it’s that hyper-velocity impact that causes all sorts of problems, not only with the space station or human spacecraft, but also with satellite technology.” It is a serious threat to astronauts, spacecraft and space exploration in general.
The VIMAL team will be looking at ways to use their sensing, computer vision and AI expertise to identify pieces of debris and track them for long periods of time as they orbit Earth.
USC’s Legacy of Space Innovation
Olivas extends a strong legacy of innovation in space exploration at USC. He joins fellow former NASA astronauts Paul Ronney and Garrett Reisman, who also serve as faculty at USC Viterbi, which is one of a core group of top schools with a distinct astronautical program. This won’t be the first time Olivas and Reisman have worked together, they were classmates in the NASA astronaut program.
To date, school researchers have created innovations in spacecraft propulsion, space science, space environment, space communications, satellites and materials. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was a USC Viterbi alumnus, and the school has a dedicated Space Engineering Research Center at ISI. 
USC Viterbi maintains strong connections with pioneering space organizations and alumni who design and build rockets and space launchers, communications and direct broadcasting satellites, navigational systems, crewed space vehicles and planetary probes.
On a Mission to Collaborate
“At the end of the day, space is a human endeavor,” said Olivas, who pointed out that part of being an astronaut involves looking out for one another. He seemed impressed by this aspect of the work done by VIMAL.
“One thing that I’ve come to appreciate at VIMAL is the inclusive nature of the collaborations; it is really inspirational,” he said.
AbdAlmageed has very intentionally fostered the collaborative environment of VIMAL. “I’m proud that we’ve created a culture in the lab where everybody feels a sense of ownership and partnership.” He continued, “I couldn’t have done something like hire Danny [Olivas] without the significant contributions of everyone in VIMAL who do the work day in and day out. This was a team effort. I am also very grateful to Dr. Craig Knoblock, ISI Executive Director, for supporting our ambitious initiatives and pursuits.”
Olivas certainly seems excited to join the team, “I look forward to sharing, learning and seeing where those opportunities might be with VIMAL,” concluded the astronaut.

Summary


Pandemic-related constraints have hindered the restaurant industry, creating a limited workforce and high demand for service from customers. Robotics, powered by AI and rugged-edge computing, is ready to step in and offer an immediate financial impact on a restaurant’s bottom line.




 Now We’re Cooking: How Artificial Intelligence Helps Bring the Robot Fry Cook to Life 

The commercial foodservice industry is revolutionizing itself through intelligent automation solutions that solve some of the most significant gaps in back-of-house kitchen operations. Pandemic-related constraints have hindered the restaurant industry, creating a limited workforce and high demand for service from customers. Robotics, powered by AI and rugged-edge computing, is ready to step in and offer an immediate financial impact on a restaurant’s bottom line. Aided by machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics, new robotic systems will soon become commonplace in the kitchen, driving productivity while reducing cost and making room for the robotic fry cook to come to life.
 
The new normal 
The restaurant space has been hit hard in the last few years and is just starting its slow recovery from the pandemic’s impact on the industry. As the world moves into the post-pandemic era, there is hope that the industry could return to business as usual. But a new normal has since taken shape, leaving food preparation workers less motivated to resume their posts for various reasons. Robotic systems in the kitchen are in a prime position to help these institutions get back to work–and more efficiently.
 
Software algorithms, explicitly designed for intelligent food service, can enable hardware to streamline repetitive kitchen tasks. The computing systems powering this technology require a CPU, sufficient USP ports, and real-time edge processing with the help of a powerful GPU. As these solutions are developed for immediate use, with additional RMA support offered to restauranteurs, the production of these systems will scale rapidly through the US.  
 
The rugged edge along the kitchen counter
Developers of these types of robotics need to incorporate rugged edge computing, allowing these automated solutions to perform in hazardous environments while executing the core capabilities outlined by the software.
 
Real-time data collected by sensors is mission critical to these robotics’ performance. Uniformity works best when designing the hardware, minimizing the need for client customization, and accelerating time to market. The system electrical panels embedded in the hardware are a vital component of the automation process and should be designed for manufacturing and service that is easy to deploy. This helps guarantee that the modules within the robot can successfully handle sensor data coming from the kitchen.   
 
These robotic systems can be mass manufactured and deployed quickly and efficiently, as manufacturers ensure consistent settings across all products, scale their services, and accelerate time to market. With assets like trained personnel and industrial environments capable of managing assembly of the rugged edge hardware, it becomes possible for manufacturers to produce hundreds of units at a time.  
 
Mass production of a reliable system at scale requires recognizing the clear differentiation between a general-purpose embedded computer and a system built to handle AI algorithms and real-time data workloads. Whether on a fishing boat in the middle of the Atlantic or in the kitchen of a local restaurant, rugged edge computing is essential to balancing the performance, reliability, footprint, and longevity demands of these fast-evolving robotic systems.
 
Let’s get cooking
By combining smart AI algorithms with automated, industrial hardware, the modern restaurant kitchen is evolving in a manner that until recently was considered possible only in science-fiction. Autonomous commercial food prep has the potential to be less reliant on manual labor while improving overall working conditions for cook staff. Mundane, repetitive restaurant tasks performed by robots enhance food quality, safety, and throughput, and can also result in significant cost savings by minimizing human error and creating a streamlined workforce focused on some form of management instead of day-to-day tasks. Autonomous restaurants additionally allow for better, smarter business decisions by providing more–and more valuable–operational data, translating into broad savings over the long term in an overly competitive industry on the cusp of significant change.
 
The pandemic’s world-changing circumstances have presented new opportunity, calling for the tech and food industries to align. Restauranteurs and fast food chains that embrace robotics in the kitchen are “in the right place at the right time,” poised to gain a competitive edge while ensuring that their workflow, staff and customer experience are well looked after. These innovations are geared to flip the foodservice industry on its head, so as this change is embraced, the only thing left to do is to start cooking.

Medical Coding is the Next Stop for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare
Industry leaders agree that artificial intelligence in healthcare is taking off; medical coding and billing is the latest use case for ER staffing company TECHealth.

October 03, 2022 - To a layperson, medical codes look like a different language, and in a way they are. Medical coding is a highly complex process in healthcare in which clinicians and revenue cycle staff work together to translate clinical encounters into billable codes for not only reimbursement but other performance tracking efforts. The codes that ultimately end on claims tell the story of a patient’s encounter.
Understanding a clinical encounter is extremely important for patient care and for keeping the doors open. However, in a world of ever-changing payer rules and documentation requirements, medical coding is perhaps more complex than ever.
“Something that is challenging for us is getting payment in a timely fashion so that we can actually make payroll to make sure doctors and APPs [advanced practice practitioners] are paid correctly,” explains Eric Wilke, MD, Eric Wilke, an emergency medicine doctor and chief operations officer at TECHealth, an ER physician staffing company.
Medical coding can get in the way of timely reimbursement. Payers may reject or deny claims because of medical coding errors or missteps. In fact, a survey of hospital executives found that about a third cite coding as their top concern when it comes to denials and denials prevention.
With denial rates on the rise, optimizing medical coding to prevent claims denials is critical. Healthcare organizations must identify the right codes for services provided during a clinical encounter while adhering to payer requirements. Organizations must ensure they are not leaving money on the table by neglecting to code a service or applying the appropriate severity level or modifier.
Organizations are also trying to implement medical coding best practices with fewer coders and revenue cycle staff.
“We’ve experienced hiring challenges for billing and coding positions, especially in the wake of COVID-19,” Wilke says. “We had extended interviews to several people, and they never even bothered to show up.”
The “Great Resignation”—a term used to describe high levels of turnover during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic—has hit healthcare particularly hard. Provider organizations have especially faced shortages of qualified revenue cycle talent, with entry-level roles taking an average of 84 days and over $2,000 to fill. Mid-level revenue cycle positions, which require six to ten years of experience, are taking an average of 153 days and over $3,500, survey results also show.
Many healthcare organizations choose to offshore medical coding to combat domestic staffing shortages and the high costs of filling open roles. But for organizations like TECHealth, “all of the work we were doing was domestic,” Wilke states.
Unfortunately, Google Translate does not recognize medical codes as a language. However, TECHealth found a “bit of an equalizer in that standpoint.”
Tapping into AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken healthcare by storm. The predictive analytics technology is revolutionizing the way certain providers deliver care. For example, Mayo Clinic recently found that AI can help detect atrial fibrillation, while Google Health is tapping the technology to detect cancer.
AI is being leveraged by researchers, providers, and tech companies alike to diagnose some of the most common and deadly diseases out there. However, the technology can also serve a purpose on the administrative side of healthcare.
Medical coding is ripe for AI technology, according to Wilke.
“Anything image or text-centric is a great opportunity for AI,” the healthcare leader explains. “So, yes, pathology, radiology, and dermatology are all areas of opportunity, but so is analyzing charts for billing and coding.”
AI can help organizations overcome the top challenges of medical billing and coding.
“We want something that can process [payments] quickly, so get them to the clearinghouse faster. The faster that works through the system, the better,” Wilke explains.
Tapping AI technology for medical billing and coding means a large portion of TECHealth’s claims were being worked through their IT systems. The technology was able to comb through upwards of 80 percent of claims with limited or without any human interaction. Additionally, the technology was able to process tens of thousands of medical charts in a matter of days to ensure proper coding.
With a kick-out ratio of under 20 percent, Wilke describes AI technology for medical billing and coding as  “a bit of an equalizer” when it comes to the workforce obstacles most healthcare organizations are currently facing, according to Wilke.
“[The technology] is not dependent on the human workforce, which is currently limited,” Wilke elaborates.
The smaller medical billing and coding team was able to work on more complex claims to recoup money from claim denials and to prevent future money-leaking missteps. Most of the low-hanging fruit was already taken care of by the organization’s IT systems.
Growing pains
While medical billing and coding are ripe for AI innovation, as evidenced by TECHealth’s success with the technology, implementation can come with some growing pains for healthcare organizations. The number one lesson learned, according to Wilke, is having quality data.
“If I could go back and redo [implementation], one of the things I would’ve redone is analyzing our coding team to make sure they were using appropriate codes because anyone using an AI engine has to use historical data so they can build the AI’s prediction model.”
“If you don’t give the [AI] the most accurate information upfront, then you don’t always get the most correct information on the backside,” Wilke stresses.
Garbage in, garbage out. That has been a major lesson for healthcare with the advent of analytics. The adage is especially true for predictive analytics models that rely on the data you feed the system to make predictions and workflows.
Healthcare organizations need enough data points or sets to ensure accurate prediction models since using a tiny fraction of your information does not provide the power analytics technologies need to be successful. That data also needs to be clean and accurate, Wilke indicates.
“I would have found somebody that coded very well, so at an appropriate level, and had those historical codes be used to train the AI,” Wilkes states.”If you’re moving to the AI side of the world, you need to analyze your data and the [evaluation and management] levels assigned. Make sure that your audit shows that coding is being done correctly, then pass that forward to the AI training engine.”
TECHealth also relied on its vendor at the time, Fathom, to get the AI prediction models just right for its medical billing and coding needs, Wilke stresses. The organization decided to go with that vendor mainly because of its “fairly robust history” of applying predictive analytics to medical coding and billing.
“They were nimble, easy to work with, and pretty aggressive and forward with making sure things got connected as fast as possible. Their technical team and our technical team worked really well together,” Wilke says.
Having a strategic partner parse through historical data and properly train models was key to TECHealth’s success with medical billing and coding at that time. And despite some pains, AI in healthcare is only growing, especially in the realm of medical billing and coding.
“AI is going to become an essential tool in this arena. It already has a pretty significant role, and it’s only going to get bigger,” Wilke states.

As we have entered into the era of artificial intelligence (AI), today’s AI-based technologies are not only assisting in mass production factories but also becoming socially intelligent – they are now utilized to interact with customers in frontline services. While the heated debate on whether AI will replace human employees continues, research evidence has shown that AI does not always outperform humans, especially in contexts such as tourism and hospitality service settings where person-to-person contact and personalized experiences are essential.
Lei, Sut Ieng (Soey) is a lecturer at Macao Institute for Tourism Studies
 A famous example is the first robot hotel in Japan which ended up replacing half of its robots with human staff. Some studies found customers still prefer human service in hospitality settings due to a number of reasons, such as the perception of humans as more effective communication partners, and the low perceived interaction quality and human sensitivity of service robots. Some studies also show that humans outperform service robots when it comes to building relationships and friendships with customers. 
Nevertheless, technologies will remain important and continue to change our lives. While the application of AI and robotic technologies seems to be unavoidable, the role of technologies should be to assist rather than replace humans. Decision makers need to understand the limitations and weaknesses of these new technologies. Paying close attention to consumer perception and reaction to technology-based services on a continuous basis is key, and the goal should be to search for the most effective ways in which humans and AI can work together to create the best customer experiences. Some research works have already been initiated to investigate synergies between human workers and AI. For example, some recent research evidence shows that human-AI collaboration can increase productivity, particularly for managerial professionals; and that people seem to complete household tasks more efficiently and perceive themselves as more effective when collaborating with AI. As employees might feel threatened by AI, identifying the situations under which they feel most comfortable working with AI and the factors that potentially reduce their perceived threat will help smoothen management practices in the future. 

The tourism and hospitality
industry provides unique opportunities for individuals to showcase their people
skills. At higher management levels, tourism and hospitality professionals’
abilities in critical thinking, strategic planning, resources integration, and
service innovation will remain crucial and irreplaceable by AI. However, smart
technologies will prevail when humans fail to meet customer expectations. Practitioners
and students should review their performances, skill sets, strengths, and
weaknesses on a regular basis and continuously seek opportunities for self-development.
How should the hospitality workforce become more ‘human’? How should human
sensitivity be further showcased in service settings so as to further exert the
advantages of human intelligence in service delivery? How should service
failures due to human errors be reduced to maximize the value of human
resources? These are critical questions for practitioners, educators, and
students to think about. At the end of the day, customers will turn away from
poor service, regardless of whether it is provided by humans or technologies.

According to reports, the Indian industrial robotics market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 13.3% between 2019-2024. With its rising industry applications and productivity benefits, the study of cybernetics is likely to be a vital element in the advancement of robotics..The craving for gadgets or machines that can keep up with the challenges of the present world and largely function in simpler and smarter ways is evident. Automation and autonomy have offered this by producing and delivering products and services that contain the least amount of human intervention, making certain jobs more convenient than ever before even when information is incomplete and uncertain. The appearance of new service robots and their wide evolution into new applications has further facilitated the world of automation. Due to the dynamic nature of robotics, numerous application sectors are now using robotics to perform predetermined tasks and enhance human efforts in both physical and analytic ways. Robotics has enhanced task efficiency, dependability, and quality, all of which were earlier, products of a laborious procedure. Being a critical component of automation, robotics is currently used in an ever-growing variety of fields, like manufacturing, transportation, healthcare &amp; medical care, utilities, defence, facilities, operations, and more recently, information technology. Here Cybernetics enters as a primary element as robots need to be advanced..What is Cybernetics and what makes it different from Artificial Intelligence (AI)?.Cybernetics is a study of science that focuses on developing technologies that act or think like humans by researching how electrical devices or machines and the human brain function to enhance the value of the job to be performed. Cybernetics is the best workaround physical embodiment of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and predictive analysis and control, investigating underlying systems/structures, possibilities, and limitations of complex mechanisms, including robotics, and generating an autonomous environment that uses minimal to no human interaction. AI and cybernetics are two dissimilar perspectives on intelligent systems or systems that may act to achieve an aim. Making computers imitate intelligent behavior using pre-stored world representations is the primary goal of AI. In general, cybernetics tells us how systems control themselves and can take actions autonomously based on environmental signals even when the information is minimal and subject to significant uncertainty or noise. These systems go beyond simple computation; they can also control biological (body temperature regulation), mechanical (engine speed regulation), social (managing a huge workforce), and economic (controlling a national economy) systems..How does Cybernetics work?.Every cybernetic system's aim is to be set up so that its operations are linked in a variety of input-output system configurations which are normally driven with reference control signs. This is achieved by processing feedback-based automatic closed-loop control systems that can decide which behaviors should be changed, which actions should be tracked, how to compare the actions to the reference, and how to adapt the application behaviors in the most effective way. In natural cybernetic systems, this regulatory mechanism generates or organizes by itself with the help of self-learning. On the other hand, artificial cybernetic systems behave or are influenced by human-implemented automatic control systems. Essential elements of cybernetic systems are sensors, the controller, actuators and the system to be controlled..Cybernetics in robotics.Cybernetics in robotics systems' main objective is to use AI and machine learning in the sense-plan-act paradigm normally used to develop robots so they can operate productively in real-world scenarios. Developing a robot to understand and differentiate complex situations every day is highly demanding and getting the situation awareness correctly identified is crucial to ensuring the desired reference control signal can be identified for implementation. This can make sure an industrial robot recognizes and picks up the correct item for the next stage of the manufacturing process from a selection of parts to ensure the requests of the human to be served a variety of beverages will get the correct drink. Sensors and sensor systems that are perfectly calibrated are necessary for ensuring the situation awareness is achieved perfectly and in real-time using AI-based models which can be learned and applied in various situations such as driverless cars, medical robots, automated manufacturing, and home care robots..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Adrienne Williams and Milagros Miceli are researchers at the Distributed AI Research (DAIR) Institute. Timnit Gebru is the institute’s founder and executive director. She was previously co-lead of the Ethical AI research team at Google.


The public’s understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) is largely shaped by pop culture — by blockbuster movies like “The Terminator” and their doomsday scenarios of machines going rogue and destroying humanity. This kind of AI narrative is also what grabs the attention of news outlets: a Google engineer claiming that its chatbot was sentient was among the most discussed AI-related news in recent months, even reaching Stephen Colbert’s millions of viewers. But the idea of superintelligent machines with their own agency and decision-making power is not only far from reality — it distracts us from the real risks to human lives surrounding the development and deployment of AI systems. While the public is distracted by the specter of nonexistent sentient machines, an army of precarized workers stands behind the supposed accomplishments of artificial intelligence systems today.
Many of these systems are developed by multinational corporations located in Silicon Valley, which have been consolidating power at a scale that, journalist Gideon Lewis-Kraus notes, is likely unprecedented in human history. They are striving to create autonomous systems that can one day perform all of the tasks that people can do and more, without the required salaries, benefits or other costs associated with employing humans. While this corporate executives’ utopia is far from reality, the march to attempt its realization has created a global underclass, performing what anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computational social scientist Siddharth Suri call ghost work: the downplayed human labor driving “AI”.
Tech companies that have branded themselves “AI first” depend on heavily surveilled gig workers like data labelers, delivery drivers and content moderators. Startups are even hiring people to impersonate AI systems like chatbots, due to the pressure by venture capitalists to incorporate so-called AI into their products. In fact, London-based venture capital firm MMC Ventures surveyed 2,830 AI startups in the EU and found that 40% of them didn’t use AI in a meaningful way.
Far from the sophisticated, sentient machines portrayed in media and pop culture, so-called AI systems are fueled by millions of underpaid workers around the world, performing repetitive tasks under precarious labor conditions. And unlike the “AI researchers” paid six-figure salaries in Silicon Valley corporations, these exploited workers are often recruited out of impoverished populations and paid as little as $1.46/hour after tax. Yet despite this, labor exploitation is not central to the discourse surrounding the ethical development and deployment of AI systems. In this article, we give examples of the labor exploitation driving so-called AI systems and argue that supporting transnational worker organizing efforts should be a priority in discussions pertaining to AI ethics.
We write this as people intimately connected to AI-related work. Adrienne is a former Amazon delivery driver and organizer who has experienced the harms of surveillance and unrealistic quotas established by automated systems. Milagros is a researcher who has worked closely with data workers, especially data annotators in Syria, Bulgaria and Argentina. And Timnit is a researcher who has faced retaliation for uncovering and communicating the harms of AI systems.
Treating Workers Like Machines
Much of what is currently described as AI is a system based on statistical machine learning, and more specifically, deep learning via artificial neural networks, a methodology that requires enormous amounts of data to “learn” from. But around 15 years ago, before the proliferation of gig work, deep learning systems were considered merely an academic curiosity, confined to a few interested researchers.
In 2009, however, Jia Deng and his collaborators released the ImageNet dataset, the largest labeled image dataset at the time, consisting of images scraped from the internet and labeled through Amazon’s newly introduced Mechanical Turk platform. Amazon Mechanical Turk, with the motto “artificial artificial intelligence,” popularized the phenomenon of “crowd work”: large volumes of time-consuming work broken down into smaller tasks that can quickly be completed by millions of people around the world. With the introduction of Mechanical Turk, intractable tasks were suddenly made feasible; for example, hand-labeling one million images could be automatically executed by a thousand anonymous people working in parallel, each labeling only a thousand images. What’s more, it was at a price even a university could afford: crowdworkers were paid per task completed, which could amount to merely a few cents.

The ImageNet dataset was followed by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, where researchers used the dataset to train and test models performing a variety of tasks like image recognition: annotating an image with the type of object in the image, such as a tree or a cat. While non-deep-learning-based models performed these tasks with the highest accuracy at the time, in 2012, a deep-learning-based architecture informally dubbed AlexNet scored higher than all other models by a wide margin. This catapulted deep-learning-based models into the mainstream, and brought us to today, where models requiring lots of data, labeled by low-wage gig workers around the world, are proliferated by multinational corporations. In addition to labeling data scraped from the internet, some jobs have gig workers supply the data itself, requiring them to upload selfies, pictures of friends and family or images of the objects around them.
Unlike in 2009, when the main crowdworking platform was Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, there is currently an explosion of data labeling companies. These companies are raising tens to hundreds of millions in venture capital funding while the data labelers have been estimated to make an average of $1.77 per task. Data labeling interfaces have evolved to treat crowdworkers like machines, often prescribing them highly repetitive tasks, surveilling their movements and punishing deviation through automated tools. Today, far from an academic challenge, large corporations claiming to be “AI first” are fueled by this army of underpaid gig workers, such as data laborers, content moderators, warehouse workers and delivery drivers.
Content moderators, for example, are responsible for finding and flagging content deemed inappropriate for a given platform. Not only are they essential workers, without whom social media platforms would be completely unusable, their work flagging different types of content is also used to train automated systems aiming to flag texts and imagery containing hate speech, fake news, violence or other types of content that violates platforms’ policies. In spite of the crucial role that content moderators play in both keeping online communities safe and training AI systems, they are often paid miserable wages while working for tech giants and forced to perform traumatic tasks while being closely surveilled.
Every murder, suicide, sexual assault or child abuse video that does not make it onto a platform has been viewed and flagged by a content moderator or an automated system trained by data most likely supplied by a content moderator. Employees performing these tasks suffer from anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder due to constant exposure to this horrific content.
Besides experiencing a traumatic work environment with nonexistent or insufficient mental health support, these workers are monitored and punished if they deviate from their prescribed repetitive tasks. For instance, Sama content moderators contracted by Meta in Kenya are monitored through surveillance software to ensure that they make decisions about violence in videos within 50 seconds, regardless of the length of the video or how disturbing it is. Some content moderators fear that failure to do so could result in termination after a few violations. “Through its prioritization of speed and efficiency above all else,” Time Magazine reported, “this policy might explain why videos containing hate speech and incitement to violence have remained on Facebook’s platform in Ethiopia.”
Similar to social media platforms which would not function without content moderators, e-commerce conglomerates like Amazon are run by armies of warehouse workers and delivery drivers, among others. Like content moderators, these workers both keep the platforms functional and supply data for AI systems that Amazon may one day use to replace them: robots that stock packages in warehouses and self-driving cars that deliver these packages to customers. In the meantime, these workers must perform repetitive tasks under the pressure of constant surveillance — tasks that, at times, put their lives at risk and often result in serious musculoskeletal injuries.

Amazon warehouse employees are tracked via cameras and their inventory scanners, and their performance is measured against the times managers determine every task should take, based on aggregate data from everyone working at the same facility. Time away from their assigned tasks is tracked and used to discipline workers.
          
Read Noema in print.


Like warehouse workers, Amazon delivery drivers are also monitored through automated surveillance systems: an app called Mentor tallies scores based on so-called violations. Amazon’s unrealistic delivery time expectations push many drivers to take risky measures to ensure that they deliver the number of packages assigned to them for the day. For instance, the time it takes someone to fasten and unfasten their seatbelt some 90-300 times a day is enough to put them behind schedule on their route. Adrienne and many of her colleagues buckled their seat belts behind their backs, so that the surveillance systems registered that they were driving with a belt on, without getting slowed down by actually driving with a belt on.
In 2020, Amazon drivers in the U.S. were injured at a nearly 50% higher rate than their United Parcel Service counterparts. In 2021, Amazon drivers were injured at a rate of 18.3 per 100 drivers, up nearly 40% from the previous year. These conditions aren’t only dangerous for delivery drivers — pedestrians and car passengers have been killed and injured in accidents involving Amazon delivery drivers. Some drivers in Japan recently quit in protest because they say Amazon’s software sent them on “impossible routes,” leading to “unreasonable demands and long hours.” In spite of these clear harms, however, Amazon continues to treat its workers like machines.
In addition to tracking its workers through scanners and cameras, last year, the company required delivery drivers in the U.S. to sign a “biometric consent” form, granting Amazon permission to use AI-powered cameras to monitor drivers’ movements — supposedly to cut down on distracted driving or speeding and ensure seatbelt usage. It’s only reasonable for workers to fear that facial recognition and other biometric data could be used to perfect worker-surveillance tools or further train AI — which could one day replace them. The vague wording in the consent forms leaves the precise purpose open for interpretation, and workers have suspected unwanted uses of their data before (though Amazon denied it).
The “AI” industry runs on the backs of these low-wage workers, who are kept in precarious positions, making it hard, in the absence of unionization, to push back on unethical practices or demand better working conditions for fear of losing jobs they can’t afford to lose. Companies make sure to hire people from poor and underserved communities, such as refugees, incarcerated people and others with few job options, often hiring them through third party firms as contractors rather than as full time employees. While more employers should hire from vulnerable groups like these, it is unacceptable to do it in a predatory manner, with no protections.




      “AI ethics researchers should analyze harmful AI systems as both causes and consequences of unjust labor conditions in the industry.”

Data labeling jobs are often performed far from the Silicon Valley headquarters of “AI first” multinational corporations — from Venezuela, where workers label data for the image recognition systems in self-driving vehicles, to Bulgaria, where Syrian refugees fuel facial recognition systems with selfies labeled according to race, gender, and age categories. These tasks are often outsourced to precarious workers in countries like India, Kenya, the Philippines or Mexico. Workers often do not speak English but are provided instructions in English, and face termination or banning from crowdwork platforms if they do not fully understand the rules.
These corporations know that increased worker power would slow down their march toward proliferating “AI” systems requiring vast amounts of data, deployed without adequately studying and mitigating their harms. Talk of sentient machines only distracts us from holding them accountable for the exploitative labor practices that power the “AI” industry.
An Urgent Priority For AI Ethics
While researchers in ethical AI, AI for social good, or human-centered AI have mostly focused on “debiasing” data and fostering transparency and model fairness, here we argue that stopping the exploitation of labor in the AI industry should be at the heart of such initiatives. If corporations are not allowed to exploit labor from Kenya to the U.S., for example, they will not be able to proliferate harmful technologies as quickly — their market calculations would simply dissuade them from doing so.
Thus, we advocate for funding of research and public initiatives that aim to uncover issues at the intersection of labor and AI systems. AI ethics researchers should analyze harmful AI systems as both causes and consequences of unjust labor conditions in the industry. Researchers and practitioners in AI should reflect on their use of crowdworkers to advance their own careers, while the crowdworkers remain in precarious conditions. Instead, the AI ethics community should work on initiatives that shift power into the hands of workers. Examples include co-creating research agendas with workers based on their needs, supporting cross-geographical labor organizing efforts and ensuring that research findings are easily accessed by workers rather than confined to academic publications. The Turkopticon platform created by Lilly Irani and M. Six Silberman, “an activist system that allows workers to publicize and evaluate their relationships with employers,” is a great example of this.
Journalists, artists, and scientists can help by drawing clear the connection between labor exploitation and harmful AI products in our everyday lives, fostering solidarity with and support for gig workers and other vulnerable worker populations. Journalists and commentators can show the general public why they should care about the data annotator in Syria or the hypersurveilled Amazon delivery driver in the U.S. Shame does work in certain circumstances and, for corporations, the public’s sentiment of “shame on you” can sometimes equal a loss in revenue and help move the needle toward accountability.
Supporting transnational worker organizing should be at the center of the fight for “ethical AI.” While each workplace and geographical context has its own idiosyncrasies, knowing how workers in other locations circumvented similar issues can serve as inspiration for local organizing and unionizing efforts. For example, data labelers in Argentina could learn from the recent unionizing efforts of content moderators in Kenya, or Amazon Mechanical Turk workers organizing in the U.S., and vice versa. Furthermore, unionized workers in one geographic location can advocate for their more precarious counterparts in another, as in the case of the Alphabet Workers Union, which includes both high paid employees in Silicon Valley and outsourced low wage contractors in more rural areas.




      “This type of solidarity between highly-paid tech workers and their lower-paid counterparts — who vastly outnumber them — is a tech CEO’s nightmare.”

This type of solidarity between highly-paid tech workers and their lower-paid counterparts — who vastly outnumber them — is a tech CEO’s nightmare. While corporations often treat their low-income workers as disposable, they’re more hesitant to lose their high-income employees who can quickly snap up jobs with competitors. Thus, the high-paid employees are allowed a far longer leash when organizing, unionizing, and voicing their disappointment with company culture and policies. They can use this increased security to advocate with their lower-paid counterparts working at warehouses, delivering packages or labeling data. As a result, corporations seem to use every tool at their disposal to isolate these groups from each other.
Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa created the type of cross-worker solidarity that scares tech CEOs. Both women worked as user experience designers at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters cumulatively for 21 years. Along with other Amazon corporate workers, they co-founded the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ). In 2019, over 8,700 Amazon workers publicly signed their names to an open letter addressed to Jeff Bezos and the company’s board of directors demanding climate leadership and concrete steps the company needed to implement to be aligned with climate science and protect workers. Later that year, AECJ organized the first walkout of corporate workers in Amazon’s history. The group says over 3,000 Amazon workers walked out across the world in solidarity with a youth-led Global Climate Strike.
Amazon responded by announcing its Climate Pledge, a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 — 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement. Cunningham and Costa say they were both disciplined and threatened with termination after the climate strike — but it wasn’t until AECJ organized actions to foster solidarity with low-wage workers that they were actually fired. Hours after another AECJ member sent out a calendar invite inviting corporate workers to listen to a panel of warehouse workers discussing the dire working conditions they were facing at the beginning of the pandemic, Amazon fired Costa and Cunningham. The National Labor Relations Board found their firings were illegal, and the company later settled with both women for undisclosed amounts. This case illustrates where executives’ fears lie: the unflinching solidarity of high-income employees who see low-income employees as their comrades.
In this light, we urge researchers and journalists to also center low-income workers’ contributions in running the engine of “AI” and to stop misleading the public with narratives of fully autonomous machines with human-like agency. These machines are built by armies of underpaid laborers around the world. With a clear understanding of the labor exploitation behind the current proliferation of harmful AI systems, the public can advocate for stronger labor protections and real consequences for entities who break them.

Conscientious employees—detail oriented, orderly, and hard-working—are considered better performers in the workplace. However, this belief may be based on 20th century evidence that ignores recent technological advances, especially artificial intelligence. Pok Man Tang, Joel Koopman, and Shawn McClean write that AI characteristics such as precision, detail orientation, and orderliness that overlap with the conscientious employee’s traits, and research shows that people prefer working with colleagues that possess complementary, not redundant, qualities as compared to their own.

 
There is an important and ongoing societal conversation about the fourth industrial revolution and the rapid incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into the 21st century workplace. The conversation often tends to emphasise this new technology’s promise to improve employee performance by helping them to understand trends, improve communication, and enhance data analytics. Yet all too often, the promise of new technology can obscure the very real costs that can arise from its implementation. In a recent article, we write that for some employees, working with AI may not live up to its performance-enhancing promises.
There is a century-old consensus that more conscientious employees are higher performers at work because they are detail oriented, orderly, and hard-working. This consensus has developed based on clear and consistent evidence that these employees were more effective at working with the various performance-enhancing “traditional” technologies associated with the 20th century (e.g., computers, word-processing software, and the internet). As a result, organisational decision-makers worldwide tend to prioritise recruiting, selecting, developing, and promoting these employees. Yet these characteristics may be ill-suited to the future workplace in which employee jobs have been augmented with AI.
The central premise of our arguments is based on a long-standing stream of research about complementarity—that employees tend to prefer interaction partners (e.g., co-workers, supervisors) who possess complementary—rather than redundant—characteristics. For example, as Adam Grant and his colleagues note, extraverted leaders (i.e., those who tend to command the attention of others) are often best paired with less proactive employees, while more introverted leaders may be best paired with more proactive employees. We expected something similar for how employees prefer to interact with their new non-human “colleagues” (e.g., AI, algorithms, and robots). These intelligent machines are designed to be precise, detail-oriented, and orderly—all characteristics that overlap with those of conscientious employees. On this basis, we expected that the unique value of conscientious employees would be redundant and rendered moot when they have to work with these machines. As a result, when these employees work with AI, the elevated performance that they tend to deliver should be negated.
Across three different studies with participants from Malaysia, Taiwan, and the United States, we consistently showed that when paired with intelligent machines as part of their work, highly conscientious employees performed worse than their less conscientious counterparts. This was because the autonomous capabilities of AI that enable it to learn and make decisions conflicted with the desire of conscientious employees to remain autonomous and in control of their work. These employees then reported reduced confidence in their abilities to handle work responsibilities and increased levels of ambiguity as to what their responsibilities even were. The result in both cases was a decrease in performance.
This work has critical implications for managers and other organisational decision-makers who are at the vanguard of the fourth industrial revolution. The workplace is rapidly changing, as modern intelligent machines—equipped with the ability to learn, improve, and adapt based on experience—become ubiquitous at work. Managers must quickly come to realise that some of the old rules may no longer apply in the new digital era. In this case, whereas hiring conscientious employees has long been argued to have little downside, our findings should give managers reason for pause.
While one remedy might simply be to encourage managers to de-emphasise conscientiousness as a selection characteristic, or at least to not target such employees for working with AI, this may not be feasible in all situations, given the decades of emphasis on hiring these employees and the fact that intelligence machines are increasingly being incorporated into the business operations of companies worldwide. Thus, another option would be to find ways to reaffirm the unique value that conscientious employees offer to organisations. For example, we recommend managers give these employees unique tasks that are not replicated by AI, as well as the autonomy and control to override the information and suggestions provided by AI. In this way, organisations can potentially continue to reap the benefits afforded by conscientious employees without incurring the costs that we identified.
In closing, we would note that 21st century managerial practices are, in many cases, based on the findings of research conducted in the 20th century. Yet the modern workplace bears little resemblance to the era in which many of these practices were developed. We showed that one such piece of received-wisdom—that of the supremacy of conscientious employees when it comes to performance—may no longer hold. In this way, our research joins an emerging conversation on this new era of work and should spark additional research on intelligent machines and the employees who use them. It would behoove managers to take heed of our findings, and also to be vigilant for other such pieces of wisdom that may no longer hold as well.

Kardashians without cosmetic work according to artificial intelligenceNewsPoliticsFootballCelebsTVShoppingRoyalsByAmy DenmanDeputy Showbiz Editor09:17, 13 Oct 2022Updated13:11, 13 Oct 2022|5Comments|BookmarkA TikTok video has predicted how the Kardashian-Jenner family would look without their cosmetic procedures using artificial intelligence. The Kardashian clan are known for being style chameleons, but long-term fans have also noticed a marked chance in their appearances in recent years. From Kylie's plumped up pout to Khloe's secret nose job, the sisters have been more honest with their followers about what they've had done in recent years. But how would the family look without any work at all?  But now a clip, created by Australian streamers Vandahood Live, predicts how Kim Kyli,, Khloe, Kris Jenner and Kourtney could look without their tweaks. The eye-opening clip uses footage from last year's Keeping Up With The Kardashians finale special to make the comparisons.

  Altered images of the Kardashian-Jenner sisters using artificial intelligence shows how the reality stars could look if they didn't have any cosmetic work. The most obvious differences in the clip are Kylie's thinner lips – after she had lip filler injections – and Khloe's nose, which she had done shortly before her daughter True turned one. The Vandahood Live stars' reactions are heard as the images of the Kardashians appear.  













The streamers who altered the images say the Kardashians look 'great' without enhancements

 In the clip, Vandahoodlive's Charles says: ""Watching that back, I think surgery might be a waste of time and money. They look normal, fine. They look great!"" Meanwhile, Keith from Vandahood Live told PetaPixel of the clip: ""We used three different AI software and two different standard graphics software and a full week to pull it off. ""We had to take a different approach for each member of the family since each one underwent different changes over the years."" The comedy and entertainment streamers used artificial intelligence programmes such as Deep Face Lab, FaceApp and EbSynth to uncover the Kardashian's looks.

  Keith added: ""In the comments section of the TikTok video, there has been all these debates on the Kardashians' influence and people either going against or defending them. But for us it wasn't that deep, it was all only for entertainment purposes."" Last year, Khloe confirmed she had undergone a nose job procedure after feeling insecure for years. She said: ""Well, for me, everyone says, ‘Oh, my gosh, she's had her third face transplant,’ – I've had one nose job, Dr Raj Kanodia."" Khloe, 38, has also revealed she has had fillers in the past, but said they ""do not work"" for her. She said: ""[Fillers] did not work for me. I looked crazy, and I still think the effects are in there. I went to have it all dissolved like three times.""

 Kim, meanwhile, has always denied getting surgery but admitted to getting Botox which the 41-year-old previously said ""isn't plastic surgery"". Kylie, 25, had lip filler injections as a teen after a boy kissed her and made a cruel comment about her lips. She once said: ""I was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. 











Some of the sisters have discussed having procedures in the past

 ""And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, 'I didn't think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.' But I took that really hard.""

  The most obvious differences in the clip are Kylie's thinner lips – after she had lip filler injections – and Khloe's nose, which she had done shortly before her daughter True turned one. The Vandahood Live stars' reactions are heard as the images of the Kardashians appear.

 In the clip, Vandahoodlive's Charles says: ""Watching that back, I think surgery might be a waste of time and money. They look normal, fine. They look great!"" Meanwhile, Keith from Vandahood Live told PetaPixel of the clip: ""We used three different AI software and two different standard graphics software and a full week to pull it off. ""We had to take a different approach for each member of the family since each one underwent different changes over the years."" The comedy and entertainment streamers used artificial intelligence programmes such as Deep Face Lab, FaceApp and EbSynth to uncover the Kardashian's looks.

 Keith added: ""In the comments section of the TikTok video, there has been all these debates on the Kardashians' influence and people either going against or defending them. But for us it wasn't that deep, it was all only for entertainment purposes."" Last year, Khloe confirmed she had undergone a nose job procedure after feeling insecure for years. She said: ""Well, for me, everyone says, ‘Oh, my gosh, she's had her third face transplant,’ – I've had one nose job, Dr Raj Kanodia."" 










The streamers who altered the images say the Kardashians look 'great' without enhancements

 Khloe, 38, has also revealed she has had fillers in the past, but said they ""do not work"" for her. She said: ""[Fillers] did not work for me. I looked crazy, and I still think the effects are in there. I went to have it all dissolved like three times."" Kim, meanwhile, has always denied getting surgery but admitted to getting Botox which the 41-year-old previously said ""isn't plastic surgery"". Kylie, 25, had lip filler injections as a teen after a boy kissed her and made a cruel comment about her lips.

 She once said: ""I was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. ""And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, 'I didn't think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.' But I took that really hard.""

Roberts, an associate professor of information studies at UCLA, who has spent time with workers in the Philippines who do content moderation for companies like Facebook.""Nothing in any of those terms suggest that there are legions of humans that are needed,"" she said.Some of these legions work for Appen.A globally significant and long-term player in the AI supply chain, the Sydney-headquartered company boasts of having 1 million ""flexible contributors"" in more than 170 countries who do these tasks for clients including Amazon, Google and Boeing.Missed invoices and dead endsDispersed across the world, these workers don't typically meet in person.But in online forums, Appen's ""crowd"" chats about promising projects, the benefits of flexibility and which data-labelling companies pay the most. They also detail frustrations: missed invoices, slow communication from the company and projects that disappear or don't make sense.On a Reddit forum dedicated to working online, posts advise ""Beware of Appen!!"" and ""Appen, save yourself time and frustration"".Several Appen contractors who spoke with the ABC under condition of anonymity, due to fears of repercussions from the company, claimed invoices were sometimes missed for a whole month or delayed.One American worker showed the ABC an invoice tab on Appen's dashboard that showed no invoice generated for the month of June, which they said amounted to hundreds of hours of missing pay.Think you can spot content written by AI?You may not have heard of GPT-3, but there's a good chance you've read its work, used a website that runs its code, or even conversed with it through a chatbot or a character in a game.Read moreThe company did have an issue with invoicing for one project this year that has now been fixed, according to Appen's spokesperson Christina Golden.""We have always kept open communication with our contributors.""If they have a need to share feedback anonymously, we have a whistleblower hotline that is given to all contributors.""But getting in touch with someone who can actually help at Appen is increasingly difficult, according to some of its workers, with slow and seemingly boilerplate responses to problems with jobs or pay.""I used to get generic 'please allow three business days for tickets to be settled' emails,"" one said.""The last three support tickets I sent were automatically closed as soon as I sent them with no reply or action taken on them.""Another said he was invited to participate in projects that simply never materialised.Appen has turned up frequently in the business press after a recent downturn in financial performance.In its first half of 2022 results call, chief executive Mark Brayan said revenue had fallen in part due to a slowdown in spending from some of its large customers.Mr Brayan ascribed this to weaker digital advertising revenue, affecting its ad-related programs.Some have speculated this will impact how the company treats its contractor workforce — especially when it's competing with competitors that chase workers in locations where they can pay the least. There has been growing attention paid to the psychological impact of online content moderation and exposure to disturbing content.(Supplied: The Cleaners)As Appen's former boss Lisa Braden-Harder recently told the Sydney Morning Herald, ""you can definitely do a race to the bottom"".The ABC spoke with workers who said their pay was around or just above minimum wage in their location.Appen spokesperson Ms Golden said the company used location-based minimum wage to ensure they were ""paying above"".""Rates vary by the project due to the different levels of difficulties or expertise required to complete the task.""In fact, ""crowd conditions"" are named as a potential risk in the company's 2021 annual report, with customers requesting information on worker conditions — particularly around content moderation work, which can expose people to extreme and disturbing content.'One of the maids sweeping their nursery room'Technology companies rarely acknowledge the work they contract through companies like Appen, much less the army of people that train their algorithms.Monash University's Jathan Sadowski, who studies the social impact of digital technology, says this kind of data labour is barely discussed in public. And when it is, it is not granted anywhere near the same level of respect or remuneration as other kinds of high-tech work.""You don't want to look at the wizard behind the curtain.""Do you know more?Contact Ariel Bogle using ProtonMail on abogle@protonmail.comAppen's workers described tasks like making voice recordings or taking short videos of certain objects to help develop what they thought was voice command technology. Others seemed to be focused on improving mapping technology or search engine results.Arden*, an Appen contractor from the US Midwest, spoke about one project in which they would be shown a piece of content — an image, video or string of text.They would then have to summarise the purpose of the post in one sentence, and find a link to a trustworthy source that touched on the same subject. They would be given a minute or less to review text, but more time for a long video or streamed content.""[There were] many health-related scams, election fraud, COVID misinformation, fake quotes, faked UFO photos,"" they said.""These were our specialty, but I'd also sometimes see calls to violence, self-harm-related content, violence, gore, abuse material and more.""ABC Science on YouTubeWant more science — plus health, environment, tech and more?

Non-Binding “Guidance”
OSTP included a “Legal Disclaimer” which attempts to soften the impact of the release, describing it as a “white paper.”  OSTP states that the Blueprint is “non-binding and does not constitute US government policy” and “does not supersede, modify, or direct an interpretation of any existing statute, regulation, policy, or international instrument.”  While the Foreword to the Blueprint states that it is intended to provide “guidance” in connection with automated systems, the Legal Disclaimer clearly states that the Blueprint “does not constitute binding guidance for the public or Federal agencies and therefore does not require compliance with the principles described herein.”
Five “Principles”
The Blueprint and Technical Companion describe five principles and associated practices “to help guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems.” The five principles are

Safe and Effective Systems;
Algorithmic Discrimination Protections;
Data Privacy;
Notice and Explanation; and
Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback.

While these five principles often overlap, they combine concepts relevant to employment law and data privacy that are also relevant to the evolving legal landscape around the use of artificial intelligence and automated systems.
OSTP intends the Blueprint to apply broadly, demonstrated by how it defines “automated system” as “any system, software, or process that uses computation as whole or part of a system to determine outcomes, make or aid decisions, inform policy implementation, collect data or observations, or otherwise interact with individuals and/or communities.”  The “Definitions” section notes that automated systems may include, but are not limited to, those derived from machine learning or artificial intelligence.
Principle 1: “Safe and Effective Systems”
The first principle, “Safe and Effective Systems,” states that automated systems should be “developed in consultation from diverse communities, stakeholders, and domain experts” and should “undergo pre-deployment testing, risk identification and mitigation, and ongoing monitoring.”  The Technical Companion highlights that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is also developing a risk management framework to better manage risks posed by Artificial Intelligence.
Principle 2: “Algorithmic Discrimination Protections” 
Under the second principle, “Algorithmic Discrimination Protections,” Americans “should not face discrimination by algorithms and systems should be used and designed in an equitable way.”  This principle also states that “independent evaluation and plain language reporting in the form of an algorithmic impact assessment, including disparity testing results and mitigation information, should be performed and made public whenever possible[.]”  The Technical Companion describes a handful of examples,  such as “a hiring tool that learned the features of a company’s employees (predominantly men) rejecting women applicants for spurious and discriminatory reasons; [and] resumes with the word ‘women’s,’ such as ‘women’s chess club captain,’ were penalized in the candidate ranking.”
Principle: 3: “Data Privacy”
The third principle, “Data Privacy,” provides that “[y]ou should be protected from abusive data practices via built-in protections and you should have agency over how data about you is used.” This principle encourages designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems to request permission and respect decisions regarding “collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of your data[.]”  The Technical Guidance cautions against companies using “surveillance software to track employee discussions about union activity.”  It encourages privacy by design when designing automated systems, and champions extra protections for “sensitive domains” including “health, employment, education, criminal justice, and personal finance” related data.
Principle 4: “Notice and Explanation”
Pursuant to the fourth principle, “Notice and Explanation,” Americans “should know that an automated systems is being used, and understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you.”  The principle encourages clear documentation regarding how the system works, and publicly reporting summaries of the automated systems.  The Technical Guidance notes that notice has “long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement[.]” The Technical Guidance also calls attention to the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which contains a notice requirement, and a California law requiring warehouse employees to be provided with notice and explanation about use of quota systems, which are “often facilitated by algorithmic monitoring systems.”
Principle 5: “Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback”
The fifth principle, “Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback,” states that “[y]ou should be able to opt out, where appropriate, and have access to a person who can quickly consider and remedy problems you encounter.” The Technical Guidance provides the example of an unemployment benefits system in Colorado which required applicants to have a smartphone to verify their identity but provided no alternative option.  The Technical Guidance encourages the use of brief, clear, and accessible ways to opt out of automated systems in favor of human alternatives, where doing so would be timely and effective.
Conclusion
The Blueprint represents a significant effort by the White House to guide private industry and state and local governments in developing practices and policies around the use of automated systems.  While it is expressly non-binding, it will likely provide a framework for drafts of future legislation.  Some jurisdictions, just as New York City, Illinois, and Maryland, have already passed laws directed at certain automated systems.  The Blueprint may encourage other jurisdictions to pass laws and regulations governing the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's the claim of many pundits, who argue that artificial intelligence (AI) will replace human workers in every industry as soon as 2025—and that we're already seeing signs of this trend. However, while AI may seem like a great replacement for humans in some cases, it could also lead to a host of unforeseen consequences if we don't take steps to ensure that robots can be trusted with sensitive information or jobs involving human interaction. As such, we need to continue developing technologies that enable machines to learn from their mistakes and develop new skills on their own—without having access to vast amounts of data sets or having any idea where those learning curves might lead us next. If you're looking for ways in which AI is changing our lives today... well... look no further than these seven developments worth noting:AI that can detect liesLie detection is a fascinating field of study, and one that has been around for centuries. But it's only recently that artificial intelligence has come into its own as an important tool in this area.In order to detect lies, researchers can analyze patterns of speech or movement on video footage—or even use brain scans to identify whether someone is telling the truth. These techniques are especially useful when they're combined with more traditional ways of detecting deception: polygraph tests and behavioral analysis like body language and tone of voice (which can be used together).The ability to detect lies could help law enforcement better investigate crimes—and even save lives! For example: if you know someone's lying about something like whether they've ever been arrested before, it could make it easier for police officers to determine what kind of person they're dealing with while investigating crimes such as robbery or murder cases where there may be suspects who aren't always forthcoming about their pasts.""Intelligent algorithms that identify depressionThe algorithm is based on neural networks and can detect depression in real time. It's not just that the algorithm works better than a human at detecting depression, but also that it's able to do so at an affordable price. This means that we might be able to use these algorithms for things like improving treatment for people with depression or even helping them prevent themselves from developing the condition in the first place.The technology could be used as early warning tools for those who are at risk of developing depression, allowing them to get treatment sooner rather than later and avoiding unnecessary suffering later down the line.An AI system that teaches itself to play computer gamesIf you're like me, you've probably spent countless hours playing video games. You probably also know that most of the time, your brain doesn't need to be involved in order for it to be used—the game just makes sense. But what if there was an AI system that could learn how to play games without any human input? What would happen then?A team from Stanford University has been working on this very question and they've come up with some interesting results: an AI system that can teach itself how to play computer games! The researchers trained an agent called ""Lukas"" using reinforcement learning—a method where agents learn by trial and error using rewards or punishments (or both). They gave him access not only over all sorts of different game genres but also allowed him free rein over which ones he wanted access too; he could choose whether or not he wanted a certain genre at any given moment during his training period.Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana are only the beginningSiri and Cortana are only the beginning. Other examples of AI in the real world include:Amazon’s Alexa, which is an intelligent personal assistant that can help you shop, control your smart home devices, stream music, get news headlines and weather updates—all without lifting a finger!Google Assistant (Gmail) has been built into Gmail since late 2016. It understands natural language requests like ""What's my flight status?"" or ""show me recipes I haven't tried yet."" The technology also learns over time so it can answer questions better over time as well as anticipate users' needs automaticallyA robot you can trustYou can't trust the AI in your phone to tell the truth. But what if it could?There's a lot of hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), but there are plenty of AI developments that are still under-the-radar. One such development is a robot you can trust—one designed to detect lies and identify depression.Researchers at MIT have created an algorithm that can detect depression using facial analysis software and machine learning techniques, which they tested on real human subjects with over five years' experience working as psychologists or nurses treating patients with mental health issues like anxiety or depression. The team found that their algorithm was able to identify people who were clinically depressed 90% of the time based on fewer than 100 images per person!Automatic translationIn the past, it was always necessary to hire a human translator to help you communicate with someone from another country. With AI-powered translation, however, you don't need that extra step.The technology is still not perfect—but it's getting better all the time. Google Translate has been able to translate between more than 70 languages since its launch in 2006 and now supports over 400 million users worldwide (and counting). Microsoft's Bing Translator offers similar services through its free version as well as paid plans for businesses that need advanced features like video translation or real-time chat conferencing across multiple devicesAutomated journalismWhile the idea of AI writing news articles is a bit off-putting, it’s a reality. In fact, some companies are already using artificial intelligence (AI) to write their own content.For example, IBM Watson has been trained to spot patterns in text and then create human-like speech for use in videos and infographics. It can also generate original ideas for essays or reports by analyzing existing data sources like Wikipedia or social media sites like Twitter.But what if we were able to automate journalism too? What kind of stories would these computers tell us? Would they be objective? Or biased towards one side or another?We've all heard about how AI is going to change the world, but these advancements will have a profound impact on society in the very near future.AI is only as good as the data it is trained on, and there's no shortage of information to train AI with. The technology can be used to perpetuate discrimination and bias, but it can also be used to solve problems that have plagued humanity for centuries.While we're still in the early stages of AI development, we've already seen how powerful this technology can be when combined with other technologies such as machine learning or deep learning algorithms (which allow computers to learn through observation).ConclusionAI is a very exciting field to work in, but it's also one that requires a lot of hard work. If you want to be an expert in artificial intelligence, then you need to put in the time and effort. You can't just expect your computer program or robot to do all the work for you; instead, you have to build them up and teach them how we humans think.https://becominghuman.ai/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-10-16T14:39:05.284Z,e89a98f3916d,['Ghulam Mustafa Shoaib'],,,,,,,,,,,,,
