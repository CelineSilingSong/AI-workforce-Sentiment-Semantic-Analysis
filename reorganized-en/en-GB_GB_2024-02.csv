AI was all the rage dominating last month’s Davos knocking the perennial favorite of blockchain technology off the Promenade and making it look ""very last year."" The conversations focused on “the serious strides in global collaboration on governance and setting the right guardrails.”


This echoed the U.S. Executive Order (E.O.) 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence in 2023, and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's message at the global AI Safety Summit 2023 that the “future of AI is safe AI.”

Not a moment too soon for this message, with Nvidea, the leader of the Mag 7, experiencing a 16 percent share price bump following record fourth quarter sales with co-founder and chief executive Jenson Huang commenting, ""Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point, demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.""

PROMOTED
Many are talking about how AI is implemented and how it affects everyday lives, but the message of ""safety first"" does not quite reconcile with the ongoing disruption and upheaval in the jobs market coupled with the investment potential of generative AI.

Recent data from the website Layoffs.fyi which tracks the tech jobs market shows generative AI is even hitting employment levels among the feted tech giants. Around 34,000 jobs have been lost so far this year by companies including Microsoft, Snap, and eBay as they have switched investment into generative AI at the expense of other parts of their business.

A total of 138 tech companies have cut jobs this year, according to Layoffs.fyi, demonstrating how AI, or to be precise, the desire to invest in AI, is disrupting the tech jobs market.
Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek has said, “We need to become more efficient by deprioritizing some of the existing things, but we also need to invest in some of the new.”

Enterprise software company SAP, has announced a “company-wide transformation” including cutting around 8,000 jobs as it increases its focus on AI.
Pitchbook data on investment in startups last year shows AI startups attracted one out of every three dollars invested in the U.S. in 2023 as investors competed to back companies developing AI technology following the stunning debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Venture investors took a bigger slice of a shrinking cake as total investment dropped to $170.6 billion from $242.2 billion in the previous year. OpenAI and Anthropic alone accounted for 10 percent of the total deal value.

Generative AI is very much focused on sectors such as media, marketing and law where ""text"" is an important part of the business.
The brutal verdict from Ken Smythe, founder of Next Round Capital summed it up, “AI names are trading at a premium. Some software names are trading at a premium. Meanwhile, food and grocery delivery and crappy consumer concepts are all trading down 95 percent from their last round.”
AI continues to disrupt in new ways hitting venture capital and startups just as much as traditional tech giants, and to be frank, it looks a pretty volatile experience. Where the AI “safety first” policy of world leaders resonates is in the highly regulated and controlled investment management industry.
AI: The Next Frontier For Investment Management
Consultancy Deloitte is convinced about the disruptive impact of AI on investment management claiming it is the “the next frontier for investment management.”
Research by Ocorian has found that almost all alternative asset fund managers believe AI will be important to the growth of their business over the next five years with 43 percent surveyed believing it will be very important. More than one in three (34 percent) say they have conducted very successful tests of AI in projects within their firms.
The London Stock Exchange says generative AI is a “powerful business changing tool” for investment management identifying five key areas where it will have an impact: legal and consulting, software and IT, research and development, sales and marketing, and manufacturing.
AI can sift through legal documents and support due diligence while it can reshape how software codes are written. It can speed up research and boost social media marketing and draft technical sales collateral. AI models can reorganise the processing of tasks currently carried out manually.
For all the talk, fund managers admit that in the financial services industry is only at the beginning of the AI journey. BNP Paribas has said that while it is “using AI in a number of areas” it is at the same time keeping a close eye on the associated risks”.
Risk, the domain investment managers must master to make money for investors, is the key word to bear in mind and a guide to how the investment management industry is already using AI. Ironically enough, using AI to help better understand the risks and impact that AI will have on (other) industries in order to better risk adjust investments, is an emerging hot topic among risk boffins.
AI Is On The March In A Highly Regulated Industry
AI is on the march in investment management, a highly regulated industry, and along with the use of alternative data such as credit card spending and employment data, such as average salaries and hiring plans, AI is regarded as increasingly key for fund managers to generate higher returns as they look for ways to use data to differentiate themselves in the market.
The scope of AI use cases are also expanding to seek to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, to handling other aspects of the fund management industry service offering including investor engagement.
AI's biggest use case is in risk management where it can give managers tools to improve compliance and risk management functions while automating data analysis, including external data, to better anticipate major market events and scenarios.
Ocorian’s research with alternative fund managers shows compliance and regulation is regarded as the area most likely to provide a role for use of AI. Survey respondents ranked compliance and regulation first above sales and marketing activity, recruitment, administration, identifying and reviewing investments, and client servicing and reporting, as the functions that AI will have the most impact on over the next five years.
More than nine in ten (92 percent) alternative investment managers are already using AI as part of risk and compliance procedures. Around one in ten (11 percent) started doing so more than two years ago. Over half (55 percent) started two years ago, and 24 percent started between one and two years ago.
Joe French, Managing Director and Head of Financial Crime at Ocorian, says, “The majority of alternative fund managers have already been using AI within their compliance and risk procedures for around two years. When used for the right type of tasks, AI can transform the ability of over-stretched, under-resourced compliance teams.”
His view is backed up by further specialist research Ocorian conducted among compliance and risk professionals. It interviewed senior leaders and senior compliance and risk executives at alternative fund manager firms which collectively manage around $132.25 billion assets under management working across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, U.A.E, Turkey, Quatar, and Saudi Arabia.
More than nine out of 10 (92 percent) interviewed indicated they are already making use of AI in their organisations with more than half (55 percent) indicate they started using AI two years ago. Among the few who admit to not using AI around 71 percent plan to do so within six months.
The regulation and compliance professionals working in investment management identified transaction monitoring as the biggest area where AI can be applied while other key areas highlighted were staff filings, communication monitoring, and internal capital and liquidity monitoring.
World Economic Forum Managing Director Jeremy Jurgens, writing about AI after this year’s Davos meeting. said, ""there’s a need for nuance beyond polarized narratives” in respect of the debate about AI.
The nuance for investment management is that AI is already contributing to the development of this highly regulated and controlled industry, but not necessarily in the areas one might first think of.

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks, deep learning models, complex algorithms, and large and varied training datasets to produce original content based on user input.
The content that generative AI creates includes written text, images, video, audio, music, synthetic data, and computer code, with new use cases and products emerging on a near-daily basis.
Generative AI has recently garnered widespread attention because major breakthroughs in the technology are accelerating and now reaching the general public.
For example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT — which is publicly available in both free and paid versions — can generate grammatically correct and logical text responses that appear to be written by humans, and OpenAI’s DALL-E tool can produce photorealistic images based on user descriptions. Other companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have also developed sophisticated generative AI tools that can produce authentic-looking text, images, or computer code with minimal human intervention or technical know-how.
In this guide, we’ll talk through more of what generative AI actually is and how it works, as well as some practical tips for understanding how it can be used and how your business can benefit from incorporating this technology into your workflows and routines.

How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI models work through the training they receive from massive training datasets and neural networks, which teach the models how to reason in ways akin to a human brain. For some of these models, researchers feed enormous volumes of data — words, pictures, music, or other content — into a deep learning system called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. The supervised neural network sifts through the data and uses a system that rewards successes and penalizes errors, mistakes, and failures.
Over time and with frequent fine-tuning and improvements, a generative AI model can learn how to identify and understand complex relationships. Beyond GAN, other common generative AI model training techniques include transformer-based model training and diffusion model training.
Once a model has received its initial training and is released, users may access it in different ways and for different reasons. If it’s an AI chatbot like Gemini or ChatGPT, for example, users may choose to access the tool from their desktop or a mobile app, requiring little to no additional investment or hardware to get started. All they need to do is input their queries, being sure to write clear, natural-language inputs; these tools will generate responses accordingly.
If the customer is more interested in using a foundation model so they can develop or fine-tune their own models and project use cases, they’ll likely need to work with the original vendor’s API keys and documentation. They may also need to invest in GPUs, CPUs, and other high-powered computer hardware and software in order to operate these tools in their own environments.

Historical Evolution & Significance of Generative AI
Artificial intelligence research began to take shape during the 1950s when Alan Turing and other scientists began to explore ways to create computing frameworks that could duplicate human thinking.
By the 1960s, so-called Markov models began to appear. These probability-based algorithms could generate speech or text based on basic mathematical models, though with limited success. By the 1990s, more sophisticated AI technologies and foundational tools were appearing, including early AI chatbots and the first recurrent neural network architecture.
In the 2010s and 2020s, the development of transformer-based architecture, GPUs, and advances in deep learning have ushered in far more advanced AI. Today, recurrent neural networks can generate content in a way that approximates — and in some cases exceeds — the output of human artists, musicians, and writers.
At this point, artificial intelligence and generative AI are fundamentally reshaping the way people and businesses act, interact, and process information. Whether they’re simply experimenting with free generative AI chatbots or they’re fine-tuning and embedding complex generative AI tools in their enterprise environments, a significant number of business professionals and casual users alike have begun to use generative AI tools in their daily lives. As these tools continue to mature, their benefits expand into areas like pharmaceuticals and drug discovery, healthcare and diagnostics, and generative AI cybersecurity protections.

Generative AI vs. AI
In essence, generative AI is a narrow type and application of the broader artificial intelligence umbrella of technologies.
Generative AI technology is specifically designed and trained to generate new content. In contrast, AI as a whole encompasses a wide range of use cases and applications, including robotic process automation, AI-supplemented cybersecurity, sentiment analysis, predictive maintenance, image recognition, and chatbots with either predetermined or generative responses.
Both of these AI technology types can effectively support human users with a variety of tasks and goals, yet at this time, both types of technology are not mature, consistent, or autonomous enough to stand in for humans.

5 Key Generative AI Techniques & Models
The best generative AI techniques and models all depend on what you’re trying to accomplish and if you’re planning to train your own models from scratch or fine-tune an out-of-the-box solution. Learn more about some of the model architectures and related training techniques:

Transformer-based model training: Through a combination of attention mechanisms — which allow models to analyze data all at once rather than sequentially — and encoders and decoders, generative models are trained to create logical, original content in the style of training data. This type of model training is most commonly used for text and code generation models. Model example: Gemini (formerly Bard).
Variational autoencoder (VAE) training: Input data is sent to a latent space (latent variable generative model training) where the model can more easily learn how to accurately depict images and audio. Model example: Certain iterations of DALL-E.
Autoregressive model training: Trained to sequentially predict the most logical next segment of data. This type of model training is most commonly used for coding and developer use cases. Model example: GitHub Copilot.
GAN model training: Two different generative AI models compete to generate the most accurate data and outputs; their ongoing competition trains them both to produce better data over time. Model example: Artbreeder.
Diffusion model training: A type of latent variable generative model, diffusion model training involves diffusing original data with noise and slowly removing it to create new data that closely resembles the old data. Model example: Stable Diffusion XL.

3 Real-World Generative AI Use-Case Examples
Generative AI can be used for much more than simple text generation and Q&A. In business contexts, users are beginning to take advantage of generative AI capabilities for these use generative AI cases and many more:
Advanced Data Analytics & Recommendations
Rather than simply providing predictive and prescriptive analytics results, generative AI data analytics solutions can pull data from more locations and provide smart explanations and recommendations for how to improve these numbers in the future. Marketing, sales, e-commerce, and product development teams are using this type of tool to help them brainstorm new solutions for better customer engagement.
Video & Image Generation
AI image and video generators are popping up all over the place and are being used for everything from just-for-fun creative projects to social media posts to video game graphics. With intelligent editing tools, natural-language-driven content creation, AI avatars, and voice synthesis, these modern media creation tools make art and video projects more accessible to more users.

Coding & App Development
Several generative AI platforms have been developed with the needs of advanced and novice developers in mind. These tools allow users to create new code through natural language requests. Similarly, they can troubleshoot existing code, automate code completions, and receive recommendations for how to further optimize their coding projects, all through chat and natural language interfaces.
5 Benefits of Generative AI
When it’s used thoughtfully and with clear goals in mind, generative AI offers users a range of unique benefits, including the following:
Operational Efficiencies
Generative AI assistants and copilots are great at assisting users with routine tasks that can take up a lot of time. Some of the work that AI can now help with includes taking and summarizing meeting notes, updating content in documents and spreadsheets, and sifting through emails to determine which ones are most urgent. With AI handling some of these types of tasks, employees have more time to focus on more strategic tasks for the business.

Accessible Tools for Brainstorming
If you’re feeling stuck on a project or are a solopreneur who needs someone to bounce ideas off of, several generative AI tools are up to the task. Inflection’s Pi, for example, is a capable conversational AI agent that does a good job of handling contextualized, back-and-forth conversations. While it won’t be the best solution for artists who want to talk about or work through their projects, text-based queries work well here.
Scalable Content Generation
When generative AI chatbots and models are given clear instructions for content generation, the initial drafts they produce are often close to human quality and take a fraction of the time.
For example, ChatGPT can draft a 2,000-word article on a complex topic — even including relevant headers — in less than a minute.
These tools can be used to generate different kinds and quantities of content as well. For instance, if you are experiencing a creative block as a social media manager, with just a few pieces of information fed into a generative AI tool, you can generate dozens of social media caption options to help you move forward.

Some Limitations of Generative AI
While generative AI can complete many tasks similarly to how a human would do them, these tools still have limitations that can impact your results and possible projects:

AI hallucinations: Because of how generative AI models are trained, they may occasionally give a completely false or bizarre answer to user queries with the utmost confidence – these are known as AI hallucinations. It’s important to fact-check AI content, especially if it sounds strange.
No independent thinking capabilities: Generative AI tools are not autonomous thinkers, though their responses sometimes sound like they’re coming from a human. They are incapable of original thoughts — all content they generate is based on the training data and algorithms running in the background.
Little historic data storage and retrieval: While some generative AI tools store conversational history for a limited time, many do not store historic data in a way that users can easily access. As such, it’s difficult for users to continue or recall past conversations with AIs as they might do with a friend.
Limited cybersecurity and data security protections: Some generative AI tools have basic security and compliance features built in, but most will not have the enterprise-level data security protections that users require. These users will need to invest in third-party, comprehensive cybersecurity solutions for the best possible results.
Biased training data: Generative AI tools are only as good as the datasets and algorithms that train them. If data is sourced in an incomplete, inaccurate, or unethical manner, the resulting content generated by the tool may reflect those biases and errors.
Rare citations and sourcing information: Generative AI isn’t the most reliable way to go about serious research, especially since most of these tools do not mention any specific citations or references when stating a fact.
Lack of real-time data: Though this is changing quickly with tools like Google’s Gemini, most generative AI tools are not connected to the internet or other real-time data sources. This means that the answers they provide may not take into account recent, relevant events.

Top 8 Best Practices for Generative AI
The following generative AI best practices can benefit both business leaders and individual users of this type of technology:

Set policies: Set an AI policy that details AI governance, AI ethics, and usage rules for your organization.
Ensure standards: Protect and determine standards for your data proactively.
Staff training: Train employees and any other users on generative AI tools and how and when to use them.
Stay aware of regulations: Pay attention to industry-specific, regional, national, and international regulations and compliance laws, especially as these rules evolve around AI technology.
Monitor content: Quality-check generated content against reliable sources to ensure accuracy.
Select partners carefully: Partner with ethical AI technology providers that transparently discuss how they train their models and source their data.
Evaluate models: If you choose to develop your own models, establish a process for periodically evaluating model performance; ideally, add a peer review component so all users can share feedback if something is amiss.
Specific prompts: Be specific when prompting for the best possible outcomes.

Risks & Ethical Considerations for Generative AI
Not surprisingly, the rise of Generative AI has unleashed concerns, especially in the ways that it can effectively mimic the work and conversations of humans. Learn more about some of the possible risks of generative AI and ethical concerns that come with the rise of generative AI:
Inaccuracies & Hallucinations
For reasons mostly unknown at this time, the complex training that generative AI tools receive can occasionally cause them to hallucinate, or produce wildly inaccurate (and sometimes offensive) content.
AI-generated content requires human review because it isn’t always complete or accurate, even if it sounds fairly logical. Blindly plugging in text generated from an AI tool into your projects could lead to a variety of problems, ranging from accusations of bias to legal issues related to plagiarism.
Deepfakes & Misinformation
Generative AI tools for images, videos, and audio synthesis are being used to create more believable deepfakes, or digital media that convincingly mimics an actual person to their detriment. With the maturity and believability of this technology, deepfakes and similar generative AI products have been used to falsely incriminate world leaders, create explicit and offensive imagery of celebrities, and more.
Legal Issues & Plagiarism 
Businesses must be cautious about the types of music, images, and other materials they use when derived from generative AI. Because these models are often trained on data or actual content produced by writers, musicians, and painters, this usage can raise questions about ownership, control, and copyright.
For this reason, generating a photorealistic image that’s similar to the specific style of an artist could raise questions or even lead to a lawsuit or public backlash. There are also growing concerns about AI-enabled plagiarism in academic settings.
Privacy & Security
AI privacy Issues and AI cybersecurity concerns are at the forefront of generative AI. Some data that’s used to train generative AI models may inadvertently contain private data or information that could be exposed at a later date. This danger may come in the form of a model’s initial training data or in the data it collects from user queries and submissions.
Equally concerning: cybergangs and other criminals have already begun to use generative AI to produce highly convincing documents, software, and images that become part of social engineering campaigns.
Societal & Environmental Impact 
The overall impact of generative AI on the workforce and society at large is prompting serious discussion. Some observers, such as New York Times technology columnist Kevin Roose, have raised concerns about the technology being used to manipulate humans in harmful and destructive ways. In addition, critics have voiced concerns about the technology carrying out its own dangerous acts if it achieves higher levels of autonomy.
Currently, there are many concerns about the processing power and requirements to produce this type of technology as well; some AI companies are coming forward with greener production methods, but at this time, there’s little regulation for this industry that is already harming the environment at scale.

Top 3 Generative AI Tech Providers
While many generative AI leaders, including AWS and IBM, have come to the fore in recent months and years, these three are the clear front runners today:

OpenAI: A startup that has blossomed into a multi-billion-dollar empire, OpenAI is the force behind GPT-4, ChatGPT, DALL-E 3, and several other content generation tools. Its focus areas include text, image, and code generation.
Microsoft: Long a leader in the business and enterprise technology space, Microsoft has quickly made a name for itself in generative AI, especially through its strategic and close partnership with OpenAI. Its Copilot technologies, including Copilot for Microsoft 365, provide intelligence AI assistance to users across a variety of workplace tasks.
Google: Google (Alphabet) was one of the earliest generative AI technology pioneers with its 2017 paper that established the basis for modern transformer-based architecture. Today, it offers users access to a tool called Gemini, a direct ChatGPT competitor that can supplement its responses with real-time data and images from the internet.

Beyond these larger enterprises, many other companies and early startups are creating interesting generative AI solutions.

The Future of Generative AI
While nobody can predict the exact trajectory of generative AI, it’s already clear it will profoundly impact businesses and society at large. As the technology advances, its capabilities and relevant industry use cases continue to expand. Nowhere is this more evident than in the pharmaceutical drug discovery and medical diagnostics companies that are releasing new solutions and use cases regularly.
Years from now, it’s possible that generative AI will produce better final drafts than professional writers and generate better art and design projects than professional human artists and graphic designers. In many ways, we may see generative AI take over jobs in both creative and industrial fields that were previously handled by human workers. However, we’ll likely see the creation of new jobs as well, especially for work like AI quality assurance, training, and testing.

Determine your goals and hopeful outcomes for AI usage: Before investing in expensive tools and possible hardware and software to get started, first decide what kind of generative AI your organization wants and when, how, and why it will be used. This will help you narrow your search to the most useful tooling options.
Research available tools and AI vendors: Your search should focus on the reputation of vendors and tools, the relevance of tools to your organizational goals, and how well prospective tools align with your compliance and ethical requirements.
Select AI model(s) that work for your organization: Now it’s time to select a model that will align with your goals as an organization. Beyond focusing on models from reputable AI vendors, you’ll also want to consider your unique requirements, like budget and the level of technical skill within your workforce to use these kinds of tools.
Determine how to integrate AI with your current tool stack: Though you can still get a lot out of standalone generative AI solutions, businesses will be able to do more with their data and projects if they select a model that integrates directly with their most-used applications, documents, and other company resources. Many AI vendors offer accessible API keys, plugins, and other integration options to help you unify your tech stack with AI.
Develop an AI usage and governance policy for your organization: To make sure everyone is on the same page about how AI should be used within the organization, create a comprehensive policy and distribute it throughout your workforce. This policy should detail any roles or responsibilities, how to use data in a way that complies with relevant regulations, and more.
Train and provide resources to all users for appropriate AI usage: Simply handing a policy to your employees is not enough to enforce proper AI use. That’s why it’s a good idea to train relevant stakeholders on how they can use AI to make their workflows more efficient and effective.

Dive Brief:

Job seekers hitting the market with generative AI skills command an average salary boost of 47% compared to competitors without them, according to an Indeed report published Wednesday. The company reviewed job posting salary data on its platform.
Technology workers who are competent in generative AI can expect average salaries of up to $174,727, according to the company’s analysis.
Generative AI sits alongside other key skills earning job seekers a salary premium including deep learning, computer vision and knowledge of specific software languages and frameworks such as Rust or PyTorch.





















Dive Insight:
The job market fluctuations of 2023 are giving way to more stability this year, as enterprises resume once-deferred projects and spin up AI implementations. Job seekers with tech chops benefit from these efforts amid a shortage of specialized talent.
Data scientists, machine learning engineers and software engineers are some of the roles that require these sought-after skills.
″Half of the highest-paid skills in tech are AI-specific, which suggests that job seekers with AI skills can stand out in a competitive job market, and potentially earn more than their counterparts,” the company said in the report.
Employers across sectors of the economy had nearly 400,000 active tech job postings in January, an uptick of nearly 34,000 from the previous month, according to CompTIA data. 
The scarcity of AI-related tech skills available in the market is causing a rift between talent demand and supply, said Brian Jackson, research director at Info-Tech Research Group.
“The number of data scientists available on the market, people with that real mathematical level understanding of how to model data, and bring in data warehouses… that’s a big talent shortage,” Jackson said.
Enterprise leaders can address the talent gap through upskilling and training opportunities. Despite interest in these opportunities, less than 1 in 4 developers say their employers provide time for upskilling or learning AI skills, according to a HackerRank survey.

Why Australians aren’t buying in the generative AI hype (Source – RMIT Online)
Aussies don’t believe in the generative AI hype?By Muhammad Zulhusni






Many Australians remain skeptical about the effects of generative AI on their careers.A significant gap in areas like generative AI and cybersecurity poses challenges for employers and employees alike.Australian businesses and the workforce must adapt to the evolving digital landscape through strategic training and the development of new skills.Generative AI’s marketing narrative has caught everyone’s attention, heralding a new era where it reshapes business strategies, particularly in learning and development. This comes at a critical juncture, where acquiring digital skills is beneficial and essential for businesses and their workforce. However, a recent study has highlighted a surprising trend: many Australians seem to underestimate the impact this technology could have on their professional lives.A collaborative study conducted by RMIT Online and Deloitte Access Economics has shed light on an alarming gap in Australians’ understanding of generative AI’s potential to disrupt existing job roles. This lack of awareness is especially concerning, given the rapid pace of digital transformation across industries.The skills gap in digital competencies among both employers and employees is becoming increasingly apparent. Employers have noted a particular shortage in digital skills within their organizations, with a significant emphasis on generative AI, machine learning, data science, coding, and cybersecurity. This scarcity has led businesses to offer a considerable premium for these in-demand skills. Meanwhile, employees have acknowledged an even more acute shortage of digital skills, exacerbating fears about future job security in the face of emerging technologies.IS USING GENERATIVE AI AT WORK CHEATING?Muhammad Zulhusni | 23 February, 2024  Generative AI in the workplace: Use and relevanceThis growing demand for digital skills underscores the urgency with which the Australian economy needs to address these skill shortages. Reports by Deloitte and the Australian Computer Society (ACS) project that an additional 1.3 million digital skills will be required by 2030 to keep pace with AI and data analytics advancements. This necessity is mirrored in the workforce’s sentiment, where most recognize the looming integration of technologies like generative AI into their daily tasks.Despite the clear trajectory towards a more digitally integrated workplace, nearly half of the employees surveyed admit to having never used generative AI in their current roles, often citing its perceived irrelevance to their work. This viewpoint starkly contrasts with studies indicating that most occupations will eventually interact with these technologies. Employees do recognize the importance of digital literacy for their future success, although they underestimate the value of specific skills like data science and analytics.The report reiterates the disconnect between employees’ current use of generative AI and their understanding of its relevance, despite widespread indications of its impending impact across various occupations. Furthermore, Deloitte’s research reveals that a mere fraction of Australian businesses feel fully equipped to adopt and utilize AI technologies effectively.With digital skills in high demand, businesses are prepared to offer premiums for candidates proficient in data and digital competencies. This readiness highlights the critical skill gap in the Australian workforce, further magnified by the advent of AI and other pivotal technologies. RMIT Online’s CEO, Nic Cola, stresses the importance of proactive reskilling and upskilling to navigate the challenges posed by these technological shifts.Echoing the need for a swift response to the evolving digital landscape, John O’Mahony of Deloitte Access Economics points out the unique advantages of generative AI in enhancing traditional learning and development. Its capability to produce customized content can significantly boost employee learning efficiency and knowledge retention.Facing the future: The urgent need for strategic workforce developmentDespite these insights, many employers have yet to introduce generative AI training within their organizations, underscoring a broader unawareness or hesitancy towards embracing these technologies. This reluctance occurs even as specific industries are poised for rapid and profound changes due to this revolutionary technology, emphasizing the critical need for a strategic approach to workforce development in the face of digital transformation.Generative AI stands out from prior technological advancements with its ability to process vast amounts of unstructured data, eliminating a significant hurdle for business adoption. Its capability to generate new, multimodal content from straightforward user prompts opens up intelligence use to a wider audience, without requiring a background in computer science.Currently, a mere 5% of Australian businesses are completely ready to integrate and utilize AI in their workflows. However, a substantial portion of the workforce and student body—32% of employees and 58% of students—already engage with generative AI, pushing its adoption across various sectors.The main economic advantage of generative AI lies in its ability to enhance productivity by automating mundane and labor-intensive tasks. According to Deloitte’s survey on generative AI, regular users of these tools can save an average of 5.3 hours weekly. Those equipped with the skills to effectively employ the technology are at the forefront of these productivity improvements, with 59% of employees planning to enhance their generative AI skills within the following year.HERE’S HOW ENTERPRISES COULD EMBRACE GENERATIVE AI AND CLOUD TECH IN 2024Dashveenjit Kaur | 9 November, 2023Towards a generative AI-ready Australia: Bridging the training gapHowever, there’s a noticeable disparity between employees’ enthusiasm to learn about generative AI and businesses’ investment in training and adopting these tools. 78% of companies surveyed have not offered generative AI training, or are unaware of such initiatives within their organizations. Additionally, 17% do not foresee providing training on generative AI at any point.This gap in training exacerbates potential risks associated with generative AI, such as data breaches, inaccuracies, and copyright issues, with 53% of employees expressing concerns over privacy when using the technology in their roles.Nevertheless, investment in AI by Australian companies is expected to surge to AU$27.5 billion by 2030, a seven-fold increase. This investment aims to maximize generative AI’s benefits by training employees on tailored models that securely and responsibly incorporate the company’s data. It also seeks to enhance workplace training and experiences through AI, thereby attracting and retaining employees adept in generative AI technologies.Generative AI’s impact on skill demand varies across roles and industries, depending on how it’s applied. For instance, generative AI could affect 98% of sales tasks but only 3% of finance-related tasks in the retail industry. In cases where generative AI augments tasks rather than fully automating them, employees with basic technical skills, like coding and prompt design, can significantly benefit.Five key industries—financial services, ICT and media, professional services, education, and wholesale trade—are poised for rapid and transformative changes due to generative AI, representing 26% of the Australian economy or nearly AU$600 billion in economic activity.Although coding has been a highly sought-after skill in Australia for the past decade, the rise of no-code generative AI tools is making programming skills more accessible to the broader workforce. This shift underscores the growing importance of soft skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication, alongside technical abilities.Top five in-demand skills for professionals from January to July 2023 (Source – RMIT Online)Generative AI is also expected to generate new job roles, especially in managing customized AI models, necessitating specialized data skills. The demand for professionals capable of designing AI models, monitoring outputs, and ensuring training data is diverse and balanced is set to rise sharply. Projections from Deloitte and the ACS anticipate a 179% increase in demand for advanced data analytics skills and a 268% surge in high-performance computing skills by 2030.

Generative AI exploded into the public consciousness at the end of 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, but by that point it was already causing problems for artists and illustrators. They only gotten worse as the AI hype took off over the past year.You’ve probably heard the story by now: AI companies indiscriminately took a ton of copyrighted material off the web without anyone’s permission, trained models on all that data, then acted like they weren’t to blame when people started using image generators like DALL-E and Midjourney to create works in the same style as artists whose work had been stolen to train them. But there’s another piece to that: it isn’t just an insult to those artists; it’s actively taking work away from them.To learn more about the impact these AI tools have had on artists and how people in the profession are fighting back, I spoke to award-winning concept artist Karla Ortiz. She not only has an impressive resume that spans mediums and includes work with companies like Marvel, Ubisoft, and Wizards of the Coast, but she’s been at the forefront of the campaign against generative AI. Ortiz was one of three names on the first class action lawsuit launched against AI image generators back in January 2023 and her activism hasn’t stopped there.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Generative AI and AI-generated media have been in the news a lot for the past year or so. When did you come across these tools and when did you start to realize they would become an important issue for illustrators and concept artists like yourself?I became aware of generative AI around April 2020. I came across a website called Weird Wonderful AI and it was promoting this thing called Disco Diffusion and it had something called the Artist Studies. In those Artist Studies, I saw the names of so many of my peers, people that I knew personally, and one of the things that really blew my mind was that there were some similarities to their work. I thought at first it must be some kind of university thing and I wanted to know more about it, so I reached out to some of the actual artists that are on this list, and to my shock, they didn’t know what I was talking about.This place had studied those artists without the artists even knowing about it. So we looked into who was making these and we found out they were also selling merchandise that suspiciously looked just like the studies they were doing — mugs, NFTs, you name it. The folks that were on these studies were like, “Hey, listen, we reached out to them.” We were like, “Hey, can you take their name down? They didn’t want to be a part of this.” But these folks straight up ghosted us. That was my first introduction to generative AI.Fast forward to August and September of 2022, when Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion were really blowing up, and because the first interaction had left such a bad taste in my mouth, I was like, “Okay, let me research these guys and see what’s up.” What I found was disturbing. Basically these models had been trained on almost the entirety of my work, almost the entirety of the work of my peers, and almost every single artist that I knew. I spent various afternoons being like, “What about this artist? There they are in the dataset. What about that artist? There they are in the dataset.” To add insult to injury, these companies were letting users and in some cases encouraging users to use our full names and our reputations to make media that looked like ours to then immediately compete with us in our own markets.The thing that a lot of people don’t know is that like artists like myself were already feeling the effects of this in our industry back in August 2022. Rumors started to pop up that people had lost jobs, and then rumors became anecdotal quotes where it’s like, “Yes, I actually lost this.” I knew of students who had lost their internships because companies decided to use generative AI. That took various forms in the entertainment industry, in music, in illustration. Even that same winter of 2022, the San Francisco Ballet did a whole marketing campaign for The Nutcracker — which is huge — and it was completely generated via Midjourney. But that’s someone’s job. That’s high profile. That could have gone to a photographer or an illustrator.Can you tell us what goes into being a concept artist and what the response of your profession has been?A concept artist essentially solves visual problems for a production or a client. It starts with a description from the books, and then eventually a description from the script. From there on, rather than give that to VFX or to costume and spend a lot of money to build these things to then find out they’re going in the completely wrong direction, you start with either a drawing or a painting. That’s literally it. That’s the job. So basically, I’m there to problem solve for a director or a production what something could look like. That could be for characters, clothing, creatures, or environments. All of these things require paintings. We’re often some of the first people in pre-production and, more often than not, we usually push the look of a full picture, sometimes even doing something called keyframes, which are actual moments in the film. We’re kind of like the unsung heroes for a lot of moviemaking because the work influences all other departments.So that’s our role, but you can see how that role of providing imagery to solve a visual problem from text to image becomes immediately at risk from tools or models that explicitly do that. For those models to explicitly do that while utilizing the names of people who work in these industries is especially egregious.I’m a board member of the Concept Art Association, which is this wonderful little association, and I brought the concerns to them. Immediately, the Concept Art Association wanted to do a town hall. I think it was like early September 2022. We didn’t know much about it, but I did get to bring in a machine learning expert, in this case Abhishek Gupta from the Montreal AI Ethics Institute, and I just had a conversation with him where I’m like, “Here’s all the information I gathered. Is this bad? Is this okay?” And he was horrified. He didn’t know how bad the training data was for these models, how exploitative they were, and the actions the companies were allowing the users to engage in. That’s been the case with many other machine learning experts that we’ve spoken to. That gave us the motivation to be like, “It’s not us being upset without knowing the details. Now we know the details. Now we know how this works. This is bullshit.”“The act of writing is not typing”An interview with John Lopez about AI and the writers’ strikeDisconnectParis MarxFrom there, my path branched out in many different ways. On one end, I helped the Concept Art Association elevate their efforts. They focus on legislation, so they’ve been hitting DC, they’ve been hitting government officials. The other branch that I took was the litigation side. I became one of the first three plaintiffs on a class action lawsuit. At the time, it was against DeviantArt, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Runway ML was added to it as well. While also still trying to make a living, this thing has become my part-time job.In October, I went to an artist convention called Lightbox, and one of the things that got to me was veterans in this industry basically said what I knew to be true, because I myself had gone through a project like this, that pitch work is dead. Pitch work is basically when a director, writer, producer, or any combination of those get together with an artist and say, “We want to pitch to studios and we need imagery.” All of that has now been given to generative AI. I was part of a pitch work production. I was working closely with the director. It was going awesome. This was during the height of the of the strikes, so it would have been welcome work. But as soon as I gave my quote — gone. They totally disappeared, and their entire pitch deck was already full of generative AI from Midjourney. So many people are saying, “Who cares if I can’t copyright this? Who cares if this is exploitative? Who cares if this is replacing the people I’ve worked with for decades? I’m still going to use it.” It’s pretty bad.Can you talk a bit more about the risk that generative AI poses to artists like yourself and how you’re already seeing it change the work of illustrators?For starters, people just aren’t working as much as they were before. I especially worry for people who are starting in their careers. The bigger companies, the ones who have access to big legal teams, they’re not touching this because they know this is a fucking mess. But that doesn’t mean that their outsourcers are following those guidelines or their marketing teams are following those guidelines. But they’re not touching it. It’s a lot of the middle or sometimes even smaller companies that don’t have access to those legal teams that are implementing generative AI right away and that means a lot of artists have been laid off or have had their duties slashed in half.For example, I’m a contractor. I’ve been part of three different productions that have utilized generative AI at some capacity — and they’re big, so there goes my theory. But the problem is that I charge by the hour and whenever generative AI was utilized, it was utilized to slash those hours. They’ll say, “Here’s what you did and here’s what this model did,” side by side to the director. I can show maybe six or seven images tops, while the thing showed a hundred images. Regardless of whether it was chosen or not, that took time away from me, from the art team, and from all the other contractors to take the time to develop new visuals. That already diminished our roles and our earnings.Then you have, again, a lot of students that are transitioning from student to professional and they rely on a lot of the smaller jobs as well. But those are the ones that are most likely using generative AI right now. Recently I was looking at like Global Game Jam, which is a world-renowned game jam that is usually a great start for artists. They’re being sponsored by Leonardo AI, which is entirely fueled by Stable Diffusion. They’re saying to generate assets on it and that completely cuts the ability for new artists to get their foot in the door.There’s a bit of a creative working ecosystem where there are natural cycles to someone getting their start to then having enough experience to gain a higher level in their career and make a living out of it. All of those doors are now starting to close because of generative AI. With the works that generative AI makes, the metric isn’t whether something is artistic or has quality, because if that were the case then people would win. The metric is the market itself. When you have a team trying to slash costs who say, “I could hire this artist full time, that’s a whole year’s worth of salary, or I could just pay a little subscription fee,” they’re going to go for the model.Veterans who should be respected for the incredible contributions to our industry have been approached by high-profile production houses being like, “Can you paint over this Midjourney image? Oh, and we’ll pay you half.” That’s happening right now. At least in film, there’s at least some good pay a person can make a living off, and that’s now being lowered. And it’s going so much faster than any of us ever imagined. There’s a lot of angst and depression, even among actual professionals who are like, “I’ve given my whole life to this. It’s a lifetime of work.” And then for some company to say, “That lifetime of work, that dedication, it’s now mine. We’re gonna compete against you, we’re gonna make insane amounts of money off your work, and you don’t have to have a say.” That’s fucking a lot of people up. It’s a really tough time.I can only imagine. You talked about how you’ve been involved in a lot of organizing around generative AI and even litigation against some of these companies. Can you tell me a bit more about the work you’ve been doing and the impacts that you’ve seen from it?I’ve come to realize my coping mechanism is action. I’ve been so lucky that so many wonderful people have also been working extremely hard and have acted. There’s been a sense of solidarity and organizing from artists in a way that I haven’t seen in a really long time. Artists in particular, we’re uniquely at risk in ways that other creative endeavors aren’t. A lot of us are contractors, we don’t have a clear union. For concept artists in particular, our unions are split in two. We’re between the Art Directors Guild and the Costume Designers Guild. Oftentimes we’re in the same union as our bosses, and some of those bosses really want to use generative AI. The unions are trying to work that out, and I hope they do. But the majority of us are contract and we don’t have the same protections that the recording industry might have or SAG-AFTRA might have or the Writers Guild might have that.Because of that lack of protections, we’ve banded together and advocated for ourselves in a way that has been very inspiring and very hopeful. Last year, the Concept Art Association said, “We need to be in DC because we have to have a voice.” And we’re like, “Let’s just do the same thing that other companies do. Let’s hire a lobbyist. Let’s hire someone who has the connections.” So we did a fundraiser and 5,000 people from all around the globe gave them enough to be able to fund a full year of lobbying; a full year of action, a full year of events. Because of that I got to go to the Senate and I got to testify. I got to be in the same room as the Stable Diffusions and the Adobes. I was definitely the poorest person there because next to me was the top lawyer from the recording industry, the policy person for Stability, and the top lawyer for Adobe. But it was impactful. I got to tell the senators exactly what had happened and exactly how we were affected. Between that and a lot of different conversations behind the scenes with congressmen, staffers, regulatory agencies, and so on, that little organization has made a huge splash.Generative AI closes off a better futureUrsula Le Guin said we must be able to imagine freedom. AI traps us in the past.DisconnectParis MarxThere’s a continued push to form alliances between artists groups and artists coalitions. There’s the Human Artistry Campaign, a coalition of 140 different artist groups. Trying to tell everybody it’s not enough to just get your creative sector safe, we’re in this together, that’s been interesting. I’m tired, I really just want to paint all day. But again, it’s existential. I’m very happy to know I’m not the only one. I hope that’s enough to make some solid changes.In terms of those changes, what do you think is going to be necessary to rein in these companies and these tools? Do you think regulation is necessary? Do you think litigation will deliver that? And is there anything the public can do to help move that cause forward?It’s not a “one solution,” it’s an “all solutions” type of situation. We need legislation. We need regulation. We need litigation. We need education. We need public relations. We need the public to be like, “No, I will not support your product if it contains generative AI because it’s an exploitative technology that is meant to replace the same people who’ve worked on the things that we’ve loved for so long.” Eventually it’s coming for anyone whose work will be digitized.In terms of litigation, we need the courts to look at this and say, “This kind of exploitative practice of indiscriminately grabbing whatever data we can see on the internet and say, ‘Oh, it’s publicly available, so I could profit from it’ — even if that data is copyrighted, biometric, private. That’s not okay.” Companies should not be able to get away with this, and I feel like the court should be unanimous in that decision and say, “It’s not okay to train models off the work of people who do not want to be part of it and who were never even asked.” We also need relief and payment from all these companies who made all this profit on the back of artists and the back of people that didn’t even want to be a part of it. Those companies need to pay these people.In terms of regulation, we need so much action and we need it yesterday. There’s a specific and wonderful term that sounds metal as hell called “algorithmic disgorgement.” It’s an act the FTC has engaged in before — basically, the destruction of any algorithm, dataset, or model that contains ill-gotten or illicit data. These definitely fit that bill without a shadow of a doubt. Specifically, we recently found out that even child abuse material has been found in these datasets. So we need algorithmic disgorgement. We need destruction of these models right off the bat because once a model is trained on data, it can’t forget.After that, we need regulations or rules to stipulate that models should only be trained on the public domain, as in like from government archives, stuff that’s available for everybody to use, with any expansion upon that to be done with the explicit consent, credit, and compensation of whomever owns that data. I’m not talking about like, “in order for you to get a job, you need to say you will give us your data,” because that’s gross. And I’m not talking about, “we'll give you 0.005 cents if you give us your image,” because that’s also equally gross. I’m talking about serious wages here.We also need immediate transparency of all models, because we can’t have an OpenAI situation where they’ve gotten away with not telling the public what their models are trained on. There’s definitely copyrighted data in there. I don’t want to see a situation where just because the company holds copyright in the form of work for hire, where we give away all of our rights to a company in order to work with that company and they can do what they want with it. For example, I worked with Disney for eight years or so. Disney owns so much of my work and there’s nothing stopping them from generating a Karla Ortiz model internally and never having to hire me again. That’s a possibility that can happen and we need worker protections against that.So we need a lot. In terms of the public again, don’t engage with theft. If you see something that has generative AI, raise a ruckus, complaint about it. It does work. A lot of companies have steered away from it because of the backlash they’ve seen. It sounds silly, but it is true: vote with your money on this stuff. Don’t reward a product that used generative AI. Call them out.I think all those points are so important. And I love the focus on algorithmic discouragement instead of just regulating it. Any final thoughts?One more thing: Send opt-out procedures into a deep, dark hole. Fuck that. That’s a push a lot of the AI companies have been doing for quite a while because it’s easy. It shifts the burden of responsibility onto people in a really irresponsible, but also unfeasible way.There are hundreds of visual models. Does that mean I have to opt out of every single one of those models? What about every time they update? The method of opting out is incredibly inefficient. For example, OpenAI not too long ago was like, “Yeah, we’ll opt you out, but you have to show how we’ve used your work.” How do you do that when they’re not even open and transparent about the work that they’ve used? You can’t. That also places undue burden on people who might not know the language, who might not know the technology, who might not even be aware that this is happening because they’re just not online. It’s completely reprehensible.They know that if they can push opt out only, they can still have access to all that ill-gotten data. And that’s the data that powers them. That’s the secret sauce. But if you do algorithmic disgorgement and implement opt in, then they have a problem because hardly anybody wants to give away their data. Why? Because those models are going to compete with them in the future. Why would you do that? Opt in only.

Job seekers with AI skills clearly stand out
There is little doubt that AI is changing the tech industry and the nature of jobs. Consequently, “job seekers would do well to consider the changing industry’s new demands, which include changes stemming from the widespread adoption of generative AI,’’ the first-ever Indeed top 10 highest-paying tech skills report noted. “While Gen AI will touch virtually every industry, tech will be impacted the most.”
Despite the layoffs in tech that have dominated headlines, “this data is demonstrating an inverse trend within the industry — proving the demand for certain tech skills is still high, and in some cases, skyrocketing,” Donal McMahon, vice president of data science at Indeed, told TechRepublic via email. “With this in mind, it is interesting that we see AI-specific skills dominating half the list. This underscores that in a tight market, job seekers with AI skills can stand out, and potentially earn almost 50% more than their counterparts.”
AI skills are sought globally
With the rise of AI globally, Indeed is seeing as much demand for similar skills across the world as in the U.S., McMahon said. Companies around the world “are all searching for employees who know AI and can adapt to new and emerging technologies,” he noted.

Top companies and industries hiring these tech skills
The top companies hiring for these tech skills include Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, TikTok, Deloitte and Ericsson Worldwide, according to Indeed’s report.
In terms of vertical-specific industries, in 2024, every company is working to become a tech company, increasing the demand for these skills, McMahon said. “Some of the top industries we are seeing coveting these skills are the aerospace and defense industry, insurance companies, financial services, manufacturing, and semiconductors.”
Tips for hiring employers: Act fast, focus on skills and upskilling
As more businesses move their operations online and every industry takes on new forms of digital transformation, workers with specialized technical skills are needed everywhere — not just in the tech industry, McMahon stressed.
“Indeed data has shown that 77% of job seekers are frustrated with the job search process and feel like the process is too slow,” he said. “Employers also agree that it takes too long to find quality talent and hire — but they do have some control over this timeline. When job seekers and skills are in demand, we encourage employers to act fast and utilize matching technology during the hiring process.”
Not only will this alleviate pain points for the job seeker, McMahon added, but the company can make a strategic hire faster.
Further, employers can find candidates faster if they focus on a skills-first hiring approach, he said. “Rather than looking at proxies like a college degree, a certain number of years of experience, or previous companies, they can hire based on the skills they need. This will open the talent pipeline to candidates who are often overlooked but are qualified to do the work.”

Employers can also consider implementing an upskilling program to provide opportunities for current employees to learn these skills, McMahon said. He also suggested that new workers continue developing expertise in these skills.
While Indeed’s Workforce Insights Report finds that 43% of job seekers consider lack of certifications as a top barrier to finding the job they want, a majority of the skills on this list can be learned through online courses, the report said.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

Artificial intelligence is changing the way marketing and PR agencies are run.Research shows that 68% of public relations professionals use AI, 68% of SEO experts are exploring it, and 61.4% of marketers are using it. It's easy to see why.AI usage in social media is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.04% through 2028, and large language models increasingly write online search results. We even have AI influencers taking over, with a reported 34% of American consumers putting their trust in them, and the highest-paid virtual influencer, Lu Do Magalu, is earning an estimated $16.2 million per year with sponsorships from brands like Adidas and Mac Cosmetics.



It's clear that AI is here to stay, and it's making a huge difference for companies in various ways, especially when creating online content. This is rapidly changing the tasks that marketers, SEOs, and PR professionals perform while augmenting their skill sets with powerful (albeit somewhat inaccurate) tools.If you want to build a successful agency, the traditional advice is to hyper-focus on one niche and be the best at it to generate revenue and grow your team. Using AI, however, a single person can do the work of an entire team, and many solopreneurs are using it to diversify their offerings as the technology creates dramatic shifts in legacy agency models.

These transcriptions make it easier to assign work to freelancers and ensure they have the client's exact wording and specifications.AI image-generation tools like Midjourney and Adobe Firefly can reduce operational costs while ensuring you have high-quality images for client social media, marketing, ads, and other channels. Runway ML takes visuals a step further by transforming text and images into video, and ElevenLabs provides AI-generated voiceovers.Finally, large language models like Perplexity make online research much faster and more efficient. Of course, there are also risks inherent in using AI in your agency.

This is because generative AI sparked a lot of controversy over the past two years, and there are various ethical considerations, including amplified biases and potential copyright infringement.Last month, a study from Gary Marcus and Reid Southen showed Midjourney v6 reproduces almost exact movie stills, and both Wacom and Magic: The Gathering drew heat online for using generative AI images in their advertising, and the latter fired their agency after the snafu.Related: What Will It Take to Build a Truly Ethical AI? These 3 Tips Can Help.


Making matters worse, AI image detectors like Hive and text detectors like Originality AI produce false positives, blurring the lines between human and machine-generated content. Even if you pledge not to use AI, the freelancers you hire may still introduce it into your workflow, causing unexpected problems.If you do use AI, there are four steps you can take to ensure it's being used safely and correctly.1. Don't publish AI outputs as your ownRaw AI outputs should never be used as the final published product, whether images or text. They aren't legally protectable, per the US Copyright Office's AI guidelines, and claiming AI outputs are your own is plagiarism. Since it's impossible to know what content most models were trained on, it's best to use AI either in the ideation phase or as one small piece of a finished product.2. Be transparent about using AIIf you use AI in any way, be upfront with clients and the public. Having AI usage laid out plainly in your contracts and any content using it is best. Being caught using AI without disclosing it can lead to drastic negative consequences, like this indie book cover contest that was canceled after the artist lied about the use of AI against the rules of the contest. If a publication doesn't want AI pitches or editorials, be sure to honor those requests.


3. Be careful with proprietary dataUnderstand that any information input into an AI may potentially be trained on or viewed by an outside party. Several instances were reported in the past year of ChatGPT leaking sensitive information to other users, and it's important to be mindful of what information is entered into any AI tools. Don't input anything into a prompt that you don't want anyone to see.4. Keep a human in the loopIt's easy to get lazy and submit mistakes you normally wouldn't when using AI. Channel Nine in Australia recently learned this the hard way when an image of politician Georgie Purcell was edited with Adobe Firefly and drew accusations of sexism. This technology isn't a replacement for humans–it's an augmentation. Be sure to thoroughly check any AI work before turning it in and making mistakes that ruin the reputation of your agency or client.Related: 3 Smart Things to Know Before Getting Started with AIGetting started with AI in your agencyAI can be a game-changer, and staying on top of technological advancements is important. It can give you a competitive edge over larger firms with a longer staff list. However, it requires purpose and care to implement correctly, and the consequences for misusing AI can be dire.


More than anything, honesty is the best policy. Companies are continuing to implement internal rules about the use of AI, and a subsection of consumers are always looking to catch a company using it without disclosure. As long as you properly label where AI is used in your workflow, the benefits and the efficiency that come out of it can be worth it.

Like most people, there were things on Heather Holding's to-do list she knew she'd never get to.That led Holding, who oversees risk management at fintech company Best Egg, to wonder whether an artificial intelligence tool could draft policy documents she and her colleagues couldn't find time to pull together.""One day, I was like, 'You know what, let's just try to put these through,'"" Holding told Business Insider. So, she wrote prompts for an AI tool built into a corporate reporting platform made by Workiva. The chatbot drafted documents that needed some tweaking, but Holding and her team got through the backlog of 10 policies within a day.

Holding's experience points to the sometimes subtle ways AI is changing work. Many workers have expressed fears that the technology will show up at the office like a young gun coming for their job. Yet, in some cases, AI might be more like the temp that gets brought in when work piles up — or to do the jobs nobody wanted to do.An AI bot could act as your intern.One reason chatbots like the one Holding used might not take over tons of jobs right away is there are limits to what AI can do — for now. Generative AI tools often still require oversight, much like an inexperienced worker might. Holding has to review and sometimes adjust what a bot kicks out, but even with that, she saves time.

To write a policy doc from scratch, she said, might take from eight to 30 hours, depending on the type and how much research it requires. As long as she does the upfront legwork to draft the proper instructions for the bot, the results are compelling, she said.""You can literally have the sections mirror exactly what you want in an actual policy,"" Holding said.

Tackling those jobs that people otherwise might not even start is an important part of how AI will transform the workplace, according to Ron Williams, CEO and founder of Kindo, which helps companies adopt and use AI tools securely. In part, it's because the technology lets companies do things they couldn't do easily or cost-effectively before.""There are jobs not getting done today that aren't threatened at all — that AI is just going to be able to start doing,"" he told BI.Williams expects some of the biggest gains from AI won't center on what companies and workers are doing now. Instead, he sees major wins coming from what workers aren't doing but that AI could. Accomplishing those things could change the trajectory of a business, Williams said.""As the AIs get better, that's just going to accelerate and expand the reach of what they're going to be able to impact,"" he said.

Williams pointed to work such as content moderation or aggregating reviews in e-commerce. He said AI can sift through thousands of posts and summarize customers' sentiments about a product. Amazon is trying this. Hot takes from AI could boost sales, Williams said, if shoppers have a better understanding of what people think about a product. It's the kind of service that wasn't feasible without technology.""Before, that just wasn't economical to have a human go through and try to aggregate that stuff,"" he said.Filling in when help is scarceOne reason jobs sometimes aren't getting done is because there aren't always enough workers. So, some leaders are looking to AI for help. In a Gigged.AI survey of about 250 UK execs in mid-2023, about half said GenAI could address skills shortages in tech.There are also efforts to train workers in fields like accounting that are facing worker shortages about the benefits of AI. A startup called Docyt recently introduced a professional development platform to help teach accountants how to use AI to complete their jobs more efficiently and accurately.

Jérôme Pesenti, founder and CEO of an AI-powered learning app called Sizzle and former VP of AI at Facebook parent Meta, told BI that sometimes AI takes on parts of jobs that might be unexpected. He pointed to research labs where machines excel at repeating experiments with high precision. But tasks that might seem menial — like cleaning machines and moving samples — are actually often harder to leave to robots.""We are literally decades away from automating this,"" he said. ""Yet some jobs that we thought were, you know, maybe like higher level, which was like doing precise experiments — it actually turns out machines are better at doing.""Humans still come out ahead in areas like behaving in a complex environment and dealing with multiple systems, Pesenti said. But that doesn't mean people won't turn to AI as a hired hand in the workplace, he noted. ""I'm still betting on the human, but I do think the human needs to leverage the machine to be a lot better,"" Pesenti said.At Best Egg, Holding hopes AI might one day take on even more work, like scooping up thousands of rows of data and allowing auditors to ask a chatbot questions about that information or hunt down anomalies. Right now, she might spend up to 40 hours conducting transactional tests. If AI could be deployed to help with this work, the time the task takes might get cut in half, Holding said.

Security and privacy are the essential requirements of developing and deploying AI systems, which is considered the main problem. The risk of data security and privacy violation with the proliferation of AI is growing, thus requiring stronger regulations and frameworks to protect sensitive information. 
A critical question is how AI should be used ethically. Addressing these problems requires cooperation between ethicists, the technical community, the policymakers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the AI systems are fair and equitable.
Also, AI increases the concerns over the loss of jobs and a persistent issue of economic inequality, which calls for steps to reskill the workforce and address social and economic disparities.
AI's rapid progress raises questions about its effects on autonomous weapons and cybersecurity, so there is a call for international collaboration and ethical standards.
Let's understand these AI challenges and discuss solutions to overcome them.
AI Challenges
As of 2024, the AI field will face more problems, such as privacy and personal data protection, ethics of use, which comprises algorithmic bias and transparency, and the socio-economic impact of job displacement. Solving challenges in Artificial Intelligence calls for interdisciplinary cooperation and defining regulatory policies. 
The growth of AI also causes concerns over how AI will affect cybersecurity, which requires international collaboration and ethical controls. Moreover, promoting AI benefits to society and avoiding risks require a general approach, which should consider technological progress and ethical aspects.

Ethics in AI involves discussions about various issues, including privacy violations, perpetuation of bias, and social impact. The accountability, transparency, and fairness in decisions made by AI systems are now the challenge. Some issues that include algorithmic bias, which leads to the discrimination of particular groups, threaten the strengthening of inequalities. 
Additionally, a more focused approach must be used when implementing AI in sensitive areas such as health and criminal justice that warrants increased consideration of ethical principles needed to attain fair outcomes. Finding a balance between technological development and moral issues is essential to using AI for societal benefit while avoiding risks and encouraging ethical innovation.
Bias in AI
Bias in artificial intelligence can be defined as machine learning algorithms' potential to duplicate and magnify pre existing biases in the training dataset. This may lead to unjust and unethical outcomes, significantly affecting marginalized communities. 
For example, biased hiring procedures, loan approvals, and unequal criminal sentencing. AI bias mitigation needs a deliberate approach to data selection, preprocessing techniques, and algorithm design to minimize bias and promote fairness. 
Also, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of AI systems help identify and rectify bias, thus promoting fairness in the outcomes of all individuals through AI-based decision-making processes.
AI Integration
AI integration means that artificial intelligence systems are incorporated into production and services to improve automation and efficiency. This implies identifying relevant application scenarios, fine-tuning AI models to particular scenarios, and ensuring compatibility with existing systems. The integration process demands AI experts and domain specialists to work together to fine-tune their solutions to satisfy organizational requirements. 
Challenges include interoperability of data, the need for personnel training, and the associated change management. Coping with these challenges requires strategic planning, stakeholder participation, and iterative implementations to optimize AI and minimize disruptions. As such, AI integration can play a crucial role in bringing about transformative change and delivering a competitive edge across various industries and sectors.
Computing Power
The degree of computing power is crucial in developing and deploying AI models, particularly those involving computations and massive datasets. The need for high-performance computing devices, such as GPUs, TPUs, and others, increases with growing AI algorithm complexity. Challenges include cost, energy consumption, and scalability. In the early development stages, hardware architectural innovations like neuromorphic computing and quantum computing also offer potential solutions.
Moreover, distributed computation, as well as cloud services, can be used to overcome computational limitations. Managing computational requirements with a balance of efficiency and sustainability is vital for the progress of AI potentials while maintaining resource limitations.
Data Privacy and Security
The main issues surrounding AI are data security and privacy since AI systems require large amounts of data for operation and training. To avoid leaks, breaches, and misuse, one must ensure data security, availability, and integrity. To comply with data protection rules such as the CCPA and GDPR, an organization must have access restrictions, encryption, and auditing capabilities. 
Furthermore, using privacy-preserving approaches such as differential privacy and federated learning is essential to minimize privacy risks and maintain data utility. Trust-building among users through transparent data processes and ethical data handling protocols is crucial for user confidence in AI systems and responsible data management.
Legal issues with AI
The legal concerns around AI cover a large spectrum: liability, intellectual property rights, and regulatory compliance. The accountability question arises when an AI-based decision maker is involved, especially in a faulty system or an accident resulting from an autonomous AI system. Legal issues related to copyright emerge due to the ownership of the content created by AI and its algorithms. 
Furthermore, the regulatory systems, usually the last to adapt to technological changes, must be noticed to avoid legal liabilities and risks. Tackling these issues requires a combination of legal specialists, policymakers, and technology experts working together to create clear rules and policies that balance innovation with accountability and protect stakeholders' rights.
AI Transparency
AI transparency refers to the algorithms and decision-making processes. Transparency is essential for building credibility, trust, accountability, and user confidence in AI systems. Transparency is defined as an element of how AI models work and what AI models do, including inputs, outputs, and the underlying logic. Techniques like explainable AI (XAI) are directed at providing understandable insights into complex AI systems, making them easily comprehensible. 
Further, clear documentation of the data sources, model training methodologies, and performance metrics would also promote transparency. Transparency can be achieved through promoting it, which enables organizations to show ethical AI practices, deal with bias, and allow users to make the right decisions based on AI-derived results.
Limited Knowledge of AI
Limited knowledge among the general population is one of the critical issues impacting informed decision-making, adoption, and regulation. Misconceptions and misinterpretations of AI's abilities and constraints multiply, holding back its responsible use and promotion. Effective measures should be developed and implemented for the education and public awareness programs to ensure public comprehension of AI concepts, use cases, and potential effects. 
Furthermore, enabling accessible resources and training opportunities would allow users to use AI technology more effectively. Bridging the knowledge gap through interdisciplinary collaboration, community involvement, and outreach is how society will get AI that can be productive without at the same time dealing with the ethical, societal, and economic issues of AI.

Trust in AI systems is a significant condition for their wide use and acceptance by people. The foundation for trust is transparency, reliability, and accountability. Organizations need to guarantee transparency by exposing how AI systems operate and their choices. Reliability is another way to say that you are expected to deliver consistent performance, including producing correct results. Accountability constitutes taking responsibility for outcomes resulting from AI, as well as fixing errors or biases. 
Furthermore, building trust involves reaching out to stakeholders, taking feedback, and putting ethics into the front line. By emphasizing transparency, reliability, and accountability, organizations will create trust in AI systems, allowing users to use AI technologies and their potential benefits.
Lack of AI explainability
The lack of AI explainability refers to the difficulty in understanding and determining how AI systems reach their conclusions or recommendations. This lack of transparency makes people distrustful and accountable regarding essential applications such as healthcare and finance. 
The AI methods are developed to address this issue by providing insights about the logic of AI algorithms. Analyzing the importance of features and visualizing models provide users with insight into AI outputs. Though the explainability issue remains a challenging problem, that solution does not affect the model performance is a difficult task. 
Discrimination
An example of discrimination in AI is when the system behaves in a biased and unfair way toward individuals or groups due to their race, gender, or other factors. While AI systems can unknowingly perpetuate or aggravate social biases in their training sets, this ultimately results in discriminatory outcomes. For example, the biased algorithms used in hiring and lending processes amplify existing inequalities. 
Addressing discrimination calls for countering bias in data collection and algorithmic choice. Modern approaches like fairness-aware machine learning are focused on promoting equity by identifying and addressing bias while the model is being developed. In addition, through fair and transparent AI systems, discrimination will be recognized and rectified, leading to fair and unbiased treatment of all people.
High Expectations
High expectations accompanied by AI's powers often lead to unrealistic expectations for AI, followed by disappointment. While AI offers immense potential, its limitations and complexities frequently overshadow exaggerated promises. 
Furthermore, educational and awareness programs give stakeholders a clear picture of how AI is used and its limitations. By setting achievable goals and a balanced knowledge of AI's pros and cons, organizations avoid disappointment and focus on taking advantage of AI.
Implementation strategies
Implementation strategies for AI include systematic approaches to bring AI technologies into the existing systems and workflows to use them effectively. Some key aspects include selecting the proper use cases that align with the business objectives, evaluating whether the data is sufficient and of good quality, and choosing suitable AI algorithms or models. 
Moreover, creating an innovation advisory board would drive the experimentation and learning necessary for AI solutions' iterative development and refinement. Having domain experts and AI specialists on the same team is essential when implementing a project so that the solution covers the needs of users and the organization. 
Data Confidentiality
Confidentiality of data is the focus of AI that ensures that private information remains under restricted access and does not leak to unauthorized parties. Organizations must implement strict security mechanisms (i.e., encryption, access control, and secure protocols for storage) to keep data secure from creation to disposal. 
Complying with data privacy laws, e.g., GDPR and HIPAA, is crucial to guaranteeing confidential data's legal and ethical use. Privacy protection is essential in creating trust among users and stakeholders and is a critical factor in developing AI systems perceived as responsible and reliable.
Software Malfunction
Malfunction in AI software presents excellent risks, including erroneous outputs, system failures, or cyber-attacks. Testing and quality assurance practices should be strict at each stage of the software lifecycle to eliminate such risks. 
Additionally, implementing robust error-handling mechanisms and contingency plans helps keep malfunctions' impacts small when they occur. Regular software updates and maintenance are also significant in preventing and solving potential defects that might cause malfunctioning. 
In addition, creating a culture that promotes transparency and accountability principles helps detect and resolve software problems faster, contributing to the reliability and safety of AI systems.
How do you overcome the challenges in artificial intelligence?
To tackle the challenges in AI, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential. This is achieved by merging technology, ethics, law, and sociology experts to develop all-encompassing solutions. Adopting explainable and transparent AI practices enhances accountability and trust. 
Besides, education and awareness programs also contribute to offering knowledge in the field and ensuring making informed decisions. Investing diversity and inclusiveness in AI team development minimizes biases and yields equality in results. Furthermore, a robust regulatory system is mandatory to adhere to legal and ethical codes. 
AI's challenges can be addressed safely through collaboration, transparency, education, and regulation.

Grammarly and Harris Poll Find Using Generative AI for Communication Could Save Up to $1.6 Trillion Annually in U.S. Productivity




Third annual “State of Business Communication” report illuminates how businesses can tangibly harness AI to enhance communication, efficiency, and performance






February 21, 2024 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Grammarly, the company helping over 30 million people and 70,000 teams work smarter and faster wherever they write, today announced its third annual “State of Business Communication: AI’s Potential to Turn Overload Into Impact” report, uncovering the potential of generative AI to save a staggering $1.6 trillion in U.S. communication productivity each year. In partnership with The Harris Poll, the study exposes how generative AI brings both new solutions and challenges to the problem of poor communication that plagues U.S. businesses.


“Companies not using generative AI for communication are already way behind, and those that are, are far from realizing its full potential”Post this

New AI gaps and risks pose serious threats to businesses, jeopardizing their ability to reap the benefits of the technology. The data shows that leaders and workers have been communicating more (78%) and in more channels (73%) this past year, and it’s causing more stress than ever, particularly among workers (+16% over last year). At the same time, both groups are seeing early benefits from using generative AI, including saving a day a workweek—which adds up to around $16,455 per worker per year. But even though it’s helping, most workers still wish their companies were more open to implementing AI (58%) and don’t know how to use AI well (52%).


“Companies not using generative AI for communication are already way behind, and those that are, are far from realizing its full potential,” said Matt Rosenberg, Grammarly Chief Revenue Officer and Head of Grammarly Business. “The data is clear that generative AI offers monumental benefits, but can also add more distractions at a time when teams need ways to communicate better, not add more to the mix. Our report should be a wake-up call for businesses to stop with the piecemeal approaches, get aligned with their employees, and hone a clear strategy that empowers their entire workforce with AI if they are to realize its impact.”


The study of U.S. business leaders and knowledge workers underscores the changing nature of workplace communication and the ways that generative AI is impacting how we work and interact. Additional findings include:



Workers spend nearly half of their workweek on writing tasks (19.08 hours), and time spent reviewing and editing especially increased (+11% year-over-year)



92% of leaders and 84% of workers who use generative AI do so at least weekly, and it’s already delivering business results for leaders like increased efficiency (52%), higher productivity (50%), saved costs (38%), and higher customer engagement (37%)



Workers using generative AI say that it makes them better at their job (77%) and has transformed how they communicate at work (71%), and that they ultimately believe AI will enhance their work, not replace them (66%)



Leaders, your communication problem is worse than you think: There’s a 24% gap between workers’ (63%) and leaders’ (87%) perceived effectiveness of their organization’s overall communication. Fewer workers this year also say their senior leadership communicates effectively (64%, down 8%)—compared to 90% of leaders who say the same. With leaders reporting that communication directly drives business outcomes like productivity (64%), customer satisfaction (51%), and brand reputation (45%), it’s time for a reality check to tackle the problem.


Focus on better, not more, to address communications overload: Most leaders and workers find constant work notifications challenging (56%), struggle to manage all of the communications they receive (54%), and spend too much time trying to get messages across in the right way (55%). Despite the AI deluge, more workers this year also wish they had better tools to help them be more effective (66%, vs. 58% last year). Facing an overwhelming surge of communication in more places, teams need ways to improve the quality of communication, not simply pile on more.


Chart a clear course to close AI gaps and move past the hype: Despite extensive generative AI use and promising early benefits, poor communication remains a pervasive problem, and leaders and workers are at odds with each other in their use of AI. 89% of leaders report using generative AI for professional purposes, but only 53% of workers say the same—a symptom of the lack of a cohesive AI approach. While 82% of leaders are planning investments in AI, those investments will go to waste if not paired with a company-wide AI strategy that focuses on literacy, education, and training.

The top 10 highest paid skills in tech can help workers earn up to 47% more — and the top skill among them is generative artificial intelligence (genAI), according to a new report from employment website Indeed and other sources.
For example, the top three skills — genAI, system-on-a-chip (SoC) and deep learning — each command an annual salary north of $170,000.
This year, the median salary for IT skilled workers is $101,323, according to IT business consultancy Janco Associates.











 
 
 
Half of the highest-paid skills in tech are AI-specific, which suggests that job seekers with AI talent can stand out in a competitive job market and earn more than their counterparts, according to Indeed.

“One thing everyone can agree on is that the tech industry is changing, and likely irrevocably,” according to Indeed’s report, which is aimed at helping tech workers be more competitive and/or find a new job in 2024.
Job seekers need to keep up with the tech industry’s new demands, which include changes stemming from the widespread adoption of genAI tools over the past year. While genAI will touch virtually every industry, tech will be affected the most.











 
 
 
“In today’s workplace, tech workers (and really, most workers) need to be adaptable as AI continues to impact the world of work,” said Donal McMahon, Indeed’s vice president of data science. “Generative AI in particular is where we are seeing an uptick in shared interest from both job seekers and employers.”
Enterprises spent about $19.4 billion worldwide on genAI technologies in 2023; that amount is expected to double this year, according to research by IDC.
“The way I often describe this is AI is sucking the air out of almost all non-AI investments in the whole tech world,” said Harvard Business School Professor David Yoffie.











 
 
 
Layoffs don’t lie
The past year has seen a trend of “rolling layoffs” that, despite better economic numbers, have continued to plague IT jobs. Business Insider likened the leveling out of IT layoffs to those you might see in any other big industry settling into a more sustainable rhythm.
In January, US-based employers announced 82,307 cuts, compared to 34,817 cuts the month before; it represented a 136% increase in layoffs over December and a 10-month high, according to a report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The surge in job cuts was led by the tech industry.
While that January number is down 20% from the 102,943 cuts announced in January 2023, they’re a sign the tech job market is shifting, the outplacement firm said.











 
 
 
 Janco Associates
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in a report issued in January, noted that shift, saying the world is on “the brink of a technological revolution that could jump start productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world.” Yet AI and genAI could also “replace jobs and deepen inequality.”
The IMF found the results of an analysis of AI and jobs to be “striking,” and said nearly 40% of global employment will be exposed to the effects of genAI. That figure could be even higher — 60% — in advanced economies such as the US and Europe.
Indeed’s McMahon said data backs that up: “Searches for generative AI jobs on Indeed have surged nearly 4,000% in the last year, indicating a pronounced industry shift. Job postings for generative AI roles have seen a remarkable 306% increase since September 2022, underlining the sustained demand for these specialized skills.”











 
 
 
David Foote, chief analyst at IT research firm Foote Partners, said fast-evolving technologies like AI “are forcing organizations to move more quickly in filling specific gaps in their job architectures.”
Foote Partners publishes a quarterly analysis of supply and demand for 1,333 IT skills and certifications at 4,314 U.S. and Canadian organizations. During the last three months of 2023, many non-certified IT skills were among those earning the highest pay premiums, including AI, big data analytics, and identity access management (including machine learning)
According to Foote Partners, the top jobs within the genAI family are:











 
 
 

Lead Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Principal Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Senior Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Lead AI Data Analyst
Senior AI Data Analyst
AI Data Analyst
AI Product Manager
AI Prompt Engineer
Human AI Collaboration Manager

For example, AI engineering is central to product innovation because it leverages AI, machine learning (ML) and software engineering skills to transform ideas into reality and develop a wide range of products and technology for commercial use.
“This group takes the lead in bringing projects to production, but also [has] the opportunity to come up with new ideas,” Foote’s report said.
The rise of skills like prompt engineering
Within the genAI field, both fundamental software development and prompt engineering skills are highly sought after by organizations for creating foundation AI models, tuning them for domain-specific applications, and building consumer-facing products, according to McMahon.











 
 
 
“Prompt engineering is a more accessible job skill for those without a software engineering background. After training up prompt engineering, individuals are able to quickly leverage large language models in a variety of industry tasks such as content creation and text summarization,” he said.
Other top worker capabilities related to AI being sought by employers include data science, machine learning engineering, and software engineering.
Indeed said it’s seeing “a high repetition of the skills identified on its list. Specifically, we see data scientists and machine learning engineers focusing on: generative AI, Deep Learning, Torch, PyTorch and computer vision,” McMahon said. “The capabilities for software engineers are slightly different, with companies preferring skills such as SoC, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Mesos, Rust and Elixir.”











 
 
 
Top 5 highest paid skills, according to Indeed:

The top jobs seeking those skills include data scientist, machine learning engineer and software engineer, and the top companies hiring for those skills include Deloitte, Ericsson-Worldwide, and Meta.
While many of the “skills” identified by Indeed simply look like the technologies themselves, such as “SoC” or system-on-chip, the “skill” is being listed across various job descriptions and in top employers hiring.











 
 
 
The specific technical skills related to those technologies include: Analog IP integration, PCIe High-Speed Interfaces, SoC-Level Clocking, Reset, and Power Management, FPGA Design Experience, and RTL Synthesis and DFT/MBIST Insertion.
Where to learn new skills
Indeed’s recent Workforce Insights Report found that 43% of 5,000 job seekers feel a lack of certifications is one the top barriers to finding jobs they want, but a majority of those certifications can be accessed through online learning. The report also found that 71% of workers are open to new opportunities and 60% are prepared to apply.
There are a variety of effective methods for learning new tech skills, including not only enrolling in online courses, but attending boot camps and participating in other training programs tailored to AI development and other top skills.











 
 
 
The top online IT certification providers are: CareerFoundry, Coursera, Udemy, EdX, Codefinity, Codeacademy, Udacity, and FutureLearn. Many universities and colleges offer online certification courses. Beyond that, there a variety of free or cheap online courses, including:

AWS AI and Machine Learning Path
Google’s Cloud Skills Boost
Microsoft Virtual Academy
Professor Messer
LinkedIn’s Career Essentials In Generative AI training course
AI’s “AI for Everyone” short course

“These resources provide practical experience and can accommodate busy schedules. Continuous learning and staying abreast of the latest advancements in AI are essential for success in this rapidly evolving field,” McMahon said. “For many roles today, it’s important to invest in building tech literacy. Everyone in tech can benefit in learning about the basics of AI, as nearly every tech role now has to be an AI role.”

The federal workforce of the future will be tasked with leveraging artificial intelligence — including in hiring — and using accurate, timely data to inform policy decisions, the Office of Personnel Management said in an announcement Friday. 
In releasing its workforce playbook for federal agencies, OPM said agencies should implement strategies that aim to enable a workforce that is “inclusive, agile and engaged, with the right skills to enable mission delivery,” according to a press release. OPM listed 12 priorities, including AI integration and data-driven decisions. 
“OPM is 100% invested in strengthening the federal workforce,” OPM Director Kiran Ahuja said in the release. “This playbook is just another example of OPM’s ongoing efforts to equip federal agencies with the tools and resources to hire the right talent and strategically plan for their future workforce. The federal government works best when we leverage the full talent of our nation and workforce — this playbook is full of useful strategies to do just that.”
In the playbook, OPM calls on federal agencies to use “appropriate” AI capabilities in the HR process, understand how the technology will impact the workforce and safeguard employees accordingly, upskill teams with “appropriate competencies” and train existing talent on recent AI use cases and their applicability to current projects. The office pointed to a report from the Government Accountability Office that shared approximately 1,200 existing and planned use cases along with specific “challenges or opportunities that AI may help solve.”

The Biden administration is also asking agencies to explore the use of generative AI to see how the technology could “improve efficiencies” as needed. 
Additionally, the office is asking agencies to take steps toward implementing data into decision-making by using available data products and platforms, ensuring that data standards are implemented, identifying data literacy gaps and developing strategies to guarantee employees have the necessary data skills. OPM shared that the Department of Defense uses an advanced analytics platform that “supplies leaders with decision support analytics, visualizations, data tools and associated support services.” 
OPM also said in the release that it will provide training and technical assistance to agencies as they implement these strategies through webinars, and it will be posting “periodic updates” to its Workforce of the Future webpage.

Amazon is warning employees not to use third-party generative AI tools for work, according to multiple internal guidances viewed by Business Insider.""While we may find ourselves using GenAl tools, especially when it seems to make life easier, we should be sure not to use it for confidential Amazon work,"" the company warned employees in a recent email. ""Don't share any confidential Amazon, customer, or employee data when you're using 3rd party GenAl tools. Generally, confidential data would be data that is not publicly available.""

Amazon's internal third-party generative AI use and interaction policy, viewed by BI, warns that the companies offering generative AI services may take a license to or ownership over anything employees input into tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.""This means that any outputs such as email, PRFAQs, internal wiki pages, code, confidential information, documentation, pre-launch and strategy materials may be extracted, reviewed, used, and distributed by the owners of the generative Al,"" the policy states. ""As such, all Amazonians must abide by our standard Amazon policies for confidential information and security for any inputs to generative Al.""

Those companies might also claim the rights to anything their models output, according to the policy.Around this time last year, an Amazon corporate lawyer informally warned employees not to provide OpenAI's ChatGPT with ""any Amazon confidential information (including Amazon code you are working on,"" saying there had been instances of ChatGPT responses looking similar to internal Amazon data. Amazon employees at the time said they were already using the AI tool as a software ""coding assistant,"" according to internal messages.Questions about how generative AI companies handle confidential information, and who owns the information that goes in and comes out of a model, largely remain unresolved as these tools become more ubiquitous. Amazon may be particularly sensitive as its main competitor Microsoft invested heavily in OpenAI and has its own generative AI products.Amazon notoriously kept employees off of Microsoft systems, but it has softened on that lately. The company recently signed a $1 billion, five-year deal for Microsoft 365 licenses, as BI previously reported.

Amazon's internal generative AI policy states employees can use third-party models for work if they obtain director and legal approval and comply with any applicable security reviews. The recent email states some employees have access to Amazon's internal tool Bedrock, ""a more secure alternative.""Amazon's spokesperson Adam Montgomery said the company has been developing generative AI and large machine learning models for a long time and employees use its AI models every day.

Governors Discuss Artificial Intelligence Risks and Regulatory Priorities


Feb. 24, 2024

Press Releases 



















Washington, DC – During the annual Winter Meeting of the National Governors Association (NGA), Governors welcomed tech pioneer Marc Andreessen for a discussion on the potential risks and benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. With no overarching federal regulations on AI, states are taking the lead to set policies to take advantage of the benefits of AI and put safeguards in place against its risks.
North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum moderated a conversation with Andreessen that focused on harnessing the advantages of AI to enhance U.S. competitiveness while protecting consumers from risk. 
Governor Burgum explained how Governors are applying AI to improve efficiency in state government and explored AI’s potential impacts on workforce issues, stating: “In our lifetime, every job, every company, every industry has been transformed by technology. Now we have something more powerful, that’s being adopted at a faster rate than cell phones, the internet or personal computers. Is the AI revolution going to [increase] productivity, or are we going to regulate ourselves in such a way that we have slower growth than we could be achieving? As operating leaders that run state government, Governors always apply technology to be better, faster, more efficient, more responsive to the citizens. Governors are always competing with each other for jobs and talent and capital to come to our states. But part of that competition is going to shift to who is going to have the framework, the education system that is producing the workforce, the human capital that actually understands this.”  
Andreessen explained the technology sector perspective on potential regulatory approaches, stating: “Fundamentally, there are two different regulatory approaches on how to deal with these technologies. One is to regulate the technologies themselves. A lot of the proposals on regulating AI have to do with things like: regulating what can go into chips, regulating who can buy chips, how they get used; regulating software, regulating open-source software, deciding who can actually download open-source software, who can use it, who can write it. The other approach is regulating the uses. That approach [focuses on scenarios such as using AI to] make it easier to plan a bank robbery. Well, it turns out bank robbery is already illegal. Invasion of consumer privacy is already illegal. Medical fraud is already illegal. The good news is, in this country we already have a robust set of laws and regulations for basically all or most of the downside scenarios – either at the law enforcement level for domestic issues or intelligence capabilities for dealing with things at the global level. I think it’s far more effective to regulate the uses since you’re addressing the actual issues. It also preserves the underlying fundamental opportunity in all the positive cases [without] choking off the technology itself.”  
Andreessen concluded: “At the end of the day, we’re going to have to decide as a country: Are we in new technologies to win them? We are so used to America being technologically dominant, which means economically dominant, which also means militarily dominant. We’re so used to that. It’s been the case for 80 years. We have to figure out how to win, how to have American enterprise win, and the American people win in this, while also dealing with the downside cases.”
Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, NGA Chair Utah Governor Spencer Cox, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, and Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon also shared insights on what their states are doing to implement effective AI policies.

Johnson: “The cybernation revolution” will create “a separate nation of the poor, the unskilled, the jobless” who will be unable to find work and to afford life’s necessities, they argued. Three decades earlier, in the 1930s, according to The Atlantic, a California mayor wrote to the US President that industrial technology was a “Frankenstein monster” that threatened to upend manufacturing, “devouring our civilization”.These doom and gloom predictions of how new technology would lead to a worse world proved to be utterly wrong, of course – just as many similar, earlier predictions about the effects of new technology had been. But the most recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, presented a déjà vu moment: An IMF report concluded that 40% of jobs around the world will be affected by AI. In advanced economies, that rises to 60% of jobs set to be affected by machine learning, with about half being negatively impacted. The losers will face lower salaries and reduced hiring, and some jobs will disappear altogether.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesOver the last 200 years, predictions of fewer jobs in the future have generally proven to be false. The pessimists have been wrong repeatedly. But make no mistake – hundreds of millions of jobs have been destroyed. First, agricultural technology replaced millions of farming jobs, while the industrial revolution moved people into factories. Then automation moved them back out of the factories, giving rise to an economy of services. Throughout these waves of creative destruction, however, the total number of people employed has risen. Today there are a record number in employment across the globe and in almost every country.Number of people employed worldwide (billions), 1991-2023 Image: International Labour OrganizationBut it will be different this time because AI is different. Technology will not always support people in doing their jobs, it will primarily replace jobs. New types of jobs will emerge, however.Trying to imagine the new world of workIf you were a farm worker 120 years ago – like roughly three quarters of all people at the time – would it have been possible for you to imagine a world where only one in 20 people worked on farms? Could you have anticipated the range of new jobs available to workers today? Even 20 years ago, economists probably wouldn’t have predicted that there would be 800,000 personal trainers employed in the US today and 2.5 million jobs in the app development industry.It’s possible that we are experiencing the same difficulty today in trying to imagine the new, unknown jobs of the future. We can’t see into the future, but we can shift our perspective on the possible creation of new jobs by asking broader questions.First, are all of our needs satisfied today? For instance, would we like higher quality food? Would we like better services from businesses or government agencies? Would we like more efficiently or more beautifully designed products? Do we want better health – physical and mental? New roles could be created to address these needs and wants.Second, will new needs arrive as our society evolves – as we work through solutions to our current global challenges and as new innovations arrive? A future equivalent to today’s smartphone could create entirely new sectors of employment. It’s possible that we are not able to imagine this today, but if the patterns of the last 200 years continue, these jobs will arrive.Third, will an increase in demand for products and services lead to new jobs? New technology will eliminate some jobs, yes. But in many cases, it will support a worker in doing a better, more efficient job, lowering the cost of production. When products and services become more affordable, demand generally increases.Last, and perhaps most relevant: How can policy makers and government agencies best facilitate the dynamic creation and rotation of the labour market towards new jobs? This will be particularly important if, as is likely, creative destruction and job changes continue, possibly at a higher rate than ever.Investing in new technology and jobsSmall and mid-sized businesses create a disproportionate amount of new jobs around the world. So, freedom for entrepreneurs and investors to create and grow businesses will be more critical than ever as new technology becomes more available. A more flexible and free labour market should allow more rapid moves between sectors and businesses as the nature of jobs change. This means that nations that are less attractive to entrepreneurs and investors because of lower economic freedom and heavily regulated labour markets may suffer from more unemployment. Alternatively, nations with open and free markets will keep creating new jobs to replace the lost ones.Creative destruction stemming from tech development may lead to hard times and new challenges for many people, as well as for whole cities and regions. Governments can play an important role in alleviating this by providing opportunities or support programmes for reskilling, as well as unemployment benefits and other forms of transitional safety nets. During the industrial revolution, local and national governments made major public investments to teach the skills of reading, writing and math that were necessary for the new jobs at that time. There was also investment in new roads, ports and other infrastructure. In this new era, we need public investment in digital skills for everyone, as well as digital highways that allow regions to participate in new economic opportunities.As we all try to imagine the new, unknown jobs of the future, we must ask the right questions about new technology and how it will affect our work and our industries. By shifting our perspective on how new jobs can arise from new technology, we can ensure AI brings about change that works for everyone.Have you read?Climate action and AI can create more and better jobs.

The choice is oursThu 29 Feb 2024 06.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Feb 2024 16.33 ESTShare130130As artificial intelligence spreads rapidly across America’s economy, there’s a lively debate about how it will transform the future of work. What many people fail to realize is that AI has already changed millions of workers’ jobs – often for the worse.At Amazon, some warehouse and delivery drivers complain that AI-driven bots have fired them without any human intervention whatsoever. At some companies, surveillance apps track how much time workers spend in trips to the bathroom, with some workers protesting that the time limits are too strict.Many corporations gather information about their employees through webcams, keyboards, internet activity and phone logs, and that can include private information about workers’ political opinions, sexual orientation, union activity and even their emotions and mental state. Inside many call centers, AI tools monitor the calls that agents make, and based on factors like the agent’s or customer’s tone of voice, those tools often send messages to an agent’s computer, directing them to talk with more empathy or energy.And then there are the forecasts that AI will wipe out millions of jobs. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2030, tasks that account for up to 30% of the hours now worked across the US could be automated, and that AI will push 12 million American workers out of their jobs. Goldman Sachs predicts that AI will disrupt 300m jobs worldwide by 2030.Workers worry that AI will mean more stress, surveillance, and layoffs. It doesn’t have to be that wayC-suite executives can’t wait to deploy more AI in their offices, warehouses and factories, but many workers, white-collar and blue-collar alike, worry that AI will mean only bad news for them: more stress, surveillance, and speed-ups, and more layoffs, too. It doesn’t have to be that way.In Germany and several other European countries, workers often have a voice in how their employers roll out and use artificial intelligence. German law requires that companies notify their works councils (worker-management committees that exist in most German workplaces) in advance about any plans to introduce AI. Those councils often then discuss how to use AI, typically with an eye to having it complement workers and make them more productive, instead of replacing them.Virginia Doellgast, a Cornell University expert on AI and work, told me that the German model, with its works councils and strong unions, leads to less employee resistance to AI, smoother rollouts of AI-related technologies, and increased productivity that benefits companies and workers alike.But in the United States, a country where workplace decisions are typically top-down with employees having little or no input, workers often feel like victims and guinea pigs when it comes to AI. Indeed, many workers don’t even know when their employers are using AI to surveil them or speed up their jobs.Labor leaders wish that US workers could have a strong voice in how AI is introduced and implemented, but that’s wishful thinking in a nation where just 6% of workers in private industry are in labor unions. At unionized workplaces, but not non-union ones, employees have a right not only to negotiate about AI when it substantially affects working conditions, but also to push for protections against some of AI’s worst effects. Hollywood’s writers’ and actors’ unions won important protections on AI in the negotiations that settled their lengthy strikes last year.One labor leader told me that unions certainly recognize that new technologies can increase productivity and overall prosperity. But he added that AI-related technologies often “speed up the work, deskill the work, make workplaces more stressful and make jobs more demanding”.At some companies, AI-powered tools keep tabs on whether employees meet their production quotas, and those tools sometimes automatically increase the quotas of employees who regularly meet them. With employers increasingly using AI to screen résumés, AI has faced complaints about discriminating against older applicants, women, people of color and workers with disabilities. At many call centers, AI-powered apps review the transcripts of agents’ conversations with customers and sometimes give warnings or demerits to agents for straying too far from the assigned script.Some economists warn that if corporations can roll out AI with little input from workers, then AI will increase production and profits for corporations, with few or any gains for workers – all while increasing the nation’s overall income inequality. Workers will suffer from speed-ups, stress and layoffs, and society at large may have to finance tens of billions of dollars in unemployment insurance, health coverage and perhaps food and rent assistance for many who lose their jobs to AI.To minimize AI’s negative effects on America’s 160 million workers, there are many things government, labor and business should do. Government should require companies to notify their workers when they’re using AI tools to monitor them.Recognizing that workers aren’t in a position to assess the downsides of AI, Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO union federation, has called for having a government agency vet AI technologies to determine whether they’re harmful to workers – just as the FDA vets drugs to make “sure drugs don’t kill people before they’re put out into the world”.‘Disinformation on steroids’: is the US prepared for AI’s influence on the election?Read moreWith AI threatening to cause large-scale layoffs, the government should create incentives for employers to embrace four-day, even three-day workweeks to spread the work around and minimize layoffs. For example, if AI makes a 1,000-employee company consider laying off 200 people, that company could avoid layoffs by shifting its 1,000 employees to four-day workweeks.Labor unions need to snap to attention on AI and educate workers, both union and non-union, about AI’s harms and benefits – it can mean more invasiveness, but also increase productivity and hopefully workers’ wages, too. Unions should also educate workers about how to press their employers to reduce AI’s harms and to share the fruits of AI so that workers, and not just shareholders, benefit from the increased productivity and profits it produces. (The AFL-CIO’s Technology Institute is already doing some of this educating.)Unions should press companies to use AI in ways that complement rather than displace workers, and that means pushing for enhanced training to help employees work with AI. Unions should of course keep up their efforts to unionize tech workers.As for business, Michael Richards, policy director at the US Chamber of Commerce’s technology engagement center, said that “while there are clear benefits” to AI, “there are legitimate concerns” surrounding the technology. Richards said companies “recognize that engaging in an inclusive dialogue about using new technologies is critical”. Such a dialogue could reduce workers’ distrust of AI and encourage employee input, for instance, about ways to tweak AI tools to have them work more efficiently alongside workers.There’s little doubt that AI will bring big changes, good and bad, to America’s workplaces. To reduce AI’s harmful effects, President Biden should create a panel of government, union and business officials, much like the tripartite boards that President Franklin Roosevelt created to maximize arms production during the second world war. This new panel should make recommendations about how best to use AI in America’s workplaces, all with the goal of maximizing AI’s benefits for the nation and sharing the gains from AI while minimizing the pain for workers.

Dive Brief:

When it comes to job security, 87% of marketers are worried about technology replacing their jobs, per a recent report from Gartner based on several recent surveys of marketers. 
Those concerns aren’t unfounded, as 26% of marketing leaders said they plan to reduce personnel due to generative AI in 2024. The findings also point to a martech burden: 61% of respondents said they have encountered technology or process changes in the past 12 months.
However, generative AI use can lead to lower rates of burnout. Those who engage with the technology at high rates are 30% less likely to indicate high rates of burnout and are 40% less likely to leave their job in the next year, per Gartner. 





















Dive Insight:
Gartner’s research underscores some of the challenges and opportunities CMOs face across their marketing organizations as the role of technology broadly continues to expand and as generative AI, more specifically, remains a big focus.
One takeaway is that while technology holds a great deal of usefulness for marketers, gaining the necessary skills remains a challenge: 63% of martech leaders reporting marketing cannot fully integrate or operate technologies in their stack while two thirds of marketers said that learning takes time away from day-to-day responsibilities.
In terms of morale, the report found that 55% of marketers report mismatched job expectations. This is further compounded by environmental factors such as new technology and uncertainty in leadership, with 20% of respondents experiencing a recent change in senior marketing leadership. 
“These findings should be a red flag for CMOs, as high environmental uncertainty, mismatched role expectations and martech burden can lead to burnout as well as increased attrition,” said Iliyana Hadjistoyanova, director, advisory in the Gartner Marketing Practice, in a statement. “CMOs must refocus their talent strategy and prioritize development with a strong focus on upskilling and change management to ensure their function is prepared in the face of ongoing disruption.”
While the use of generative AI has increased in the past year, many consumers remain skeptical. The technology has been linked to increases in misinformation, among other concerns. Additionally, one-fifth of brands say they aim to remain generative AI-free as a point of differentiation.
The report, AI Opportunity Amid Talent Turmoil: 2023 Marketing Talent Survey, is based on surveys of 405 martech leaders between May and June of 2023 and 627 marketers between August and September of 2023. Between September and November of 2023, 822 business executives were surveyed.

Gen AI is game-changing technology, directly impacting the way legal work is done and the current law firm-client business model; and while much remains unsettled, within 10 years, Gen AI is likely to change corporate legal departments and law firms in profound and unique ways

Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) isn’t a futuristic technology — it’s here now, and it’s already impacting the legal industry in many ways.
Already, both corporate legal departments and law firms of all sizes have begun experimenting with Gen AI technology, both with public-facing tools such as ChatGPT, as well as more business-friendly tools such as Microsoft’s Copilot and legal industry-specific technologies. This experimentation has begun to give way to more discrete planning, as well as specific policies and procedures governing the use of Gen AI in the legal workplace.
This shouldn’t be a surprise. After all, just about everybody in legal knows that some sort of dramatic sea change is coming. Indeed, 70% of legal professionals said they believe AI and Gen AI will have a transformational or high impact on the legal profession within the next five years — more than any other trend, including the economy, regulation, and activities around environmental, social & governance (ESG) issues, according to the Thomson Reuters Future of Professionals Report, which also showed that Gen AI brings hope of a new efficient future but also fear of job replacement.
Both that hope and fear may be well-founded, as both the scope and pace of change may be greater than some in the legal industry anticipate. While some law firms are approaching Gen AI as an optional, nice-to-have technology, our research has found that change is likely to take place imminently. And within the next 10 years, the legal industry should expect wide-scale business model changes, as well as some disintermediation of lawyers in situations in which consumers eschew legal professionals altogether in favor of a technological option.
The most successful corporate legal departments and law firms won’t be the ones merely experimenting with Gen AI — they will be the ones preparing now for a legal industry future that will look a lot different in 2034 than it does today. That’s why we are embarking on a new blog series discussing Gen AI usage in the legal industry to help explore that future, laying out the scenarios we anticipate for the legal industry in both the immediate and mid-term future.
Our predictions for AI in the legal industry
To understand how the industry could be impacted by AI in the near and longer term, we garnered the views of Thomson Reuters’s technology and legal market experts, including members of TR Labs, who are at the cutting edge of legal AI research and development. We also interviewed a range of experts across industry and academia. Based on these discussions and other research recently conducted by Thomson Reuters, such as our Future of Professionals Survey, we have been able to make early predictions for how the legal market will evolve over the next decade.

Already, Gen AI has begun to make in-roads among law firms, corporate legal departments, and other legal service providers and technology companies. That impact will likely occur in three overlapping waves; however, the effect will not be linear. Some firms of course will move faster than others, while even within each firm progress could be diverse, with some practice areas with work that’s more susceptible to automation — such as real estate — radically transforming with AI faster than other practice areas, such as litigation.
This first wave we are already beginning to see now, with widespread AI adoption and experimentation occurring in corporate legal departments and law firms of all sizes. Over the next one-to-three years, the legal industry will increasingly gain access to trusted Gen AI tools from both large technology companies and legal technology providers, letting legal departments and law firms move from pure experimentation to putting AI plans into action. Especially at the beginning, this work will be focused on back-office functions and support staff. Law firms and their clients will begin considering how they can optimize their labor costs, reducing numbers of new associate hires and non-fee-earning staff.
The focus on non-billable work will not last for long, however, particularly as Gen AI technology advances to perform more complex tasks. Looking three-to-five years out, we begin to see changes to the legal business model emerge. AI will allow legal work to be done more efficiently, and corporate legal departments will put increasing pressure on law firms and outside providers to deliver work faster. As less time is spent on legal tasks, the billable hour will no longer be the most cost-effective way to capture value, prompting firms to reimagine their billing models to better share in efficiency savings and capture the value that’s added through advanced technology.


Already, Gen AI has begun to make in-roads among law firms, corporate legal departments, and other legal service providers and technology companies.


In response, large law firms will seek to capture more revenue by deploying staff, including juniors, to higher value work. They may also use their new law or internal innovations teams to standardize repeatable work that might otherwise be unprofitable. Meanwhile, small- and midsize law firms will be able to use Gen AI to grow their practice without needing to hire more staff. Regardless of size, however, the point is that change is a must: The law firms that don’t adapt will not be able to keep up with the efficiencies gained by their peers.
Finally, extending the time horizon out five-to-ten years leads to greater automation of legal services — and, in some cases, partial or full disintermediation of the legal professional through AI. With Gen AI technology capable of tackling even more complex tasks, AI will be a primary driver of day-to-day legal tasks, with legal practitioners acting as supervisors and strategists. The result is a complete overhaul of not only how legal services are completed and billed, but also the mix of players in the legal arena that are most needed.
Tech-enabled services will allow some legal clients in both the public and corporate spheres to sometimes bypass law firms entirely, relying on technology to serve their legal needs. This means do-it-yourself (DIY) legal solutions for consumers and small legal business are poised to proliferate, increasing access to justice in an underserved market. For law firms to survive, they will need to learn how to blend AI with human expertise and relationships, perfecting their service delivery to compete with a clientele that is familiar with and fully expectant of AI-enabled expertise.
Gen AI’s rollout looks different based on organizational type
However, as noted above, not all parties in the legal industry will fully embrace Gen AI’s introduction, nor will the technology’s advancement affect everyone equally. Gen AI will impact differently sized corporate legal departments and law firms unevenly.
At the forefront of the market, corporate legal departments will purchase and access Gen AI in a way that could transform their structure and day-to-day work product. Gen AI usage will likely be enterprise-wide at many companies, with the legal function receiving the benefits of economies of scale and outside technology investment. As corporate legal departments continue to experience cost pressures, however, we anticipate a changing of internal roles within those departments, with fewer paralegal and junior roles as the tasks those roles usually handle become the first to get automated.
Corporate legal departments are also increasingly likely to expect lower costs from their outside providers in turn, particularly for low-stakes work — which in some cases means replacing current panel firms with lower-cost alternatives, including alternative legal service providers (ALSPs) or technology firms, meaning that these entities must embrace AI or risk losing out on work. And across the board, this client emphasis on costs could lead to a rise in alternative fee arrangements and a further diminishing of the billable hour.
This shift towards cost-cutting and a change of roles is likely to be mirrored across law firms of all sizes. Large law firms generally have greater technological capability and access to larger datasets, and many also have already established new law or internal innovation teams. Niche data could become a key law firm differentiator in the age of AI. Larger firms also may leverage their economies of scale to enable Gen AI-powered technology products that capture work that would not have been profitable without automation.


This shift towards cost-cutting and a change of roles is likely to be mirrored across law firms of all sizes.


Among midsize law firms, the same technology could be used to capture bigger-ticket work. By using AI to automate repeatable, labor-intensive tasks, midsize law firms should be able to take on more clients, including more complex clients, or perhaps cover more practice areas through an expanded scope. In this way, midsize law firms can bill themselves as low-cost alternatives for plain vanilla transactions or disputes.
At small law firms, Gen AI will be similarly used to automate some processes in order to win new business. This could impact small firms’ headcount — particularly the hiring of new paralegals and junior associates — as small law firms lawyers leverage Gen AI to automate processes that previously fell to these new hires. With time and cost saved, this would allow some smaller firms to take on more cases or even expand their practice into new areas, enabling these firms to grow their book of business without hiring additional staff. This could also help alleviate the access to justice problem that many consumers currently face.
All in all, there remains a lot of speculation around when and how Gen AI will influence the legal profession. Between the technology’s development, the industry’s reaction, and outside economic forces, there are a lot of different paths in legal that Gen AI could take.
Regardless of the exact path, it would be smart for law firms, corporate legal departments, ALSPs, and other legal industry players to begin plans for a potential future now, because it’s reasonable to believe that a Gen AI-impacted future will lead to profound change in the way people work.


In coming weeks, this series from the Thomson Reuters strategy team and the Thomson Reuters Institute will take a closer look at some of the individual practice and subject-area facets of those changes and what those professionals in the legal sphere should expect.

There is much fear that artificial intelligence will steal human jobs. Many human capabilities are being delegated to machines and abilities such as memory, attention, accuracy and manual precision could be undermined. But humans have a unique type of intelligence that AI can’t match. Chiara Succi describes three levels of (irreplaceable) human contribution to the workplace: intelligent hand, intelligent mind and intelligent heart. 

The heated debate about artificial intelligence (AI) and its “extraordinary potential” is surprisingly leading to a rediscovery of humans’ contribution to work. If robots can bring speed, precision, and strength, we still need fantasy, intuition and affection. It is important to debunk the belief that machines will steal the jobs of human beings, unless they are asked to repeat only one single task. In fact, we will not see the elimination of our occupations, but artificial intelligence applications will certainly impact and modify them deeply.
Weakening human capabilities
Automation will change workers’ behaviours and the risk is that some abilities could be undermined, such as memory, attention, accuracy, manual precision, and many others. How can we leverage new technologies without diminishing our competencies? Which human assets are in danger and in need of protection?
It is not easy to describe the magnificence of human intelligence (HI) and the literature has not yet presented an exhaustive taxonomy of relevant human capabilities in the digital age. As a starting point, I propose a description structured over three levels:
The intelligent hand
Some manual skills cannot be replaced by machines while keeping the same versatility and level of quality. In every organisation, we can identify some activities that require a particular know-how and a great amount of knowledge that is transferred over time, through on-the-job training. Several lines of manual work require the ability to solve complex changing problems that are always slightly different because the raw material, temperature or context is different. It would make no sense to program a robot to solve a problem that occurs differently almost every time.
The world of luxury, in particular, strives for authenticity and values artisanal processes, which make some handmade goods unique. Contemporary research finds that products, services and organisations perceived as authentic carry value that consumers are willing to pay for.
As a side effect, if we push to replace manual work with AI, we might miss some parts of the work experience such as technical mastery, dedication to the job, experimentation, apprenticeship, concentration, and caring about excellence, with possible implications and impacts difficult to assess for the workplace.
The intelligent mind
Matthew Crawford warns us of the risk of “learned helplessness” as an effect of automation and digitalisation. People display a lower level of individual agency and a higher level of dissatisfaction. Office jobs often don’t allow us to experience the direct effects of our actions and to see tangible results.
In fact, we have a greater amount of data at our disposal, but an inferior capacity to read them, and probably at a lower speed in comparison with an algorithm. It appears natural to delegate complex tasks and difficult decisions to machines, the danger being that we will lose critical thinking. This might weaken our exercise of judgment and we may face issues more superficially and impulsively, without going in-depth and without analysing root causes.
This might represent a problem, considering that cognitive skills such as problem-solving, creativity, innovativeness, and learning to learn are becoming increasingly important in the workplace. Decisions are taken by managers largely based on their intuition and not based on a mere analysis of data.
AI doesn’t have the sensitivity to manage unexpected events or crises. A self-driving car cannot enter a complex roundabout, as it cannot identify a zero-risk condition. Human drivers, instead, find the courage to travel adapting to the flow and moderating their speed to avoid accidents, as a robot will (probably) never be able to do.
We must acquire higher awareness of the potentiality of our mind and its ability to find mental shortcuts, the so-called heuristics, which allow us to source daily experience to survive and overcome obstacles.
The intelligent heart
Communication among human beings is becoming more complex and more frequent; it can be supported, facilitated, “augmented” by technologies, but never fully substituted by a remote system. Mysteriously, the hormone oxytocin, which is essential for the development of trust and emotional engagement, is produced only when we interact in presence.
Emotional intelligence and even a sense of humour can be extremely powerful, especially in the workplace. Only real interactions and laughing together release ‘feel-good’ hormones, such as endorphins, dopamine and oxytocin.
Finally, the moral question, distinguishing between good and bad, is central when we discuss artificial intelligence. Computers alone are not able to work ethically and, consequently, discrimination and injustice might be automated.
Augmented by machines
If Steve Jobs said that “computers are like a bicycle for the mind”, AI represents its racing car. In fact, there are several areas in which AI can effectively support human intelligence, such as offering new paths for exploration, enhancing the creative process, saving time and focusing attention on relevant tasks.
In organisations, AI can facilitate the imagination process in the development of new products or new ideas. The exploratory phase typically requires access to information, multiple experiences, time, and space to take place. AI can accelerate this phase, removing several roadblocks and quickly testing new directions.
AI and technological developments have begun to transform and aid creative and complex processes, as well as challenge what we believe to be advanced reasoning ability. After losing to a computer program for the first time, the Go world champion declared “I’m learning new moves and I’m becoming a better player thanks to AlphaGo…”
The complexity of the context is forcing companies to redesign their organisational model and to clarify the contribution of employees, in particular of managers. This can represent an opportunity to develop human potential and to increase people’s effectiveness and satisfaction.
It is necessary to acquire a higher awareness of human capabilities and personal talents. organisations and educational institutions play a crucial role in developing it. They have to create environments in which people can express themselves, make mistakes, restart, create and innovate and not just execute tasks or process information (like robots).

I am skeptical of the article’s optimistic stance on the survival of enough jobs with artificial intelligence. The swift advancements in robotics, deep learning, and emotion simulation will quickly bridge gaps that were once considered uniquely human and would replace many more intelligent hands, minds, and hearts in my view. Mass human contributions will be increasingly replaceable, and only a number of geniuses and artisans will survive.
The only frontiers to human existence are meaning, a sense of purpose, and free will. “What is the purpose of it all?” I invoke the metaphors of Sisyphus eternally rolling his stone uphill and a mouse trapped in its wheel, tirelessly running. We are in an existential quandary and our future roles are less than certain with AI and loose ethics.

I believe the argument the author makes in this blog-entry ignores the empirical evidence AI systems have just delivered over the course of the past year.
I am not convinced that AI won’t be able to imitate these purported three “human” traits, at least not sufficiently well or much better than human average. There is large variation in how different persons’ strength in these three, e.g. many are definitely very awkward and rather unsuccessful in their attempts to adjust their tone to the specific interaction and relationship at hand. On the other hand I believe that the past year has shown that – if anything – AI is frighteningly well able to internally mirror even very complex workings of systems such as our internal compass for whom to trust and how to interact, our hormonal systems. In fact I believe it’s plausible that this is exactly what would happen if I had a sufficiently powerful AI being trained by tagging along with me in the office for several months and observing all my interactions and decisions.
Now, one may be inclined to reply that this all may be true but that it is the very combination of individuals bringing these traits in differently strong and faceted versions to the table that makes humans superior. But we already know that systems with several separate agentic AI systems do develop complex interactions, collaborations and story-lines in which different systems develop different characteristics.
The necessity of (human) presence may be the strongest argument in this article, since in an iron-man version of it we can accept that this may be something an AI is categorically unable to imitate. To do that, we have to put aside the deceptive effects human-like robots and “emotional companion” products have had on probands in experiments. But while the argument may be sound, it is not a necessary condition for saving jobs: if all co-workers in the office are robots/AIs equipped with an internal mirroring of trust-guiding hormonal systems, none of them will really need the presence of a human around. They may be joking around to figure out their standing among each other and potentially this could work for them to identify “odd” colleagues who they don’t trust – without needing any human presence in the room.
Finally, the author reveals a fundamental misunderstanding in the conclusion which serves to substantiate why the article in its entirety seems mistaken: the success of today’s robots, the fundamental breakthrough leading to the capabilities that we can see today, was to turn robots from machines that execute tasks into machines that “create environments, can express themselves, make mistakes, restart, create and [this remains for philosophers to argue], innovate.”

Yet the dramatic shifts in the pandemic-era workplace have turned this once unfathomable idea into a reality for some workers. And as more global data emerges, an increasing number of companies are courting the approach after positive trial-run results across countries including the UK, Iceland, Portugal and more.Now, as pilots continue – in Germany, a trial of 45 companies has just begun, for instance – another factor has entered the mix. Artificial intelligence (AI) is gathering pace in the workplace, and some experts believe it could accelerate the adoption of the four-day workweek.Data from London-based news-and-events resource Tech.co collected in late 2023 lends credence to this idea. For their 2024 Impact of Technology on the Workplace, the company surveyed more than 1,000 US business leaders. The researchers found 29% of organisations with four-day workweeks use AI extensively in their firms' operations, implementing generative AI tools such as ChatGPT as well as other programmes to streamline operations. In comparison, only 8% of five-day working week organisations use AI to this extent. And 93% of businesses using AI are open to a four-day work week, whereas for those who don't, fewer than half are open to working shorter weeks.By handing over simple tasks to AI tools, we gain invaluable time previously lost to slow aspects of the process – Abb-d TaiyoAt London-based digital design agency Driftime, adopting AI technology has been crucial to enable the business to operate a flexible four-day work week. ""By handing over simple tasks to AI tools, we gain invaluable time previously lost to slow aspects of the process,"" says co-founder Abb-d Taiyo. ""With tools like Modyfi, the graphics are all live and modifiable, making it so much easier and quicker for our designers to create concepts and ideas.""Taiyo believes it makes sense for both his employees and his bottom line to work the condensed week. ""Instead of a dip in the quantity of work created over just four days, we've seen a remarkably high quality of work matched by a high staff satisfaction return. The health and happiness of our team is in direct correlation to the high standard of work produced,"" he says.AlamyThe mainstreaming of AI tech may mean workers get an extra day off (Credit: Alamy)Shayne Simpson, group managing director of UK-based TechNET IT Recruitment, also believes AI has been fundamental to the success of the company's four-day work week policy. The firm has found AI tools save each of their recruitment consultants 21 hours per week, primarily by automating previously manual tasks like data input, confirmation emails, resume screening and candidate outreach. This has reduced the time to fill permanent roles at the company by an average of 10 days. ""This timesaving allows our team to achieve their weekly goals earlier in the week and the flexibility liberates our consultants from being tethered to their desks, enabling them to enjoy a well-deserved Friday off,"" says Simpson.Not only has the company's abridged workweek boosted productivity and morale, Simpson says it's also been key to attracting talent to work within the company itself. ""Seasoned recruitment professionals are enticed by our streamlined processes while entry-level talent is eager to embrace new tools."" It's lifted the entire business, he adds.Rather than becoming mere caretakers or servants of machines, human workers need to develop new skills that can leverage, complement and lead AI, achieving the enhanced outcomes – Na FuWhile AI tools are certainly paving the way for a four-day work week within some industries, the technology can't usher in the change alone. Organisational culture within a business is also fundamental, says Na Fu, a professor in human resource management at Trinity Business School, Ireland. ""An openness to innovative work structures, an experimental mindset and, importantly, a culture grounded in high levels of trust are all important for the four-day work week to be successfully adopted,"" she says.As the digital transformation with AI progresses, employees themselves also must be willing to level up, she adds: ""Rather than becoming mere caretakers or servants of machines, human workers need to develop new skills that can leverage, complement and lead AI, achieving the enhanced outcomes.""Some industries will benefit from AI more than others, however – notably those who are able to use generative AI tools for such tasks including software development, content creation, marketing and legal services, says Fu. Plus, artificial intelligence development still has a way to go if it is to substantially reduce human working hours across the board.What may drive the shift to a four-day workweek in an AI-powered business landscape may not ultimately be up to the robots, however. Executive buy-in is required, and whether leaders will embrace the unconventional concept will vary depending on a firm's overarching purpose and values, says Fu. Instead of letting AI supplement the work of humans, for instance, some businesses could use it to automate certain tasks while piling other work on employees to fill newly open hours.Still, despite some reservation, an increasing number of business leaders – including those from some of the world's highest-earning companies – see a technology-driven shortened workweek as an inevitable future. In October 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg TV: ""Your children are going to live to 100, and they'll probably be working three-and-a-half days a week."" Employees will have to wait and see.Artificial intelligenceFuture of businessHow we workTechnology of BusinessWork culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computer Weekly: Authorised access only – biometrics in the workplace





























By


Steve Ranger



Published: 27 Feb 2024 13:00


 
More staff are experimenting with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in the workplace, but adoption may be being held back by a lack of guidance from managers.
In its latest survey of more than 10,000 desk workers around the globe, the Workforce Lab from Slack found that experimentation with AI tools in the office continues to grow.
It found that one in four desk workers reported having tried AI tools for work as of January 2024, compared with one in five in September last year. One in three desk workers said they had used automation tools – such as automated workflows – in their job.
The survey from Slack – which was acquired by Salesforce in 2021 – also found that, outside of work, another 19% had used GenAI and 8% had used automation. That still means, of course, that about half of desk workers haven’t tried either.







Of the respondents who had used AI and automation tools for work, around 80% said the technology was already improving their productivity.
The top tasks where desk workers said they were seeing the most value from AI tools included in writing assistance, automating workflows and summarising content. Writing summaries has replaced “research” as a top value-add for respondents since Slack’s September 2023 survey.
It’s still early days for generative AI in the workplace, and so it’s perhaps unsurprising that attitudes towards the new technology vary. While enthusiasts for GenAI argue that it will enhance jobs by automating away the tedious busy-work and giving them a chance to focus on more creative work, others warn that managers will more likely use the opportunity of generative AI to cut staff levels instead.
While the largest proportion of those surveyed (42%) said they were excited about the idea of AI handling tasks from their current job, another 27% said they were concerned about these tools handling common workplace tasks, with the remaining 31% in “wait-and-see” mode.



“Lack of instruction may be preventing employees from experimenting with AI. Desk workers at companies that have defined AI guidelines are nearly six times more likely to have tried AI tools, compared with desk workers whose companies have no guidelines around AI usage”


Slack research




If workers are split on the introduction of AI tools, bosses seem far more bullish. The survey found that the majority (81%) of executives feel “some urgency” to incorporate generative AI into their organisations, with 50% of leaders reporting a high degree of urgency.
However, the survey found that almost half of staff had received no guidance from their leaders or organisation on how to use AI tools at work.
“Lack of instruction may be preventing employees from experimenting with AI,” the Slack research said. “Desk workers at companies that have defined AI guidelines are nearly six times more likely to have tried AI tools, compared with desk workers whose companies have no guidelines around AI usage.”
Workers at companies where the usage guidelines limit the use of AI are still more likely to have experimented with AI tools than those at companies with no rules around AI usage.
The results are in line with a survey by Isaca in October last year, which found that only 28% of organisations expressly permitted the use of generative AI and only 10% had a formal comprehensive policy in place. While setting up guidance around generative AI might be a new area, without it, there is the risk that staff will use these tools in ways the organisations might not want – something that is known as “shadow AI”.
As a result, some organisations, especially in the public sector, have started to put in place guidelines for what staff can – and cannot – do with generative AI technologies. Much of this has focused on making sure that all content is checked to prevent any chance of AI hallucination and ensuring that humans are always involved in key decision-making.
For example, US city San Francisco published its own generative AI guidelines in December 2023 which included rules around always disclosing the use of these tools and never putting sensitive information into public tools. New York also has a set of guidelines in place.
“The vast majority of people who are using AI and automation are already starting to experience productivity gains,” said Christina Janzer, senior vice-president of research and analytics at Slack and head of Slack’s Workforce Lab.
“But the data indicates that failing to provide guidance or instruction on AI may be inhibiting your employees from giving it a try. If you’re looking to ready your workforce for the AI revolution, you can start by providing guidelines for how AI can be used at work.”
The research found the top business benefits that executives are most looking forward to from integrating AI into business operations include increased efficiency and productivity of employees (38%), the ability to make data-driven decision-making (35%), innovation in products and services (34%) and cost reductions (33%). Managers are also hoping for an increased focus on strategy over rote tasks (27%) and enhanced customer experience (18%).
In terms of what is stopping executives from fully embracing AI, data security and privacy topped the list at (44%), followed by worries about AI reliability and accuracy (36%). A lack of expertise and a skills gap among staff was cited by one in four (25%), while broader ethical and compliance issues were blamed by (17%). Customer trust and acceptance was mentioned by 17%, while 16% said the cost of implementation and maintenance was an issue.
The research suggests that desk workers report spend as much as 41% of their time at work on tasks that are low value and don’t contribute much to their core job functions. The more time desk workers spend on low-value work, the “more excitement they express for AI and automation to handle tasks from their current job”, the Slack report said.
“We all have tasks to complete that aren’t part of our job description but are necessary to keep things running smoothly. But if the average desk worker is spending two full days each week on this ‘work of work’, that’s a problem – and an opportunity,” said Janzer.
“In this pivotal moment, implementing AI and automation tools that are trusted, intuitive and embedded in the flow of work is key to recalibrating energy at work toward the activities that will move the needle,” she added.

Every tech company you can think of is jumping on the generative AI bandwagon and touting new features promising to make our lives easier, increase productivity, and unlock some dormant cache of hidden potential within all of us. But ""promise"" is the operative word here. Despite all the AI hype and billions of dollars of investment, generative AI is still very new to the average person and has yet to transform from being a fascinating novelty into an indispensable mainstay. Even as someone who writes about AI for a living, I use generative AI tools somewhat sporadically. That mostly involves testing out and experimenting with new AI models and apps that are available. I might get excited about a certain app or tool only to forget about it and fall back into my normal habits.Also, I generally don't trust generative AI. Since truth and accuracy is pretty important to what I do, bringing ChatGPT and other tools into the fold seems not only counterproductive to me, but also potentially disastrous for my employment. But what if there are ways of using AI tools that don't replace my livelihood, but empower me to do it better? Isn't that what Big Tech is promising us anyway? That's why I decided to give it the old college try and spend some time using AI tools in earnest to test out what's useful, and more importantly what actually sticks. The experiment I spent a little over a week using generative AI tools that fit within my daily life and work schedule. To do this, I made an outline of what my typical week looks like and identified ways where generative AI could help and which tools to use. Since several AI tools require a subscription, programming knowledge, or aren't widely available yet, I narrowed it down to services that are free or readily available to the average person. That excludes tools like Slack's AI add-on, Microsoft's full access to Copilot, and Zoom's AI companion which requires a paid subscription.The experiment isn't intended to use as many generative AI tools as possible, but to experiment with the popular ones deemed the most useful for my life. Here's what I came up with: ChatGPT PlusGoogle Gemini Google Docs and Gmail ""Help me Write"" featureThe standalone Copilot siteOtter's AI features for transcriptsTasty's Botatouille appIt's important to note that I have a paid subscription to ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus), and Mashable paid for a subscription to Otter. But I used all of the other apps with my free personal accounts.First, a disclaimerBeing a reporter, using generative AI tools for work comes with unique ethical challenges. That's why I pledged to use these tools only for brainstorming and writing help, but never to actually write something for me.Anytime I used generative AI to help with drafting or brainstorming, I did it for the purposes of understanding whether it was actually useful and accurate. So you'll see examples of me asking for writing-related help but I didn't actually publish or post any of its responses verbatim. Also, when using ChatGPT for any unpublished or sensitive information I had my chat history turned off. This was to ensure that what I shared wasn't used to train the model. I didn't use Gemini or Copilot in these instances because there's no way to protect your data from being used, unless you have a paid enterprise account. With expectations firmly set, let's begin!Spinning my tangled to-do list into efficiency goldOrganization and time management are not my strong suit. I seem to be missing that gene that accurately budgets time, plans ahead, and efficiently doles out my time and energy instead of obsessing over mundane details and doing everything at the last minute. Here's where I was most excited to lean on AI tools. Every morning, I started my day by brain dumping all the things I needed and wanted to accomplish that day. This included work tasks related to story ideas and assignments and life tasks like walking my dog, doing laundry, and doing yoga.

On the first day, I fed my to-do list with specifications around my work hours, any imminent deadlines, and appointments into ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot to see which one gave me the most helpful response. It became immediately clear that ChatGPT was to become my go-to for the rest of the week. Even though I told Gemini I worked from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., it had me doing work tasks before 9 a.m. and working up until 9 p.m., without any specifics on when to accomplish certain tasks, only suggesting I should ""swap the yoga and writing session in the evening if that works better for you."" That might be how the workday goes in Silicon Valley, but I keep pretty strict work hours to stay sane, especially when working remotely. 




I think Gemini needs to learn more about work/life balance.

Copilot was better at actually blocking out my time, but since it kept encouraging internet browsing by offering me links to various articles about where to find yoga studios or links to articles about AI tools (since I explained what I was working on.)

ChatGPT, on the other hand, gave me a genuinely useful schedule based on how to best use my creative energy. After tackling a news story to start the day, it suggested a concrete time block for my longer term story in the early afternoon, since ""It's a good period to focus deeply on research, outlining, or writing without the fatigue that can come later in the day."" It even recommended getting the laundry going before I work in my longterm story since it can run in the background. I was going to do this anyway, but it was interesting to see ChatGPT picking up on that efficiency.

Toward the end of the day, ChatGPT suggested less energy-consuming tasks like reaching out to new sources. With my ChatGPT-planned schedule in place every morning, I felt more organized and relaxed about the day. Some things definitely took longer than ChatGPT budgeted time for, but it was useful to have something to stick to instead of my usual vague to-do list. Good with recaps, bad with headlinesThroughout the workday, I looked for ways to incorporate generative AI into my work. Since I definitely wasn't asking it to write for me, I had to get creative about how else to use it. That's how I ended up using ChatGPT for its summarization skills.When struggling with a headline, I pasted a draft of the story into ChatGPT and asked it what the story was about. This helped me make sure what I was trying to communicate lined up with what I wrote, and determine certain keywords to use in a headline.

ChatGPT will now remember things about you



Just as an experiment, I also asked ChatGPT to give me headline ideas using stories I'd previously written to see what it came up with. It accurately captured the gist of the story, but ChatGPT's headlines were predictably sterile and robotic. For my story regarding, OpenAI's lack of transparency around training data for its AI video generator Sora, ChatGPT suggested headlines like ""OpenAI's Sora: Breakthrough Video AI Sparks Copyright Controversy"" and ""Sora Unveiled: OpenAI's Latest Leap Forward Amid Ethical Quandaries."" Putting aside the fact that ChatGPT loves a dramatic colon, it sounds like a poor imitation of a New York Times article. 




None of these headlines were particularly inspiring.

While Gemini's headline ideas were either very generic like ""The Legal and Ethical Issues of Training AI Models on Public Data"" or in a clickbait-y style that makes me dread the future of the internet, like ""Is OpenAI Stealing Data to Train its AI Models?"" I also pasted the same story into Copilot for headline ideas, but it was cut off because there's a 2,000-word limit.

4 ways AI can boost your productivity at work



Encountering the trust issueNow onto the next chapter of my day. This week involved reading through transcripts of interviews for a longer term story I'm working on. For journalists, Otter is a lifesaver. It uses AI to transcribe audio files so you can review your interviews within minutes instead of tediously transcribing them yourself. That's nothing new, but this year, Otter released an AI chatbot, which also provides transcript summaries, tells you if you were mentioned, and outlines any specific takeaways. This is mostly geared towards workers who use Otter for meetings, not for journalists interviewing sources, but I decided to try it out and see if it helped for my purposes, since transcripts can be burdensome to comb through for salient points. In the Otter Chat for a long interview, I asked ""what are the takeaways from this conversation?"" The results helpfully showed a brief bulleted list of the major points of the conversation. The AI-generated takeaways seemed valid, but I still felt like I needed to read through the transcript and double-check, since we all know at this point, generative AI can sometimes get it wrong. Everything ultimately was correct, but this is an example of where generative AI might not be the time-saver it's cracked up to be if everything needs to be fact-checked. Nonetheless, I liked having the list of takeaways as a reference when going back to the transcript instead of having to scroll through all of it. Wrangling customer service is an AI solution I can get behindI wanted to try out Google's AI tools for Gmail (formerly Duet AI, now rolled into the umbrella Gemini brand) but only had access to it with my personal email through Google Labs. During my lunch break one day, I discovered something beautiful that I will definitely be using in the future: emailing customer service. As a Soda Stream devotee, I'm a big fan of their CO2 exchange, which lets me ship back used canisters in the same box that delivered the new ones, all with a prepaid label. Yet, when I ordered new canisters, the delivery date came and went, with no new canisters to make my water delightfully carbonated. The tracking status said they were delivered, but nothing ever arrived.

These are the kinds of mundane tasks I despise. Every time I remembered to reach out to Soda Stream, something else would come up and it would slip my mind. I also debated whether it would be better to email them or call, which would mean sitting on hold, and then would I have to somehow prove my canisters never arrived? Welcome to my neurotic brain. Bolstered by the spirit of my experiment, I turned to Gmail's ""Help me write."" In the chat, I prompted ""draft an email to Soda Stream explaining how my CO2 canisters never arrived, even though it said they were delivered on January 9."" The result was a perfectly adequate email, and subject line that explained all the necessary details. All I did was add in the order number, since I didn't specify that in the original prompt. 




Now this is helpful.

By the way, Soda Stream was very responsive and sent me new canisters right away, no questions asked. All in all, it was a pain-free experience, and now I'm back to drinking carbonated water by the gallon. Half-baked recipe ideasAfter my workday, I put generative AI tools to the test while cooking dinner. Tasty's Botatouille app is a chatbot from the popular recipe app that helps you brainstorm meals and find recipes. At the end of most days when my creativity is tapped, I struggle with making sense of the contents of my fridge, let alone how to cook something. So I started out by asking Botatouille for ideas based on the ingredients I had. In terms of generating meals, Botatouille had some good ideas. One night, I made a soup with kale, white beans, and sausage, and another night, I threw together a stir fry with leftover veggies and chicken. However, Botatouille was better as a jumping off point for finding ideas rather than executing the recipe. I often had to follow up to get the recipe, and even then I ended up reworking it based on my own needs and ideas. I tend to improvise or add my own flair to recipes when cooking anyways (which is why I'm a terrible baker). But that was the extent of its usefulness. One major reason is because Botatouille doesn't save your chat history, so I couldn't go back and revisit ideas. I was also disappointed when looking for recipes using ground beef and shiitake mushrooms, since it kept giving me ideas for other types of meat, which I did not have in my refrigerator. Maybe if you're planning on cooking a meal for a dinner party and going out to buy ingredients, it might be more helpful, but for a hungry person who just wants to eat and relax, the best way to use it is as a brainstorming shortcut. 




Botatouille gave me one recipe idea with ground beef, but the other two used different types of meat.

In conclusion...My week with AI tools was a bit of a mixed bag. Having committed to using them as much as possible throughout my day, there are a few tools I could see myself coming back to and some that don't have the stickiness to earn a spot on my tech roster. I'll likely keep using ChatGPT for planning my workday and summarizing information, and brainstorming headlines. I will also be relying more on Gmail's ""Help me write"" feature for tackling any sort of mindless email-related tasks that just need to get done. But some of the other tools felt a bit redundant or required more effort than they were worth. Otter's AI companion tools didn't save me much time since I felt the need to double-check its responses. With Tasty's Botatouille, I could have just googled recipe ideas or browsed through the app, rather than go through the extra step of writing out a prompt. Ultimately, many of the AI tools for work are geared towards workers in non-creative industries. I could see a project manager or consultant, whose days are jam-packed with meetings and involve lots of logistics and task-juggling, relying on generative AI to catch them up on meetings, put together recaps of strategic conversations, and design proposals and presentations. But, since most of what I do involves teasing words out of the old brainbox, there's only so much ChatGPT and the like can help with, and I'm pretty okay with that.

This is the prediction of a report published on Monday 26 February by Randstad Research on the impact that AI will have on the Spanish labour market after carrying out an analysis based on extrapolations from international methodologies.According to the report, almost 10% of jobs in Spain, equivalent to around two million, are at risk of being automated and will disappear due to the implementation of artificial intelligence. However, the expansion of this technology in business activity will also generate new opportunities over the next decade and create more than 1.6 million new jobs that do not exist today, according to calculations made by Randstad. The net effect on the labour market will, therefore, be the potential loss of some 400,000 jobs.But the positive effect of AI is not only in terms of the new positions; it will also increase productivity in 3.24 million existing jobs, 15.9% of the total, which will in turn boost the Spanish economy. And, no significant adverse effects are expected for three quarters of workers, more than 15.1 million individuals.Logically, the impact that AI penetration will have on different sectors will vary. Some professions will benefit from an increase in jobs, while others will see their share of the labour market decline with the advent of these technologies. Commerce and administrative activities will be the worst affected sectors, as they will experience a reduction in employment of 158,415 and 147,915 jobs respectively over the next decade, followed by hotels and catering and logistics, with losses of 112,770 and 47,440 jobs respectively.In contrast, sectors or activities with a more positive impact on job creation include programming and consultancy; telecommunications; media and publishing; and professional, scientific and technical activities. Finally, there is a group of sectors that will generally experience a limited impact with the arrival of AI, such as agriculture, livestock and fishing; associative activities; extractive industries; and construction.Higher productivityThe greatest increase in productivity with the consolidation of artificial intelligence will also be concentrated in these sectors: programming and consultancy, 40%; insurance, 37%; financial services, 36%; and media and publishing, 33%.Valentín Bote, director of Randstad Research, said that globally 18% of work could be more or less affected by automation and global GDP could increase by 7% as a result of the boost to labour productivity.Low implementationAt present, companies are still in the early stages of adopting artificial intelligence. In Spain, 54.5% of companies said that they still do not use it. The remaining 45.5% that do so use the technology mainly for data analysis (49.2%), optimisation of administrative tasks, or process automation (36.1%).Furthermore, the degree of use differs greatly according to the size of the company: it is still very incipient in small companies, while its degree of use is much more widespread in large companies, which have a greater investment capacity and opportunities for using this type of technology.""It already seems clear that AI will become a technological breakthrough and will eventually change the way work is done and the content of work as it is incorporated by companies,"" Bote added.",,,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/surenglish/', 'https://twitter.com/SUR_English', '']",,,,,en,,,,Employment,Madrid,https://www.surinenglish.com/compromisos-periodisticos.html,"[{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Grupo Vocento', 'logo': 'https://www.vocento.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/09/Logo_Vocento-HD.png', 'url': 'https://www.vocento.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/VocentoSocial/', 'https://twitter.com/Vocento', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/vocento']}]",https://www.surinenglish.com/condiciones-uso.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Age of Uncertainty—and Opportunity: Work in the Age of AI

Abstract
The question of how artificial intelligence will affect jobs, skills, and the future of work is open-ended, and answers have been uncertain and contradictory. As AI has advanced, forecasts of labor market impacts have increasingly emphasized AI’s potential to automate tasks that require skills—including creativity, writing, and social and emotional learning—previously believed to be beyond the technology’s reach. In the face of these advances and the uncertainties they generate, students and incumbent workers should focus on developing balanced skill “portfolios” that support flexibility and adaptation, and policymakers should empower them to do so.

Introduction
In an era defined by rapid technological advancements, artificial intelligence has emerged as a so-called general-purpose technology, akin to the steam engine, electricity, and the transistor, with the potential to reshape all aspects of our economy and lives. Much of AI’s transformative potential is due to recent developments in the field—particularly the rise of generative AI, which can create novel text, images, and audio. According to a recent report published by McKinsey & Company, this new wave of technology could add $2.6–$4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, with an outsized impact in industries such as banking, software and tech, and the life sciences (Chui, Hazan, et al. 2023). According to Goldman Sachs (2023), AI could raise the global gross domestic product (GDP) by 7 percent over 10 years.
Changes of this scale in growth and GDP will likely affect businesses and workers profoundly. The question is what those changes will be and how we can prepare for them. In this report, we review over a decade of research on AI’s potential and actual impacts on employment trends and demand for skills in the labor market. We then explore this research’s implications for skill development and worker training and offer recommendations for workers and policymakers.
As we stand on the threshold of an AI-driven economy, the future of work is at stake. Will work still be an important human activity, or will human labor be rendered surplus to requirements? While machine-based intelligence has loomed over human imagination for centuries, the modern idea of AI emerged in the mid-20th century with the development of digital computers. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, while references to artificial intelligence in popular literature rose sharply in the late 20th century, peaking between 1985 and 1990, mentions of the term in academic literature remained relatively low until 2010. As the topic gained ground in scientific circles, references to it in popular literature also began to climb.
AI’s growing role in the public consciousness coincided with revolutionary change in fields such as image recognition and natural language processing, setting the stage for AI’s prominence in public discourse today (Roser 2022).
Between 2010 and today, AI development can be broken into three major periods. From 2010 to 2016, breakthroughs in neural-network design transformed AI. Powered by these new systems, AI made rapid gains in image recognition and deep learning, especially through models such as AlexNet and AlphaGo, a program that shocked scientists and other observers by defeating a world champion Go player (Albrecht 2023; Google DeepMind n.d.).
AI’s advances in 2016–22 built on earlier development with the introduction of highly influential neural-network models including Google’s Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and OpenAI’s GPT (Albrecht 2023). These models set new benchmarks in natural language processing, helping rapidly improve AI reading comprehension and language understanding, as noted in Figure 3.
The third era, from around 2022 to the present, has featured the maturation of generative AI and the proliferation of generative AI tools for broad public use. In this brief period, tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, DALL·E, Midjourney, and a host of other tools have become widely available, spurring debate about the impacts of AI on work (Chui, Hazan, et al. 2023). Below, we examine the key research voices and trends in each of the three major periods of development outlined above.

  Artificial intelligence creates tremendous opportunities that benefit society. But how does it impact jobs? In this chapter, we take a step back and look at how AI can change our daily lives at work, and how we can best prepare ourselves to make it an ally rather than a threat.Is Artificial Intelligence Human's Ultimate Competitor?It’s nothing new: whenever disruptive technologies appear, changes in the job market follow, as organizations embrace new advances to improve productivity and reduce costs (i.e., acquiring new machines that take over part or all of a task usually performed by humans). One example is sorting fruits and vegetables on a production line to determine whether they are ripe enough to be sold.But how will my job be affected by this transformation?Artificial intelligence is not just about automating tasks. It aims to automate our cognitive abilities, such as perception and decision-making. This raises even more questions about its impact on jobs.With the rise of automation and computerisation, some economists have even argued that work will disappear, as Jeremy Rifkin did back in 1995. These theories have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in recent years with the advent of artificial intelligence. Leading figures such as Elon Musk and Richard Branson have backed the idea of a ""universal"" basic income to counterbalance the potential loss of jobs.So you may be asking yourself if your job will be impacted by this transformation. You are not alone! In 2013, an Oxford University study made the news when it predicted that artificial intelligence could replace nearly half of all jobs within 10 to 20 years. Several years later, this prediction is far from coming true; it has even been revised downward.Since then, the results of other studies have been less definite. The OECD, for example, has analyzed the trend toward automation. The upshot? As highlighted in their 2021 report, economists believe that 14% of jobs face a strong likelihood of being automated over the next two decades, while 32% of jobs could be deeply transformed.While these figures are somewhat less alarming, it’s clear that certain existing roles are already changing. In any case, we should bear in mind that it is very difficult to make precise estimates. It is entirely possible that AI will have a transformative impact beyond expectations. Let’s look at how AI is already changing the world of work!The Future Landscape of JobsAlthough recent studies have been reassuring regarding job losses, some tasks may be automated, even if the job itself remains.Attorneys could use an AI tool to locate legal information without spending hours looking for it. Accountants could use an AI tool to interpret invoices and record them in a software program automatically. Photographers could use AI software to correct all of the slides of a presentation automatically. In all of these examples, AI does not replace the profession; it merely provides a new tool.Artificial intelligence is also a source of job creation, particularly in the IT and digital realms. Although the new “marquee” job of the artificial intelligence revolution is that of a data scientist, many other skills are required to carry out AI projects, such as computer programming, research, and design. Many jobs will be created in this vein, including database administrator, cybersecurity officer, SEO engineer (search engine optimization), and more. This Forbes article mentions some new and enhanced roles AI could create.As we have seen, the driving force behind the AI revolution is data. In order to use this data, it needs to be meticulously collected, cleaned and fine-tuned. By whom? Researcher Antonio A. Casilli talks about ""click workers"", scattered around the world. Often invisible, on the other side of the world, living in precarious conditions, they carry out micro-tasks such as annotating photos or videos, sorting tweets, moderating the content of social platforms, transcribing audio recordings, etc.The Importance of Continuing EducationWhether the arrival of these new technologies does away with your job entirely or fundamentally alters it, there are actions you can take. You are already taking one by taking this course. The key to survival, both today and tomorrow, is lifelong learning. Options will be a matter of government and corporate policy and individual choice. More and more types of training are being offered online (on the OpenClassrooms platform, for example 😊 ), in the classroom, and on the job, with customized learning platforms that allow users to progress at their own pace.Let's Recap!The AI technological revolution has shifted the employment market, with certain jobs disappearing and new ones being created. AI is good at helping us to perform certain tasks, making us quicker, more efficient, and more accurate in our work. Humans need to adapt to these technological changes and ensure that they continue to undertake training throughout their working lives. Now that you have learned more about the challenges and opportunities associated with AI, test your knowledge by answering a few questions!

It has been a year since the launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot that became a global phenomenon overnight, ushering in an era of rapid technological innovation driven by generative AI. The series of AI advancements that followed unlocked a global competition for AI dominance and forced governments, businesses, and consumers to rethink what our world will look like in the era of generative AI.This technology will have a profound impact on the future of work. While generative AI offers great potential to accelerate productivity and innovation, it poses new challenges to business leaders. For instance, how do organizations prepare their workforce for a future where humans and AI work together to make critical decisions and complete complex tasks? How can they adopt generative AI safely across the business? How do they make sure that no one is left behind?Susan CharnauxSocial Links NavigationChief People Officer at Appian.Business leaders and front-line workers have different views of AIOne concern related to generative AI is that it will create new knowledge divides within organizations. Recent data from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggests that these divisions are most conspicuous at the hierarchical layers of the business. According to the research, 80% of leaders use generative AI regularly, versus just 20% of frontline employees. Business leaders also tend to be more optimistic about the potential of the technology, with 62% of senior decision-makers expressing this sentiment compared to 42% of frontline employees.These disparities in attitudes towards AI could align with people's understanding of the technology. The research indicates that 44% of leaders have received training on generative AI to sharpen their skills and stay relevant, while only 14% of frontline employees have received similar training. Familiarity with the technology, or lack thereof, seems to be causing further ruptures across the different generations within the workforce. Organizations must act quickly to bridge the generational divide.LATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar

Generational differences in AI use in the workplace are another area of concern, with research showing that over half of workers above 35 are not using AI in the workplace, while 71% of younger employees are utilizing these tools. This could create a rift between generations, leaving behind older workers who don’t have a good grasp of the technology. However, one of the most transformative attributes of generative AI is that it is very user-friendly, meaning new users can easily learn to work with the technology and use it to enhance their productivity and performance.Earlier this year, researchers from Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) conducted the world’s first large-scale empirical study of the impact of generative AI on workers. The data showed that lower-skilled workers saw the biggest increase in productivity because of generative AI. This early data on the impact of the technology indicates that generative AI offers huge opportunities for organizations to improve productivity and level the playing field for all employees by freeing up more time for them to focus on more meaningful work. But to benefit from this, businesses must act quickly to bridge the AI divide and equip all employees with the right skills to make the most of generative AI.Building a safe AI environment and fostering an AI-friendly cultureTo realize the full benefits of generative AI, business leaders must empower everyone within their workforce to use the technology safely and effectively. This means building a culture of knowledge, understanding and responsibility towards AI. Before rolling out formal training, businesses should consider how they can protect their intellectual property and their employees from the risks associated with generative AI.Are you a pro?

To mitigate those risks, organizations should consider a private AI model, which means all the data, AI algorithms, and IT infrastructure are fully controlled within the business.In this scenario, AI models are trained exclusively on data the organization owns or has access to. Training data in a private AI environment allows the organization to gain more control over the data and the outcome. By going private, AI models remain with the organization. Therefore, unique algorithms and trade secrets remain protected for competitive advantage. This approach creates a safer environment where employees can use generative AI without exposing their organization to security risks. Most importantly, this protects data privacy of employees, customers, and business partners.Once you have created a safe AI environment, it is essential to establish clear policies and guidelines for its use across the business and roll out a comprehensive training program that touches every part of your organization, tailored to different technical skills and levels of experience. This strategy will enable you to empower your workforce to make the most of AI and create an AI-friendly culture that nurtures a deeper understanding of the technology and an exponential increase of its benefits for the business.We've featured the best online collaboration tool.This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Every technology introduces paradoxes. But AI seems to have more than its share — it giveth, it taketh away — all at once. Of course, this makes it harder and more confusing for business and IT leaders to make decisions on AI in their organizations, especially since it involves considerable budgets, convincing everyone, and shifting of resources.


Here are some prominent AI paradoxes:

1. AI reduces labor requirements. AI increases skill requirements. Putting together AI-driven capabilities requires skills to do so — and this is one of its greatest challenges. For example, AI replaces tasks formerly performed by humans, with 62% of respondents to a Rackspace Technology survey saying that it has led to reduced headcounts within their organization. At the same time, the issue or obstacle most often faced is a shortage of skilled talent to make AI happen, cited by 67%.

2. AI is complicated to develop and deploy. AI makes it easier to develop and deploy applications. The people seeing the most benefits from AI technologies to date are technologists themselves — automating their operations and quality assurance, enabling faster application development, greater network optimization, and eliminating manual task work. artificial intelligence, a survey from IBM’s Watson Group finds.

PROMOTED
3. AI is expensive to implement. AI helps manage and reduce IT costs. For example, the rising practice of FinOps — which encourages intelligently controlling technology spending — may benefit from AI and machine learning, an analysis out of the FinOps Foundation predicts. At the same time, FinOps and other cost mitigation efforts may be needed to manage and build AI capabilities.
4. AI automates and mechanizes work. AI demands greater creativity in work. Authors of the future jobs report out of the World Economic Forum estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted in the next five years, and cognitive skills are reported to be growing in importance most quickly, “reflecting the increasing importance of complex problem-solving in the workplace.”

5. AI won’t help companies that really, really need it the most. There’s a tendency to assume by taking the latest and greatest technology, dropping tons of money on solutions and associated consulting, and, presto! Miraculous growth and happy customers overnight. The slow and inefficient organizations that would benefit the most from AI are less like to embrace it in a productive way. The organizations with forward-looking cultures that would succeed without AI are its biggest proponents.

6. AI requires huge data sets. AI can alleviate data management requirements. AI requires the highest-quality data. AI can assure greater data quality. While AI is a data resource hog, it can be instrumental in identifying and preparing the data needed for analytics-driven systems.
7. AI brings incredible intelligence, but is really dumb. AI may be able to crack quantum physics, but cannot be taught the simplest of tasks. This is Moravec's paradox, coined by Hans Peter Moravec of Carnegie-Mellon University, who observed that ""it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.”
AI is extremely promising technology for many business problems and opportunities. But the trade-offs are interesting — and will certainly perplex us for some time to come.

Despite the broad range of artificial intelligence technologies and the flurry of new laws regulating them, virtually all laws regulating how these technologies process data follow the same basic framework.
This means employers can follow a relatively straightforward checklist around the world to work through the major data protection issues.
This Insight walks through the checklist and identifies significant variations between regions and countries.





As employment-related artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools proliferate, multinational employers feel increasing pressure to deploy AI across their global offices.  These tools can provide great value and efficiency across the employment life cycle.  For example, recruiters request AI screening services that can save them days of time by quickly reviewing thousands of applications.  Business partners want performance-monitoring tools that can save time on supervision. Employees may insist on generative AI tools to help them create reports, presentations, and trainings. The HR Department might request a chatbot that can answer common workforce questions.  The list of requests may go on and on.
At the same time, the compliance challenge of rolling out AI tools in global offices may seem overwhelming.  AI tools implicate a myriad of legal concerns in the workplace—including labor, discrimination, intellectual property, and data protection. Not only does every country have its own laws in these areas, but legislatures are rapidly developing laws specific to AI.  The good news for multinational employers is that the laws with the most comprehensive restrictions on AI—data protection laws—follow a similar framework all over the world.  As a result, multinational employers can follow a relatively straightforward checklist to work through the major data protection issues.  This checklist may assist employers in creating a global data protection framework for their AI programs, which they can then vary as needed by jurisdiction.
Overview of the Legal Framework Regulating AI Tools
Most countries have data protection laws that comprehensively regulate the use of personal data, and these laws apply to the use of personal data by AI tools and the use of automated decision-making tools.  One of the most prominent of these laws is the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union (“GDPR”),1 but virtually every major trading partner of the United States has a data protection law. These countries include: our neighbors, Canada and Mexico; global powerhouses, such as Brazil, China, the European Economic Area, India, Japan, and the UK; as well as many smaller economies. Increasingly, data protection laws include provisions that govern AI or automated decision-making.  Moreover, new laws specific to AI build on the framework of the existing data protection laws.
While the United States lacks a comprehensive data protection law at the federal level, a complex patchwork of privacy and data security laws throughout the United States collectively add up to protections similar to a comprehensive data protection law. Additionally, more than one quarter of all states have adopted comprehensive data protection laws that layer on top of the existing laws. For now, at least, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, (collectively, the “CCPA”) is the only such law that applies to the data of applicants, employees, independent contractors and others in a human resources relationship to a company (“HR data”).2 In addition, a growing body of legislation specifically regulates AI.
Despite this complexity, virtually all data protection laws follow the same basic framework.  This provides employers with a checklist of issues to consider. Although there are other elements of these laws, key items for employers to evaluate are the following:

Legal basis for processing
Notice
Proportionality and data protection impact assessments
Cross-border data transfer restrictions
Data-related rights
Data minimization and retention
Accuracy
Data security
Contracting

This article will explore each of these items in more depth and discuss some of the variations between countries.

Legal Basis for Processing Data

Before considering how to implement a particular AI tool, employers should first consider whether there is a legal basis for collecting and processing the information. Most data protection laws around the world permit the collection and processing of personal data only on limited grounds, such as the individual’s consent or as required by law. In those countries, an employer may only process data if there is a legal basis for doing so. In other words, in reverse of the United States – where an employer can use personal data for any purpose as long as it is not explicitly prohibited – in most countries, an employer cannot use personal data unless an explicitly permitted legal basis applies.  Typical legal bases for processing personal data in the employment context are consent, performance of a contract, legitimate interest of the company, and compliance with a legal requirement.3
Many countries rely heavily on an individual’s consent for the legal basis. At one extreme, in South Korea, employers must obtain separate consents to use personal data, to use certain categories of sensitive personal data, to disclose personal data to a third party, and to transfer personal data to another country.4 At the other extreme, a growing number of countries permit data processing on the looser concept of the employer’s legitimate interests. Some countries, like European Union (EU) Member States, strongly disfavor reliance on consent as a lawful basis for processing in the employment context.
Publicly Available Data
The issue of legal basis poses a particular hurdle when publicly available personal data is scraped from the internet.  For example, a popular subset of AI tools gathers information about people on the internet – LinkedIn profiles, professional bio web pages, and the like – to identify potential candidates for recruiters or headhunters to contact for hard-to-fill jobs.  In principle, a tool like this might collect information about thousands of individuals.
In countries that generally rely on consent as the legal basis for processing, gathering information about hundreds of candidates from publicly available information online might be impractical due to the difficulty of obtaining consent from each individual. Other countries, such as Brazil, the UK, and members of the EEA, permit data processing based on the company's ""legitimate interests"" to the extent that the individual's rights and freedoms do not outweigh the company's legitimate interests.5 
Whether a company can rely on the basis of its “legitimate” interests may be quite dependent on context.  For public profiles in professional social networks, the balancing of interests generally should favor the employer, particularly where the profile demonstrates the individual’s interest in finding a job. However, where the individual clearly did not post the profile for potential employers, where the terms of use prohibit scraping, and other factors indicate that the individual did not intend for the profile to be used to evaluate them for employment, then the balance of interests most likely weighs against the employer. Consequently, before implementing AI tools that rely heavily on information scraped from the Internet, global employers should conduct sufficient due diligence to assess the risk of whether the data may not have been collected in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
Privately Available Data
The question of legal basis also raises challenges when collecting personal data in other contexts.  For example, an employer may have a legitimate interest in collecting personal data about employees’ activity on the company’s computer system so that an AI tool can analyze it for productivity.  However, as noted above, legitimate interest typically must be weighed against the privacy rights of the individual.  This includes considering not only the information that will be collected, but the method of collecting the data.  For example, a German court held that an employer’s legitimate interest in monitoring employees through the use of keylogger software was outweighed by the employees’ privacy rights.  The court found that the use of keylogger software, which records all keystrokes on a work computer to covertly monitor and control employees, requires a suspicion of a criminal offense or other serious breach of duty based on concrete facts.6
In principle, the employee’s consent could be an alternative to legitimate interest as the legal basis for collecting surveillance data about employees. Most data protection laws permit the processing of personal data based on consent.  However, in the EEA, Brazil, and the UK, at least, consent generally will not be a feasible alternative in the employment context. In those countries, authorities take the position that employees, and in some cases even applicants, generally cannot “freely give” consent for data processing due to the imbalance of power between employees and employers.
Data Collection Restrictions in the United States and Elsewhere 
As noted above, U.S. data protection law by and large has not adopted the concept of a legal basis for processing personal data.  Instead, the common law in many states protects personal information in which individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Collecting information that invades this reasonable expectation, such as surreptitious video recording in private offices, may amount to a tort under the common law. In addition, various U.S. laws require consent to collect sensitive information such as audio recordings, biometric data, and location data.  Other U.S. laws prohibit the collection of certain information about applicants and employees except in very limited situations, for example, health and genetic data.
Similarly, other countries have laws separate from their national data protection laws that limit the collection of information.  For example, many states in Australia have surveillance laws specific to the workplace that limit the types of information that may be collected.7
Key Factors to Consider in Data Collection
As this brief discussion illustrates, the question of whether an employer has a legal basis to collect personal data and process it with AI generally will depend on four factors:

The type of personal data and the employee’s privacy interests in that data;
Where the information is collected and processed, including whether the data is publicly available;
The context of collection and processing, including the invasiveness of the technology; and
The purposes of use. 

Considering whether the employer has a legal basis for collection and use of personal data should be the first step in assessing how to use an AI tool because the analysis may show that the employer simply cannot collect and/or process the necessary personal data in some jurisdictions.

Notice

After a company has determined that it can legally collect and use personal information, it must consider how it will provide notice to individuals about the practices. Virtually all data protection laws require a company to provide a notice regarding how it processes personal data. Most statutes require that the notices include what data is processed, the purposes of using the personal data, the parties to which the data is disclosed, and information about how to exercise data rights.  Other required disclosures may include the legal basis for using the personal data, details about data transfers to other countries, and contact information for the company’s data protection officer.
Notice in Existing Data Protection Laws
Increasingly, data protection laws require additional disclosures in certain circumstances about how artificial intelligence will process personal data.  Since it became effective in mid-2018, the GDPR has required notice if the data controller makes decisions solely based on automated processing that “produces legal effects” or “similarly significantly affects” the individual. This likely includes most employment decisions based solely on automated processing.8 In that case, the notice must describe the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the individual.
Additional Notice Requirements in New AI Laws
The EU’s upcoming AI Act supplements the GDPR’s notice requirement for AI tools that operate as biometric categorization systems and emotional recognition systems.9 Although the meaning of this latter term is not yet entirely clear, it potentially could encompass some of the new AI tools that attempt to gauge the emotional state of employees, for example, the emotional state of a call center employee based on analyzing their behavior during calls.
U.S. regulatory agencies and new U.S. laws have progressed in a similar vein.  For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) has recommended that employers using AI tools provide notice at least about which traits or characteristics the tool is designed to measure, the methods by which those traits or characteristics are to be measured, and the disabilities, if any, that potentially might lower the assessment results or cause the individual to be screened out.10
New York City’s groundbreaking law on using artificial intelligence to assess employees and candidates requires that companies subject to the law provide notices explaining that the company will use automated employment decision tools in connection with the assessment or evaluation of such employee or candidate and the job qualifications and characteristics used in the assessment.11
The EU and the United States are at the forefront in passing laws specific to AI.  However, many countries have proposed such legislation.  For example, under Brazil’s LGPD, notice to individuals should include the data subject’s right to request the review of fully automated decisions.12 Brazil’s proposed AI Law goes further, requiring that notice to individuals include a statement that AI will be used and an explanation of the individuals’ rights.13 These rights would include the right to an explanation of the AI’s decision, the right to contest the decision, the right to information about the participation of a human in the decision, and the right to request correction of discriminatory biases.
Given these trends, we expect that many jurisdictions will pass laws requiring notice to individuals stating at least that the employer uses an artificial intelligence tool and, most likely, the purposes of use, the traits assessed by the tool, and some explanation of the methods used by the tool. Global employers, therefore, will need to check for new AI-specific notice requirements that supplement the general requirements of applicable data protection laws before implementing AI tools for purposes of human resources administration.

Proportionality and Data Protection Impact Assessments

Data protection laws generally require that data controllers process personal data in a proportionate manner by balancing the controller’s interests against risks to the individual.  To reduce these risks, most data protection laws require a formalized data protection impact assessment (“DPIA”) for high-risk forms of data processing.
Due to the potential impact on an individual’s livelihood, using AI to assess applicants or employees most likely requires a DPIA under data protection laws.  However, existing data protection laws can be ambiguous as to whether they require a DPIA because the criteria to determine whether a DPIA is legally required depends on a list of factors. In apparent response to this ambiguity, a growing number of AI laws and proposed legislation would explicitly mandate DPIAs for AI used in the HR context.
In particular, the EU’s upcoming AI law builds on the GDPR by requiring an employer to conduct the GDPR’s DPIA when using an AI system to process personal data to recruit or select employees, to make decisions about hiring, termination, and task allocation, or to monitor and evaluate workers.14 Brazil’s proposed AI Law would take a similar approach.  Like the GDPR, Brazil’s general data protection law, the LGPD, requires DPIAs in certain high-risk scenarios. Brazil’s proposed AI Law classifies the use of AI for selection of candidates and employment as high-risk. Accordingly, the proposed law requires a type of DPIA, as well as detailed documentation regarding the functioning of the system and the decisions involved in its construction, implementation and use.15 In the United States, an early draft of regulations for the California Consumer Privacy Act would require a risk assessment covering almost 50 factors if the employer uses “Automated Decision-Making Technology” to make decisions about applicants, employees, or independent contractors.16
China has taken a particularly protective approach. China’s Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”) requires that a personal information handler conduct a personal information protection impact assessment prior to using personal information to conduct automated decision-making and record the handling activities. The PIPL defines “automated decision-making” as the activity of using computer programs to automatically analyze or assess personal behaviors, habits, interests, or hobbies, or financial, health, credit, or other status, and making decisions thereupon. The requirement for such an assessment also applies under other circumstances mentioned under the PIPL, such as handling sensitive personal information or transferring personal information abroad. The assessment must address items including: whether the purposes and methods of the handling are lawful, legitimate, and necessary; the impact on the data subjects’ rights and interests, security risks; and whether the protective measures undertaken are lawful, effective, and appropriate based on the degree of risk.17
Accordingly, before implementing a new AI tool in the workplace, multinational employers should consider whether they must conduct a DPIA. Increasingly, the answer will be “yes,” and the employer should ensure that the DPIA considers the factors prescribed in all relevant jurisdictions.  Even when a DPIA is not legally required, global employers still should consider some type of evaluation of the risks of implementing the AI tool in the HR context. Identifying risks in advance of implementation will allow the company also to consider how to mitigate those risks and whether the mitigation measures reduce the risks to a level that is tolerable for the particular employer.

Cross-border data transfer restrictions

Most data protection laws prohibit the transfer of personal data to another country except in limited circumstances. This poses a hurdle to multinational employers because, if they centralize their HR processes in one office, then handling HR data involves transferring personal data across national borders.  For example, if an employer uses an AI tool that operates on a service provider’s server located in the United States to evaluate applications from applicants in another country, the applicants’ personal data most likely would cross international borders in the process of the AI review. 
Consent Required
Many jurisdictions require consent from the individual for cross-border data transfers.  Depending on the context, obtaining consent can be impractical, but, increasingly, countries permit cross-border data transfers without consent if the sending and receiving legal entities sign data transfer agreements that apply protections equivalent to the origin countries’ data protection laws.
EU, UK, Brazil, and China: Other Mechanisms
Conversely, in China, the EU, the UK, and likely Brazil, employers effectively cannot rely on consent for data transfers, at least in the employment context. The EU offers several options for data transfers, including model data transfer contracts, binding corporate rules, and, with respect to transfers to the United States, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Brazil’s National Authority for Data Protection is in the process of developing standard contractual clauses modules, which will be required for cross-border transfers, as no other country has yet been named as providing adequate data protection and consent can be impractical or risky. China’s current data protection legal framework makes it a burdensome exercise on the part of the personal data exporter to essentially seek government approval by filing a number of materials in order to transfer personal data outside of China.18
The United States is quite unusual in that it does not impose restrictions on transferring personal data to other countries. There are export controls on certain types of technology, but not on personal data per se.
In sum, multinationals that use centralized AI tools or otherwise transfer personal data across national borders may need a compliance strategy involving consent in many countries, as well as intra-company data transfer agreements compliant with multiple laws, and filings with some local governments. If the multinational employer already has implemented a cross-border data transfer strategy for other types of HR related activity, the cross-border transfer of personal data for use in centralized AI tool could be “wrapped into” this broader data transfer solution.

Data-Related Rights

Data protection laws invariably provide some form of data rights.  These include rights applicable to all data processing, as well as rights specific to automated decision-making and other forms of AI.  Global employers need to be aware of these rights, so they can be prepared for rights requests in relation to their use of AI tools.
General Data Rights Relevant to AI
The traditional data rights particularly relevant to AI are the right to know how data is processed, the right to object, the right to delete, and the right to revoke consent, where the company processes personal data on the basis of consent.  For example, in the EEA, employees generally have a right to demand that the employer stop processing their personal data for purposes of monitoring their performance or for surveillance, unless the employer demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.19
Automated Decision-making Rights in Existing Data Protection Laws
In addition, many data protection laws have, for years, included rights specific to automated decision-making.  These typically include rights to object to automated decision-making, to request human intervention, and to receive information about how the automated decision-making works.  For example, the GDPR provides, in effect, a right not to be subject to an employment decision based solely on automated processing.20 The Philippines data protection law grants a right to request information about automated processes that form the sole basis for any decision “significantly affecting” the individual.21 In close parallel, when Chinese individuals consider the automated decision-making to have a significant impact on their interests, they are entitled to request that the data handler explain the situation, and the individual has the right to refuse the use of these automated means.22  
Rights in New AI-Specific Laws
New AI-specific laws have followed these approaches.  In the United States, NYC’s AI Ordinance provides employment candidates or employees the right to obtain information on the data collected, data source, and data retention policy. The ordinance also provides candidates with the right to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.23 Outside the United States, South Korea has amended its data protection law to give individuals a right to reject entirely automated decisions that materially affect the rights of the individual.24  This likely includes many entirely automated decisions about employment.  Further, South Koreans will have a right to obtain an explanation about a decision made through automated means.  Many jurisdictions have proposed similar legislation.
Workers’ Collective Rights, Including Works Councils
Although not precisely a data right, workers’ organizations may have rights to notice or approval about data processing of the employees represented by them.  In particular, in the EU, employees in some countries have a right to create works councils at their employer.25 These works councils have rights to information, consultation with management and depending on the country, the employer may need works councils’ consent to implement new monitoring and technical systems.  This may mean that an employer must provide prior notice to, or reach agreement with, a works council before the employer can start implementing an AI system since otherwise the works council could try to take legal action to block implementation. Further, in many countries, unions may obtain contractual rights, via collective bargaining agreements, to review or approve AI tools in the workplace. Indeed, issues surrounding the use of AI were integral to resolution of disputes between U.S. production companies and both screenwriters and actors.

Data Minimization and Retention

Virtually all comprehensive data protection laws adopt data minimization principles on the front end and the back end of the data life cycle.26  These principles require that data controllers collect only the minimum personal data necessary to achieve the purpose for which the personal data was collected.  Once that purpose has been accomplished, the personal data generally must be permanently deleted subject to any legal obligation to retain the personal data for a longer period.
While these principles can be stated simply, they generally are difficult to apply, in practice, especially in the context of AI tools used for HR administration purposes.  In many circumstances, AI tools function more effectively as the volume of information, including personal data, in the underlying database (a/k/a large learning model) increases.  While the data minimization principle does allow for the data controller to exercise discretion in evaluating the business necessity for collecting personal data, that principle likewise imposes an obligation on data controllers not to over-collect personal data.  Consequently, when evaluating the use of AI tools for HR purposes, employers must carefully consider both the necessity of specific data inputs as well as the relevance to the employer’s business purposes of the AI tool’s outputs. 
After the AI tool has been used to process personal data, employers will have to balance multiple considerations in determining how long to retain both the input personal data and output personal data.  On the side favoring data retention, employers may wish to retain both input and output data to assess the consistency, accuracy, and possibly biases of the AI tool over time.  In addition, retaining this data may help the employer defend itself against claims of disparate impact against minority groups.  
On the side favoring prompt data destruction, retaining the personal data of any one individual longer than needed to assess that individual may violate the proportionality principles in data protection laws.  Also, keeping data generally heightens data security risks simply because the possibility of a security incident increases over time.  Finally, retaining data may increase the cost and administrative burden of responding to individuals’ requests to exercise their rights to access, correct, or delete personal data maintained about them by the company because the company likely will need to search for data in more storage locations and, with respect to an access request, manage the production of a larger quantity of personal data. 
Moreover, the balance of risks in retaining personal data versus destroying it may vary by jurisdiction. Consequently, the employer may decide to set different retention periods by country or region.
Finally, employers should not lose sight when evaluating whether to use an AI tool in the first place of the potential, practical challenges of permanently purging personal data once the purpose of collection has been accomplished.  For example, many large language models appear to have been built on the premise that personal data may be stored in them indefinitely. Consequently, the practical challenges of removing specific data points from such models may be insurmountable, creating risk for the organization.  While outputs may be easier to isolate and purge, if the employer allows the outputs of AI tools to be proliferated across numerous storage locations (e.g., e-mail, local hard drives, centralized human resources information systems), the practical challenges of purging those outputs could become daunting.  Nonetheless, with some inquiry early in the implementation process and advance planning, employers should be able to mitigate the risks of over-collection and the practical challenges of permanent deletion.

Accuracy

Data protection laws generally impose an obligation to ensure that personal data is accurate and kept up to date where necessary.  As a practical matter, this means that both personal data entering into an AI tool and the personal data output must be accurate.  Regarding input data, ensuring accurate personal data may not pose challenges particular to AI if the employer provides the input data, but some AI tools may provide their own input data, for example, scraping it from publicly available sources.  Employers usually have an obligation to make sure this data is accurate too but effectively have limited means for doing so.  As a result, employers should evaluate the risk that AI tools which process publicly available data may not comply with the accuracy requirement contained in many data protection laws.
Ensuring the accuracy of the output data can be even more difficult because the algorithms and processes used by the AI tool may be hard to understand.  Moreover, to protect their methods from competitors, AI vendors may not provide full information about these algorithms and processes.  Inaccuracy and bias can lead to some of the biggest risks of using AI tools, for example, unlawful discrimination.

Data Security 

With few exceptions, data protection laws require reasonable safeguards for personal data, but generally do not spell out precisely what those safeguards entail.  Typically, data protection laws clarify that safeguards must include: (a) technical measures, e.g., passwords, firewalls, etc.; (b) administrative measures, e.g., policies, procedures, and training; and (c) physical measures, e.g., locked doors, security guards, etc. Beyond this, employers must look to regulatory guidance and industry standards. 
A growing international consensus lays out basic standards, for example, the 27001 cybersecurity standards published by the International Organization for Standardization and the recommended technical and organizational measures for AI systems published by the German Data Protection Commission.  However, authorities emphasize that companies should conduct risk assessments specific to their systems and threats to develop reasonable safeguards for their circumstances.

Contracting 

Finally, employers cannot outsource their responsibilities for compliance with data protection laws.  As the data controller, the employer remains responsible for the personal data of its applicants and workers processed on its behalf by vendors.  This is a key issue for employers because employers typically use AI tools provided by third-party service providers who process personal data on their own servers (“Software as a Service” or “SaaS”) rather than purchasing licensed software and running it on the employer’s own information systems.
Virtually all data protection laws require that the data controller obtain some contractual assurances from these vendors.  At minimum, the contractual assurances include the requirement that the vendor provide reasonable safeguards for the data. Increasingly, data protection laws specify detailed vendor contract provisions. The GDPR’s Article 28, for example requires about a dozen points in data processor contracts, including that the data processor only process personal data on the controller’s documented instructions and impose the same data protection obligations that apply to the vendor on any sub-processor.27  The California Privacy Rights Act requires a similar number of provisions, many of which are quite distinct from the GDPR.28  In addition, as discussed above in the cross-border data transfers section, if the vendor stores personal data in a country, other than where the applicant or employee is located, the employer may be required to include country-specific data transfer provisions in the contract.
Finally, employers should consider including supplemental language to protect their interests. These might include, for example, indemnification provisions, mitigation and reporting provisions for data breaches, and requirements for accurate representations about how the AI works so that the employer can meet its obligations to provide notice. 
Practical Implications and Takeaways
This article provides a checklist of key data protection points to consider in adopting AI tools across multiple countries. Of course, the real challenge is developing a compliance program for AI that works in practice across multiple jurisdictions.  This requires thinking through the data protection implications at each step of the process.  In rough chronological order, this likely will include:

Vendor vetting;
Conducting DPIAs and determining feasible jurisdictions for deployment;
Vendor contracting;
Implementing policies to address risks, such as accuracy, and compliance steps, such as responding to data rights requests;
Distributing notices, obtaining consent, and communicating with the workforce;
Handling requests to exercise data rights; and
Retention and disposal of personal data.

In this process, employers can use the basic data protection framework as a guide and then adapt as needed to local variations.

Nearly half of employees in the United States aren't using artificial intelligence at work, according to a new report, while leadership takes the initiative in utilising the developing tech.
Findings from The Quantum Workplace found that 49% have never used AI to help them with their job. According to the report, 17% said they only used it a ""few times."" Others said:

Daily (8%)
Weekly (12%)
Monthly (9%)
Quarterly (5%)

Usage of AI was mostly focused on higher-level positions, the report noted, which found that directors had the highest number of AI users in the workforce with 41%. For other positions:










Executive (37%)
Manager (23%)
Individual contributor (20%)

Confidence in AI strategy
The findings come as only 25% of employees are confident in their organisation's AI strategy, with leadership more confident than other employees. By position, agreement rates showed:

Executive (29%)
Director (29%)
Manager (20%)
Individual contributor (26%)

""Most employees, including executives, are not confident in their organisation's strategy for implementing new technologies like AI. This is not surprising,"" said lead researcher Shane McFeely in a statement.
Employers have long been encouraged to develop robust frameworks to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI in workplaces.
""Organisations must leverage the competitive benefits of AI while mitigating current and future risks,"" McFeely said.
Offering AI-related training
Despite the relatively low usage of AI in workplaces, the report found that 45% of employees want more training about AI in the workplaces.

This comes as 35% said AI will ""significantly change the nature"" of their job in the next five years.
McFeely agreed that nothing has the potential to impact the workplace more than AI.
""Though adoption is not yet widespread, it is predicted that AI will replace some jobs and make others more productive,"" he said. ""AI has the potential to automate tedious tasks and free employees for critical thinking and creativity.""
The problem with training, however, is that only 16% said their manager encourages the use of AI at work.
""Leaders should foster an open culture of learning and innovation while providing guidelines on strategic AI use,"" McFeely said. ""Because of this, HR needs to be at the forefront of your organisation's AI strategy.""









The Quantum Workplace's findings were sourced from ""one of the largest databases on employee experience"" in the US, which included over 700,000 voices from more than 8,000 organisations.

In this article:Learn why America needs an Artificial Intelligence-ready workforceFind AI learning and workforce training opportunities




America needs an AI-ready workforce. The U.S. government supports thousands of AI learning and training opportunities across the country.




An artificial intelligence (AI)-ready workforce is essential for the United States to fully realize AI’s potential to advance scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security. In 2023, the White House released the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence(link is external) (“AI EO”) to harness the power of AI for good while mitigating its substantial risks. The EO calls for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in coordination with the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), to ""establish(link is external) a pilot program to enhance existing successful training programs for scientists, with the goal of training 500 new researchers by 2025 capable of meeting the rising demand for AI talent.”




DOE has been preparing future scientists to be AI research leaders by leveraging decades of sustained R&D investments in high-performance computing (HPC) that have led to significant advances in both fundamental studies and world-leading supercomputing tools. By planting the seeds of curiosity through discovery learning, over the decades, DOE national laboratories have introduced basic AI concepts and skills to hundreds of thousands of students and educators at all levels. Training programs at DOE national laboratories deliver opportunities for best-in-class hands-on research experiences, including through access to leading AI research expertise, world-class supercomputing facilities, and a science-driven approach. These training opportunities complement AI education and training offered through other pathways, such as AI education and training supported by both DOE and NSF at institutions of higher education and various other settings for learning.











The unparalleled research and innovation environment at DOE national laboratories attracts talent from all over the world to strengthen America's AI workforce. DOE will continue its investments in a highly skilled talent pool - encompassing K-12 educators and students, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty and professionals looking to add to their skillsets - to grow and sustain America's AI-ready workforce of tomorrow.




NSF is supporting the development of an AI-ready workforce through the creation of educational tools, materials, fellowships, and curricula to enhance learning and foster training opportunities open to all communities. NSF-funded efforts reach across the country, from K-12 classrooms to experiential learning opportunities at the undergraduate and graduate levels to workforce development efforts in community colleges, building AI skills and understanding at all levels needed to responsibly harness the opportunities of AI for scientific discovery and other critical societal challenges. 











NSF’s AI training and education programs support AI research experiences for undergraduates, seasonal internships, and full-time graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. Through its Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, NSF has built a nationwide ecosystem of advanced computing and data capabilities alongside training programs that empower researchers to use those systems. In addition, NSF supports AI and data science training programs at the regional level, including with community colleges, minority serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities.   




By 2025, the education and workforce opportunities provided by the DOE and NSF pilot program will add to the national AI workforce by training more than 500 new researchers at all career stages in a variety of critical basic research and enabling technology development areas.




DOE, in coordination with NSF, is creating a vibrant training and workforce ecosystem by advancing secure, trustworthy, and equitable AI for all Americans. This web portal highlights a non-exhaustive collection of DOE and NSF AI education, training, and workforce opportunities. This is a part of a larger effort to increase connectivity between government-supported AI learning and training programs and elevate the accessibility of these opportunities to people interested in accruing AI knowledge and skills.

While the age of sentient robot assistants isn't quite here yet, AI is fast making a bid to be your next co-worker. More than half of U.S. workers are now using some form of AI in their jobs. According to an international survey of 5,000 employees by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), around 80 percent of AI users reported that AI had improved their performance at work, largely pointing to increased automation. For some, the ethical integration of AI is the top workplace concern of 2024. But while proponents note how much potential there is for AI technologies to improve and streamline more equitable workplaces — and there's probably examples of AI already at play in your job, as well — that doesn't mean we should all rush to bring AI into our work.

That same OECD survey also documented continued fear of job loss and wage decrease as AI digs its heels deeper into the employment landscape. A different survey of U.S. workers by CNBC and SurveyMonkey reported 42 percent of employees were concerned about AI's impact on their job, skewing higher for those with lower incomes and for workers of color. And with the rise of AI-based scams, ongoing debate over government regulation, and worries about online privacy (not to mention the sheer over-saturation of ""new"" AI releases), there's still a lot of unknowns when it comes to AI's future. It's best to tread into the world of AI at work with a bit of trepidation — or at least with some questions in your back pocket. What kind of AI are we talking about, exactly?First step: Familiarize yourself with artificial intelligence at large. As the term has grown in popular use, ""Artificial Intelligence"" has evolved into a catchall phrase referring more to a variety of technologies and services than a specific noun. Mashable's Cecily Mauran defines artificial intelligence as a ""blanket term for technology that can automate or execute certain tasks designed by a human."" She notes that what many are now referring to as AI is actually something more specific, known as generative AI or artificial general intelligence. Generative AI, Mauran explains, is able to ""create text, images, video, audio, and code based on prompts from a user."" This use has recently come under fire for producing hallucinations (or made up facts), spreading misinformation, and facilitating scams and deep fakes.

4 ways AI can boost your productivity at work



Other forms of AI include simple recommendation algorithms, more complex algorithms known as neural networks, and broader machine learning. As Saira Meuller reports for Mashable, AI has already integrated itself into the workplace (and your life) in a multitude of ways, including Gmail's predictive features, LinkedIn's recommendation system, and Microsoft 's range of Office tools. Things as simple as live transcripts or captions turned on during video meetings rely on AI. You could also encounter it in the form of algorithms that facilitate data gathering, within voice assistants on your personal devices or office software, or even as machine learning that offers spelling suggestions or language translations.Does your company have an AI policy?Once you've established that the AI tool falls outside of a use case already employed in your day-to-day work, and thus might need some further oversight, it's time to reach out to management. Better safe than sorry! Your company will hopefully have guidelines in place for exactly what kind of AI services can be pulled into your work and how they should be used, but there's a high chance it won't — a 2023 survey from The Conference Board found that three-quarters of companies still lacked organizational AI policy. If there are no rules, get clarity from your manager, and potentially even legal or human resources teams, depending on what tech you're using. Only use generative AI tools pre-approved by your place of work. In a global survey of workers by business management platform Salesforce, 28 percent of workers said they were incorporating generative AI tools in their work, but only 30 percent had received any training on using the tool appropriately and ethically. A startling 64 percent of the 7,000 workers reported passing off generative AI work as their own.

Based on the response rate of unsupervised use, the survey team recommended that employees only use company-approved generative AI tools and programs, and that they never use confidential company data or personally identifiable customer data in prompts for generative AI.Even big companies like Apple and Google have banned generative AI use in the past. Things to consider before using a generative AI tool:Data privacy. If you are using generative AI, what kind of information are you plugging into the tool, such as a chatbot or other LLM? Is this information sensitive to individuals you work with or proprietary to your work? Is the data encrypted or protected in any way when it is used by the AI?Copyright issues. If you are using a generative AI system to design creative concepts, where is the tech sourcing the artistic data needed to train its model? Do you have a legal right to use the images, video, or audio the AI generates? Accuracy. Have you fact-checked the information provided by the AI tool or spotted any hallucinations? Does the tech have a reputation for inaccuracy?

Who would the AI serve?It's also important to distinguish where AI fits in your daily work-flow, and who will be interacting with any generative AI outputs. There is a difference between incorporating AI tools like chatbots or assistants within your own daily tasks, and replacing an entire job task with it. Who will be affected by your use of AI, and could it be a risk to you or your clients? The disclosure of AI use is a question even law firms lack clear answers to, but a majority of Americans believe companies should be mandated to do so.Thing to consider:Are you using an AI tool to generate ideas solely for your own brainstorming process?Does your use of AI result in any decision-making for you, your coworkers, or your clients? Is it used to track, monitor, or evaluate employees?Will the AI-generated content be seen by clients or anyone outside of the company? Should that be disclosed to them, and how?Who is in charge of the AI? You've gotten the go-ahead from your company and you understand the type of AI you're using, but now you've got some larger ethical matters to consider. Many AI watchdogs point out that the quick rush to innovate in the field has led to the conglomeration of a few Big Tech players funding and controlling the majority of AI development. AI policy and research institute AI Now points out that this could be a problem when those companies have their own conflicts and controversies. ""Large-scale AI models are still largely controlled by Big Tech firms because of the enormous computing and data resources they require, and also present well-documented concerns around discrimination, privacy and security vulnerabilities, and negative environmental impacts,"" the institute wrote in an April 2023 report. AI Now also notes that a lot of so-called open source generative AI products — a designation that means the source code of a software program is available and free to be used or modified by the public — actually operate more like black boxes, which means that users and third-party developers are blocked from seeing the actual inner workings of the AI and its algorithms. AI Now calls this a conflation of open-source programs with open-access policies.

At the same time, a lack of federal regulation and unclear data privacy policies have prompted worries about unmonitored AI development. Following an executive order on AI from President Joe Biden, several software companies have agreed to submit safety tests for federal oversight before release, part of a push to monitor foreign influence. But standard regulatory guidelines are still in development. So you may want to take into account what line of your work you're in, your company's partnerships (and even its mission statement), and any conflicts of interest that may overlap with using products made by specific AI developers. Things to consider:Who built the AI?Does it source from another company's work or utilize an API, such as OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs)?Does your company have any conflicting business with the AI's owner?Do you know the company's privacy policies and how it stores data given to generative AI tools?Is the AI developer agreeing to any kind of oversight?


Could the AI have any relevant biases?Even the smartest AI's can reflect the inherent biases of their creators, the algorithms they build, and the data they source from. In the same April report, AI Now reports that intentional human oversight often reiterates this trend, rather than preventing it.   ""There is no clear definition of what would constitute 'meaningful' oversight, and research indicates that people presented with the advice of automated tools tend to exhibit automation bias, or deference to automated systems without scrutiny,"" the organization has found. In an article for The Conversation, technology ethics and education researcher Casey Fielder writes that many tech companies are ignoring the social repercussions of AI's utilization in favor of a technological revolution. Rather than a ""technical debt"" — a phrase used in software development to refer to the future costs of rushing solutions and thus releases — AI solutions may come with what she calls an ""ethical debt."" Fielder explains that wariness about AI systems focuses less on bugs and more on its potential to amplify ""harmful biases and stereotypes and students using AI deceptively. We hear about privacy concerns, people being fooled by misinformation, labor exploitation and fears about how quickly human jobs may be replaced, to name a few. These problems are not software glitches. Realizing that a technology reinforces oppression or bias is very different from learning that a button on a website doesn’t work.""Some companies that have automated services using AI systems, like health insurance providers who use algorithms to determine care or coverage for patients, have dealt with both social and legal ramifications. Responding to patient-led lawsuits alleging that the use of an AI system constituted a scam, the federal government clarified that the technology couldn't be used to determine coverage without human oversight. In educational settings, both students and teachers have been accused of utilizing AI in ethically-gray ways, either to plagiarize assignments or to unfairly punish students based on algorithmic biases. These mistakes have professional consequences, as well. ""Just as technical debt can result from limited testing during the development process, ethical debt results from not considering possible negative consequences or societal harm,"" Fielder writes. ""And with ethical debt in particular, the people who incur it are rarely the people who pay for it in the end.""While your workplace might appear to be much lower stakes than a federal health insurance schema or the education of future generations, it still matters what ethical debt you may be taking on when using AI.

At the same time, Klarna says the tool has a similar customer satisfaction score and even resolves errands more efficiently, at two minutes versus the human average of 11 minutes.At the financial level, Klarna anticipates a $40 million profit increase this year with the AI tool performing the equivalent work of 700 full-time agents.While Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co-founder and CEO of Klarna, said the AI would lead to higher returns for investors and potentially better prices for customers, there are still many looming questions about how such an efficient AI could disrupt the workforce and society as a whole.""We are incredibly excited about this launch, but it also underscores the profound impact on society that AI will have,"" Siemiatkowski said in a statement to Newsweek. ""We want to reemphasize and encourage society and politicians to consider this carefully and believe a considerate, informed and steady stewardship will be critical to navigate through this transformation of our societies.""For Klarna's customers, however, they can now expect a 24/7 customer service operation for all sorts of questions, including refunds, returns and payment issues. The AI tool also features multilingual support for more than 35 languages.Will AI Take Away More Jobs?The biggest question many employees have regarding AI concerns their job security.According to Viputheshwar Sitaraman, a tech consultant for several Fortune 500 companies and a Tedx talk AI speaker, artificial intelligence generally is most effective when it works in conjunction with humans.""AI likely won't eliminate jobs as much as it will entirely change the job description,"" Sitaraman told Newsweek.For engineers, that will mean less code writing and more debugging and deployments. For doctors, the initial diagnosis could come from AI, but the doctor will work with the technology to correlate symptoms with a diagnosis and treatment plans.Lawyers, too, could see immense benefits, likely skipping the process of writing legal documents from scratch and instead revising and building upon the initial AI written contracts. It's already being seen in ChatGPT and Github Copilot today, Sitaraman said.Still, the vast majority of AI tools are not ready to take over the roles of hundreds of human workers without any human correction, he added.""This is why today's 'AI agents' are not yet useful to businesses because they seldom can complete a task without getting stuck or running in circles,"" Sitaraman said, adding they face a range of copyright and IP theft concerns.When it comes to Klarna's AI performing the equivalent of 700 human jobs, Sitaraman is skeptical.""'Bot' customer service tools have been around for a long time, and consumers universally find them frustrating timewasters,"" Sitaraman said.Despite the current problems facing current AI technology, many leaders think the tools available to companies could quickly merge into something far more advanced.""With generative AI, we are only at the start of an irreversible platform change,"" Ryan Valles, the co-founder at tech AI skill platform Interview Kickstart, told Newsweek. ""This is a general purpose technology akin to electricity, and so it will bring about massive changes in both the way we work and our productivity. What we are seeing today is only the beginning.""Valles echoed Sitaraman's perspective that AI will fundamentally change jobs but more so in how workers perform the tasks before them. Those who are reluctant to embrace the new ways of work could likely become less in demand by companies, he added.""Every working professional has a clear choice, to get AI-enabled or to risk being left behind,"" Valles said. ""We increasingly see the world getting polarized between the AI-haves and the AI-have-nots. Disproportionate value is likely to accrue to the AI-haves.""And the changes are coming quicker than some might anticipate. A recent McKinsey report found that 70 percent of companies will adopt at least one type of AI technology by 2030.President Joe Biden expressed his concerns around allowing AI to continue to advance with little oversight in an executive order last October.Biden called AI the ""most consequential technology of our time."" He also said he anticipated Americans would see more developments in technology over the next decade than in the past 50 years.""One thing is clear: To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risks, we need to govern this technology,"" Biden said. ""And there's no other way around it, in my view. It must be governed.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'Tech Boss Fears for Future Of Work As AI Takes On 700 Human Jobs', 'description': 'The CEO of e-commerce site Klarna expressed concerns about how artificial intelligence could impact the future of work as its new AI tool takes on the jobs of 700 humans.', 'thumbnailUrl': ['https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2354710/ai.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;q=88&amp;f=c6f4fab89a1b8a92eff218c6728d5004'], 'uploadDate': '2024-02-27T21:48:27-05:00', 'duration': 'PT0M57S', 'contentUrl': 'https://video.newsweek.com/transcoder/480p/2910/1709087281-8682666-1709088153.m3u8'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OpenAI has seen the future, and it involves imbuing a humanoid robot with the silicon spark of artificial intelligence.The developer of ChatGPT, the generative AI technology that has set the world abuzz, said it's investing in Figure, a California company that makes robots for the workplace. OpenAI and Figure will also join forces to develop AI technology aimed at helping robots ""process and reason from language,"" the companies announced in a news release.  Launched in 2022, Figure is building what it calls ""general purpose humanoids"" that can labor alongside people, as well as do dangerous or unpleasant work. ""There are over 10 million unsafe or undesirable jobs in the U.S. alone, and an aging population will only make it increasingly difficult for companies to scale their workforces,"" the company says on its website.   






Other blue-chip players joining OpenAI to invest in Figure include Jeff Bezos (through Bezos Expeditions, his family office), Intel, Microsoft and Nvidia, with the $675 million venture round announced Thursday valuing the robotics company at $2.6 billion. Figure is one of a growing number of companies developing robots to work in warehouses, factories and other industrial settings. The company announced in January that it had signed a deal with BMW to deploy robots in the German automaker's plants, including the German company's facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

Technology experts and the U.S. public share serious concerns about the future of privacy, job opportunities, politics and democracy, civility and many other aspects of life, according to a new report from Elon University outlining the potential future impact of artificial intelligence.
This report, “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence by 2040,” finds both the general public and experts believe enormous upheavals are on the horizon as AI spreads. Many experts go so far as to say that we will have to reimagine what it means to be human and that societies must restructure, reinvent or replace existing institutions and systems. At the same time, they embrace the idea that important benefits will also result from the spread of AI.
This is the first report released by Elon’s expanded Imagining the Digital Future Center under the leadership of Lee Rainie, who joined the university after a 24-year career directing Pew Research Center’s Internet and Technology research. The Center works to discover and broadly share a diverse range of opinions, ideas and original research about the impact of digital change, informing important conversations and policy formation.
The new study combines a national public opinion poll with a canvassing of hundreds of technology experts, the hallmark of the 48 previous research reports produced by Elon in partnership with Pew Research Center since 2004.
“This special two-pronged research into public and elite opinion shows how disruptive many think AI will be to essential dimensions of life,” Rainie said. “Both groups expressed concerns over the future of privacy, wealth inequalities, politics and elections, employment opportunities, the level of civility in society and personal relationships with others. At the same time, there are more hopeful views about AI making life easier, more efficient and safer in some important respects. Virtually everyone agrees this is a pivotal moment for how the future plays out with AI.”
Rainie noted that the rapid development of ChatGPT and other AI tools has raised public awareness and caused considerable worry as well as great optimism about the ways AI tools may make life easier, more efficient and potentially safer.
“This special two-pronged research into public and elite opinion shows how disruptive many think AI will be to essential dimensions of life.”
Lee Rainie
Director, The Imagining the Digital Future Center

The public opinion poll was designed to focus on the expected impact of AI on a variety of dimensions of personal lives and on the structures of society. The separate canvassing of more than 300 technology experts provided an opportunity for technology developers, business and policy leaders, researchers, analysts and academics to contribute essays about the potential coming impact of AI.
Some envision a future when economies and work are overhauled, people have personal digital assistants and diminished skills in making their own choices, when AI-created deepfakes and disinformation create alternate definitions of “truth,” and when there are major advances in medical diagnostics and treatment.

The National Public Opinion Poll
Two-thirds of Americans believe AI may have a negative impact on their personal privacy and more than half believe there will be negative consequences for their employment opportunities, according to the national public opinion poll conducted by the center.
Those are among the findings of a national public opinion survey sponsored by Elon’s Imagining the Digital Future Center and conducted in partnership with the Elon University Poll, and Ipsos, an international marketing research and polling firm.

More than half of Americans expect negative impacts on politics and elections and 40% look for worsening level of civility in society. The most positive outlook is for the impact of AI on healthcare systems and the quality of medical treatment.
There is no prevailing viewpoint about the overall impact of AI. Asked how the increased use of AI will affect people’s daily lives, 31% say it will be equally positive and negative; 29% said it will be more negative than positive; 17% say it will be more positive than negative; and 23% say they don’t know. On a broad question about AI ethics, 31% say it is possible for AI programs to be designed that can consistently make decisions in people’s best interest in complex situations, while the exact same share say that is not possible. Some 38% say they are not sure.

The poll of 1,021 Americans was conducted Oct. 20-22, 2023, and designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of error is +/- 3.2%.
Comparing expert opinions with the general public’s views
When answering a similar set of questions, the experts agreed with the general public that the impact of AI on privacy is the biggest concern. The experts were far more concerned than the public about a growing wealth inequality in society but somewhat less concerned than the public about the impact on employment opportunities.


The 17th “Future of Digital Life” Experts Canvassing
In addition to answering the quantitative questions, the experts wrote thoughtful essay responses in which they described the challenges and opportunities they see in the digital future. Some said we will have to reimagine what it means to be human and that societies must restructure, reinvent or replace existing institutions and systems. They also spelled out their concerns that AI could greatly enfeeble people in the coming years, while at the same time embracing the idea that seemingly miraculous benefits could result from the spread of AI.
A few of the most intriguing ideas from the experts include the following:

A new meaning of life will arise in a “self-actualized economy:” Massive AI-generated economic efficiencies that improve work and the way basic infrastructure performs will be combined with medical and other scientific advances that will fundamentally alter the way people act, connect and care for each other.
There will be a shifting boundary between what’s human and what’s a machine: As AI applications become normalized and ordinary, the things that are considered controversial and dangerous will change from year to year.
Adjunct intelligence will be everywhere: This will dramatically affect individuals’ sense of identity, perception and even consciousness itself.
Personal avatars with “self-sovereign identities” will represent us: Individuals will possess 3D, photo-realistic avatars to carry out tasks for them utilizing their comprehensive personal data.
Digital assistants will have far more influence over their person than their human analogues have over themselves: Engagements with AI provide their creators with intimate insights about users that can be exploited
People will form intimate and meaningful relationships with their bots: Some will focus most of their human affection, desires and attention on digital products.
“Truths will be modified”: The AI-abetted spread of deepfakes, disinformation and post-truth content will broaden, and masses of electronic documents will be modified in hindsight to fit special interests’ points of view.
Shared benefits will transform humanity: The application of AI to achieve long-needed widespread economic change will lead to a more-equitable, sustainable society that relies less on consumption as a driver of productivity and instead evaluates productivity based on “human-flourishing metrics.”
Creativity will be democratized but may also be homogenized: Those with ideas but not much technical skill will have the tools to create and promote their concepts; this could create a monoculture of outputs.
An abundance mindset might replace a scarcity mindset: A sufficient combination of intelligence (via AI), matter (via asteroid mining) and energy (from various clean sources) could provide for effectively unlimited material abundance and enable humanity to overcome much of its reason for struggle.
AI could enable transparency of corporations and governments and expose now-hidden processes: AI systems to aid fact-checking and enable critical inquiry into government and corporate databases might empower citizens and bring suspect or shady practices to light.

“A large share of these global experts and analysts briefly mentioned the great gains they expect, but focused their responses mostly on expressing worries over the potential losses they fear,” said Professor Janna Anderson, founding director of Elon’s Imagining the Internet Center, who has been a co-author of the “Future of Digital Life” reports since they began in 2004. “Their concerns are reflected in the five overall themes we found in our analysis of their responses.”
An analysis of the experts’ responses surfaced five major themes:
Theme 1 – We will have to reimagine what it means to be human
As AI tools integrate into most aspects of life, some experts predict the very definition of a “human,” “person” or “individual” will be changed. Among the issues they addressed: What will happen when we begin to count on AIs as equivalent to – or better than – people? How will we react when technologies assist, educate, and maybe share a laugh with us? Will a human/AI symbiosis emerge into a pleasing partnership? Will AI become part of our consciousness
Theme 2 – Societies must restructure, reinvent or replace entrenched systems
These experts urge that societies fundamentally change long-established institutions and systems – political, economic, social, digital, and physical. They believe there should be major moves toward a more equitable distribution of wealth and power. They also argue that the spread of AI requires new multistakeholder governance from diverse sectors of society.
Theme 3 – Humanity could be greatly enfeebled by AI
A share of these experts focused on the ways people’s uses of AI could diminish human agency and skills. Some worry it will nearly eliminate critical thinking, reading and decision-making abilities and healthy, in-person connectedness, and lead to more mental health problems. Some said they fear the impact of mass unemployment on people’s psyches and behaviors due to a loss of identity, structure and purpose. Some warned these factors combined with a deepening of inequities may prompt violence.
Theme 4 – Don’t fear the tech; people are the problem and the solution
A large share of these experts say their first concern isn’t that AI will “go rogue.” They mostly worry that advanced AI is likely to significantly magnify the dangers already evident today due to people’s uses and abuses of digital tools. They fear a rise in problems tied to extractive capitalism, menacing and manipulative tactics exercised by bad actors, and autocratic governments’ violations of human rights.
Theme 5 – Key benefits from AI will arise
While most of these experts wrote primarily about the challenges of AI, many described likely gains to be seen as AI diffuses through society. They expect that most people will enjoy and benefit from AI’s assistance across all sectors, especially in education, business, research and medicine/health. They expect it will boost innovation and reconfigure and liberate people’s use of time.

Paid Post:JetroAdvertising partnerPublished: 12:00pm, 29 Feb 2024Why you can trust SCMPListen to this article [The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]Japan is offering new opportunities in digital technology, using groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) tools as it seeks to counter the issues of a shrinking workforce arising from an ageing population. For foreign companies, this provides an opportunity to work with domestic partners in this new “industrial revolution” to help transform Japanese society.AI is one of the most important technological developments in modern history. However, to take advantage of it, there is a need for entrepreneurs to bring about breakthrough innovations, companies to provide financial resources and infrastructure, and for government policies that provide the appropriate environment for innovation.Japan provides these three elements. When the nation transformed itself into an economic powerhouse it was driven by the belief that industry and government should work together as partners, rather than viewing each other as adversaries. The country’s breakthroughs in innovation have demonstrated the value of this approach, and Japan continues to be a global leader in major industries.Japanese market is uniqueSega Cheng, co-founder and CEO of iKala, a Taiwan-based firm that helps companies implement AI solutions, sees plenty of reasons for optimism: “The customers in Japan are willing to pay the right price and are seeking long-term relationships with their suppliers,” he says. “This kind of business practice is invaluable for any company seeking to enter the Japanese market.”iKala CEO Sega Cheng says Japanese firms are seeking long-term relationships with foreign companies.With its shrinking workforce, Japan aims to be a leader in demonstrating the benefits of higher productivity made possible by AI. Healthcare, which is facing critical staff shortages – the ageing population requires higher levels of medical care – is seen by industry experts as a key target area.Perceptions of AI in Japan are changing. A survey by the consulting group PwC found that in the spring of 2023, just 10 per cent of respondents said they had used generative AI in applications such as Chat GPT. Just six months later, the number had jumped to 73 per cent. NEC, a Japanese multinational information technology and electronics company, has developed its own enterprise-focused generative AI system called cotomi, with plans for additional versions for specific industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. Japanese start-up Preferred Networks is designing customised chips destined for machines that will power generative AI.In the public sector, the city of Yokosuka (in the Kanagawa prefecture south of Tokyo) became the first municipality in the country to run a trial of ChatGPT for administrative operations last year.Global companies play a key roleGlobal players are also looking at the opportunities in Japan. United States company Nvidia, which has played a major role in the realisation of AI, has announced plans to work with Japanese partners to build an AI tech-related ecosystem in the country. As part of its efforts, Nvidia will establish a research lab and invest in local start-ups. Sakana AI, established in Tokyo by former Google research scientist David Ha and engineer Llion Jones, is engaged in the development of generative AI with telecommunications company NTT, among others. Sakana AI is also a member of the AI Alliance, an international group created by IBM and Meta that has more than 50 companies, universities and scientific organisations to help foster open-software programmes to develop generative AI. The alliance, whose members also include major Japanese organisations including Keio University (one of the country’s oldest research institutions), Sony and the University of Tokyo, aims to improve the capabilities, safety, security and trustworthiness of AI.Saturday

These include plans to introduce a national institute to ensure the safety of AI technologies.Given the potential of generative AI, it is essential for companies to use it not only as a tool to improve operational efficiency and productivity but also to gain a competitive advantage by transforming their products, business models and corporate organisations, according to a report last year on digital promotion in Japan by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.In addition, the leaders of the G7 nations launched the Hiroshima AI Process last year, which aims to create a common vision and goal of safe, secure and trustworthy AI. The group agreed on the International Guiding Principles for AI at the online G7 Digital and Tech Ministers’ meeting in December.Leaders of the G7 nations at the Hiroshima AI summit in Japan last year.Japan’s AI initiatives are also built on the concept that no single company or nation can supply all the answers needed in this fast-changing technology. Therefore, key parts of the government’s policies are to work with countries, corporations and entrepreneurs from around the world to bring this new industrial revolution into reality.“Whether in terms of regulation compliance or in terms of research funding, the Japanese government is moving really fast,” Cheng says.Further SupportGovernment support for AI is just a part of its broader initiatives to attract international talent and investment to one of the world’s leading economies. There is a wide range of programmes in place to help firms ease their way into and expand operations in Japan. These include start-up visas, research and development assistance for small and medium-sized companies, and tax credits for businesses. The programmes can be accessed through the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro), a government-related organisation that works to promote mutual trade and investments between Japan and the rest of the world. The organisation acts as a one-stop centre to help companies establish or expand their business in Japan.Find out more about Japan’s innovation ecosystem here, and Jetro's business support services here.AdvertisementConversations Advertising partnerThis content has been created under the direction of an advertiser.

However, to take advantage of it, there is a need for entrepreneurs to bring about breakthrough innovations, companies to provide financial resources and infrastructure, and for government policies that provide the appropriate environment for innovation.
Japan provides these three elements. When the nation transformed itself into an economic powerhouse it was driven by the belief that industry and government should work together as partners, rather than viewing each other as adversaries. The country’s breakthroughs in innovation have demonstrated the value of this approach, and Japan continues to be a global leader in major industries.
Japanese market is unique
Sega Cheng, co-founder and CEO of iKala, a Taiwan-based firm that helps companies implement AI solutions, sees plenty of reasons for optimism: “The customers in Japan are willing to pay the right price and are seeking long-term relationships with their suppliers,” he says. “This kind of business practice is invaluable for any company seeking to enter the Japanese market.”

With its shrinking workforce, Japan aims to be a leader in demonstrating the benefits of higher productivity made possible by AI. Healthcare, which is facing critical staff shortages – the ageing population requires higher levels of medical care – is seen by industry experts as a key target area.
Perceptions of AI in Japan are changing. A survey by the consulting group PwC found that in the spring of 2023, just 10 per cent of respondents said they had used generative AI in applications such as Chat GPT. Just six months later, the number had jumped to 73 per cent. NEC, a Japanese multinational information technology and electronics company, has developed its own enterprise-focused generative AI system called cotomi, with plans for additional versions for specific industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. Japanese start-up Preferred Networks is designing customised chips destined for machines that will power generative AI.
In the public sector, the city of Yokosuka (in the Kanagawa prefecture south of Tokyo) became the first municipality in the country to run a trial of ChatGPT for administrative operations last year.
Global companies play a key role
Global players are also looking at the opportunities in Japan. United States company Nvidia, which has played a major role in the realisation of AI, has announced plans to work with Japanese partners to build an AI tech-related ecosystem in the country. As part of its efforts, Nvidia will establish a research lab and invest in local start-ups. Sakana AI, established in Tokyo by former Google research scientist David Ha and engineer Llion Jones, is engaged in the development of generative AI with telecommunications company NTT, among others. Sakana AI is also a member of the AI Alliance, an international group created by IBM and Meta that has more than 50 companies, universities and scientific organisations to help foster open-software programmes to develop generative AI. The alliance, whose members also include major Japanese organisations including Keio University (one of the country’s oldest research institutions), Sony and the University of Tokyo, aims to improve the capabilities, safety, security and trustworthiness of AI.
Japanese government programmes are helping foster an AI environment, working to ensure the nation has the resources required for this digital transformation (known as DX in Japan). These include plans to introduce a national institute to ensure the safety of AI technologies.
Given the potential of generative AI, it is essential for companies to use it not only as a tool to improve operational efficiency and productivity but also to gain a competitive advantage by transforming their products, business models and corporate organisations, according to a report last year on digital promotion in Japan by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
In addition, the leaders of the G7 nations launched the Hiroshima AI Process last year, which aims to create a common vision and goal of safe, secure and trustworthy AI. The group agreed on the International Guiding Principles for AI at the online G7 Digital and Tech Ministers’ meeting in December.

Japan’s AI initiatives are also built on the concept that no single company or nation can supply all the answers needed in this fast-changing technology. Therefore, key parts of the government’s policies are to work with countries, corporations and entrepreneurs from around the world to bring this new industrial revolution into reality.
“Whether in terms of regulation compliance or in terms of research funding, the Japanese government is moving really fast,” Cheng says.
Further Support
Government support for AI is just a part of its broader initiatives to attract international talent and investment to one of the world’s leading economies. There is a wide range of programmes in place to help firms ease their way into and expand operations in Japan. These include start-up visas, research and development assistance for small and medium-sized companies, and tax credits for businesses. The programmes can be accessed through the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro), a government-related organisation that works to promote mutual trade and investments between Japan and the rest of the world. The organisation acts as a one-stop centre to help companies establish or expand their business in Japan.

Artificial Intelligence 
AI in Australia: 60% of execs rush for adoption but only 35% of employees are guided

Recent research from Slack’s Workforce Lab underscores a significant artificial intelligence (AI) trend that is specific to Australian workplaces. While Australia leads in global AI adoption rates at 35% — matching Japan — a deeper dive into the statistics reveals nuanced challenges, including gaps in leadership guidance and gender disparities in AI trust and usage.
The study was released alongside this week’s Salesforce World Tour in Sydney and included feedback from 1,000 Australian workers out of more than 10,000 respondents worldwide. The study shows that 60% of Australian executives report a high degree of urgency to implement AI. This is 10% higher than the global average.
However, only 35% of Australian employees have received guidance from their leaders when it comes to navigating AI integration. This figure is notably lower than the global average of 43%, highlighting a gap in direct support and communication from leadership.
And this is a problem considering just how many workers are using AI. The report showed that Australian desk workers spend nearly half of their time (47%) on low-value or repetitive tasks. However, 48% express optimism about AI’s potential to alleviate these burdens, suggesting a readiness to embrace AI for more meaningful work.
Having this enthusiasm met with a lack of guidance from leaders is a problem. Talking about its integration is great, but it’s not particularly helpful without any follow-through or guidance from the top. It also poses potential security issues.
A Deloitte survey from September 2023 found that 66% of Australian workers using generative AI in the workplace were doing so secretly. Combining this without instructions or proper implementation from leadership in such a high proportion of Australian businesses is a potential recipe for disaster.
Christina Janzer, head of Slack’s workforce lab and SVP of research & analytics at Salesforce, points out that users are already witnessing productivity gains from AI and automation tools. Yet, the study brings to light the importance of bridging the gap between executive urgency for AI adoption and the practical support provided to employees, as well as addressing the gender disparities in AI trust and usage.
“The findings show the benefits for top executives to be increasing effectiveness and productivity, innovation of products and services, and cost reduction. However, despite this, there is also an evident disparity between the feeling of importance around AI, versus how desk workers feel it’s being integrated into their working roles,” Janzer said.
Gender disparity with AI trust
Separately, further data from Salesforce released this week revealed that generative AI adoption among Australian office professionals stands at 53%. But, while 61% of men report using or experimenting with generative AI at work, only 40% of women do the same.
This disparity extends to trust levels in generative AI, with 70% of men expressing trust compared to just 43% of women.
This data echoes research that Roy Morgan released last year, which showed that 67% of people who believe that AI causes more problems were women.
But as we reported at the time, that isn’t always the case. In fact, despite the continued  — and incredibly valid — conversations around AI bias, some women were more willing to trust AI than human beings.
A 2023 white paper titled Does Artificial Intelligence Help or Hurt Gender Diversity? revealed that women were 30% more likely to complete an application compared to men if AI was involved in the recruitment process.
“Complementary evidence from two surveys suggests that the gender treatment effect is driven by applicants’ perceptions of the relative bias they experience from AI vs human evaluators,” the white paper says.



This data wasn’t just based on a perception of human bias. It also found that human recruiters were more likely to score women “substantially lower” than men when gender-revealing names are attached to job applications.
So when it comes to Australian businesses, it looks like there are two gaping trust gaps that urgently need to be addressed.

Apple cancels EV, to work on generative AI projects

Posted in Cars, International News				 / By Mick Chan				 / February 28 2024 12:40 pm








The Apple Car project is no more, as the company has decided to pivot towards development of artificial intelligence (AI) projects, Bloomberg has reported. 
According to Bloomberg sources, Apple made the announcement internally, to the surprise of the nearly 2,000 staff who had been on the Apple Car project. The decision was announced to Apple staff by chief operating officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, according to sources. 
Many staff from the Apple Car team, known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG, will be moved to the artificial intelligence division led by Apple executive John Giannandrea, and these employees will focus on generative AI projects which are an increasingly key priority for the company, according to the report. 

Also employed under the Apple Car team are ‘several hundred’ hardware engineers and vehicle designers, who will possibly be able to apply for jobs on other teams within Apple. There will be layoffs, Bloomberg wrote, however the number of those involved is unclear at this time. 
            






The Bloomberg report also noted that Apple had recently imagined the Apple Car to be priced around US$100,000 (RM476,100), which is well into luxury car territory. In the United States, the Standard Range variant of Tesla Model S was announced last August to start from US$78,490 (RM373,690). 
Apple executives were however reportedly concerned about the car’s ability to bring the profit margins typically enjoyed by Apple from its products, and its board was concerned that “hundreds of millions” were spent annually on a project that may not see completion. 

Also known as Project Titan, the Apple Car project came to be known as far back as 2015, when a selection of automobile designers were revealed to be on board the project, including Marc Newson who designed the Ford 021C concept, Julian Hönig who was responsible for the Audi RSQ concept, and Aaron Von Minden who penned the BMW Gina concept.
The Apple Car was initially planned to be a fully autonomous, SAE Level 5 vehicle, though this was scaled back a year later in 2016 to use a Level 4 autonomous driving suite, or conditional full automation. 
In January this year, the project was reported to have been delayed yet again, to 2028, and its self-driving capabilities further reduced to “Level 2+”, which is not an official SAE classification, but is understood to be a more advanced version of Level 2.

Artificial Intelligence is like a highly specialized tool in a corporate setting, adept at performing specific tasks such as analyzing data, predicting patterns or automating routine processes. This is not new and has been around for a while now - after all, wasn't Netflix
NFLX
-0.3% recommending content for us using AI to watch almost a decade ago?


Generative Artificial Intelligence, or Gen AI, on the other hand, is a subset of AI and is relatively newer. It can create new content, like generating an image or design, using its programming to 'imagine' and produce things that didn't exist before. Think of AI as a highly skilled worker, while Gen AI is more like an innovative artist or creator.

HR leaders are now expected to go beyond their typical area of expertise (people) and understand/adopt new technologies (like AI) within the workforce, to both make teams more productive and create policies for safe use.

PROMOTED
The Difference Between AI And Gen AI
To further differentiate these concepts, let's break it down.

Netflix's recommendation system is an example of AI and not Gen AI. It uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze your viewing history, preferences, and behaviors. Doing so can predict and suggest content you're likely to enjoy. This system continually learns and adapts based on your interactions with the platform, making its recommendations increasingly personalized and accurate over time. The use of AI in this context is a prime example of how technology can enhance user experience by providing tailored suggestions for the end user. An example of machine learning in HR applications is the use of applicant tracking systems (ATS) that leverage machine learning algorithms to screen resumes and applications. These systems analyze resumes to match job seekers with job openings based on criteria such as skills, experience, and education.

Gen AI, in contrast, is about creating new content or data that didn't exist before. It involves AI systems that can generate new images, text, music, or other media that mimic human creativity. So while Netflix recommendations are a sophisticated use of AI, they don't involve the creative, generative processes characteristic of Gen AI. An example of Gen AI in HR applications is the creation of personalized training programs and content. Gen AI can analyze an individual employee's learning style, performance data, and career development goals to generate customized learning modules, activities, and educational materials. This tailored approach ensures that training is more engaging, effective, and directly aligned with the employee's growth path and the organization's needs.

Impacts Of Gen AI On The Workplace
Gen AI will be the most significant change to workplaces since the agricultural and industrial revolutions. This may sound like an extreme, however, in its early stages, it’s shown promising revolutions across many facets of how organizations work.

According to a recent McKinsey report, the adoption of AI is expected to sharply accelerate the timeline for automation, potentially automating up to 29.5% of work hours in the U.S. economy by 2030, compared to 21.5% without AI. The report suggests this change is not limited to manual or routine tasks - but extends to areas requiring creativity, expertise, and interaction with people​​.
However, the introduction of Gen AI into teams poses unique challenges. Research from the Columbia Business School indicates integrating AI into human teams can impact performance and coordination, leading to a decline in productivity. Despite the productivity gains offered by AI, there is a notable human aversion to working with AI agents, which raises concerns about trust and job satisfaction – key competencies of employee engagement and retention. This aversion is not uniform across cultures, indicating a need for differentiated strategies in global organizations. HR professionals and organizational leaders must collaborate to create common practices and guidelines that address cultural differences and trust issues, ensuring Gen AI implementation within the workforce enhances rather than hinders employee engagement and productivity.
AI creates a landscape where individuals can evolve from specializing in just one or two skill areas to proficiently handling several interconnected skills simultaneously. Deepening the integration of Gen AI in organizations will need more robust learning programs and a culture that emphasizes teaching and learning across three dimensions: individual, organizational, and the AI itself. About 75 percent of the value that Gen AI use cases could deliver falls across four areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D, according to a June 2023 McKinsey report.
I believe AI will not replace all humans anytime soon, but rather both humans and machines will enhance their capabilities over time to effectively harness the full potential of Gen AI for an organization. To truly understand and leverage this transformative technology, I encourage you to dedicate time to learning about the power of Gen AI by immersing yourself in it and giving it a try. A good place to start is to reference this report by FlexOS that covers the top 150 GenAI tools.

I have a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence. I’m leaving the tech industry. Applying machine data to help me move on with my life
by Harshini Rajachander

					02/12/2024 • Illustrated by Estelle Guillot




After six months of searching-and-not-searching for management-level jobs in tech, I am done. I have done what society demanded of me. I have pursued what I thought needed to be pursued. I valiantly pushed on toward a goal that should have been mine but never was. I have given my time, my energy, and my youth for a white-collar world that will never stop gorging on people like me.  
I am done.  
Growing up in India, I did everything right. I excelled in math and science. I gave up my dreams of becoming a writer in favor of a stable, steady engineering job. I followed the path set down by men like Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google. I completed my master’s at a top University of California school in a field that promised to place me in the frontiers of change — robotics and artificial intelligence. I found a job in the self-driving industry and worked on AI that claimed to make the world a better place. And then reality struck me on the head, forcing me to look up. 
In total, I worked in the AI industry for four years. The result: absolutely nothing. None of the products I worked on ever reached the people they were supposed to help. Tech leaders and evangelists enjoy preaching about helping society and serving the ones who need a leg up. But after observing their actions and not just their words, I learned that it’s all a facade. There is no scope for those who want to work on socially impactful products. The current tech universe is centered around investor happiness, futuristic demos, and making executives richer than their wildest dreams. It has no place for ideals or idealists. For a while ,I hung on with my eyes willfully shut, because it was the only way to pay the bills and hold on to my work visa. But everything changed when the effects of COVID turned the tech industry upside down. 
By the time I was hit by the layoffs in Summer 2023, I had already survived multiple ordeals similar to other young workers: switching to remote work during the pandemic after only a few months of experiencing the old norm, having to support my family when businesses everywhere ground to a halt, being forced to live away from my home when wave after a deadly wave of COVID hit my country. All to hold onto a pointless job and a dehumanizing visa. I’m sorry to say that even after I got laid off, I didn’t wake up at once. After all, it’s hard to let go of the dream one’s entire life has been built on. From July to December 2023, I applied to 500-plus companies, interviewed with less than five percent of those, got led on by recruiters, went through multiple rounds of interviews with a few companies before they yanked those jobs out from under me to give them to someone who came “highly recommended.”  
It’s 2024, and the layoffs have continued into the new year. Optimism dictates that I wait around and keep trying. The next role must be lurking just around the corner. In the beginning, I had taken an inside view of the whole situation. I am terribly smart, a good leader and so, so capable. I must be able to get a job soon, right? 
But zooming out, a different picture greeted me. I decided to learn from AI and look at all the available data. There are hundreds and thousands of others in the same laid-off boat who are just as capable and just as in need of the very same jobs. Some in more desperate situations than mine. Whenever workforce reductions begin, the companies go for the middle management — the product, program and project managers, those whose roles are not tied to the “core” business, whatever that may be. History repeats itself and in the quest for “lean” organizations, those in charge of people, culture, and other intangible benefits, get placed squarely in the line of fire.  
If these organizations stopped to look at the way history tends to play out, they will see that by cutting out the “non-essential” staff, they are spreading the work out onto the already-burdened shoulders of the “essential” ones, people who may have neither the will nor the skill to take on managerial tasks. Among the survivors, burnout is high, fear of the next layoff tangible in the air, resulting in an anxious and less motivated workforce. Organizations and leaders have lost respect and trust. A good lesson would be to look at what happened at companies in the 1980s and ’90s after mass layoffs around the appearance of new technology. Shareholder profits and short-term goals can and have pulled companies under in the past. 
Currently, for many of those who got laid off software roles are the only way to rejoin the tech industry and get a visa sponsorship. But I’m tired of being told what to do and being forced to work on products that create no real impact. There is no guarantee that the next company wouldn’t throw me under a bus the first chance they get. The modern tech company has successfully shifted the risk and responsibility from the employers onto the fragile employees. Executives take zero responsibility for a worker’s well-being and are then surprised when people defer from putting their hearts and souls into their jobs. They forget that the only way to ensure a “productive” workforce is to make the workers feel happy, safe, and cared for.  
Right before the layoff, I nearly ended up digging myself further into the corporate grave. I got offers from some of the best business schools in the U.S., but something always stopped me from taking them up on their offers. Once I even paid to hold a seat, but fate/destiny/an-evil-layoff prevented me from starting the course. I was lost, confused and more than a little stunned by the way things had turned out.  
At that time, my friends helped me find a way out of the fog. One friend consoled me by saying that she never pictured me remaining in the corporate world anyway. She believed in my ability to create, to think differently, and to forge my own path. She helped me let go of my misconceptions and loosely held visions of the future. That conversation led to days and months of thinking, overthinking, and ruminations about the future. I found that it was easier to figure out what I didn’t want and didn’t have any further need of: the tech industry. And with the dawn of the new year, I finally found the courage to let go. 
I am tired of tech, its inherent hypocrisies, and its everlasting hooplas. I am sick of being forced into doing performative actions to prove my worth. I am done being treated as a diversity candidate and having to convince powerholders that I am worthy of their time and money. I am done with being viewed as a risk and too young and too foreign. I am frustrated that even after so many decades, the rot in Corporate America remains too deep to be flushed out. I am, simply, done.  
Moreover, I refuse to give up on all that I have gained in the past six months: my health, my sanity, my creativity, my freedom. I refuse to be forced into the office for the sake of presenteeism. I refuse to give in to the demands of emotionally insensitive, profit-minded, short-sighted leadership teams. I refuse to look the other way when the underlying problems with a company and its culture refuse to be addressed. I refuse to be treated as a second-class citizen and eyed as a potential “mom.” I refuse to assimilate and conform and become “an organization man.” Because try as I might, I know they will never truly accept me or treat me well. 
I have thought long and hard about what I want to do next. What my future should look like. What my ideal job could be. How would I like to spend the rest of my time on this precious but burning planet?  
The answer is simple and the one right in front of all of us: to do things that make one happy. Of course, the jump to self-employment and being my own boss is going to be hard, but ultimately better for my mental and physical health. I found that I enjoyed doing freelance and consulting work that is self-sustaining. I like having the time to volunteer and being an active member of the community. It feels wonderful to benefit others in a way that is visible and tangible. After escaping the confines of the archaic 40-hour work week I have no intentions of willingly putting back on the shackles of white-collar employment. It’s true: once you see the rot, it’s really hard to unsee.  

I know that not everyone can walk away from their jobs. I admit that I may be one of the lucky few who can. Working in tech provided me with one huge lasting benefit — a kind of financial freedom I had never known before. My years in tech helped me build a modest nest egg that now gives me the dignity and confidence to dream of a better life without seeing myself as a burden to my partner. I will always be grateful for that. 
Besides, I’ve also learned that it’s okay to plateau. It’s okay to slowly build a stable and steady life. It’s okay to not want what others want. It’s okay to make your own mistakes and choices and not give into the pull of the system. It’s okay to not pursue constant growth. It’s okay to stop living in fear of being left behind. 
I feel eager to get started on the next phase of my life. Of course, this is just one of a multitude of choices I could be making. But I choose to take the path that feels right. The one that beckons and comforts. The one that aids my family, friends, and my community. The one that gives and does not take. The one that lets me pause and breathe. I choose to lean on my privilege and the support of my family. I choose to ignore the demands of corporate feminism and allow my partner to take care of things for a while. I choose my mind, my body, and my peace.

A quarter of workers fear that AI will drive women out of the workplace, according to new research from Code First Girls. A survey from the social enterprise found that more than eight-in-ten workers are using ChatGPT in their workplace across a variety of roles, including tech, content creation, graphic design, and copywriting.Six-in-ten said they're using it mainly to improve productivity, with half saying it helps them work faster.However, a surge in the use of generative AI tools has also given rise to fears over the potential impact of the technology on female staff. One-quarter of workers said they believe the use of AI will “push women out of the workforce” while nearly half agreed that the potential imbalance in tech will result in biased or discriminatory AI models.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProWhen it comes to recruitment, researchers said unintentional bias in AI models and algorithm development can result in a lack of diversity among shortlisted candidates, thanks to male-dominated training data.(Image credit: Getty Images)UK businesses that adopt AI earn millions more than those that don'tAI interest is fueling a surge in digital apprenticeships across the UKThousands of disabled people 'missing' from tech workforceAnna Brailsford, CEO of Code First Girls, said the research highlights growing concerns among female tech workers that the emergence of generative AI tools could have a negative impact on their careers.""The development of AI continues to demonstrate useful applications across a variety of industries and sectors. However, by not prioritizing diversity in its development, we risk building models that are inherently discriminatory against race and gender minorities,” she said.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

It happens to be the case that AI's abilities overlap more with support occupations,"" said Revelio economist Hakki Ozdenoren.AI recruitment tools have been a contentious topicFears that AI recruitment tools are biased are well-founded. In 2018, Amazon was forced to pull an AI recruitment tool after it was discovered that it was disproportionately favoring men. Because the tool was trained on data about previous hires - mostly men - it started downgrading any resumes containing the word 'women's'.RELATED WEBINAR(Image credit: IBM)Transform your people management and optimize your HR strategyIn September 2023, a study by Aligned AI found that gender bias still persists in large language models (LLMs). When it comes to professional gender bias, researchers said OpenAI’s GPT-4 is the most biased AI, with a score of 19.2%, followed closely by Databricks’ Dolly 2.0, and Stability AI’s StableLM-Tuned-Alpha.While some researchers have claimed that AI can actually reduce bias in recruitment, this idea was contested in late 2022 by University of Cambridge researchers, who found that using AI to narrow candidate pools can increase uniformity rather than diversity in the workforce, as it's calibrated to search for the employer’s 'ideal candidate'.""These tools are trained to predict personality based on common patterns in images of people they’ve previously seen, and often end up finding spurious correlations between personality and apparently unrelated properties of the image, like brightness,"" said Euan Ong, researcher on the project.

Already, gen AI can be leveraged across the value chain: from product design and content creation across campaign images, marketing text, website code and videos, to online consumer experiences through virtual styling and digital clienteling. Meanwhile, conventional AI can be leveraged to forecast demand for buying and merchandising teams or gather insights for store associates and retail teams.The management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company estimates that gen AI could add up to $275 billion of economic potential to apparel, fashion and luxury sectors’ operating profits. It estimates the technology could increase the productivity of the marketing function with a value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending, while as much as one-fourth of gen AI’s potential value in fashion may be driven by use cases in design and product development.As a result, 73 percent of fashion executives expect to prioritise gen AI this year, as cited in BoF and McKinsey’s State of Fashion 2024, while 62 percent of fashion businesses already use gen AI in the workplace.However, only 4 percent claim to use AI “regularly”, while 21 percent use it “occasionally” and 37 percent “experimentally”. The most popular use cases are focused around creative experimentation — in marketing, creating copy or visual content, or to assist in design and product development. Use cases in stores and supply chain operations are still nascent despite their potential.ADVERTISEMENTCrucially, the rate of change executives seek in their business by integrating gen AI and other technologies is out of step with existing skill sets. The State of Fashion report finds that many will face a talent gap, given that just 5 percent of the surveyed executives said they are ready to make best use of the technology.To accommodate next-gen technologies, job requirements across different functions will need to change — in some cases, they already have. Many job specifications in product development require an understanding of computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D modelling software. Soon, fashion professionals can expect requests for skill sets or specialisms in gen AI programmes like Midjourney, ChatGPT and their competitors.What’s more, leaders and HR teams need to consider how they can foster the right workplace culture and technical support to optimise the use of next-gen tools.This BoF Careers white paper explores how fashion businesses can approach integrating gen AI into their workplace, the core skill sets needed in a digitally competent workforce, and the pastoral requirements to effectively support an employee cohort reimagining its day-to-day practices for long-term success.Featuring actionable insights and analysis from global experts:Rhianna Cohen is the creative director for the creative strategy studio Mørning, working with global brands such as Nike, Calvin Klein, Coty, Meta and more.

There are many types of AI content generators with a variety of uses for consumers and businesses.
ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot, inspired a flurry of attention with its November 2022 release. The technology behind it -- the GPT-3 language model -- has existed for some time. But ChatGPT made the technology publicly available to nontechnical users and drew attention to all the ways AI can be used to generate content. Now, more than a year after its release, many AI content generators have been created for different use cases.







This has prompted questions about how the technology will change the nature of work. Some schools are banning the technology for fears of plagiarism and cheating. Lawyers are debating whether it infringes on copyright and other laws pertaining to the authenticity of digital media. President Joe Biden also passed an executive order in October 2023 that addresses the technology's opportunities and risks in the workforce, education, consumer privacy and a range of other areas. Generative AI has the potential to change the way content is created.

What is AI-generated content?
AI-generated content -- or generative AI -- refers to the algorithms that can automatically create new content in any digital medium. Algorithms are trained on a large amount of data. Outputs are then returned based on that data and a comparatively little bit of user input. But the key is that content is new and generated automatically.
The most common example of a generative AI algorithm is ChatGPT. ChatGPT performs natural language processing and is based on the language model GPT-3. GPT-3 is trained on a large amount of human text from the internet and teaches the language model how to respond when interacting with users.

19 of the best large language models in 2024




Other generative AI programs work in a similar way. They are trained to develop a body of knowledge and use that knowledge to create novel outputs.
Many commercial generative AI offerings are currently based on OpenAI's generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Codex.


What are the different types of AI-generated content?
AI-generated content is not just limited to mimicking human writers. AI-generated content also exists in other media, such as the following:

Image.
Speech.
Video.
Music.
Code.

Despite the many types of content generative AI can create, the algorithms used to create it are often large language models such as GPT-3 and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers -- also known as BERT.





How generative AI is used
These different media can be used in tandem to generate various content. They can be used in many fields, including the following:

Academia, to write papers and other long-form content.
Law, to write legal briefs.
Science, to automate and expedite drug discovery.
Art, to generate new works and unique content ideas.
Manufacturing, to expedite product development.
Digital marketing, to write copy and product descriptions, as well as draft social media posts.
Software development, to generate, remediate and summarize code.
Cybersecurity, to perform accelerated threat detection and develop malware.



AI content generators
There are AI content generator tools in every medium -- some paid and some free. Many are based on similar technology and add features to address specific user needs. Below are some of the top content generators organized by content type.
Written

AI-Writer is an AI writing assistant that helps reword and remediate an existing piece of content, creates unique article drafts, provides citation lists, summarizes SEO competitors and creates SEO-optimized content from Google.
Gemini (formerly Bard) is Google's conversational AI tool, powered by a language model of the same name. It is available in more than 230 countries and territories and functional in over 40 languages. Gemini competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT and aims to improve the way people search for and retrieve information. One example of a use for Gemini is asking it for meal ideas based on what food is in the house. Another example is asking it to explain complex scientific concepts in a way a child could understand. Gemini, like ChatGPT, is multimodal, meaning it can handle images as well as text. Gemini integrates with other Google services such as Gmail and Google Docs.
ChatGPT is a machine learning-powered chatbot trained to engage in realistic dialogue. The chatbot can debug code, challenge incorrect premises and refuse to respond to certain requests. The model produces convincing content but does struggle with factual accuracy. It was trained using reinforcement learning and is informed by previous OpenAI projects such as GPT-3 and Codex. It also integrates with image models to generate images from a text prompt.




ChatGPT can help users troubleshoot and generate computer code.






ChatSonic is a dialogue-focused content generator from Writesonic built on top of GPT-4 with added features. Users can choose from 16 different personas to chat with, including poets and accountants. Users can also interact with ChatSonic via voice and choose to have ChatSonic respond audibly. ChatSonic is connected to Google's knowledge graph and includes up-to-date information from the internet.
Claude is a conversational AI tool by Anthropic, an AI safety and research lab. Claude is in beta and is integrated into Slack to summarize threads and answer questions. It provides a principal-based approach to performing chatbot functions and can handle adversarial questions. Anthropic was founded by two former OpenAI employees.
Docs is Google's cloud-based, collaborative word processor with AI features to generate, summarize and brainstorm text. Docs is integrated with Google Bard as well.
Jasper AI is a long-form AI copywriting tool and article generator that includes more than 50 content generation templates in 25 global languages. Jasper's user interface is simple to use and lets content creators specify SEO keywords and tone of voice in the prompt.
Magic Write is an AI text generator for Canva Docs. Users can prompt magic write to brainstorm, generate outlines and generate content ideas. It was developed using GPT-3.
Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine. It includes many of the same natural language functions that ChatGPT has to offer. A unique feature of Perplexity is that it can provide sources to back up the answers that it has generated. It functions more as a search engine than an original writer, but still generates original content.
Rytr is an AI content generator that lets content creators specify a content use case, tone of voice and keywords. It also comes with plugins for WordPress.
Spellbook by Rally is writing software designed to help lawyers with legal drafting. Spellbook can draft new contract clauses, list common negotiation points based on the contract and create contract summaries.
Wordtune is an AI tool for AI21 Labs that can perform a variety of general language tasks, such as rewriting sentences and citing sources.

Image

Craiyon, originally called DALL-E mini, was developed by researchers at Google and Hugging Face. It produces a batch of AI-generated images in response to a text prompt. The image quality is generally lower than that of Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E. The images often appear blurry and unrealistic.
DALL-E is OpenAI's image generator that creates images and art from a simple text prompt. DALL-E can also make realistic edits to images using a caption. It can remove components and change image texture, for example. It can also create several variations of an existing image based on the original. DALL-E uses diffusion, which starts with a random pattern of dots and creates an image from it.
Midjourney is an image generator hosted on a Discord server. Users can manipulate the generator via Discord bot commands or through a web app. It generates realistic-looking images based on text prompts. Some users have noted that Midjourney output resembles paintings rather than photographs. Users are encouraged to post their creations on designated X -- formerly known as Twitter -- and Reddit pages to help train the system.
Stable Diffusion is Stability AI's generator that can create photorealistic images from an inputted text. It can also be used to fill in missing or deteriorated pieces of art and has an easy-to-use in-browser function through DreamStudio. Stable Diffusion uses diffusion to create images.

Music

Amper music is a generator that creates music from prerecorded samples. The software can be used to match music to video, where users can specify the duration of music and where in the music a climax should fall.
Dadabots is a generative neural network that creates a constant live stream of artificial music in different genres and raw audio neural networks that imitate bands. For example, its infinite bass solo video is a 24/7 stream of emulated bass noises.
Harmonai is a community-driven organization that creates open source tools for generating novel sounds based on diffusion, a process that takes white noise and manipulates it into audio samples automatically. Harmonai aims to develop open source audio synthesis and manipulation tools. Harmonai released Dance Diffusion, which has six publicly available music generation models -- each trained on different sets of data sets.

The arrival of generative artificial intelligence has been nothing short of a professional earthquake, shaking up the very foundations of career landscapes across the board.See Also: 5 Requirements for Modern DLP
As we traverse this seismic shift in innovation, it's becoming increasingly clear that gen AI is playing a dual role: It's both the villain in the tale of job displacement and the hero ushering in a new era of enhanced job roles and opportunities.
Let's peel back the layers of this narrative and examine the somewhat bitter truth about gen AI's impact on careers.
The Job Role Revolution: Disruption or Destruction?
Gen AI's impact on traditional job roles is less of a gentle nudge and more of a shove off a cliff. Roles steeped in routine tasks and aspects of customer service are finding themselves face-to-face with the automation guillotine. Gen AI - with its flashy capabilities to generate content, spit out code and mimic customer service agents - is challenging the notion of what kind of work requires a human touch.
Yet, we're told not to view this disruption as the end of the line for these professions. Instead, it's supposed to lead to a magical transformation in which humans are liberated from the monotony of their tasks to pursue higher-level, more creative endeavors. Customer service agents, for example, are now expected to deal with the complexities of human emotions and behaviors that gen AI can't quite grasp - yet. But let's be honest: Is this evolution or just a fancy way of saying, ""Find a new job""?
New Careers and Skill Sets: The Silver Lining or Just More Clouds?
On the bright side, new careers and skill sets are emerging, thanks to our AI overlords. There's a growing demand for AI specialists, data scientists and ethics compliance managers, which reflects the desperate need for humans to keep AI systems in check. The irony is that we're now creating jobs to manage the technology that's making other jobs obsolete.
This new era emphasizes the importance of being a jack-of-all-trades. Professionals now must juggle technical skills, ethical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. But there's a catch: You need to be a lifelong learner, constantly updating your skill set to keep up with the relentless pace of AI advancements. The goal posts for employability are not just moving; they're on a high-speed train.
Ethical and Societal Chess
Diving deeper, gen AI isn't just driving a technical and operational overhaul in the professional world; it's opening a Pandora's box of ethical dilemmas and societal challenges.
As AI systems gain autonomy, we're scrambling to find professionals who can navigate the murky waters of ethics, privacy and social justice. It's a tall order, considering these digital genies are already out of the bottle, weaving themselves into the fabric of our decision-making processes.
The ripple effect of gen AI on society calls for a Herculean effort to revamp education, training programs and social safety nets. But let's not kid ourselves. The call for a collaborative effort among governments, industries and educational institutions to support workforce transitions feels more like a polite suggestion than a concrete plan.
Surviving the Gen AI Wilderness
For the average professional trudging through the wilds of gen AI, the mantra is: Adapt or perish. Embracing continuous learning and staying on top of AI trends is now a survival strategy, not just career advice. And let's not forget the need for ethical literacy, as if understanding the complexities of AI wasn't daunting enough.
Networking and interdisciplinary collaboration are touted as lifelines in this era of uncertainty. But in reality, they're just fancy ways of finding allies in your quest to remain relevant in the face of gen AI's relentless march forward.
Skepticism, Adaptability and Humor
The narrative surrounding gen AI and careers is a mix of genuine opportunity and veiled threats. While this technology promises to revolutionize job satisfaction and innovation, it also carries the risk of making vast swaths of the workforce obsolete. 
Navigating a career path in the age of gen AI is a journey fraught with uncertainty. It demands a blend of skepticism, adaptability and a dash of humor to tackle the challenges head-on. Welcome to the brave new world of work, where the only constant is the relentless hum of the machines.

As an employment-focused social network that counts more than 1 billion business professionals and 65 million organizations among its users, LinkedIn has a unique view of job-seeker behavior and what skills employers are looking for. And right now, everyone is focused on generative AI.

According to the company’s recent “Future of Work Report: AI at Work,” 55% of LinkedIn users’ jobs will be impacted in some way by generative AI.
The report also showed that between December 2022 and September 2023, views for AI and AI-related jobs rose 12% across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Applications for AI and AI-related job postings for those seven countries increased by 11%, and in just the U.S., views and applications rose by 21% and 19%, respectively.
“By and large, what we’re seeing is there are different speeds of displacement, different speeds of augmentation happening, but it is happening across all sectors,” said Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist.


“What that tells me is that the adoption rate of this technology ... it is not a flash in the pan,” said Kimbrough during a panel discussion at the MIT Shaping the Future of Work Initiative launch event in January. “It is here. It is changing what employers are looking for.”
The initiative, led by co-directors Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and MIT economist David Autor, uses research to analyze the labor market and improve job quality and job equity for non-college workers.
Here are some additional takeaways from the LinkedIn analysis and panel discussion.
Disrupting industries
In its analysis, LinkedIn found that 49% of women and 45% of men will experience disruption in their jobs because of generative AI. Women are in the majority, according to the report, because they are overrepresented in jobs that can be partially done by machines, such as administrative and office management positions.


LinkedIn also studied the U.S. communities where the workers who are most likely to be disrupted live.
“We asked, ‘What’s the median income in the communities that they live in?’” Kimbrough said. “It was 10% above the median. These were folks that were not the locksmith but the librarian. This is your solidly middle-class [cohort] that looked to be the most exposed.”
Becoming ‘AI literate’
The LinkedIn analysis found that its users are rapidly adding AI skills to their profiles, though Kimbrough said that doesn’t mean they have to become AI experts.
“You just have to know how to be AI literate, how to use the software in your domain,” Kimbrough said. “That’s going to help you be a little bit more efficient. So it’s not about all of us becoming coders; it’s about all of us just getting a little bit more literate in our space.”
That dovetails with the study’s findings that employers today are willing to focus on skills more than previous job titles or degrees.

How should AI-generated content be labeled? 


“What we actually find in our own data is that when you take a skills-based approach … you actually expand your potential talent pool, sometimes as much as 20 times,” Kimbrough said. “Getting over that initial barrier of ‘Did you go to a certain school or did you get a certain degree or did you have a certain title?’ makes a huge difference for hiring.”
Investing in employees
Workers are focused on investing in their skill sets, and Kimbrough and MIT Sloan professor of the practice Zeynep Ton urged employers to invest in their employees as well.
LinkedIn found that companies that excelled at internal mobility and upskilling retained their employees for nearly twice as long as companies that did not do those things well.
Offering employees a career path “is huge,” Ton said. “Once you commit to promoting from within, then your entire HR system changes, because now you’re hiring differently; now you’re coaching people differently.”
And while a paycheck is still a priority, Kimbrough said, younger generations are reporting that it’s also important that their employer takes a vested interest in them.
“They want to feel that they have a career path and not just the job,” Kimbrough said.

Today, “how” we work and “who” we work with are the defining transformations in the workplace. Soon, every human team member across departments as varied as human resources, sales, customer service, and engineering will have their own GenAI co-pilot, customized to their role and key responsibilities. Conversational AI has led to a myriad of new use cases where GenAI is our new work buddy.


We have several specialized AI powered assistants working side by side with human workers. Teachers have copilots for homework grading, such as Class Companion, architects have an AI assistant for design, SketchPro. Online learners studying at Kahn Academy have Kahnmigo to help them become better learners, while learners on the Uplimit platform have CoBot as their AI powered teaching assistant.

In the corporate world, we are seeing early adopters such as Deloitte, McKinsey, Microsoft, and Walmart launching enterprise AI powered work buddies to help employees be more productive.

PROMOTED
While workers experiment with GenAI, some companies discourage usage. A BCG Digital Acceleration study of 2,000 global executives found more than 50% discourage GenAI adoption. This seems like the debate we had in 2009, when, according to a Robert Half survey, 54% of U.S. companies banned workers from using social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn while on the job. Today, can you imagine being banned from using LinkedIn at work?

Workers will use new technology on their own, regardless of whether it is adopted by their organization. A recent survey by Fishbowl reports that 68% of 5,067 workers use ChatGPT at work, but they do not disclose this to their manager. Instead of debating new technology usage, leaders must develop a plan for GenAI’s adoption aligned to their strategic business priorities.

Lead the GenAI Transformation in Your Organization 
The only way to lead the GenAI transformation is to roll up your sleeves and start using GenAI to understand how this will you impact both you as a leader, and every employee in the company. Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera, says, “CEOs who are not using Generative AI will fail.” They will fail, because GenAI will change the way leaders think, communicate, and strategize about the business.
The best way to determine GenAI use cases is for senior leaders to experiment with GenAI and share what they have learned company-wide. Leaders can start their journey by forming cross-functional executive teams, so GenAI is aligned with the organization’s key business priorities, current AI capabilities, and key business problems.
Understand the Sentiment for using GenAI Among Workers and Leaders
International Monetary Fund estimates AI will affect almost 40% of global jobs, replacing some and complementing others. Some employees are experiencing a fear of becoming obsolete. Others are actively embracing AI to improve their productivity and creativity. A BCG survey of 13,000 people in 18 countries—from executive leaders to middle managers and front-line employees—finds leaders are much more optimistic than front-line employees about AI (62% vs. 42%) and how to incorporate it into one’s job, with 80% of leaders feeling optimistic, while only 20% of front-line workers felt they understand the impact of AI on their job.
This discrepancy on using AI between workers and leaders can negatively impact morale and productivity. Almost a third of job seekers said they are looking for new positions because of GenAI disruption. The American Psychological Association reports workers who are worried about AI disrupting their role are 57% more likely to feel that their productivity is declining and 40% more likely to feel ineffective at work.
A commitment to frequent employee pulse surveys is critical is understand worker sentiment and take action to address employee fears of becoming obsolete.
Train All Workers on Safe and Equitable Usage of AI 
The explosive use of GenAI is uncovering a need to up-skill the entire workforce. BCG research finds workers expect their employer to provide AI literacy and this is true of 80% of white-collar workers, 76% of blue collars, and 74% of pink collars. Almost one-third of workers across 16 countries report they are pursing learning opportunities on their own in response to AI disruption, because their company training was inadequate.
The large professional service companies are the early adopters in GenAI training. PwC is committing $1Billion over three years to train 75,000 workers in GenAI so they can safely incorporate this into their work. Genpact is another company that has developed a GenAI training program, giving employees instant access to the collective intelligence of the company. To date, 60,000 have gone through the self-paced training immersion and 22,000 have completed. This is in addition to a 12-week immersive program for developers, including a deep dive into prompt engineering.
Pilot Use Cases With Involvement of Cross Functional Executive Teams
McKinsey’s launch of Lilli, a GenAI solution, is one example of how an AI powered work buddy can provide streamline searching and synthesizing more than 100,000 documents and a network of experts across 70 countries. This process kicks off a new project at McKinsey and often takes about two weeks of researching and networking. Now Lilli streamlines this quickly and efficiently. In addition to increasing productivity of team members, McKinsey team members can use Lilli as “thought sparring partner” anticipating client questions sand creating an enhanced project plan.
McKinsey’s lesson in piloting Lilli is one we all need to be aware of; Phil Hudelson a McKinsey partner who leads the development of our technology platforms said that “the technology was the easy part, the bigger challenge was bringing the right team together from functions such as HR, talent development, cyber security, and risk management to address all the angles in launching the GenAI solution.
Redesign Job Roles Where Automation Will Have the Most Impact in the Workplace 
GenAI is already transforming job roles. Take the role of a customer service representative. A global retailer recently introduced a work buddy to answer nearly 50% of customer inquiries. But this did not translate into job losses among customer service representatives. Instead, nearly 8,000 of these customer service representatives were re-skilled as virtual interior design advisors. The global retailer now charges for this service, and it is a new source of revenue.
GenAI is in the early stages of experimentation at many companies. The first question leaders will deal with is, “Will GenAI lead to job loss?” But the far bigger question is how will companies adapt to GenAI which is becoming more intelligent, more functional, and more ubiquitous to how employees work each day. A leader’s answer to the impact on jobs needs to focus less on job loss and more on how jobs must be re-designed, as GenAI improves exponentially. Leaders must embrace GenAI, and build a “test and learn” culture, so workers know how GenAI can enhance their productivity and creativity.

Artificial Intelligence versus Global Jobs
The current technological scene of this century is evolving at a rapid pace, with AI being at the heart of these changes.

The current technological scene of this century is evolving at a rapid pace, with AI being at the heart of these changes. This evolution has led to sweeping transformations in the workforce, which has raised a debate concerning what awaits job opportunities as AI and automation take hold. Even though some perceive AI as a threat to employment and job stability, others consider it an impetus for the creation of new jobs alongside increased efficiency. It is important to undertake a closer examination at the complex nature of AI and work, unraveling some details about what it might mean for individuals and establishing how businesses, politicians, professionals specifically can tap into.
While the development of AI has led to concerns over job losses, the fear of being replaced by technology is not a recent phenomenon. There have been numerous historical examples of these fears, such as the developments of the Industrial Revolution that indicate technology disruptions can cause damage to labor markets but following time lead to creation of new types for jobs and industries. On the other hand, AI poses a different type of problem because it is unprecedented in its speed and scope as well as cognitive abilities.
Over the last couple of years, AI technologies have begun to play a key role in several industries. In the industrial sector, AI-based robots and automation have redefined production lines in terms of efficiency and accuracy. This also encompasses the healthcare industry, where AI algorithms have assisted in diagnostics, treatment planning and patient care while in finance sector AI is used to gain risk appraisal, fraud detection and personalized financial services. These applications are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. AI technology can be applicable to almost every industry: autonomous vehicles relating to transportation and machine learning-based crop management systems for agriculture are just some examples of this (Table-1).
Table-1 AI Skills Demand

These sectors with AI integration have different effects on jobs. While some positions have been automated, new jobs that demand different competencies have emerged. Similarly, in manufacturing we see declining demand for manual routine tasks and increasing requirements of AI maintenance, supervision, and programming.
Job Concerns and New Opportunities
The implementation of AI across industries has caused growing concerns about job losses for positions that require structured and simple decision processes. Different jobs in sectors such as customer service, transportation, and simple data entry are more vulnerable to automation. For example, the introduction of self-driving technology may dramatically change responsibilities like that of taxi and truck drivers.  Several reports and studies have tried to measure the potential effects by AI and automation regarding jobs. For instance, a report from the World Economic Forum suggests that even though artificial intelligence and automation may result up to 75 million job displacement by 2025[4] but it is likely that around133million fresh roles could be created and the statistics will be different by 2030 as explain in Figure 1. Nevertheless, these estimates greatly differ depending on the sector of industries as well as region and environment.
Figure-1 Jobs at Risk by Automation (2030)

Job losses caused by AI is not purely an economic problem but is also a societal one. It is evident that job loses can have drastic social and societal consequences, of which some include rise in inequality, economic insecurity as well as other strings. Therefore, it is important for the policymakers and industry authorities to remember these aspects as they look into ways of ensuring that AI does not cause a harm but become useful in their applications.
Rather than causing unemployment to spread, AI is also a major employment generator. New job fields are also emerging, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence implementation and data analytics as well as cybersecurity and AI ethics. These roles are not only in the tech industry but extend to other industries that deploy AI for use. For instance, the healthcare industry has witnessed an increase in demand for AI technologists who can team up with medical personnel to enhance patient outcomes. In finance, AI has established positions for data scientists and compliance officers to translate its insights informed by the algorithmic information and make sure that these are in line with regulatory requirements. There is, therefore, an urgent need for education as well as training programs that are tailored towards matching the changing job market. These not only covers technical skills related to AI and data science but also soft skill such as adaptability, critical thinking, problem-solving.
The Skills Challenge and Ethical Issue
Since AI has begun changing the workplace, a gap forms between workers’ existing competencies and those they need to fulfill roles created due to automation. This skills gap is a big problem for job seekers and employers of labor who want to use AI in their activities. The strategies involved to fill this gap encompass reskilling and upskilling. This cover equipping the workers with applicable training and education that fulfils the job requirement in a job market dominated by AI. Thereby, securing job giving competitive advantage in AI driven market. For an illustration, employees should prioritize to learn digital literacy, AI programming and data analytics to compete technology demanding market criteria.
The ethical issues are arising in the professional environment with the use of AI. Concerns of privacy, discrimination in AI algorithms and who is responsible for the consequences of decisions driven by artificial intelligence are wrecking. For example, this concerns the endeavor to keep AI from generating new types of partiality or exacerbating those that already exist. The centrality of strong regulatory regimes to oversee the influence A.I will have on jobs and society. This includes policies regarding data privacy, AI safety and ethical use of AI in conjunction with working conditions under an increasingly automated workplace. Various countries are taking different approaches to AI governance. For instance, the European Union chose to come up with recommendations for ethical AI at an early stage while countries such as Japan work towards incorporating it in their roadmaps for economic development and societal welfare.
The Future outlook
AI in the future of work is not about human job replacement. AI can also respond to manual and monotonous duties making humans engage in creativeness activities or those involving strategic aspects. There are studies in various sectors, which demonstrate the advantages of AI-human cooperation. For instance, in the field of medicine, AI helps doctors to diagnose diseases and come up with proper treatment plans that improve patient outcomes. The future of work will be a more flexible one, full of dynamism and increased diversity; AI is thus going to play a critical role in accelerating productivity as well as innovation. Thus, adaptation and constant learning in combination with productive interaction with AI will be the basis for success of this new era.

LoginThe Workforce Summit Generative AI and chatbots that can answer questions much faster than managers and HR personnel are helping to slash workloads and free up executives for higher-value work, say several executives who have embraced the newest wave of automation.But companies are still divided on whether automation and the adoption of new AI technology will guarantee productivity and efficiency gains, arguing that human know-how, empathy, soft skills and critical reasoning are still needed to get the biggest benefit from technology. Amy Coleman, corporate vice president for human resources and corporate Functions at Microsoft.  Peter RaeGenerative AI would predominantly drive “task augmentation with a human in the loop, rather than outright job automation … at this stage of the technology’s development,” according to a major McKinsey report on the potential of the technology released at The Australian Financial Review Workforce summit on Monday.At Microsoft, an HR chatbot has helped the company eliminate more than 21,000 hours of work since its introduction about a year ago. For higher level questions which the bot can’t answer, an HR team member uses the bot in conjunction with their own intel to resolve the issue.“We’ve applied an AI bot to simple HR questions,” said Amy Coleman, corporate vice president, human resources and corporate functions, Microsoft. “We have HR service centres all over the world that would normally come in and ask you that.Advertisement“[If] I’m getting ready to go on maternity leave, what do I need to be doing [and] thinking? AI can help us answer a lot of those questions and then make the self-service better as well. So we’re finding a lot of productivity there.”It is a scenario that is also playing out inside global energy management giant Schneider Electric, which is trialling a similar bot to streamline HR processes by encouraging staff to direct questions on leave allocation or parental leave provisions and other issues to the company’s chatbot.“GPT will go straight through to Schneider’s policies and start prompting, ‘have you thought about other flexibility that you want to use through that policy? Do you want to access purchase leave? Here’s the process. Here’s a diagram,’” Schneider’s human resources vice president Justine Cooper said.McKinsey partner Seckin Ungur and IAG group executive Christine Stasi both say AI needs to be paired with human interaction and critical reasoning to deliver real value. Peter Rae“It becomes a much more connected experience than kind of diving through different policy documents.”The company is also using AI in an open talent pool, which encourages staff inside the business who are keen on a new role to hang out their shingle for an internal transition or promotion. The software can gauge the skills that are transferrable to other parts of the business and has already made links for staff their managers might have missed.AdvertisementIn one instance, the open talent pool found an employee in the marketing division who was keen on a change and had the necessary skills for a more senior role in the HR team. The platform then found he had the required skills to make a jump into management strategy.Inside private hospital operator Healthscope, artificial intelligence is being used to improve rostering by predicting attendance out to a timeframe of 10 weeks.Greg Horan, CEO, Healthscope says AI is being used to help rostering. Peter Rae“We can get an idea of what that demand looks like, so that we can optimise our rostering to get the right person, at the right time, the right care, and the right the way through to the 72-hour window to ensure that again … our workforce is at the right time, right place, right cost as well,” chief executive Greg Horan said.Meanwhile, insurance giant IAG is using generative AI to streamline and expedite its claims handling processes across all categories of assets.The company has been able to cut down the assessment time on total write-offs from 15 days to five days, while also drastically reducing the number of times a claims officer had to contact the customer, from six times to one.AdvertisementDuring mass flooding in New Zealand in 2023, which generated more than 48,000 claims, the company devised a robotic process to glean the data needed to make an assessment, which then freed up claims handlers to spend more time offering support to traumatised customers on the phone.The result was a more than 700 per cent increase in IAG’s ability to process large claims, jumping from 500 a day to 150 an hour, IAG group executive Christine Stasi said.The outcome has been a workforce it is upskilling and reskilling to help customers one on one, Ms Stasi said. “We started training our claims consultants more on empathy-based service, identifying customers who were facing personal trauma,” she said.Inside the Productivity Commission, take-up of the new technology is happening at a more cautious pace even if staff can immediately see where AI could help, chairwoman Danielle Wood said.One possible application could include using AI to distil or summarise the hundreds of submissions the commission receives on a single inquiry. The technology could also be used to help the public find specific answers quickly on the commission’s website, which includes reports that can span hundreds of pages.“You can imagine the benefits of using AI to distil and pull out key themes – it would be really powerful. We also are quite famous for producing very long reports, so we were thinking of AI chatbots on the website that allow people to ask questions and interrogate those reports without necessarily having to digest five 500 pages,” Ms Wood said.Advertisement“There are lots of ways in professional life ... which can really transform the way we operate.” RelatedAI shock: Tech companies axe 34,000 since start of yearRelatedMeet ChatPwC, the custom-built AI tool being rolled out at the firmRelatedCBA claims AI is already making it work 30pc betterSamantha Hutchinson is the AFR's National Reporter.

		Code generation and copilots are just the beginning of new AI-enabled ways to develop, test, deploy, and maintain software. 	




 









Coding in the ’90s usually meant selecting an editor, checking code into CVS or SVN code repositories, and then compiling code into executables. Integrated development environments (IDEs) like Eclipse and Visual Studio improved productivity by including coding, development, documentation, building, testing, deploying, and other steps in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Cloud computing and DevSecOps automation tools brought in the next wave of developer capabilities, making it easier for more organizations to develop, deploy, and maintain applications.  
Generative AI is the catalyst for the next paradigm shift, promising to change how organizations create and maintain software as well as enabling new development tools and paradigms. The question for many developers and IT leaders is whether AI means the demise of coding as we know it. A related question is how it will affect the evolution of SDLC and DevSecOps over the next decade. With these two questions in mind, I went searching for ideas and predictions.
Is genAI a new tool or a new way of developing? 
“I am a big believer in code, and I have seen many people bet against code in my 25-year career, and they have always lost,” says Joe Duffy, CEO of Pulumi. “AI will automate and augment coding, not replace it, thereby raising the level of abstraction that we humans operate at, considerably accelerating productivity and output.”











 
 
 
That’s one viewpoint. To consider others, I went back to the classics.

In Frederick Brooks’ classic book on software development, The Mythical Man-Month, he shares a study on software development productivity showing “the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements.” In the 20th anniversary edition of the book published in 1995, he republishes the 1986 article, “No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering,” which predicted that “a decade would not see any programming technique that would by itself bring an order-of-magnitude improvement in software productivity.
We don’t know yet whether copilots and other generative AI coding capabilities will exceed these benchmarks.











 
 
 
“The software delivery lifecycle is getting disrupted by generative AI,” says Ashish Kakran, principal of Thomvest Ventures. “Dev and devops teams will become more productive with a higher percentage of team members potentially achieving outputs similar to those of 10x engineers”.
That productivity gain and democratizing the software development skill set may be possible as genAI capabilities mature and developers realign their responsibilities. “Copilots in their current form are really about developer productivity and removing that busy work,” says Ed Thompson, CTO of Matillion. “Those who assume that copilots have already fundamentally changed the job are working on the incorrect assumption that a developer’s job is to write code—it’s to solve problems.”
10 ways generative AI will transform software development
How will generative AI transform software development over the next decade? Here are 10 predictions:











 
 
 

Generating code from natural language prompts is the standard
Code validation is a critical developer responsibility
Manufacturing as the new development paradigm
Less coding, but greater code supply-chain risks
New paradigms accelerate integration
Developers manage AI agents
AI touches multiple phases of the SDLC
GenAI and human development personas emerge
AI improves ops capabilities in dev processes
Organizations must protect themselves from AI risks

Generating code from natural language prompts is the standard
Kaxil Naik, director of Airflow engineering at Astronomer, says, “Coding will become more efficient with AI-generated boilerplate code and AI-assisted copilots translating natural language into functional code, simplifying the understanding of complex codebases and ensuring adherence to best practices.”
StackOverflow’s 2023 developer survey shows that 70% of developers are using or are planning to use AI tools in their development process. Of those already using AI in development, over 82% use it to write code. These numbers suggest a paradigm shift in how developers will develop code, reuse existing code, and build components.
Code validation is a critical developer responsibility
The ability to prompt for code adds risks if the code generated has security issues, defects, or introduces performance issues. The hope is that if coding is easier and faster, developers will have more time, responsibility, and better tools for validating the code before it gets embedded in applications. But will that happen?











 
 
 
“As developers adopt AI for productivity benefits, there’s a required responsibility to gut-check what it produces,” says Peter McKee, head of developer relations at Sonar. “Clean as you code ensures that by performing checks and continuous monitoring during the delivery process, developers can spend more time on new tasks rather than remediating bugs in human-created or AI-generated code.”
CIOs and CISOs will expect developers to perform more code validation, especially if AI-generated code introduces significant vulnerabilities. “If developers don’t implement automation to scan and monitor AI-generated code, it means exponentially more code to fix and more tech debt,” adds McKee.
Manufacturing as the new development paradigm
One question about using Gen-AI tools to develop code is how it will impact tools and standards at large organizations with many development teams supporting thousands of applications. What will development look like in larger organizations if developers write less code but integrate more genAI-developed code?











 
 
 
“The tooling mix across teams results in a lack of standards and complex onboarding, not to mention that it adds to the cognitive load of developers,” says Markus Eisele, developer tools strategy and evangelism at Red Hat. “A blend of best practices combined with easy access through centralized developer portals is here to change this. Topped with the enriched capabilities of an application platform, this has the potential to remove friction and help with applying best practices across team boundaries.”
The implication is that IDEs may morph into assembly platforms similar to computer-aided design (CAD) in manufacturing or building information modeling (BIM) in construction. The focus shifts from building custom components to assembling preexisting ones and leveraging built-in tools to validate the design. 
Less coding, but greater code supply-chain risks
Another implication of code developed with genAI concerns how enterprise leaders develop policies and monitor the supply chain of what code is embedded in enterprise applications. Until now, organizations were most concerned about tracking open source and commercial software components, but genAI adds new dimensions.











 
 
 
“Devops practitioners will play a major role in maintaining and managing the AI supply chain: the security, authenticity, and origins of AI-based models will come under more scrutiny in an enterprise’s day-to-day operations,” says Ilkka Turunen, Field CTO of Sonatype. “Implementing a strategy that evaluates AI risk and properly manages an AI model’s bill of materials will help ensure proper AI hygiene and management across the devops infrastructure of any organization.”
Expect SAST, DAST, and other security and code management tools to increase code-scanning automation capabilities and help validate whether genAI code meets policies before developers integrate code into enterprise repositories.
New paradigms accelerate integration
Developers can expect new capabilities in integrations, which have already seen orders of magnitude of improved capabilities over the last decade through APIs, IFTTT SaaS integration platforms, integration platforms as a service (iPaaS), and other ecosystem technologies. That said, developers still perform much work to map data fields, code transformation logic, ensure reliability, and adjust for performance considerations.











 
 
 
Emmanuel Cassimatis, AI and Innovation team at SAP, says, “When it comes to integration, the development lifecycle has historically been quite fragmented across its different steps, from design, build, test, integrate, deploy, deliver, and review. AI can allow unification by tapping a picture from data from different applications, resulting in greater collaboration between developers.” 
It’s only a matter of time before developers use genAI to build codeless, self-healing integrations with natural language requirements and auto-generated visual flows.
Developers as managers of AI agents
Phillip Carter, principal product manager at Honeycomb, believes that genAI will transform the tasks developers and quality assurance engineers will do in the future. “In the potentially far future, natural language is likely to guide more code generation and tests that verify generated code. If we see another massive shift in AI capabilities like the transformer, we can expect AI agents to do most of this work, with developers programming goals and constraints for these agents to follow.”











 
 
 
Carter continues with a bold prediction, saying, “With a new transformation that puts AI at the helm, it’s possible that programmed agents could be enabled to analyze runtime behavior for QA, observability, and security tasks to check known unknowns, something developers are often bogged down by.”
I find this prediction interesting, as it implies developers and engineers will move up the stack to define architecture, non-functional, and operational requirements—guiding genAI on developing and testing rather than writing code and automating tests.
Carter doesn’t believe in a developer-less future and continues, “Humans would remain in the loop at all times, concerned more with goals, constraints, and analyzing unique circumstances.”











 
 
 
AI touches multiple phases of the SDLC
While copilots and many genAI tools today focus on coding, expect new capabilities to transform other phases and responsibilities in the SDLC. Humberto Moreira, principal solutions engineer at Gigster, says, “As best practices evolve for incorporating genAI into the SDLC, different models might work best for particular phases of the cycle, for example, one model optimized for requirements, one for code development, and one for QA.”
The genAI paradigm shift is already impacting QA as tools enable more robust test cases and faster feedback on code changes,
“With the rise of AI, I think a less discussed aspect is how all the facilities around coding will witness a sea change,” says Gilad Shriki, co-founder of Descope. “It’s a matter of time before SDKs, testing, and documentation are AI-generated or assisted, which means developers will need to code and document their work in specific AI-consumable formats.”











 
 
 
Shriki’s last prediction suggests that developers may have to adjust their language, similar to how people must learn to speak the language that virtual assistants are programmed to comprehend. I hope this prediction doesn’t become a reality because it could mean that genAI only delivers conveniences and not necessarily productivity or quality improvements.
GenAI and human development personas emerge
GenAI’s role in software development could splinter off from the roles and responsibilities currently held by human developers. Tools like code generators, compilers, and other dev tools would serve both human and machine personas.

“What’s interesting is that I think there might end up being a new view of code: one view is that traditional human view of code, the one that developers are trained and accustomed to reading and writing, but then there’s a second, somewhat hidden view, which is the AI-security-optimized, defensive view,” says Dustin Kirkland, VP of engineering at Chainguard. “This view is less readable by humans but perfectly readable by compilers and interpreters, and in this way, it becomes just another intermediate format for code.”











 
 
 
The question is whether alternative views will improve machine learning’s ability to identify defects, security issues, and other problems more accurately and efficiently.
AI improves ops capabilities during the dev process
Cody De Arkland, director of developer experience at LaunchDarkly, suggests use cases when genAI can help improve application reliability and operations. “We can see the early signs of how dev tooling will learn from interactions, and the key will be intuitive assistance.”
De Arkland suggests these examples:











 
 
 

Develop web application components that match the learned design standards
Create the feature flag as it detects a developer building a new feature
Stage new software deployment (CI/CD), but also roll it back when it learns of problems
Enable real-time feedback loops to QA from customized runs instead of post-deployment

These ideas raise the question of what next-gen devops and SRE capabilities will be enabled or augmented by genAI. 
Organizations must protect themselves from AI risks
One last prediction concerns the risks of exposing genAI to the organization’s intellectual property, including code and data. As genAI enables new capabilities across the full SDLC, there will be new questions about whether the benefits outweigh the risks.
“As we work toward the vision of an end-to-end AI-enabled software development process, technology professionals across the board want to ensure that any code generated is of the highest quality and does not hurt the overall reliability or maintainability of the application,” says Brandon Jung, VP of ecosystem and business development at Tabnine. “With a keen eye on the data going into the model—both yours and the training set—take the time and effort to evaluate, select, and deploy AI in ways that protect your policies and your most valuable assets–your code and your data.”
The question is whether genAI algorithms and the tools that enable them will build safeguards to protect the enterprise’s assets and how much these protections will also rely on genAI capabilities.











 
 
 
While we’re still early in the genAI era of software development, it’s becoming clear that code generation and copilots are just the beginning of new AI-enabled ways to develop, test, deploy, and maintain software.

""Populating a spreadsheet may be the closest thing we have to leisure""

Many merely find busywork peaceful. I’ve enjoyed it since I was a sales associate at a major home furnishings retailer. There, I was often instructed to refold display towels that had already been perfectly folded and stowed on shelves earlier in the day. This was busywork in its purest form. The tasks themselves were totally nonessential. We did them because our manager believed that customers found the full attention of idle associates discomfiting.

And there was nothing stressful about the work. It allowed me to recover my wits in between high-stress incidences of talking to customers.

Danielle Li, an associate professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a co-author of a paper called “Generative AI at Work,” said she finds busywork soothing in part because it catapults her into a “flow state,” but also because it allows her to keep up the performance of work while resting her mind.

        Where human intuition fits amidst the growth of generative AI at work

Staff Writer

The uniquely human strengths of your team's Detectives 


Generative AI tools may become near ubiquitous in the way we work over the next few years, but new global research into common workplace personas – which found that nearly one in three Australian workers consider themselves to be ‘Detectives’ who prefer to find things out for themselves – suggests that humans aren’t quite ready to give up their roles as authoritative founts of wisdom and information.







The research – conducted by productivity platform Slack and market research firm YouGov – polled 15,492 desk workers worldwide to better understand the diversity of psychological traits in contemporary workplaces. Thirty-one per cent of the 1014 Australian respondents to the survey said that they best match ‘The Detective’ workplace persona, which is characterised by a burning personal curiosity to find the information they need rather than having it presented to them.
The study identified five distinct workplace personas, with Detectives working alongside ‘Road Warriors’, ‘Networkers’, ‘Problem Solvers’, and ‘Expressionists’ that run the gamut of individual working styles and information processing preferences.
Detectives – who are more common in western countries such as France (38% of respondents), the UK (34%) and US (33%), but less common in Singapore (21%) and India (16%) – were found to be far more likely to value finding the right information as quickly as possible, and sharing that information with others on their team.
Over half (53%) of Detectives said they were driven by a sense of purpose and job security, describing themselves as organised with a preference for figuring things out on their own. They are also most likely to be described by their colleagues as good at digging up information and knowing everything that’s going on at the company.
This is one of the reasons Detectives are so valuable to their teammates, says Slack APAC technology evangelist at Salesforce, Derek Laney, even amidst the emergence of generative AI-powered bots.
""My experience at work is that people like to connect with each other to find the answers to their pressing questions,"" Laney told iTnews. ""This is why we see the importance of The Detective in teams. This persona has a really good understanding of where knowledge lies and how to access it, and a productivity platform like Slack is purpose-built for that.” 
“Having the ability to find answers quickly and help others connect with that information easily is paramount - whether that’s via generative AI tools or through human action. But that approach shouldn’t be limited to The Detective persona alone. Building a culture within teams where people are encouraged to find the answer first before asking someone else is going to inherently boost your productivity.""
The power of intuition
With Gartner predicting that over 80% of enterprises will have deployed generative AI by 2026, desk workers are likely to increasingly look to those tools for answers rather than their colleagues.
Generative AI models are being trained on small data sets specific to one business or industry, theoretically making them more accurate and less prone to ‘hallucinations’ that have tainted their reputations as reliable sources of fact to date.
Law firm MinterEllison, for one, recently adopted a generative AI platform that is already being credited with saving up to five hours per day for half of those who have trialled it.
Such platforms will progressively be integrated with online collaboration platforms, putting more accurate answers at the fingertips of everybody in the team.
That’s likely to help many team members stop reinventing the proverbial wheel: “things go round and round in meetings because we’re not that great at capturing and reusing tacit information,” Laney said, noting that collaboration tools “are capturing more of this tacit work information and helping you synthesise that.”
Aiming to provide a range of ways for teams to engage, Slack has rolled out a broad range of collaboration tools that facilitate different types of communication – with features like huddles, clips, canvas and Slack Connect – complementing information services like Slack Atlas, and business process tools, such as Workflow Builder alongside over 2,600 app integrations.
Yet no matter how much new technology is adopted, and how quickly generative AI takes hold in the workplace, Laney warns that it’s premature to dismiss the humanistic elements, highlighting that Detectives will still be valued members of the team.
Many core information retrieval functions may be enhanced by generative AI tools, Laney said, but “not all things are going to be, or should be, automated.”
“Humans are really good at saying ‘I don’t feel quite right about that, although I don’t know why’,” he explained, highlighting the value of humans’ ability to “make non rational linkages between information. Neuroscientist Antonio Domasio said that we are not thinking machines that feel; rather, we are feeling machines that think.”
“That’s intuition, and that’s the brain doing its magic thing – and in partnership with AI you can start to use explorative tools to build out that intuition, and to say ‘Maybe that’s the answer that I’m looking for to validate what the brain is telling me.’”

Business leaders in the United States have revealed that they are more satisfied with their jobs thanks to artificial intelligence, according to a new report.
Tech.co's survey among 1,047 business leade3rs found tat 59% who are using AI in their roles said it has improved their job satisfaction.
Another 30% of the respondents said AI has had a ""strong"" or ""significant"" impact on their work processes.









The findings come amid recent research that only 22% of employees across the world are satisfied with their jobs in 2023.
According to Tech.co, their new findings suggest that ""artificial intelligence could be the key to increasing the amount of gratification employees receive from their job in 2024.""
Easily accessible AI tools
Aaron Drapkin, Tech.co's lead writer and AI expert, attributed AI's impact to its easily accessible nature.
""ChatGPT and co. wouldn't be impacting job satisfaction in quite the same way if they were more complicated to configure, cost lots of money, or became so intelligent that they rendered workers redundant,"" Drapkin said in a statement.

He noted that while it may cause major economic change in the future, its current capacity to support employees now makes it a ""significant net benefit"" for most workplaces.
""Right now, we're living in a proverbial sweet spot. The tools are free, easy to use and not powerful enough to work independently and replace the humans using them,"" he said.
""This is great - but none of these things are absolutes. AI clearly has the capacity to completely transform how we work - but ensuring this transformation continues to be gradual, manageable and beneficial will be no easy task.""
Uses of AI at work
According to the report, the top uses of AI in their workplace are data analysis (32%) and writing tasks (26%). Other uses include:










Scheduling and calendar management (21%)
Automated data entry (20%)
Quality control (20%)
Cybersecurity (20%)
Running customer support chatbots (19%)
Design tasks (19%)
Document classification and management (17%)
Inventory management (16%)

Drapkin said this shows how freely available AI tools are helping with a huge range of tasks, especially ones that employees find repetitive, boring, and time-consuming.
""We've never had tools this capable at our fingertips before, and the data suggests it's making a tangible difference to the lives of people using them,"" Drapkin said.

Artificial intelligence is beginning to impact jobs and policies within universities as adoption of the technology grows, a new study finds.
More than half (56 percent) of those surveyed said they have new responsibilities related to AI strategy, according to Educause, a nonprofit focused on education and technology. Most of those experiencing the change are executives (69 percent), followed by managers and directors (66 percent), staff (46 percent), and faculty members (39 percent).
“Above and beyond the other risks [with AI], the risk to our workforce is they’re already overworked and now we’re asking them to do extra things,” said Jenay Robert, a senior Educause researcher. She cautioned against adding more responsibilities without changes in job titles or descriptions.

“It’s an important finding in terms of supporting the workforce,” she said. “Codify the role in people’s jobs so they know what to expect.”
Educause’s first “AI Landscape Study” focuses on the impact of the increasingly pervasive technology. The study polled 910 people who work at universities, surveying them in November and December. 
Its findings delved into new topics: namely, how—or if—AI is shaking up faculty members’ jobs, both in the work they are doing and how they use the technology.

“When October, November was rolling around, there was a shift where AI wasn’t a brand-new hot topic, but people were settling in, having job roles dedicated to it,” Robert said.
Few of the respondents were aware of new jobs being created because of AI, with only 11 percent stating they knew of new job creation. New jobs that were created included chief AI officer, senior AI adviser, chief data scientist and AI program manager.
The survey also touched on AI policies, which have been discussed but often remain murky for academics. Nearly half of respondents were not happy with the AI policies their university had in place, with 48 percent stating those policies did not address ethical and effective decision-making. About 20 percent of respondents said their AI-related policies were somewhat or extremely restrictive, in some cases banning students or faculty from using AI tools.

Of the universities making AI policies, nearly half of institutions (43 percent) are working with a third party to develop AI strategy, while 30 percent are working with peer institutions or networks and 22 percent are working with professional associations.
The largest focus of the newly created or altered policies is on teaching and learning (95 percent). Academic integrity falls in that category, according to respondents, with 72 percent saying their academic integrity policies have been impacted by AI. Policies related to technology, cybersecurity and data privacy were also affected.
Only 11 percent of respondents said that no one at their institution is working on AI-related strategy, with 73 percent stating “some or most” departments are working on some sort of AI strategy.

Despite the work on policies, Robert said there needs to be more communication across the walls often created in academia.
“I think the take-home message is if folks are not sure they can use the technology or know the risks, to reach across the silos and talk to people in privacy, security and IT departments and see what already exists,” she said. “And as the use cases bubble up [from faculty and staff], it’ll help leaders figure out what new policies or guidelines need to be created.”
Most of the policymaking, according to the survey, is due to fears that students are using AI for “inappropriate” purposes, with 68 percent of respondents stating that as a concern.
There’s also a focus on preparing students for the workforce, with 64 percent of respondents calling that their biggest goal. Only 25 percent planned on using AI adoption for research purposes, and just 17 percent viewed AI adoption as a way to boost the institution’s reputation.
Despite the growing focus on AI, there is still a lack of formalized training at institutions: only 56 percent of universities train their faculty members in AI, with the numbers dipping for staff (49 percent) and students (39 percent). There’s also a lack of long-term focus and goals, according to the report, which found only 7 percent of institutions are working to establish AI-focused senior leadership positions and just 14 percent are budgeting for long-term AI costs.
Consistent with many other recent surveys, the Educause study also found that generally there is cautious optimism about AI among faculty, an acknowledgment that AI must to be taught to students and ever-present concerns about academic integrity.

At the beginning of the school year, each of my 11th grade teachers stated that they would not tolerate students using AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. They explained that any use of AI would be considered plagiarism and could result in a failing grade.
Despite these warnings, I regularly hear my classmates laugh about how they used ChatGPT for the prior night’s homework. Their gloats are often accompanied by comments along the lines of “Work smarter, not harder” and “Teachers literally make it so easy to use AI.”
My classmates at the public high school I attend in New York City are not unusual: In a recent survey, 89 percent of students who responded said they had used ChatGPT for homework.
 
 

It’s easy for teachers to admonish students not to use ChatGPT and then blame them when they do. But educators must realize that the work they are assigning, which largely relies on rote memorization, is a perfect fit for artificial intelligence.
Rather than browbeat students for using AI, maybe educators should outsmart AI by reimagining education so that it requires more creativity and critical thought, the aspects that separate people from robots.

Related: ‘We’re going to have to be a little more nimble’: How school districts are responding to AI
Since third grade, I have been taking standardized tests. Now that I’m older, these include Regents exams, New York State tests and Advanced Placement assessments. My teachers say that our scores on these tests are a reflection of our academic proficiency, as well as a predictor of our future academic and professional success.
Yet, in my experience, all standardized tests do is reduce nearly every class, even the most interesting, to regurgitation.
Take AP Psychology. I signed up for this class because I am fascinated by the subject, especially the philosophical and open-ended aspects that require thoughtful discussion and analysis. But rather than encouraging us to engage with psychology’s intellectual premises, the class requires us to memorize roughly 400 terms.
 
 

If I can remember each term and its definition, I will have set myself up for success in the class and on the final AP exam.
Sounds fascinating and enlightening, right? Not to me. Unfortunately, this is the current state of education. Exams and teaching to the test have become so ingrained in education that little to no room is left for creative learning, rich discussion, critical thought or the development of emotional intelligence.
These are the very skills and activities that separate people from robots, yet instead of developing them, students are told to act like robots and simply spit back information on exams.
Ironically, AI is, of course, much better at being a robot than a typical student is; systems like ChatGPT can access and spit back large swaths of information better than any person.
Thus, it is no surprise that GPT-4 clocks high scores on the bar exam, SAT and multiple AP exams, including a 5 (the highest possible score) on AP Psychology.
These results show that the modern student is susceptible to AI takeover. If educators wish to effectively prevent AI from entering classrooms, they must reimagine the way students are taught.
 
 

Rethinking education in America should include a move away from teaching to the test and a push toward project-based learning, which encourages students to collaborate, examine and analyze real-world issues and apply scientific research to solve problems.

This approach might even drive test scores higher. A 2021 study estimated that students whose curricula included KIA, a project-based learning approach, would be 8 percent more likely to earn a passing score on AP exams.
While project-based learning may help lift standardized test scores, its real power lies in improving problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. These skills are vital for current students who are preparing for a world with AI.
According to one report, AI could eventually replace 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. The jobs that AI is currently unlikely to be able to replace are the ones that require problem-solving and critical thinking, as well as those that require complex communication, decision-making, creativity and emotional intelligence.
Education is a means to getting a job and being successful. Simply put, for my generation and future generations to succeed, we are going to need much more than rote memorization skills. The good news is that the skills we need are the ones that make learning fun, challenging and exciting.
We are at a crossroads. Educators, policymakers and everyone with an interest in the future of work has a decision to make: They can either continue supporting an education system that teaches students to think in ways that AI can clearly do better, or they can decide to reform education to prepare students for the not-to-distant world of the future.

Sure, AI tools are becoming more common, but generally they are some way from automating entire roles.A real estate agent might use ChatGPT to write a property listing, but AI can't yet open the door of the house.Still, there are a few professions that are already feeling the bite — and the experiences of these workers may be a helpful insight into what's to come for those who aren't yet affected.Copywriters, and in particular freelance copywriters, are seeing large parts of their work automated, and their labour devalued.They're now adapting by learning new AI skills and specialising in the types of work the bots are currently bad at.So, are these copywriters the canaries in the coal mine for AI-led automation?Here's what they have to say about the future of work.An AI tool crashes through a professionLast year, not long after the launch of ChatGPT, Leanne Shelton braced herself for turbulent times.The Sydney-based copywriter, who'd built up her freelance business over nine years, knew that change was coming.And she knew that freelancers, who were less insulated from market shocks than permanent employees, were going to feel the impact first.For Ms Shelton, business soon started drying up.""Clients were like, 'There's this free tool. Why would we invest $2,000 for copywriting when we can get something for free?'""Tim King, a Bendigo-based copywriter, experienced the same.""I saw a 45 per cent reduction in overall lead generation,"" he said. Bendigo-based copywriter and marketing strategist Tim King.(Supplied: Tim King)Lindsay, a copywriter in Sydney, was made redundant at a cybersecurity firm.""They wanted to save costs and so they cut my role,"" she said.""They thought the executives could write their own content using ChatGPT.""Looking for employment, she was alarmed by how far salaries in her line of work, and at her level of experience, had fallen.""A job that would have been mid-management level on $120,000 plus super is now around $90,000.""Tanya Abdul Jalil, a freelance education writer, has colleagues ""desperately scratching"" for work.""Especially the ones whose blogs are their bread and butter,"" she said.""Something that used to take four to five hours and get them a full day's pay can be produced in minutes.""WatchDuration: 6 minutes 42 seconds6m  Expert reveals top occupations affected by the introduction of AI.Perth-based copywriter Kara Stokes sees many in her profession left with a simple choice: adapt or get out.""It’s like Blockbuster Video,"" she said.""They didn't adapt and we saw what happened there.""The problem of measuring AI's effects on employmentIf AI is already having such a dramatic impact on copywriters, how is this reflected in their workforce statistics?The short answer is that it's not. Or at least not yet, experts say.""Workforce statistics always lag reality, right?"" Kylie Walker, CEO of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE), said.""But when you're hearing the same stories arising in multiple places, then it's time to start listening.""Measuring how AI affects employment in general is a problem for economists.This is partly due to a lack of data. Employers may not be transparent about why they're laying off workers or cutting hours.The effect of an AI tool that augments an existing role, rather than replacing it, may not show in employment figures either. Copywriter Zoe Simmons says she's noticed a lot of adverts for jobs editing AI content.(Supplied: Emma Veness)But some studies can detect recent trends.Around midway through last year, three US economists studied jobs and earnings data for copywriters and graphic designers on major online freelancing platforms.They chose freelancers partly because they were most exposed to the repercussions of AI automation, one of the economists, Washington University's Oren Reshef, said.""Freelancers are generally less protected from adverse market shocks compared to more standard employment.""And at the current state of the technology, I believe AI is much better able to replace specific, well-designed tasks, like a short freelance project.""That is, freelancers don't have much job security, and their work is more likely to consist of short, well-defined tasks, which makes it easier to feed this work to AI.The Australian jobs being lost to AI under the radarAustralians are already losing work to AI, but the impact so far has been largely hidden from view. But not to people like Benjamin, whose job was replaced by a chatbot. Read moreThe results of the study were published as a non-peer-reviewed working paper in August.They showed within a few months of ChatGPT's launch, copywriters and graphic designers saw a significant drop in the number of jobs they got and even steeper declines in earnings.And when they dug deeper into the data, the economists found an interesting trend.Being a more skilled freelancer was no defence against loss of work or earnings. This may seem counter-intuitive at first, Dr Reshef said, ""but it makes a lot of sense on second thought"".""Who do we expect to benefit the most from a new technology that improves the quality of your work or your output? Probably those that didn't do a great job to begin with.""Simply put, AI helps level the playing field across all workers.""Automation doesn't mean mass unemployment Freelance education writer Tanya Abdul Jalil has dodged the negative impact of AI by focusing on marketing and business coaching.(Supplied: Tanya Abdul Jalil)Just as less experienced copywriters might earn more by generating and editing AI content, an experienced copywriter who once earned a decent wage may be paid less to do the same job.Mr King, the Bendigo-based copywriter, has noticed this trend.""AI has lowered the bar and increased the ability for [non-copywriters] to generate content,"" he said.""Our creative services as a whole have been devalued.""But there's a risk of generalising too much from short-term data like those used in last year's freelancer study, said Xiang Hui, also from Washington University and a co-author of the working paper.Technology changes, but so do people. AI may improve and be able to automate a higher proportion of existing roles, but people adapt. They learn new skills and apply for new kinds of jobs.Dr Hui said it's hard to predict what will happen in the long run.""The technology improves and its capability to replace certain jobs gets better.""But workers increasingly adopt these new technologies, and the nature of jobs and skills they require may also change over time.""Late last year, ATSE announced that AI could automate 25 to 46 per cent of existing Australian jobs by 2030.But automation doesn't equal unemployment, Ms Walker, ATSE CEO, said.""There will be a shift in where the employment occurs, and in what people are employed for.""Jobs will be there. They just may not be the jobs that we intimately know today.""Copywriters are adapting to AISo what can copywriters teach us about adapting to AI?Having seen the writing on the wall, Ms Shelton, the Sydney-based copywriter, swiftly pivoted to AI coaching last year.She now earns more from teaching people how to use generative AI tools than she does from copywriting.""I pretty much started listening to podcasts and reading books about AI,"" she said.""[When] 150 people registered for the first webinar, I realised I was onto something."" The AI chatbot ChatGPT launched at the end of 2022, amassing 100 million users within a couple of months.(ABC News: Gian De Poloni)Zoe Simmons, who has physical and mental disabilities, said her type of writing — focusing on her experience of disabilities — meant she'd avoided the downturn.""Thankfully lived experience is something a robot or AI cannot do,"" she said.Mr King has rebranded as a marketing strategist, advising clients on how to promote their product, rather than just writing copy.And when he does write copy, he uses AI.""For me, it's a tool that I use to infinitely speed up my processes. ""Potentially AI will take your job but at the end of the day it means we can shift into higher value work.""Whether or not AI means workers end up doing less of the drudge work, early studies show it can boost the efficiency of ""knowledge workers"" (such as analysts, engineers, and accountants) at some tasks.In a recent Harvard Business School study, employees at Boston Consulting Group were randomly assigned access to GPT-4, OpenAI's latest large language model. Those using AI completed 12.2 per cent more tasks while doing them 25.1 per cent faster. They also produced higher quality work compared to those not using AI.As with the freelancer study, the least-skilled workers benefited the most from AI.""People in the lower half of that distribution had a much larger productivity bump,"" Edward McFowland, co-author of the Harvard study, said at the time.""But on average, everyone seems to do better.”AI can be helpful, but sometimes notThese findings may sound simple enough, but there's one big catch that has implications for how AI may be used to automate office work.When the Boston Consulting Group consultants were given tasks beyond a certain threshold of complexity and nuance, those who used AI did worse.How Australians are already using ChatGPTFrom consulting ChatGPT for relationship advice to asking it to write a love poem on behalf of your dog, here are stories of the novel and unexpected ways Australians have been using generative AI.Read moreThat is, AI isn't always helpful.Sometimes, it makes workers worse at their jobs.And it gets still more complicated.

Quick LinksWhat Is AI Poisoning?   How to Use Nightshade      

Key Takeaways


 Nightshade is an AI tool that ""poisons"" digital art, making it unusable for training AI models. 
 The tool alters digital artwork in a way that appears unchanged to humans but confuses AI algorithms. 
 Nightshade provides a way for digital creators to protect their work from being used in AI datasets without consent. 









 AI tools are revolutionary and can now hold conversations, generate human-like text, and create images based on a single word. However, the training data these AI tools use often comes from copyrighted sources, especially when it comes to text-to-image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, and others. 

 Stopping generative AI tools using copyright images to train is difficult, and artists from all walks of life have struggled to protect their work from AI training datasets. But now, that's all changing with the advent of Nightshade, a free AI tool built to poison the output of generative AI tools—and finally let artists take some power back. 


 What Is AI Poisoning? 
 AI poisoning is the act of ""poisoning"" the training dataset of an AI algorithm. This is similar to providing wrong information to the AI on purpose, resulting in the trained AI malfunctioning or failing to detect an image. Tools like Nightshade alter the pixels in a digital image in such a manner that it appears to be completely different to the AI training on it, but largely unchanged from the original to the human eye. 





 Thongden Studio/Shutterstock   

 For example, if you upload a poisoned image of a car to the internet, it will look the same to us humans, but an AI attempting to train itself to identify cars by looking at images of cars on the internet will see something completely different. 

 A large enough sample size of these fake or poisoned images in an AI's training data can damage its ability to generate accurate images from a given prompt as the AI's understanding of the object is compromised. 

 There are still a few questions on what the future holds for Generative AI, but protecting original digital work is a definite priority. This can even damage future iterations of the model as the training data upon which the model's foundation is built isn't 100% correct. 





 Using this technique, digital creators who do not consent for their images to be used in AI datasets can protect them from being fed to generative AI without permission. Some platforms provide creators the option to opt out of including their artwork in AI training datasets. However, such opt-out lists have been disregarded by AI model trainers in the past and continue to be disregarded with little to no consequence. 

 Compared to other digital artwork protection tools like Glaze, Nightshade is offensive. Glaze prevents AI algorithms from mimicking the style of a particular image, while Nightshade changes the image's appearance to the AI. Both tools are built by Ben Zhao, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. 



 How to Use Nightshade 
 While the creator of the tool recommends Nightshade be used alongside Glaze, it can also be used as a standalone tool to protect your artwork. Using the tool is also fairly easy, considering there are only three steps to protecting your images with Nightshade. 





 However, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before getting started. 
 Nightshade is only available for Windows and MacOS with limited GPU support and a minimum of 4GB VRAM required. Non-Nvidia GPUs and Intel Macs aren't supported at the moment. Here's a list of supported Nvidia GPUs according to the Nightshade team (the GTX and RTX GPUs are found in the ""CUDA-Enabled GeForce and TITAN Products"" section). Alternatively, you can run Nightshade on your CPU, but it'll result in slower performance.  If you have a GTX 1660, 1650, or 1550, a bug in the PyTorch library can prevent you from launching or using Nightshade properly. The team behind Nightshade may fix it in the future by moving from PyTorch to Tensorflow, but there are no workarounds at the moment. The issue also extends to the Ti variants of these cards. I launched the program by providing administrator access on my Windows 11 PC and waiting a few minutes for it to open. Your mileage may vary.  If your artwork has lots of solid shapes or backgrounds, you may experience some artifacts. This can be countered by using a lower intensity of ""poisoning.""  





 As far as protecting your images with Nightshade goes, here's what you need to do. Keep in mind that this guide uses the Windows version, but these steps also apply to the macOS version. 

 Download the Windows or macOS version from the Nightshade download page.  Nightshade downloads as an archived folder with no installation required. Once the download is complete, extract the ZIP folder and double-click Nightshade.exe to run the program.  Select the image you want to protect by clicking the Select button in the top-left. You can also select multiple images at once for batch processing.      Adjust the Intensity and Render Quality dials according to your preferences. Higher values add stronger poisoning but can also introduce artifacts in the output image.  Next, click the Save As button under the Output section to select a destination for the output file.  Click the Run Nightshade button at the bottom to run the program and poison your images.  

 Optionally, you can also select a poison tag. Nightshade will automatically detect and suggest a single word tag if you don't, but you can change it if it's incorrect or too general. Keep in mind this setting is only available when you process a single image in Nightshade. 

 If all goes well, you should get an image that looks identical to the original one to the human eye but completely different to an AI algorithm—protecting your artwork from generative AI.

A new bipartisan Senate bill seeks to improve the U.S. pipeline for jobs in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies through the development of a workforce framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
The “AI and Critical Technology Workforce Framework Act,” introduced by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., would direct NIST to create a workforce framework for AI and assess whether other critical or emerging technology areas might also benefit from frameworks, according to bill text and a release provided to FedScoop.
“As artificial intelligence continues to play a bigger role in our society, it’s critical the future of this groundbreaking technology is formed in the United States. The way to ensure that happens is by building a workforce engaged in these new technologies,” Peters, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a written statement.
The bill is intended to build upon NIST’s existing National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework — which outlines cybersecurity roles in an effort to help employers build their cyber workforces — as AI is poised to reshuffle the workforce.

Over the next five years, demand for AI and machine learning specialists is expected to increase by 40%, according to a 2023 World Economic Forum report on workforce trends across the world. 
“This bill will ensure that America continues to have a strong and increasingly skilled workforce, will utilize AI to bolster American industry, and will incentivize companies to keep their jobs in the United States rather than outsourcing them overseas,” Schmitt said in a written statement. “Additionally, this bill’s potential to benefit our defense capabilities is endless.”
Under the bill, NIST would be required to report to Congress about other critical and emerging technology areas it finds could benefit from a workforce framework. It would also direct NIST to update the NICE framework to reflect changes in the cybersecurity field and “encourage” the agency to provide resources and guidance on cybersecurity careers to students and adults, according to the release.

Although generative AI is not  new as a concept, it is only since late 2022 when ChatGPT launched, that the technology has hit the mainstream. The sophistication and accessibility of ChatGPT and its successor GPT-4, as well as that of DALL-E (which is for images) and Google’s Bard, have created both excitement and fear around its potential uses – and misuses.
Some commentators believe that generative AI will revolutionise work and society in ways that we’re unprepared for or cannot yet imagine; some predictions even verge on apocalyptic. Others recognise the enormous potential of generative AI but believe that its development and impact on business will follow a pattern similar to all other transformational technologies: there will be a period of hype during which the possibilities are thought to be endless, but the hype will subside and people will become more realistic about the potential and the limitations of the technology.
Generative AI in its current form – impressively sophisticated and accessible to all – is only in its infancy and its full potential is still not fully understood. But setting expectations for its impact and planning accordingly is something that all business leaders should be thinking about. Will generative AI fundamentally change business operations and workforce requirements? Two experts have their say.
Generative AI has great potential, but it is ultimately just another tool in the toolbox






                    Andy Sturrock 

                    Chief technology officer, Atom Bank 


Generative AI has been overhyped, but I’m not sure that it’s been more overhyped than any other technology. The Gartner hype cycle is revealing. You see so many technologies go through that hype curve: a piece of tech is introduced, there’s minimal interest at first, then it catches on and people start to think it’s going to solve all of their problems. But eventually the hype cools and the technology is regarded as just another useful tool.
In this way almost all technology with transformational potential will be overhyped. So is generative AI more overhyped than any other technology relative to its potential? I’m not sure. 
Generative AI won’t replace workforces en masse and it won’t be the final destination. There will be a ‘next thing’
I do think there’s a greater sense, especially among the less technical people in organisations, that generative AI will be some kind of ‘magic-bullet’ solution. By this I mean people have the tendency to think this is a tool that can solve all their problems relating to efficiency and they won’t need as many people. For generative AI, this thinking likely stems from the fact that the technology is accessible to almost everyone and that many of the analogies we use to talk about it – that computers are ‘thinking’ or ‘learning’ – create an element of science fiction.
In reality, generative AI has not been, and is unlikely to become, a magic-bullet solution. For another example of the hype cycle, consider how the market for cloud services developed: at one time people thought that storing all of your data in the cloud meant that you wouldn’t need to have backups and you wouldn’t have to employ infrastructure engineers. But it just hasn’t happened that way. You do still need backups and you do still need infrastructure engineers; it’s just that rather than doing cabling they’re now doing infrastructure as code.
With any major technological advance, stretching further back than even the cotton loom, there is often the worry that huge swathes of the workforce will be replaced, but they never are. People don’t become obsolete; skills become obsolete. With the cotton loom, with the internet, with the cloud, we have never needed fewer people. Instead, we need people with different skills to do jobs that didn’t exist before.
This is not to say that generative AI doesn’t have huge potential and that it won’t have a profound impact on businesses. The cloud was overhyped in its early days, but it has been incredibly beneficial. I would never go back to cabling and installing physical hardware. Similarly, generative AI will undoubtedly have major impacts on organisations and workforces. But it is not a magic bullet. It won’t replace workforces en masse and it won’t be the final destination in technological advancement. There will be a ‘next thing’ and generative AI will become just another tool in the toolbox.





In the long term, the impact of generative AI on business and society is understated

Although generative AI has been overhyped in the near term, the long-term potential of the technology within the business landscape and the impact it will have on organisations is massively understated. 
Every major industry will be faced with significant changes to both business operations and the workforce because of generative AI. And while the uses we’ve seen so far are primarily early examples of experimentation, firms in areas such as retail, financial services, oil and gas, consumer goods and healthcare are finding more sophisticated applications. 
It’s here that data quality, governance and effective AI guardrails will need to be further developed. Many organisations and tech leaders are unprepared for this challenge.
Most organisations are unprepared for the risks and will face massive challenges if they don’t act quickly
Leaders need guidance on how best to experiment, pilot and adopt generative AI ethically, and ensure the quality and privacy of data. Our annual global study of 600 data leaders found that two in five generative AI adopters cite data quality as the main obstacle to adoption, followed by data privacy and governance, and AI ethics.
Before unleashing AI-powered innovation and making it easily accessible to such a variety of public and private sector decision-makers (available to everyone, really), leaders need to tackle uncertainty around how to harness its power. This will include answering questions about how to structure input data, ensure processes are in place to protect the data being stored and processed, and avoid undesirable AI-generated outputs that could lead to disastrous consequences.
The first step of strong AI governance is to ensure you can trust the data powering the models. Put it another way, generative AI has brought data accuracy to a tipping point.
Take an example from the healthcare industry. To ensure the veracity of AI outputs in the context of patient treatment and monitoring, we need trustworthy and accurate patient information. Just one mistake in managing that data can have dangerous consequences. Data needs to be accurate, complete, consistent, timely, valid and unique long before it can be used to power a generative AI application.
Concerns around adapting processes are one thing, but the real risk is in using AI without the proper safeguards in place. Most organisations are unprepared for these risks and will face massive challenges if they don’t act quickly. The smartest companies will make sure their data is ready for generative AI before jumping in. They’ll double down on AI governance, ethics and data accuracy, embedding these into AI systems from the start.

No job is more important than educating young minds, and no AI will ever replace a great teacher. However, educators are already using generative AI to help with creative tasks or automate routine aspects of their work. This frees up more time for the really important jobs, like spending time with students.


With generative AI poised to transform every profession, understanding the impact it will have on our day-to-day working lives, the opportunities it creates for innovation and improvement, and, of course, the potential risks is critical for everyone.

So, I thought it would be a good idea to put together a series of quick guides to how different jobs and professions will likely change, starting with teaching.

Here, I‘ll overview some of how generative AI is already being used to augment the irreplaceable human skills needed in education. We’ll also take a peek into the future to think about how the fundamental role of the teacher will evolve thanks to the impact of this technology.

PROMOTED
Augmenting Teaching Skills
In late 2023, the UK government examined how generative AI is being used in education through a call for evidence.
After speaking to teachers, they found that most reported that they were already using generative AI tools in their jobs or had experimented with them. Those who used them said that benefits included saving time, improving the quality of their teaching, and improving engagement with students.

· Language learning and translating – Enabling teachers to communicate more effectively with multi-lingual classes.
Generative AI isn’t without risks, though. Inaccurate responses, inappropriate content, and bias can all clearly cause big problems when they occur in an educational setting. While I believe teachers and educators should be encouraged to experiment with the technology, these are risks that have to be kept in mind.
Personalized Learning 
This is one of the most exciting potential use cases for generative AI in education.
Children (and students of all ages) all learn differently, and with generative AI, it will be possible to create individualized lessons and learning plans. These could be tailor-made to fit the needs of specific students.
For example, students who show they are better at taking in information visually can be shown more pictures, charts, and graphs, while others may learn better from puzzles, tasks, and games.
Online course providers such as Coursera already use feedback algorithms to adjust course content and learning speed based on performance. In the near future, I expect to see this extended to traditional classroom-based learning, too.
Generative AI can also provide personalized feedback more frequently and in greater detail than a teacher can manually when dealing with a large class.
AI can be a particularly valuable resource for providing for learners with special educational needs. Teachers will use AI to augment their own ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different teaching and learning methods.
It also has huge potential to help “lifelong learners” – those members of the workforce who are consistently updating their knowledge and learning new skills to take on new challenges and responsibilities.
Learners in this group can come with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, so generative AI can be used to identify the best teaching strategies.
However, this is one education-related field where privacy and security will be particularly critical. Algorithms like those described here would require personal and very sensitive data, and great care will have to be taken to mitigate the risks of data breaches or loss.
Automating Routine Work
Most teachers prefer to spend more time working in direct contact with students and less time on tasks like grading papers or drafting routine communications.
Good news! These are exactly the type of tasks that generative AI can be very good at. There are already several platforms on the market offering specialized generative tools to help teachers with these jobs, including Teachermatic and Microsoft’s Education Copilot.
These can accelerate repetitive but vital tasks like writing letters and emails to pupils or their families, creating class newsletters, summarizing reports and producing documents like policy and risk assessment materials.
Grading papers might be a more controversial use case, particularly as we know that generative AI can sometimes have accuracy issues. At the moment, this is mostly in an experimental phase, with teachers testing its capabilities but not yet using it to assign final grades.
Other popular uses that are relevant in teaching include transcribing text from video-based learning materials or converting text into voice for audio-based learning, proofreading teaching materials, and creating compliance checklists for tasks such as safeguarding or data protection.
The Changing Role Of Teachers
As generative AI reshapes the world of education, teachers will find their role evolving further away from being providers of knowledge and towards becoming learning facilitators.
Perhaps the most significant shift in the role of educators will be an increased focus on nurturing skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. These skills will be paramount in a future where our worth is increasingly measured by our ability to perform tasks that machines cannot do or are not as proficient in. Beyond academic teaching, educators play a critical role in safeguarding the welfare of their students, a responsibility that extends far beyond the confines of traditional teaching. This involves not only protecting students from physical harm but also supporting their emotional and mental health, ensuring a safe and inclusive learning environment that fosters resilience and respect. The human touch provided by teachers becomes an indispensable pillar of education, emphasizing the irreplaceable value of empathy and understanding in nurturing well-rounded, emotionally secure individuals.
Teachers will, of course, also have a very important role to play in making sure their students are able to use generative AI itself. For decades, essential technology skills like coding, word processing, or computer-aided design have been an essential part of the curriculum. Very soon, a basic grasp of interacting with AI systems will be critical from a young age, too, and today’s teachers will have the job of passing on that knowledge.
This shift will require educators to become proficient not just in their subject matter or field of education but also in navigating the tools and technologies that are already rewriting the rules of teaching and learning.

                Generative AI may have a ‘high human cost,’ SHRM report says
            
As job roles change, reductions in force will likely be necessary, but so will learning and development opportunities, the report said.

In the decade ahead, CHROs and their colleagues will need to navigate several disruptions due to increasing adoption of generative AI in the workplace, according to a report from the Society for Human Resource Management and The Burning Glass Institute.
And those challenges will be most notable at companies in three industries, SHRM said: finance and insurance; professional services; and information systems.
These changes could come at a “a high human cost,” the report said, though such costs may be temporary. “If your company sits in a highly exposed industry or has functions composed of at-risk roles, generative AI will be especially disruptive,” the report authors wrote.

Because many roles will shift, reskilling will become increasingly important, especially as job roles and skill sets transform, according to the report. For instance, traditional customer service roles may pivot to focus on managing chatbots or overseeing automated processes. Data analysts may transition to become AI data specialists. In many of these cases, training may be necessary.
Additionally, “in light of the so-called digital divide in Americans’ access to technology, the potential exists for harmful effects to your organization’s inclusion, equity and diversity (IE&D) efforts,” they wrote; leaders will have to perform assessments to guide workforce planning.
Generative AI will also affect HR functions in a number of areas, according to the report:
Talent acquisition: In the short-term, recruiting AI talent will be difficult. In the long-term, though, leaders will face changing difficulty in filling various roles.
Labor force: Headcounts will shift away from tasks that have been automated and toward AI-augmented responsibilities. 
Learning and development: Leaders will need to invest in reskilling existing talent to fill AI roles, as well as train workers in eliminated positions to assume other roles.
Compensation: Salaries will need to adjust to changes in the labor market, particularly the roles that incorporate AI-related skills.
Diversity, equity and inclusion implications: CHROs will need to ensure that displacement doesn’t disproportionately affect underrepresented groups and that new opportunities are accessible to a diverse pool of talent. Although it may feel tempting to use AI for HR practices such as sourcing new hires, generative AI tools may replicate existing biases and work against diversity, equity and inclusion goals.

“Despite the best efforts of savvy HR leaders, workforce reductions will become increasingly pressing as generative AI transforms the macroeconomic landscape,” the report authors wrote. “HR leaders must remember that layoffs are not the only downsizing option available; more subtle strategies, such as implementing hiring freezes and leveraging natural attrition, can be deployed to minimize disruption to employees.”
By 2032, generative AI will significantly change half of all jobs, according to research by Cognizant and Oxford Economics. As a result, 9% of the current U.S. workforce may be displaced, and 1% of those workers may struggle to find new employment.
Between 2010-2019, AI usage — through tools such as language processing, image recognition and algorithm-based recommendations — spurred some job growth, according to a report by the European Central Bank. However, the jury is still out on whether the same will happen with new AI-related developments, the researchers wrote.
According to an Indeed report, all jobs posted on the site, ranging from truck drivers to software engineers, have skills that can be augmented or replaced by AI. At the same time, only 1 in 5 is considered “highly exposed” to the technology, where AI could perform 80% or more of the skills listed in the job posting.
In particular, mid-career professionals and managers appear to be most at risk for AI disruption, according to another Indeed report. Roughly 1 in 8 mid-career professionals work in management, which also faces high exposure, where AI could perform 68% of the required skills listed in job postings.

Across all disciplines norms are being established around the role of generative AI in research. Discussing a recent LSE Impact Blogpost on academic responses to AI, Eric A. Jensen suggests that clear, practical guidance needs to be developed by specific research associations and institutions.

Large language models (LLMs) have already altered the landscape of academic research. In a recent blogpost for Fast Track Impact alongside colleagues, I summarised a few of the practical ways we have started to use generative AI to boost our efficiency and effectiveness in tasks ranging from research communication, to funding applications, survey design and data analysis. There is now a nascent body of academic literature that highlights opportunities and critiques of using generative AI (GenAI) in contemporary research and the decisions being taken now will shape how this technology is used in the future.
Conducted in the summer of 2023, the survey found that 51.5% said ‘Yes’ to the question, ‘Do you use generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) for work-related purposes?’.
The initial public reaction to GenAI in academia has skewed negative. This is understandable. These tools come with the usual ethical baggage of Big Tech, connotations of plagiarism, highly questionable use of the intellectual property and many other legitimate concerns. In a recent blogpost for the LSE Impact Blog and research paper (Generative AI and the Automating of Academia) Richard Watermeyer, Donna Lanclos and Lawrie Phipps make a valuable contribution outlining potential sociological implications of GenAI’s integration into academic professional life. Reporting the results of an online survey of UK academics they express concern that GenAI tools will further embed the malignant neoliberal managerialism that has infected UK academia (and beyond). Conducted in the summer of 2023, the survey found that 51.5% said ‘Yes’ to the question, ‘Do you use generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) for work-related purposes?’. While there is no way to know if this is a representative finding given the convenience sampling used, it highlights the impact GenAI is now having on academic life.
The survey records positive and negative views from respondents, although the authors interpret this evidence in a largely negative way arguing GenAI:
“further contracts academics’ engagement with critical thinking and contemplative labour […]. In deluding academics of the merits of its productive efficiencies G[en]AI may become a weapon of some considerable self-harm”.
and
“In accelerating already hyper-stimulated work regimes in universities, generative AI may exacerbate an epidemic of burn out among academics and cause them to leave their roles in even greater numbers than are already reported”.
However, this evidence could just as easily run in the opposite direction and the claim could be made that GenAI can reduce academic burnout. The full dataset for this survey has not been made publicly available, but even selected quotations include a suggestion that GenAI tools can reduce workload pressure, for example, “It takes some of the pain out of admin”. Moreover, the finding that “83% of respondents stated that they anticipated using [GenAI] tools more in the future” suggests that UK academics feel these tools are useful.
These views of GenAI can be contrasted with optimistic accounts, such as those of Salah et al., who see potential for improving social science data collection and analysis. This viewpoint emphasises how GenAI can deliver superior research processes or outcomes in specific domains, such as textual analysis and developing analysis categories for qualitative data. In this instance because of the efficiency of GenAI tools, the expectation is that they will become ever more central to research. GenAI optimists tend to see the ethical, justice, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, methodological and theoretical issues raised by GenAI use as significant, but manageable, and they tend not to comment on the sociological implications beyond the potential for job losses. Among GenAI ‘cautious optimists’ there is a recognition that clear ethical guidelines must be established, along with institutional regulations, to limit the use of these tools in order to mitigate risks and potential harms.
Claims to moral purity based on avoiding GenAI tools are dubious at best.
Both optimistic and pessimistic accounts of GenAI’s evolving role in academic research acknowledge that the practical benefits of these tools are driving their use. I have seen these benefits in my own professional experience, including enabling me to rapidly re-size and re-shape my academic research outputs for different audiences and uses (e.g., shifting from a journal article to a conference presentation). With new tools, there is a tendency to only focus on risk. For some, this is a way of avoiding the need to learn new, unfamiliar ways of doing things. Change can be uncomfortable, and claiming to be resisting the adoption of new tools to maintain moral purity can be an effective short-term tactic to stave off the inevitable.
Claims to moral purity based on avoiding GenAI tools are dubious at best. Anybody who has ever accepted a suggested change from an automated spelling or grammar check in Microsoft Word already has some experience with using an AI tool to improve their work. Would it really make sense to invest the extra time or resources in further iterations of proofreading so that you could avoid using an automated spelling or grammar check?
Similarly, Watermeyer et al. introduce a somewhat paternalistic concern that “enthusiasm for generative AI as an efficiency aid, obfuscates the tasks that academics should remain focused on”. This seems to ignore the fact that academics will always have finite time available to distribute to varied responsibilities. Even in a utopian scenario, scarce attention and intellectual effort would still need to be allocated between competing needs. Drawing on tools to efficiently address basic tasks should be viewed as a positive, regardless of the level of neoliberal managerialism in an academic system.
Is it ethically justifiable to waste time doing that same work much more slowly when that may mean giving less attention to more important matters?
There are opportunity costs, ethical issues and risks that come with the decision to shun a new, useful tool that could improve productivity and research quality. Working slowly and inefficiently can be an indulgent luxury. While, we all wish to see more realistic workload models, there is nothing inherently praiseworthy about ‘slowing down’ academic work by disconnecting it from real-world developments. Working time is limited, so every decision about where to invest effort is a trade-off between competing needs and priorities. Readily available GenAI tools such as ChatGPT can speed up a task such as converting a research article into a draft slide deck or converting a reference list to the correct citation style. Is it ethically justifiable to waste time doing that same work much more slowly when that may mean giving less attention to more important matters? Such ethical issues are not discussed because the status quo is taken for granted. Professionals will have to weigh up the costs, risks and benefits for themselves when choosing to use or reject any platform or tool.
Waiting to engage with the practicalities of how best to use GenAI tools until all risks and concerns have been ironed out to everyone’s satisfaction is a poor solution. Let’s consider instead: What are these GenAI tools good for, and what are they not good for? Which GenAI research uses are ethically acceptable and unacceptable, and why? These are the kinds of questions that move us forward towards a balanced adoption of a useful set of tools. It is crucial for professional research associations to promptly address this issue and offer clear, public guidance. The sooner this is done, the better for the entire research community.

Problem is not speed of work, but for the social sciences, ChatGTP is good at writing passable text. So students using it learn far less, [including about how to write well] and instructors have to fail them for plagiarism if they are caught. This has been going on since late 2022, and is totally different to other less clever tools that have been used for ages. Universities are unsure what to do. As for articles and PhDs, a ‘no AI was used’ statement should be signed and appended or appear in a footnote. That could be considered in hiring and promotions, too, as a plus point. Who wants to hire a faculty member with a productive-looking cv if the papers were written in large measure by a computer? I am not sure many  STEM trained academics would be willing to sign such statements, looking around the disciplines and the bland literature reviews heavily assisted by AI that already appear at the beginning of some  papers. Its use in engineering seems particularly high.

PérezMadrid - FEB 09, 2024 - 10:46 ESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkThe labor market will be entering uncharted territory in the coming years. Although technological progress has traditionally been a double-edged sword for employment — while improving production, it forces transformations in the workforce — artificial intelligence and its immediate impact on all sectors of the economy will push things forward fast, prompting an accelerated rethinking of a paradigm shift that threatens to leave behind anyone unable to adapt in time. The responsibility for ensuring that this doesn’t happen lies with governments, which have several tasks ahead of them: to correctly analyze the current situation; to review, if necessary, the statistical sources from which they draw the reports that they use to make projections; and to demonstrate a willingness to collaborate with the private sector in pursuit of a common good. These are the main conclusions of a study by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman that seeks to address these future challenges.“In this technological revolution, workers will have less time to adapt than in previous ones. [It] will take hold more quickly and, therefore, the workforce will have less room to maneuver and adapt,” reads the report authored by Pablo Campos, Gonzalo Arana, Tomás Sánchez and Jaime Gervás.Along with this imminent labor transformation, there will be another transformation of the social sphere, which will go hand in hand with the progressive aging of the workforce. This will result, on the one hand, in an increase in the total payroll — workers with longer careers have better conditions and more experience — and, on the other, in an increase in the age of the customer base of businesses. “This will have an impact on the size of the sectors, as there will be less demand for products and services for young people (toys, nightlife) and more demand for products and services aimed at the elderly (elderly care, insurance),” the study claims.The pairing of demographics with labor is nothing new, but the progressive increase in the retirement age and the increasingly late entry of younger workers into the job market will further increase generational tensions. “The unemployment and wage gaps between sectors are unmistakable indicators of the labor market’s difficulties in adjusting. It is therefore essential to implement mechanisms that reduce friction within the domestic labor market,” the report states.All these currents of change are symptomatic of a general transformation that is yet to come, and whose final horizon will depend on the answer to the following question: what will the jobs of the future be like? According to the study’s various predictions, “work in the future will be more flexible, with more roles in human and care services… As a consequence of the evolution of new technologies, the demand for skills related to disruptive technologies will increase, the role of the employee as a ‘computer substitute’ (data collector and analyst) will be replaced by the role of the employee as ‘computer complement’ (team management, message transmission, emotion management), and will evolve toward a more human and assistive role.”At the same time, the report makes clear that some of the remote-work formulas implemented in recent years — mostly as a result of the pandemic — will become an essential base-line requirement for workers. “Society has become accustomed to more flexible ways of working, giving rise to telecommuting, greater adaptability of working hours and digital communication. These trends will become established in the coming years, and it is even foreseeable that support for shortening the week to four days to favor work conciliation will increase,” stresses the text.Financial stabilityGovernments will play the dominant role in managing this transition. And this management will have to be carried out on different time scales. To this end, the Oliver Wyman report suggests various actions be taken at different times. In the short term, the authors of the study suggest “simplifying and promoting the hiring of foreigners in sectors with low employment and a shortage of talent, eliminating obstacles in the processing of visas and residence permits”; in the short to medium term, “creating a body to coordinate between the private sector, educational institutions and the government in the promotion and identification of talent”; in the medium term, “support employee training or requalification for skills demanded by companies”; and in the long term, “revise existing educational opportunities (university and vocational training) in line with the demands of the domestic private sector to avoid brain drain.”The economic umbrella is essential for the implementation of all these actions, especially those focused on the long term. For this reason, the report emphasizes the importance of “financial stability” and the collaboration between political parties necessary to foster it. “One possible solution to the demands of ideological and financial stability is the promotion of independent institutions similar to an Institute for the Future of Work, managed by independent administrators and dependent on public-private partnerships,” the study concludes.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

As technology has evolved, so too has the accounting profession. From paper-based processes to cloud-based software, accountants are no strangers to change. No previous advancement, however, has had the potential to alter accounting (and many other industries) quite like generative artificial intelligence. But for those who embrace AI, there is a strategic opportunity to capitalize on its many benefits while protecting and even uplifting the irreplaceable human connection.

Because the accounting profession is traditionally compliance-focused, it is particularly prone to AI disruption. Clearly, there are opportunities for AI to reduce the time accountants spend on mundane, repetitive tasks. This enables a shift toward higher-value activities that are built on meaningful interpersonal relationships – like advisory services.
While the integration of AI in accounting processes holds immense potential for efficiency and accuracy, it also raises ethical considerations that demand careful navigation. Let’s take a look at what we can expect from AI in the near future, and the precautions accounting firms should take to ensure accuracy, trust, and data security.
What is generative AI?
At a high level, AI combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, and audio.
Many industries are employing generative AI to handle tasks like drafting marketing copy, emails or blogs, as well as implementing chatbots for customer service and generating code for app development.
The transformative impact of AI in accounting
Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the accounting landscape by transforming traditional workflow processes. While this sweeping transformation can create uncertainty, understanding how it will change the accounting profession and the opportunities it presents can help accounting firms not only adapt, but thrive.
One of the most significant contributions of AI is in the automation of routine workflow activities like data entry, invoice processing, and reconciliation. These tasks can now be accomplished swiftly and accurately by AI systems.
Further, AI enhances the accuracy of financial reporting by reducing the risk of human error. Complex algorithms can analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and detect anomalies that might go unnoticed by the human eye. This not only ensures more precise financial statements but also improves decision-making as it is backed by real-time insights.
How can accounting firms leverage AI?
Here are a few ways accounting firms can leverage AI in their businesses:

Client communications. Use generative AI to create a first draft of client emails or newsletters which you can then modify for accuracy and personal insight.
Client support. Employ AI-powered chatbots to provide anytime client service and support.
Audit automation. Perform audits more efficiently and accurately by relying on AI to quickly process large amounts of data, gain insight from the wider audit community, and automatically detect discrepancies or other anomalies in financial records.
Compliance. With predictive analytics, AI can flag potential tax or non-compliance risks, provide recommendations to avoid legal ramifications, and predict violations before they occur.
Tax research and planning. Keep up with ever-changing tax laws and regulations and explore different tax planning scenarios for clients with AI-powered tools.
Training. Use AI for in-depth industry research, insight into the latest trends, and to help analyze the tax landscape.

Ethical considerations in the human-AI partnership
The human-AI partnership holds immense promise for efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. However, firms must prioritize ethical considerations to ensure they protect themselves and their clients.
While AI shines in processing large volumes of data, staff members should play a pivotal role in validating AI-generated outputs, cross-referencing information, and verifying the overall reliability of the results. Firms must ensure the information gleaned from AI systems is transparent, free from biases, and does not compromise the integrity of financial information.
Further, to protect sensitive financial information from unauthorized access and cyber threats, consider implementing advanced encryption techniques, security protocols, and invest in cybersecurity training. Because AI systems may inadvertently replicate content from external sources, firms should also consider implementing plagiarism detection tools to ensure that financial reports and analyses are original and comply with ethical standards.
By striking the right balance, firms can capitalize on AI’s benefits while upholding the integrity and ethical standards that define the accounting profession.
A successful human-AI partnership
The dynamics of the human-AI partnership in accounting are all about harnessing AI’s benefits while upholding ethical standards and leveraging the irreplaceable human expertise.
While AI systems can process vast amounts of data at incredible speeds, they lack the nuanced understanding, intuition, personal experience, and ethical judgment of the human mind. Recognizing this, firms must strike a balance between leveraging AI for its computational power and uplifting the all-important human connection to clients.
Integrating AI into your accounting firm is not about replacing human beings but rather unleashing their unique capabilities. By letting AI handle routine and repetitive tasks, you can free up your staff to focus on experience-based analysis, strategic decision-making, and client relationships.

Artificial intelligence helps predict whether antidepressants will work in patients

In patients with major depression disorder, it is now possible to predict within a week whether an antidepressant will work thanks to the use of artificial intelligence (AI). With the help of an AI algorithm, a brain scan and an individual's clinical information, researchers from Amsterdam UMC and Radboudumc could see up to 8 weeks faster whether or not the medication would work. The results of this study are published today in the American Journal of Psychiatry.




""This is important news for patients. Normally, it takes 6 to 8 weeks before it is known whether an antidepressant will work,"" says Professor of Neuroradiology at Amsterdam UMC, Liesbeth Reneman.
The research team analyzed whether they could predict the effect of the antidepressant sertraline, one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States and Europe. In a previous study conducted in the United States, MRI scans and clinical data were administered to 229 patients with major depression before and after a week of treatment with sertraline or placebo. The Amsterdam researchers then developed and applied an algorithm to this data to investigate whether they could predict the treatment response to sertraline.
This analysis showed that 1/3 of patients would respond to the drug and in 2/3 not. ""With this method, we can already prevent 2/3 of the number of 'erroneous' prescriptions of sertraline and thus offer better quality of care for the patient. Because the drug also has side effects,"" says Reneman.
The right drug, much faster
""The algorithm suggested that blood flow in the anterior cingulate cortex, the area of brain involved in emotion regulation, would be predictive of the efficacy of the drug. And at the second measurement, a week after the start, the severity of their symptoms turned out to be additionally predictive"" says Eric Ruhé, psychiatrist at Radboudumc.




In the future, this new method may help to better tailor sertraline treatment to the individual patient. Currently, there is no exact prediction tool. The patient is given the medication and after 6 to 8 weeks—in practice often up to several months—it is checked whether the medication works.
If the symptoms do not subside, the patient is given another antidepressant, and this process can repeat itself several times. This standard method often takes weeks, if not months. It also saves society costs, because as long as the patient continues to suffer from serious depressive symptoms, he or she cannot fully participate in society.
In one in three depressed patients, there is still no improvement in the symptoms after several treatment steps. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a solution that allows a faster determination of the effectiveness of antidepressants in severe depression. In the coming period, the researchers will improve the algorithm by adding extra information.

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Feb 7, 2024, 2:00 PM ESTShare this story3 Comments / 3 NewHere’s how to opt-out where you can, and fight back where you can’t. Samar Haddad / The VergeAI-generated imagery feels inescapable. It’s in the video games you play, in the movies you watch, and has flooded social media platforms. It’s even been used to promote the physical hardware that real, human artists use to create digital paintings and illustrations, to the immense frustration of those who already feel displaced by the technology. The pervasive nature of it seems especially egregious to creators who are fighting to stop their works from being used, without consent or compensation, to improve the very thing that threatens to disrupt their careers and livelihoods. The data pools that go into training generative AI models often contain images that are indiscriminately scraped from the internet, and some AI image generator tools allow users to upload reference images they want to imitate. Many creative professionals need to advertise their work via social media and online portfolios, so simply taking everything offline isn’t a viable solution. And a lack of legal clarity around AI technology has created something of a Wild-West environment that’s difficult to resist. Difficult, but not impossible.While the tools are often complicated and time consuming, several AI companies provide creators with ways to opt their work out of training. And for visual artists who want broader protections there are tools like Glaze and Kin.Art, which make the works useless for training. Here’s how to navigate the best solutions we’ve found so far.Opting OutGenerative AI models depend on training datasets, and the companies behind them are motivated to avoid restricting those potential data pools. So while they often do allow artists to opt their work out, the process can be crude and labor intensive — especially if you have a sizable catalog of work. Opting out typically requires submitting a request to an AI provider, either via a dedicated form or directly via email, along with the copies and written descriptions of images you want to protect. Additionally, if you’ve agreed to let third parties license your images, the terms may include a license for AI training. It’s worth scanning the user agreements for any platforms hosting your work to check what rights they hold over it. But different AI tools’ policies vary — here’s how to opt out of some popular ones.OpenAI DALL-EOpenAI started allowing creators to remove their work from its training data alongside its DALL-E 3 generative AI model last September, and it’s one of the easier processes to follow. Content creators or owners just need to submit a form to OpenAI to request that the work be excluded from future training datasets, including a copy of the image, a description of it, and a ticked checkbox confirming that you have the rights for said image.Unfortunately, you’ll have to submit a separate form for every image you want excluded from OpenAI’s datasets, which could amount to thousands of works for some people; OpenAI hasn’t disclosed how many artists have undertaken this ordeal. You have to submit a single form for every artwork you want opting out of OpenAIs training, which simply isn’t realistic for creatives with vast portfolios. Image: OpenAIIf you only host your works on your own website, there might be a more efficient option. You can follow the instructions linked here to block the “GPTBot” web crawler used to scrape data from publicly available internet sources, which should protect all the content on it. A downside to this method, however, is that images posted anywhere outside of those walled protections, such as on social media, are still at risk of being scraped. Submitting a form at least ensures that your work is protected by a wider net, providing OpenAI hasn’t already obtained the images via a licensed third party.Both these processes only offer protection against being swept into future training datasets. OpenAI claims that its AI models don’t retain any information they’ve already been trained on, so if you believe your work was already consumed by DALL-E 3 or its previous iterations, it’s too late to have it removed.DALL-E 3 is also the model used by Image Creator from Designer, the Microsoft tool previously known as Bing Image Creator. As such, the process of opting out with OpenAI directly should also prevent Image Creator from being trained on your works.Adobe FireflyOf course, for every AI company that does allow artists to remove their works from training data, many others don’t openly advertise having such a service. And if they’re training models on a platform they own, users of that platform may not be allowed to opt out at all. That’s the case with creative software giant Adobe, which uses a model called Firefly across its Creative Cloud suite, including in Photoshop’s generative fill tool.Adobe proclaims that Firefly is commercially and legally safe because it’s entirely trained on the company’s own stock image platform, Adobe Stock. But there’s no means for Adobe Stock contributors to opt out of training Adobe’s AI models, which has resulted in some existing users criticizing the company for not seeking their permission. If you don’t want your work used to improve Firefly, you can’t put it on Adobe Stock, period.It doesn’t get much clearer than this line from Adobe’s FAQs. If you don’t want to train Firefly, avoid Adobe Stock. Image: AdobeIn principle, Adobe’s approach should mean that non-Stock users don’t have to worry about Firefly. But the reality is that there’s plenty of pirated work uploaded to the platform. If you find that someone has fraudulently uploaded your work to Adobe Stock, you can send Adobe an IP infringement notice to get it removed from the platform. Meta Creatives who want to avoid training Meta’s AI models will have to jump through similar hoops. Meta is using “information from its products and services” to train its generative AI models, so anything personal you upload, or have historically uploaded, to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads is fair game for AI training. If you don’t have an account on any of those services then you’ve potentially avoided feeding its AI machine, but deleting existing accounts and/or not uploading future works to them is the next best thing.You can submit a form to Meta to request the company correct or delete personal information that’s being used to train its generative AI models, but only if that information has been supplied by a third party. It won’t let you exclude, for instance, art you’ve been voluntarily showcasing on Instagram. Many artists have also found it to be a frustrating process, criticizing how often the tool is unable to process requests. Conceptual artist Bethany Berg told Wired that the removal form felt like “it was just a fake PR stunt to make it look like they were actually trying to do something.”Just remember that Meta will hold some rights over any content you upload to its platforms, so the most effective solution is to avoid them entirely. Image: MetaBeyond that, you can limit what personal information third parties are sharing with Meta by managing your Off-Facebook Activity. This tool will display which sites and services are giving your data to Meta and allow you to sever the connection that ties your identity with such data. This won’t clear the data that’s already been uploaded, but it should enable users to monitor if platforms they know are hosting their works are potentially feeding that information back to Meta directly.That said, Meta also uses “information that is publicly available online” to train its generative AI models, and it doesn’t disclose its datasets. So there’s no way of knowing precisely what’s already in that massive content pool — and no surefire way of staying out.What about Stability AI, Midjourney, and so on?Two of the most popular generative AI tools — Midjourney and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion — will remove copyright-infringing materials under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). But this information is buried in their respective Terms of Use policies, and the processes are crude. This also isn’t strictly an opt-out tool, and neither company provides a means to opt work out of being sucked into future training data pools.For both services, you’ll need to email the companies directly. Midjourney can be reached at takedown@midjourney.com. For Stability AI, email your requests to both mariya@stability.ai and legal@stability.ai. Stability’s user terms don’t specify what you’d need to provide, but the information required by Midjourney, and most DMCA copyright infringement notices generally, includes a description of the original works, where the image infringing on them is located, your contact information, and a copy of your signature. Other, smaller AI providers may also provide a similar approach to removing data that infringes on intellectual property rights thanks to regulations like DCMA, to varying success — if you’re unsure, try contacting the AI provider directly.How else can I protect my work against generative AI?With all that laid out, it’s clear that artists’ options when dealing directly with AI companies are pretty limited. Externally, however, several tools and services can grant creators better defenses — or even offenses — when fighting back. The various tools work differently, but in general, they run your visual art through processes that confuse or block effective training. That way, even if your work is scraped for an AI model, that model (ideally) won’t learn to reproduce it.GlazeWhen you launch Glaze, you’ll need to give it some time to download the resources it needs to protect your work. Image: Sand Lab, University of ChicagoOne of the most notable anti-training tools is Glaze, a project launched by a team out of the University of Chicago. The free-to-use tool works as a kind of cloak, making pixel-level changes to images that confuse AI software trying to read them. Real people can’t typically see these alterations on highly-detailed images so there’s little impact on the human viewing experience, but AI image generators that are fed the same materials will recognize it as something else entirely — meaning anyone who tries to replicate its specific art style will be unable to do so.Glaze is available for Windows or macOS. There are GPU and non-GPU versions available for Windows, but running the GPU variant specifically requires an Nvidia GPU from this list with at least 3.6GB of memory. (The developers say Glaze generally uses around 5GB of system memory to run.) Using it is straightforward: at first launch, the application will automatically download a number of machine learning libraries and other resources it needs to cloud your images. When that’s complete, head to the “Select” box at the top left and choose which images on your computer you’d like to Glaze. These can be uploaded in batches, so it’s much quicker than making individual opt-out requests.You may want to experiment with the strength of the Glaze application — on simple illustrations like this, Glazing at max intensity can distort the results. Image: Jess Weatherbed / The Verge and Image: Jess Weatherbed / The VergeYou can then adjust the intensity of the Glaze cloaking from “very low” to “very high,” with the latter offering greater protection against AI but increasing the possibility of changes being visible to humans. Render quality, another option, determines the overall quality of the finished image — higher-quality rendering looks better and offers greater protection but will also take much longer to process. Generally, the finished result should look virtually unchanged from your original. But a close inspection will reveal tiny differences, almost like a textured wash has been applied to it.NightshadeNightshade shares a very similar UI to Glaze, which is unsurprising considering it’s being developed by the same team. Image: Sand Lab, University of ChicagoNightshade, from the team behind Glaze, takes a similar but more extreme approach. Images passed through this cloaking tool are actually intended to “poison” generative AI models that train on them, sabotaging the outputs for text prompts. If you upload a batch of dog pictures, for instance, Nightshade is supposed to fool models into seeing some other object like cars — rather than just confusing the model like Glaze does. The idea is that if a model takes in enough confusing images, it will start building rules based on them, so any dog-related prompt might become distorted with wheels and windshields. You can’t specify what you’d like your poisoned images to masquerade as because Nightshade is built around algorithms that can’t accommodate that kind of personalization. If you want a better insight into how it works, check out this breakdown provided by data scientist Dorian Drost.Like Glaze, Nightshade applies a filter-like film over the image that shouldn’t massively impact the human viewing experience, depending on the intensity of the protection layer and how detailed the original art is. (You can apply both Glaze and Nightshade to images without them interfering with each other.) Nightshade is also available for Windows and macOS systems, though only machines running Apple’s own silicon are supported for the latter.At default intensity, Nightshade should produce similar-looking results to Glazed images. The poisoned results on the right are nearly identical to our Glaze tests. Image: Jess Weatherbed / The Verge and Image: Jess Weatherbed / The VergeMost of the overall process is the same as Glaze: you wait for the tool to download machine learning libraries, upload your work, and set the intensity and rendering options. But there’s one extra step. Nightshade will analyze the images and fill the “current tag” field with a single-word description identifying the content, like “dog” or “girl.” For the poisoning effect to work, this needs to be accurate — so you can change it if it’s wrong. Then, when you upload the images online, make sure that single-word tag is included in the metadata or alt text. Some generative AI advocates argue Nightshade won’t be much of a hindrance. AI systems are trained on truly vast amounts of data, so you’d need a lot of poisoning to affect any given prompt. And companies can develop workarounds that detect Nightshade. But most of these workarounds only filter out images that use it, rather than removing the protections — so the end result is just having art excluded from the training data, which is still a win. The Glaze project team is also continually working to update the applications to close any loopholes that are being exploited by workarounds.MistMist can be tricky to set up, but its another option to try if you’re unhappy with results from Glaze and Nightshade. Image: MistMist is a “preprocessing tool” developed by Psyker Group that, like Glaze and Nightshade, also prevents generative AI applications from effectively imitating a creator’s unique style and works. Mist’s approach is more akin to watermarking images. If an AI model is trained on “misted images,” any attempt to mimic them will see the output completely covered in visual distortions that render it unfit for most purposes and generally unpleasant to look at.Here’s an example of what’s produced by AI generation tools that reference Misted images. Image: Mist / Sang DelanElements of the original image can still be seen in some of these outputs, like similarities in photography or art styles, but the chaotic, noisy filter over the generated image isn’t something that can be easily corrected. Mist requires a graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM, which isn’t a lot of computational resources, but it’s still greater than the 3.6GB Glaze requires. Mist has been open-sourced on GitHub to allow developers to build their own tools around it, and its creators have committed to offering long-term support and continuously improving its function.There are currently two ways for non-developers to use Mist. Windows PC users running an Nvidia GPU can download Mist for free via this Google Drive package. The software doesn’t require installation and can be used almost immediately after downloading — though it’s a little finicky to set up if you lack any coding or development experience.Misting images can also produce a faint, swirling filter over the results, but like Glaze, it's harder to spot on detailed art or photography. Image: Mist / Sang Delan and Image: Mist / Sang DelanA detailed handbook is available that will walk you through the entire process, along with a community Discord channel for troubleshooting. First, make sure you’ve installed the .NET desktop runtime. When that’s done, you just select the “ENG” file inside Google Drive and download the zipped Mist_V2 folder within it. Create a new folder called “IMG” in mist-v2 > src > data >. Drop any images that you plan on Misting into the new folder when completed. Then, go back to the main folder (which should be titled “mist-v2_gui_free_version”) and run the Mist GUI booter. Mist allows you to adjust the strength of protection applied to images and select between using your device’s GPU or CPU, which may prove useful if you’re running old or inefficient hardware.For anyone who’s using macOS or doesn’t possess an Nvidia GPU, you can also run Mist via Colab Notebook, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in your web browser. Detailed instructions for how to do this are available here, but it’s a much more complicated process to set up than its Windows equivalent. Glaze and Nightshade, generally, will be much easier to navigate for folks who aren't familiar with coding processes.Kin.ArtKin.Art isn’t so much an AI protection tool as it is an entire portfolio platform that artists can use to host and sell their work. It goes beyond just banning AI-generated works — though that’s appreciated, given the backlash against sites like DeviantArt and ArtStation — and actively makes AI scraping and training harder.Kin.Art uses two different techniques to thwart AI companies. The first is image segmentation, which is used to break apart images and muddle them into something unrecognizable. It’s undetectable to human eyes but disrupts generative AI models from being able to read the image. This visual scrambling will also be present if anyone attempts to save or download the image, though it doesn’t block manual screenshots. The second technique involves scrambling the metadata, like title and description, so any labels the AI model reads won’t accurately reflect the content.Kin.Art’s AI protections just require users to tick a box when uploading their works to the platform. Image: Kin.ArtThese protections are automatically applied on the Kin.Art platform, so you just need to create an account and upload your works to benefit from them, and that works like practically any social media platform. There are some neat creator-focused features included, like the ability to add a commission status to advertise your availability to accept requests, and you can link out to external platforms like social media pages directly on your user profile. You can toggle the protections on or off when uploading images, and the service is currently free to use. Instead, Kin.Art will start placing a 5 percent service fee on top of commissions made through the service in March.What about music, writing, and other media?Our guide covers what protections are available for image-based art largely because that format has more tools available than other mediums, and the opting-out processes tend to be clearer (when they are available). That said, creatives in other fields, like writing, voice acting, and music, are also fighting to protect their work. It’s much harder to disrupt how AI models are trained on this kind of data without noticeably affecting the original content, but there are still precautions you can take to reduce the risk of it being swept into AI training datasets.As with art, always check the user terms of the hosting platform to which you’re uploading your works. Services will generally disclose if they’re handing platform data over to third parties for AI training or using it to develop their own models — if there’s no explicit opt-out process, you may unknowingly be giving consent simply by signing up. Instead, look for platforms like Medium, which have committed to blocking attempts to use content hosted on the site to train AI models. If you’re hosting work on your own site, you can also do things like block GPTBot to avoid pages being scraped.Some rights distributors have made similar commitments, like the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers of Music (SACEM) — a French association that announced it was exercising its right to opt out on behalf of its members last year. Another tip for writers, courtesy of the Authors Guild, is to place a short warning notice on your published works that clearly states you don’t consent to it being used to train AI. This is the example provided by the guild:“NO AI TRAINING: Without in any way limiting the author’s [and publisher’s] exclusive rights under copyright, any use of this publication to “train” generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to generate text is expressly prohibited. The author reserves all rights to license uses of this work for generative AI training and development of machine learning language models.”These warnings serve to clearly flag that the work isn’t freely available to use, which may be useful in any future lawsuits raised against companies that violate your ownership rights. If bots scraping web data are also intuitive enough to filter out results with such warnings then this could also potentially provide another layer of proactive protection, but there’s little evidence to show how many actually observe such information. Otherwise, performers and writers will need to submit copyright takedown notices to AI companies if they believe their works have been infringed.Comments3 Comments / 3 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: ring any bells?

It’s in the video games you play, in the movies you watch, and has flooded social media platforms. It’s even been used to promote the physical hardware that real, human artists use to create digital paintings and illustrations, to the immense frustration of those who already feel displaced by the technology. 

The pervasive nature of it seems especially egregious to creators who are fighting to stop their works from being used, without consent or compensation, to improve the very thing that threatens to disrupt their careers and livelihoods. The data pools that go into training generative AI models often contain images that are indiscriminately scraped from the internet, and some AI image generator tools allow users to upload reference images they want to imitate. Many creative professionals need to advertise their work via social media and online portfolios, so simply taking everything offline isn’t a viable solution. And a lack of legal clarity around AI technology has created something of a Wild-West environment that’s difficult to resist. Difficult, but not impossible.

While the tools are often complicated and time consuming, several AI companies provide creators with ways to opt their work out of training. And for visual artists who want broader protections there are tools like Glaze and Kin.Art, which make the works useless for training. Here’s how to navigate the best solutions we’ve found so far.

Opting Out

Generative AI models depend on training datasets, and the companies behind them are motivated to avoid restricting those potential data pools. So while they often do allow artists to opt their work out, the process can be crude and labor intensive — especially if you have a sizable catalog of work. 

Opting out typically requires submitting a request to an AI provider, either via a dedicated form or directly via email, along with the copies and written descriptions of images you want to protect. Additionally, if you’ve agreed to let third parties license your images, the terms may include a license for AI training. It’s worth scanning the user agreements for any platforms hosting your work to check what rights they hold over it. But different AI tools’ policies vary — here’s how to opt out of some popular ones.

OpenAI DALL-E

OpenAI started allowing creators to remove their work from its training data alongside its DALL-E 3 generative AI model last September, and it’s one of the easier processes to follow. Content creators or owners just need to submit a form to OpenAI to request that the work be excluded from future training datasets, including a copy of the image, a description of it, and a ticked checkbox confirming that you have the rights for said image.

Unfortunately, you’ll have to submit a separate form for every image you want excluded from OpenAI’s datasets, which could amount to thousands of works for some people; OpenAI hasn’t disclosed how many artists have undertaken this ordeal. 

[Image: You have to submit a single form for every artwork you want opting out of OpenAIs training, which simply isn’t realistic for creatives with vast portfolios. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZnMeuBMJ4NUwYQP5p55P5GXE2Ig=/0x0:1150x1693/1150x1693/filters:focal(575x847:576x848)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270057/OpenAI_opt_out_form.jpg]

If you only host your works on your own website, there might be a more efficient option. You can follow the instructions linked here to block the “GPTBot” web crawler used to scrape data from publicly available internet sources, which should protect all the content on it. A downside to this method, however, is that images posted anywhere outside of those walled protections, such as on social media, are still at risk of being scraped. Submitting a form at least ensures that your work is protected by a wider net, providing OpenAI hasn’t already obtained the images via a licensed third party.

Both these processes only offer protection against being swept into future training datasets. OpenAI claims that its AI models don’t retain any information they’ve already been trained on, so if you believe your work was already consumed by DALL-E 3 or its previous iterations, it’s too late to have it removed.

DALL-E 3 is also the model used by Image Creator from Designer, the Microsoft tool previously known as Bing Image Creator. As such, the process of opting out with OpenAI directly should also prevent Image Creator from being trained on your works.

Adobe Firefly

Of course, for every AI company that does allow artists to remove their works from training data, many others don’t openly advertise having such a service. And if they’re training models on a platform they own, users of that platform may not be allowed to opt out at all. That’s the case with creative software giant Adobe, which uses a model called Firefly across its Creative Cloud suite, including in Photoshop’s generative fill tool.

Adobe proclaims that Firefly is commercially and legally safe because it’s entirely trained on the company’s own stock image platform, Adobe Stock. But there’s no means for Adobe Stock contributors to opt out of training Adobe’s AI models, which has resulted in some existing users criticizing the company for not seeking their permission. If you don’t want your work used to improve Firefly, you can’t put it on Adobe Stock, period.

[Image: It doesn’t get much clearer than this line from Adobe’s FAQs. If you don’t want to train Firefly, avoid Adobe Stock. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YUqoxNIUWrtW2JUHz36t5zMLQA=/0x0:706x135/706x135/filters:focal(353x68:354x69)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270039/Adobe_ai_opt_out.jpg]

In principle, Adobe’s approach should mean that non-Stock users don’t have to worry about Firefly. But the reality is that there’s plenty of pirated work uploaded to the platform. If you find that someone has fraudulently uploaded your work to Adobe Stock, you can send Adobe an IP infringement notice to get it removed from the platform. 

Meta 

Creatives who want to avoid training Meta’s AI models will have to jump through similar hoops. Meta is using “information from its products and services” to train its generative AI models, so anything personal you upload, or have historically uploaded, to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads is fair game for AI training. If you don’t have an account on any of those services then you’ve potentially avoided feeding its AI machine, but deleting existing accounts and/or not uploading future works to them is the next best thing.

You can submit a form to Meta to request the company correct or delete personal information that’s being used to train its generative AI models, but only if that information has been supplied by a third party. It won’t let you exclude, for instance, art you’ve been voluntarily showcasing on Instagram. Many artists have also found it to be a frustrating process, criticizing how often the tool is unable to process requests. Conceptual artist Bethany Berg told Wired that the removal form felt like “it was just a fake PR stunt to make it look like they were actually trying to do something.”

[Image: Just remember that Meta will hold some rights over any content you upload to its platforms, so the most effective solution is to avoid them entirely. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivfJdF-MwlXfMg9DznEVCObGSrM=/0x0:979x969/979x969/filters:focal(490x485:491x486)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270042/meta_ai_opt_out.jpg]

Beyond that, you can limit what personal information third parties are sharing with Meta by managing your Off-Facebook Activity. This tool will display which sites and services are giving your data to Meta and allow you to sever the connection that ties your identity with such data. This won’t clear the data that’s already been uploaded, but it should enable users to monitor if platforms they know are hosting their works are potentially feeding that information back to Meta directly.

That said, Meta also uses “information that is publicly available online” to train its generative AI models, and it doesn’t disclose its datasets. So there’s no way of knowing precisely what’s already in that massive content pool — and no surefire way of staying out.

What about Stability AI, Midjourney, and so on?

Two of the most popular generative AI tools — Midjourney and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion — will remove copyright-infringing materials under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). But this information is buried in their respective Terms of Use policies, and the processes are crude. This also isn’t strictly an opt-out tool, and neither company provides a means to opt work out of being sucked into future training data pools.

For both services, you’ll need to email the companies directly. Midjourney can be reached at takedown@midjourney.com. For Stability AI, email your requests to both mariya@stability.ai and legal@stability.ai. Stability’s user terms don’t specify what you’d need to provide, but the information required by Midjourney, and most DMCA copyright infringement notices generally, includes a description of the original works, where the image infringing on them is located, your contact information, and a copy of your signature. 

Other, smaller AI providers may also provide a similar approach to removing data that infringes on intellectual property rights thanks to regulations like DCMA, to varying success — if you’re unsure, try contacting the AI provider directly.

How else can I protect my work against generative AI?

With all that laid out, it’s clear that artists’ options when dealing directly with AI companies are pretty limited. Externally, however, several tools and services can grant creators better defenses — or even offenses — when fighting back. The various tools work differently, but in general, they run your visual art through processes that confuse or block effective training. That way, even if your work is scraped for an AI model, that model (ideally) won’t learn to reproduce it.

Glaze

[Image: When you launch Glaze, you’ll need to give it some time to download the resources it needs to protect your work. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYVMl3IPUQ5a7QupLrJj1_F8rUg=/0x0:1282x1132/1282x1132/filters:focal(641x566:642x567)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25271972/Glaze_launcher.jpg]

One of the most notable anti-training tools is Glaze, a project launched by a team out of the University of Chicago. The free-to-use tool works as a kind of cloak, making pixel-level changes to images that confuse AI software trying to read them. Real people can’t typically see these alterations on highly-detailed images so there’s little impact on the human viewing experience, but AI image generators that are fed the same materials will recognize it as something else entirely — meaning anyone who tries to replicate its specific art style will be unable to do so.

Glaze is available for Windows or macOS. There are GPU and non-GPU versions available for Windows, but running the GPU variant specifically requires an Nvidia GPU from this list with at least 3.6GB of memory. (The developers say Glaze generally uses around 5GB of system memory to run.) Using it is straightforward: at first launch, the application will automatically download a number of machine learning libraries and other resources it needs to cloud your images. When that’s complete, head to the “Select” box at the top left and choose which images on your computer you’d like to Glaze. These can be uploaded in batches, so it’s much quicker than making individual opt-out requests.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQJPufnIxBA2F7zxDPxW2-8qhac=/0x0:1600x1400/1600x1400/filters:focal(800x700:801x701)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272553/AI_how_to_example_image_for_demo.jpg]
[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUH7k6ah3Kh_VorufnSRqVAKxb8=/0x0:1600x1400/1600x1400/filters:focal(800x700:801x701)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272552/AI_how_to_example_image_for_demo_glazed_intensity_40_V1.jpg]
You may want to experiment with the strength of the Glaze application — on simple illustrations like this, Glazing at max intensity can distort the results.

You can then adjust the intensity of the Glaze cloaking from “very low” to “very high,” with the latter offering greater protection against AI but increasing the possibility of changes being visible to humans. Render quality, another option, determines the overall quality of the finished image — higher-quality rendering looks better and offers greater protection but will also take much longer to process. Generally, the finished result should look virtually unchanged from your original. But a close inspection will reveal tiny differences, almost like a textured wash has been applied to it.

Nightshade

[Image: Nightshade shares a very similar UI to Glaze, which is unsurprising considering it’s being developed by the same team. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQUoPhgyk0ildslgybihtqPE3qE=/0x0:1302x1100/1302x1100/filters:focal(651x550:652x551)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270255/Nightshade_launcher.jpg]

Nightshade, from the team behind Glaze, takes a similar but more extreme approach. Images passed through this cloaking tool are actually intended to “poison” generative AI models that train on them, sabotaging the outputs for text prompts. If you upload a batch of dog pictures, for instance, Nightshade is supposed to fool models into seeing some other object like cars — rather than just confusing the model like Glaze does. The idea is that if a model takes in enough confusing images, it will start building rules based on them, so any dog-related prompt might become distorted with wheels and windshields. 

You can’t specify what you’d like your poisoned images to masquerade as because Nightshade is built around algorithms that can’t accommodate that kind of personalization. If you want a better insight into how it works, check out this breakdown provided by data scientist Dorian Drost.

Like Glaze, Nightshade applies a filter-like film over the image that shouldn’t massively impact the human viewing experience, depending on the intensity of the protection layer and how detailed the original art is. (You can apply both Glaze and Nightshade to images without them interfering with each other.) Nightshade is also available for Windows and macOS systems, though only machines running Apple’s own silicon are supported for the latter.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQJPufnIxBA2F7zxDPxW2-8qhac=/0x0:1600x1400/1600x1400/filters:focal(800x700:801x701)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272553/AI_how_to_example_image_for_demo.jpg]
[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gzaQ2O2SO_tDyzxCo5YXIUE_Qcw=/0x0:1600x1400/1600x1400/filters:focal(800x700:801x701)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272592/AI_how_to_example_image_for_demo_nightshade_intensity_LOW_V1.jpg]
At default intensity, Nightshade should produce similar-looking results to Glazed images. The poisoned results on the right are nearly identical to our Glaze tests.

Most of the overall process is the same as Glaze: you wait for the tool to download machine learning libraries, upload your work, and set the intensity and rendering options. But there’s one extra step. Nightshade will analyze the images and fill the “current tag” field with a single-word description identifying the content, like “dog” or “girl.” For the poisoning effect to work, this needs to be accurate — so you can change it if it’s wrong. Then, when you upload the images online, make sure that single-word tag is included in the metadata or alt text. 

Some generative AI advocates argue Nightshade won’t be much of a hindrance. AI systems are trained on truly vast amounts of data, so you’d need a lot of poisoning to affect any given prompt. And companies can develop workarounds that detect Nightshade. But most of these workarounds only filter out images that use it, rather than removing the protections — so the end result is just having art excluded from the training data, which is still a win. The Glaze project team is also continually working to update the applications to close any loopholes that are being exploited by workarounds.

Mist

[Image: Mist can be tricky to set up, but its another option to try if you’re unhappy with results from Glaze and Nightshade. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/428XwtgEkMHMNdrbsfn-yaw5xiE=/0x0:1767x831/1767x831/filters:focal(884x416:885x417)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270243/Mist_launcher.jpg]

Mist is a “preprocessing tool” developed by Psyker Group that, like Glaze and Nightshade, also prevents generative AI applications from effectively imitating a creator’s unique style and works. Mist’s approach is more akin to watermarking images. If an AI model is trained on “misted images,” any attempt to mimic them will see the output completely covered in visual distortions that render it unfit for most purposes and generally unpleasant to look at.

[Image: Here’s an example of what’s produced by AI generation tools that reference Misted images. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epkM8JALgo4JWPCrDQpt3RKsEOA=/0x0:512x512/512x512/filters:focal(256x256:257x257)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272426/misted_t2i.jpg]

Elements of the original image can still be seen in some of these outputs, like similarities in photography or art styles, but the chaotic, noisy filter over the generated image isn’t something that can be easily corrected. Mist requires a graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM, which isn’t a lot of computational resources, but it’s still greater than the 3.6GB Glaze requires. Mist has been open-sourced on GitHub to allow developers to build their own tools around it, and its creators have committed to offering long-term support and continuously improving its function.

There are currently two ways for non-developers to use Mist. Windows PC users running an Nvidia GPU can download Mist for free via this Google Drive package. The software doesn’t require installation and can be used almost immediately after downloading — though it’s a little finicky to set up if you lack any coding or development experience.

[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5eU328CU5OnDFEK7ITjLgu7SWOM=/0x0:600x600/600x600/filters:focal(300x300:301x301)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272436/ori_sample.png]
[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eOisXUU_lbyl4nxNMhLi1K17QWM=/0x0:600x600/600x600/filters:focal(300x300:301x301)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25272437/mist_4.png]
Misting images can also produce a faint, swirling filter over the results, but like Glaze, it's harder to spot on detailed art or photography.

A detailed handbook is available that will walk you through the entire process, along with a community Discord channel for troubleshooting. First, make sure you’ve installed the .NET desktop runtime. When that’s done, you just select the “ENG” file inside Google Drive and download the zipped Mist_V2 folder within it. Create a new folder called “IMG” in mist-v2 > src > data >. Drop any images that you plan on Misting into the new folder when completed. Then, go back to the main folder (which should be titled “mist-v2_gui_free_version”) and run the Mist GUI booter. Mist allows you to adjust the strength of protection applied to images and select between using your device’s GPU or CPU, which may prove useful if you’re running old or inefficient hardware.

For anyone who’s using macOS or doesn’t possess an Nvidia GPU, you can also run Mist via Colab Notebook, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in your web browser. Detailed instructions for how to do this are available here, but it’s a much more complicated process to set up than its Windows equivalent. Glaze and Nightshade, generally, will be much easier to navigate for folks who aren't familiar with coding processes.

Kin.Art

Kin.Art isn’t so much an AI protection tool as it is an entire portfolio platform that artists can use to host and sell their work. It goes beyond just banning AI-generated works — though that’s appreciated, given the backlash against sites like DeviantArt and ArtStation — and actively makes AI scraping and training harder.

Kin.Art uses two different techniques to thwart AI companies. The first is image segmentation, which is used to break apart images and muddle them into something unrecognizable. It’s undetectable to human eyes but disrupts generative AI models from being able to read the image. This visual scrambling will also be present if anyone attempts to save or download the image, though it doesn’t block manual screenshots. The second technique involves scrambling the metadata, like title and description, so any labels the AI model reads won’t accurately reflect the content.

[Image: Kin.Art’s AI protections just require users to tick a box when uploading their works to the platform. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SO1ehnIJaxSF_oGgKdTgDKfq7k0=/0x0:915x410/915x410/filters:focal(458x205:459x206)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25270112/Kin_art_anti_ai_upload.jpg]

These protections are automatically applied on the Kin.Art platform, so you just need to create an account and upload your works to benefit from them, and that works like practically any social media platform. There are some neat creator-focused features included, like the ability to add a commission status to advertise your availability to accept requests, and you can link out to external platforms like social media pages directly on your user profile. You can toggle the protections on or off when uploading images, and the service is currently free to use. Instead, Kin.Art will start placing a 5 percent service fee on top of commissions made through the service in March.

What about music, writing, and other media?

Our guide covers what protections are available for image-based art largely because that format has more tools available than other mediums, and the opting-out processes tend to be clearer (when they are available). That said, creatives in other fields, like writing, voice acting, and music, are also fighting to protect their work. It’s much harder to disrupt how AI models are trained on this kind of data without noticeably affecting the original content, but there are still precautions you can take to reduce the risk of it being swept into AI training datasets.

As with art, always check the user terms of the hosting platform to which you’re uploading your works. Services will generally disclose if they’re handing platform data over to third parties for AI training or using it to develop their own models — if there’s no explicit opt-out process, you may unknowingly be giving consent simply by signing up. Instead, look for platforms like Medium, which have committed to blocking attempts to use content hosted on the site to train AI models. If you’re hosting work on your own site, you can also do things like block GPTBot to avoid pages being scraped.

Some rights distributors have made similar commitments, like the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers of Music (SACEM) — a French association that announced it was exercising its right to opt out on behalf of its members last year. Another tip for writers, courtesy of the Authors Guild, is to place a short warning notice on your published works that clearly states you don’t consent to it being used to train AI. This is the example provided by the guild:

> “NO AI TRAINING: Without in any way limiting the author’s [and publisher’s] exclusive rights under copyright, any use of this publication to “train” generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to generate text is expressly prohibited. The author reserves all rights to license uses of this work for generative AI training and development of machine learning language models.”

These warnings serve to clearly flag that the work isn’t freely available to use, which may be useful in any future lawsuits raised against companies that violate your ownership rights. If bots scraping web data are also intuitive enough to filter out results with such warnings then this could also potentially provide another layer of proactive protection, but there’s little evidence to show how many actually observe such information. Otherwise, performers and writers will need to submit copyright takedown notices to AI companies if they believe their works have been infringed.

Ikea released a new generative artificial intelligence (AI) shopping tool, the retailer announced Feb. 5. The tool is available in the OpenAI GPT store with the $20 per month Plus membership in the U.S. Ikea says it will expand the tool to other markets in 2024.
“The new IKEA AI Assistant on GPT Stores is an ongoing initiative, and the continuation of a journey that looks to enrich the retail experience and explore additional avenues to interact with our customers and coworkers, as they help us improve and develop further,” Parag Parekh, global chief digital officer for Ikea Retail, said in a statement.
Ikea is No. 7 in the Europe Database, Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of the largest online retailers in the region.
How does Ikea’s generative AI assistant work?
Consumers can access the Ikea AI assistant through ChatGPT. Users can ask questions about Ikea’s catalog and product availability at a specific store. A customer can tell the tool that he is looking for a dining table that seats eight, and ChatGPT will respond with images of products that fit the description, along with prices and a look at average customer ratings, according to an example video Ikea shared. It can also provide a link directly to checkout with the item on Ikea’s website.

Users can also ask for design tips, or ask the tool to show them furnishings within specific parameters. For example, ‘’Show me a cozy living room layout for a small apartment with the use of sustainable materials.’’ Requests can be more specific, too, asking how certain Ikea products would look together in a kitchen, for example.
“We are taking a pragmatic, execution-focused approach, learning by doing and capitalizing on our early efforts of a Responsible AI framework. We activated a broad ecosystem of partners to bring to life several experiments, so that we can take part in the AI evolution as we shape our company strategy,” Francesco Marzoni, chief data and analytics officer at Ikea Retail, said in a statement.
Consumer-facing generative AI
Ikea joins other major retailers in releasing generative AI tools consumers can use to find and purchase goods online. Amazon.com Inc. recently debuted Rufus, a new generative AI shopping assistant trained on Amazon’s product catalog. So far, the assistant is available to a small subset of U.S. customers to answer shopping questions and make recommendations, Amazon said. It will roll out to all U.S. customers in a few weeks.
Walmart is also rolling out ways consumers can use generative AI as they shop. Walmart released a new generative AI-powered search capability in its app at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.

The search function uses Microsoft’s large language model (LLM) alongside Walmart’s data to give consumers relevant results across product categories. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon gave the example of a shopper hosting a Super Bowl watch party. Rather than searching for a new TV, chicken wings, chips, and other essentials, one search would generate all of these items, he said, without the user manually inputting the specifics of each type of product.
The generative AI search will also take into account factors about the specific app user. A consumer’s location, search history, and other relevant information will be used to further refine their results, McMillon said.

  NVIDIA has joined the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s new U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium as part of the company’s effort to advance safe, secure and trustworthy AI.
AISIC will work to create tools, methodologies and standards to promote the safe and trustworthy development and deployment of AI. As a member, NVIDIA will work with NIST — an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce — and fellow consortium members to advance the consortium’s mandate.
NVIDIA’s participation builds on a record of working with governments, researchers and industries of all sizes to help ensure AI is developed and deployed safely and responsibly.
Through a broad range of development initiatives, including NeMo Guardrails, open-source software for ensuring large language model responses are accurate, appropriate, on topic and secure, NVIDIA actively works to make AI safety a reality.
In 2023, NVIDIA endorsed the Biden Administration’s voluntary AI safety commitments. Last month, the company announced a $30 million contribution to the U.S. National Science Foundation’s National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource pilot program, which aims to broaden access to the tools needed to power responsible AI discovery and innovation.
AISIC Research Focus
Through the consortium, NIST aims to facilitate knowledge sharing and advance applied research and evaluation activities to accelerate innovation in trustworthy AI. AISIC members, which include more than 200 of the nation’s leading AI creators, academics, government and industry researchers, as well as civil society organizations, bring technical expertise in areas such as AI governance, systems and development, psychometrics and more.
In addition to participating in working groups, NVIDIA plans to leverage a range of computing resources and best practices for implementing AI risk-management frameworks and AI model transparency, as well as several NVIDIA-developed, open-source AI safety, red-teaming and security tools.

            Futurists are consistent in their appraisals that AI isn’t going away and won’t just assist humans, but that it will serve as a collaborator — necessitating that students be fully prepared for that reality.

To Richard Culatta, students need to learn about artificial intelligence and its inner workings now. But even more critical, says the CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, is that educators teach pupils not just about the technology, but how to partner with AI in their own work.
“Every kid that graduates today is going to work on a team where not every member of their team is human,” Culatta says. “How do you work on a team where not all members are human? How do you know what tasks to hand off to non-human counterparts?”
As AI populates our everyday lives — from being woven into search engines to suggesting which social media accounts to follow — so too is the technology working its way into classrooms.

Whether AI appears in student work, in assessment and lesson design, or in building a lunchroom schedule, futurists are fairly universal in their opinion that AI isn’t going away. Instead, this is a technology that won’t just assist us but will serve as a collaborator.
Culatta says that’s something everyone — especially today’s students — will need to learn to expect. “What type of human do we need to be preparing for the world they’re going to be walking into?”
So how can educators prepare today’s learners for a future working alongside AI? Education and science experts say there are several steps that can be taken within curriculum today to help students prepare for tomorrow.
Help students understand best uses
Schools should think about how to help prepare students to be good humans within an AI-driven world, says Culatta. Aside from knowing how to use AI, students also need to be ready for a world where that technology dominates some skills humans control now.
That may mean focusing on helping them understand the skills AI can handle best versus those that are uniquely human, such as creativity and empathy.
Culatta says rather than teaching students skills that will likely be handed over to AI, they should focus on how to be comfortable handing those tasks over and strengthening the abilities that the technology can’t substitute.
Ultimately, Culatta asks, can students know when it’s better to hand something to AI or know when a human would be better-suited to the task, and understand how to know that?
Rethink assessments
To teach students how to work with and trust AI, schools also need to look at their assessments. Culatta says ISTE gets calls that schools are worried AI is contributing to increases in cheating.
“There’s no evidence that cheating has increased in schools,” he says.
Instead, he says, more attention should go to rethinking tests that were designed to ask students to cut and paste answers, popping in a definition or deriving a numeric solution to a formula.
Better options include asking students to use AI to come up with six possible solutions to a problem, and then assess the flaws and benefits of each.
“That’s a skill we need for the future,” Culatta says. “It’s critical thinking. They have to know something about the solutions, whether they are good or bad.”

Pete Just, executive director of the Indiana CTO Council, concurs that schools need to shift their thinking away from whether students will or won’t use AI — or even if that’s called cheating — and instead teach them how to use the technology with “academic integrity.”
“It’s acknowledging that you may use it, and if you do, here’s what we expect of you,” Just says.
Provide teachers PD for AI
Knowing how to use AI effectively and to teach that thought process requires educators to have some comfort level with the technology.
While there are always early adopters within any field, using AI through Bing’s search engine or even through an Open AI subscription is not the same as knowing how to weave the tool into curriculum.
The Consortium for School Networking’s AI Exploration for Educators has been working with New York City Public Schools and thousands of educators to help teachers think differently about AI, says Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN. That includes the development of the K-12 Generative Artificial Intelligence Readiness Checklist. One of the first starting points Krueger notes is for educators to start using AI with tasks they need to handle in their classrooms.
“One of the themes is to play with it,” Krueger says.
Support around AI is critical, adds Just, who notes that teachers are not getting much professional development yet around the tech. While 5% to 10% of educators are using the tool on their own, he says, the rest need some assistance to get comfortable with how and where to use AI.
“Teachers and administrators should be using it to handle administrative tasks,” Just says. “That’s an easy way to dip into the waters, then move forward on how to import this into classrooms.”

But Just says not everything should be handed over to AI right now. For example, educators may eventually want to be able to chart how students are doing academically or design realistic projections for student growth in subject areas. But putting student data into open AI spaces, like Open AI today, can run into privacy issues with student data.
For educators to understand these nuances, they first need to learn how to get comfortable with using AI and how it works before knowing what they can currently do and what needs to wait.
“We start with teacher professional development and staff professional development, helping them understand the issues around ethics and student privacy and even practical pedagogical uses of AI,” Just says.
Install guardrails
According to Just, paid services or software license agreements will begin to appear in schools and districts to ensure AI has more guardrails around student data. He says that if schools and districts aren’t paying for K12-specific tools for AI yet, they eventually will.
Krueger agrees. He expects to see more “walled-garden” or district-specific AI solutions soon to allow educators to use the technology to design more student-focused lessons — even those tailored to a specific pupil. Until then, as educators start using AI, they should continue to be mindful of the student information they enter.
“We encourage teachers and administrators to use AI to solve problems they are trying to solve, but with the understanding that if you’re putting something into AI, be careful not to load IEPs [individualized education programs] into AI,” Krueger says.

While caution is important, experts agree that educators do need to start using AI — mainly because their students already are. Even more keenly, learners will use AI in ways we have yet to imagine. To Culatta, educators who focus on how to not use AI hold students back from developing skills around a technology that will be critical to their future.
“We can say what not to do all day long, but you can’t practice not doing something. And if you want good skills, you have to practice doing something,” Culatta says. “The skills we’re teaching in schools are not aligned with the skills needed to thrive in the digital world. And that’s a huge mess we have to fix in schools.”

The expanding use of artificial intelligence in business today has many people experiencing greater fear and anxiety over their futures. Recent research has shown that mental health of employees has been impacted, with the American Psychological Association’s 2023 Work in America Survey revealing that close to 2 out of every 5 workers (38%) worry that AI might make some or all of their job duties obsolete in the future.


To learn more about this topic, I caught up this month with Dan Diasio, EY’s Global Artificial Intelligence (AI) Consulting Leader. In this role, he supports clients with AI-enabled business transformation by supporting the strategic direction, identification, design, deployment of Trusted-AI and modern data platforms. He works across industries to narrow the divide of between digital immigrants and digital natives to transform weaknesses into competitive advantage.

EY’s recent AI Anxiety in Business Survey is based on findings from 1,000 employed US workers at least somewhat familiar AI about their perception of and experience with AI-backed technologies.

PROMOTED
Here’s what Diasio shared:
Kathy Caprino: Dan, what prompted EY to move forward to conduct the “AI Anxiety in Business” Survey?

Dan Diasio: Generative AI (GenAI) was one of the hottest topics in 2023 with major breakthroughs throughout the business world. However, we’ve seen that as leaders move to adopt, there was a disconnect of excitement between the leaders and the users of AI systems. Most technology projects fail, and this is with user adoption. AI is not immune from this challenge.

It's important for us to understand the full picture when it comes to AI integration, from regulation and tactical implementation to attitudes and feelings employees have about the perceived threat technology poses. Understanding this, we felt there was a real need to dig deeper into what aspects of AI and related technologies are keeping leaders and employees up at night.

Our survey uncovers the effects of AI and its current usage in the workplace, as well as how its rapid adoption is fueling anxieties across the workforce. It offers business leaders crucial insights on potential barriers and how to help employers overcome them. This information is not only valuable to us at EY for our own usage, but can help us provide better counsel to our clients on how they should be approaching AI adoption with humans at the center.

Caprino: From the findings, what surprised you the most as a leader in AI?
Diasio: AI anxiety hasn’t derailed excitement about technology’s potential, but workers want regulation with integration. Based on our research, 78% of employees say the government needs to play a bigger role in regulating AI. Given how polarizing politics are today, the fact that employees want to see more AI regulation– by AI developers and the government–was surprising.
Interestingly, employees who trust AI (80%) are more likely than those who don’t (71%) to say the government needs to play a bigger role in regulating AI technology.
Caprino: Were there any key differences based on age of respondent, in the types of responses received?
Diasio: Yes - the apparent lack of trust Gen Z workers have relative to their Millennial and Gen X counterparts was very interesting. Despite being the first true digital natives to enter the workforce, Gen Z employees are not the most likely to be using AI at work and significantly less convinced of its benefits. For example, just 72% of Gen Z believe AI will make them more efficient compared to 85% of Millennials and 89% of Gen X. We’re finding that Gen Z are the most likely generation to treat AI capabilities with a healthy dose of skepticism. However, the youngest generation represents the future of the workforce, and it is crucial for business leaders to engage Gen Z amid AI integration.
Caprino: What steps can leaders take to overcome employee AI anxiety and concerns amid adoption?
Diasio: While most employees trust AI technologies, almost as many have concerns. AI is a new tool for most employees, and with headlines swirling around its potential for negative consequences such as job displacement, workers can understandably be anxious about fully embracing the technology. According to our research, ‘FOBO’ - the fear of becoming obsolete - is plaguing the workforce, with a staggering 75% of employees concerned AI will make certain jobs obsolete. Potentially more alarmingly, about two-thirds (65%) say they are anxious about AI replacing their job.
However, human-centered design is crucial to unlocking AI throughout organizations, so for business leaders, communication, transparency and education are vital to decreasing worker AI anxiety and fully unlocking the potential of AI.
Key steps and initiatives include:
Education
Workers indicated that they not only expect training programs but are actively concerned that the current programs offered are not adequate enough. Our survey saw that 80% of respondents said more training/upskilling would make them more comfortable using AI at work, suggesting that these educational workshops are a key to lowering anxiety levels. However, nearly as many (73%) have concerns that there won’t be sufficient training or upskilling opportunities, meaning that leaders can’t just go through the motions with AI training, and the training instead needs to be strategic.
Transparency
To make employees more comfortable using AI, leaders need to share more information about responsible/ethical AI best practices, as well as receive more communication promoting the responsible/ethical use of AI. Employees said if senior leadership promoted using AI responsibly and ethically (77%), they would be more comfortable using AI at work.
Communication
At the end of the day, employees want to be informed about the process and have their opinions heard. 77% of employees felt they would be more comfortable with AI adoption at work if all levels of an organization were involved in the adoption process.
Caprino: How do you anticipate AI will continue to evolve over the next year? What trends do you anticipate for 2024?
Diasio: This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a surge of excitement around an emerging technology’s potential, but businesses shouldn’t dismiss the hype around AI - this is a revolutionary tool and harnessing its potential should be a top priority in 2024 and beyond.
What’s unique about the GenAI (generative AI) hype cycle is the constant and rapid increase of maturity and usage that has followed its explosive introduction into the market, and there’s no sign of this rapid evolution slowing down.
2023 marked a year of discovery for most organizations and understanding AI, with businesses experimenting with AI-backed solutions across a variety of functions. In 2024, we anticipate the theme to be all about scale.
GenAI will be deployed and integrated more strategically and with a focus on transforming the flow of work (rather than adding a new tool). Additionally, we anticipate that organizations will move beyond out-of-the-box capabilities and seek to implement AI that is right sized (and priced) for their needs, integrating other types of AI (like causal AI) that are specifically fit for performing actions.
In today’s challenging macroeconomic environment amid ongoing economic uncertainty, leaders will also likely feel pressure to showcase the ROI on AI investments, which we expect to further drive the focus from experimentation to scaling a proven concept.
Caprino: We are now just over a year since ChatGPT’s explosive introduction into the market. How can businesses shift from experimentation to execution while keeping in mind the risks associated with new technologies?
Diasio: GenAI is a fundamentally different technology than those that preceded it. It is probabilistic, which means that it often does not consistently give the same answers, which makes it difficult to test. Furthermore, just as abilities emerged as companies added more data to models, so do new risks emerge.
Every company embarking on the AI journey should have a strong AI Governance and Risk Management Program. These should be run by a combination of Business Leaders and Risk Management professions that are trained in how AI works. Business leaders should think of themselves as trustees and custodians of their organization’s technological ecosystem and embed responsible practices in AI – including data protection, compliance with evolving regulatory obligations, and appropriate principles and codes of practice – to maintain trust and mitigate risks.
If well-designed and implemented, regulatory mechanisms can help promote safe and trusted AI systems. For emerging technologies like AI, this will involve designing regulatory mechanisms with a capacity to evolve over time.
Ethical implications of AI are also paramount and a top concern from workers today. Our survey revealed 71% of employees are concerned about the ethical/moral considerations of using AI. Businesses can embrace transparency to mitigate the human risk surrounding ethical concerns.
In our research, the majority of employees say they would view an organization more positively if it:


Offered AI responsibility/ethics training for employees (80%)
Created an AI responsibility/ethical task force (77%)
Had a trusted third-party review of AI built by that organization (76%)


Caprino: Finally, how can businesses help prepare their employees for what’s to come on the AI front and build the workforce of the future? And with the current proliferation of new generative AI tools, how can organizations and employees manage the learning curve?
Diasio: Ultimately, GenAI is here to stay. We’re telling our clients to think about the impact of AI the same way that the internet changed all industries. New innovations are inevitable and empowering individuals by putting humans and technology together will be the key to success. Companies do not need more tools, they need to reimagine their workflows – and it's only the people conducting these workflows that can make this happen.
Employees are crucial in the successful integration of new technologies, so leaders must prioritize alleviating the fears that employees have.
Successful implementation will require thoughtful communication and meaningful upskilling programs that allow employees to feel seen and heard, while also ensuring they’re more comfortable with how and when to use the technology.

With the swift ascendancy of artificial intelligence, there is a looming fear that AI will replace jobs. Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicted in a 2023 report that the workforce in the United States and Europe would be upended, with 300 million jobs lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.


In a recent survey conducted by ResumeBuilder, 37% of business leaders revealed they have already begun to replace staff with AI. Nearly half (44%) of the executive respondents stated they anticipate further jobs cuts in 2024 due to AI efficiency.

This year, a number of top companies have already enacted workforce reductions, while announcing plans to redirect their investments into generative AI and automation. The reallocation of resources to AI investments is a major way in which this emerging technology is impacting job security for white-collar professionals.

CEO Andy Jassy said last week in Amazon’s earnings call, “Gen AI is and will continue to be an area [of] pervasive focus and investment across Amazon primarily because there are few initiatives that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes.” Jassy projected that this technology will “drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.”

Google
Google recently laid off hundreds of employees across various functions, including its advertising, sales, engineering, hardware and Google Assistant teams. These job cuts were about “removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity in some areas,” according to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.
In January, Pichai warned his employees in an internal memo about the possibility of more “role eliminations” at the company in the coming months. “We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,” he wrote in a message to Google staff that was obtained by the Verge. “The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices.” Pichai told employees that “some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year where needed, and some roles may be impacted.”
In an earnings call last week, the chief executive said, “We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures.”
He added, “Across different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas.”
Echoing Pichai’s sentiments, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company is moderating expense growth by exhibiting a “slower pace of hiring,” as she points to the “headcount down year-on-year.”
Microsoft
Last month, Microsoft eliminated 1,900 gaming roles, impacting about 8% of Activision Blizzard, Xbox and ZeniMax employees. In an internal memo to staff, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote, “As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business.”
In addition to the company’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has a substantial $13 billion investment and 49% stake in OpenAI, the company behind chatbot ChatGPT.
In his earnings call last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told investors, “We move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains.”
In talking about the future of work, Nadella said, “A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as a 70% improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks.”
In scaling Microsoft’s AI and cloud investments, the company remains “focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team.”
When discussing how the organization is able to make margin improvements, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood told investors the company is “re-pivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing, without adding material number of people to the workforce.”

As AI-driven fakery spreads—from election-related robocalls and celebrity deepfake videos to doctored images and students abusing the powers of ChatGPT—a tech arms race is ramping up to detect these falsehoods.
But in higher ed, many are choosing to stand back and wait, worried that new tools for detecting AI-generated plagiarism may do more harm than good.
“Twenty-five years ago, you were grabbing at your student’s text saying, ‘I know this isn’t theirs,’” said Emily Isaacs, director of Montclair State University’s Office for Faculty Excellence. “You couldn’t find it [online], but you knew in your heart it wasn’t theirs.”

Montclair announced in November—a year after the launch of ChatGPT—that academics should not use the AI-detector feature in a tool from Turnitin. That followed similar moves from institutions including Vanderbilt University, the University of Texas at Austin and Northwestern University.
A big question driving these decisions is: Do AI-detection tools even work?
“It’s really an issue of, we don’t want to say you cheated when you didn’t cheat,” Isaacs said. Instead, she said, “Our emphasis has been raising awareness, mitigation strategies.”

Awareness of AI-driven falsehoods and the perils of plagiarism has skyrocketed. This week, Meta—parent company of Facebook and Instagram—announced it would label AI-generated images. That followed an uproar caused by fake, AI-generated pornographic images of singer Taylor Swift circulating online and AI-powered robocalls impersonating President Joe Biden that sought to suppress votes in the New Hampshire primary. The Federal Communications Commission outlawed such AI robocalls on Thursday.
Meanwhile, discussions of plagiarism and its detection have surged since Harvard’s now former president Claudine Gay was accused of plagiarizing portions of two previously published articles. Gay resigned in the wake of that and after a congressional hearing on antisemitism in higher education.
With faculty spending more than a year fretting about the potential abuse of AI tools like ChatGPT, technology companies such as Turnitin have touted the benefits of AI detectors. The tools, typically integrated into other grammar and writing software, scan text like a spell-checker or antiplagiarism program.

Turnitin says its AI-detection tool, in an attempt to avoid false positives, can miss roughly 15 percent of AI-generated text in a document. 
“We’re comfortable with that since we do not want to highlight human-written text as AI text,” the company’s website says, pointing toward its 1 percent false-positive rate.
The detection tools have raised their own questions, and for many institutions there are no clear-cut answers.
“The idea of being all for it or entirely against it, I don’t know if it breaks down like that,” said Holly Hassel, director of the composition program at Michigan Technological University. “You imagine it as a tool that could be beneficial while recognizing it’s flawed and may penalize some students.”
The Effectiveness of AI Detectors
In June last year, an international team of academics found a dozen AI-detection tools were “neither accurate nor reliable.”
That same month, a team of University of Maryland students found the tools would flag work not produced by AI or could be entirely circumvented by paraphrasing AI-generated text. Their research found “these detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios.”
“There are a lot of companies raising a lot of funding and claiming they have detectors to be reliably used, but the issue is none of them explain what the evaluation is and how it’s done—it’s just snapshots,” said Soheil Feizi, the director of the university’s Reliable AI Lab who oversaw the Maryland team.
In November, two professors from Australia’s University of Adelaide conducted AI-detection experiments for Times Higher Education (Inside Higher Ed’s parent company).
Some tools, including Copyleaks, fared better than others, but the professors summed up their findings with a singular warning: “The real takeaway is that we should assume students will be able to break any AI-detection tools, regardless of their sophistication.”
The investigations themselves raised concerns about feeding students’ work to the generative AI tools, where it’s “not clear what’s done with it,” Isaacs said.
Isaacs and Feizi noted other problems, including that there is no evidence trail when the tools flag suspected AI writing.
“With the AI detection, it’s just a score and there’s nothing to click,” Isaacs said. “You can’t replicate or analyze the methodology the detection system used, so it’s a black box.”


Turnitin's AI detector
Turnitin 

Annie Chechitelli, chief product officer at Turnitin, emphasized the importance of teacher-student relationships, rather than relying solely on technology tools.
“Detection is only one small piece of the puzzle in how educators can address with AI writing in the classroom,” Chechitelli said in a statement to Inside Higher Ed. “The largest piece of that puzzle is the student-to-teacher relationship. Our guidance is, and has always been, that there is no substitute for knowing a student, knowing their writing style and background.”
Despite their skepticism of the detection tools, Feizi and other researchers support the use of AI technology over all.
“A more comprehensive solution is to embrace the AI models in education,” Feizi said. “It’s a little bit of a hard job, but it’s the right way to think of it. The wrong way is to police it and, worse than that, is to rely on unreliable detectors in order to enforce that.”
Beginnings of an Approach on AI Detection
The Modern Language Association and the Conference on College Composition and Communication have been careful in giving guidance about AI detectors. The two groups formed a joint task force on writing and AI in November 2022, publishing their first working paper in July.
“We don’t take a formal stance, but we have a principle that tools for accountability should be used with caution and discernment or not at all,” said Hassel, co-chair of the task force and professor at Michigan Technological University. She added that among the task force members, there’s a range of approaches to the tools, with some banning them entirely.
The group’s second working paper, delving further into AI detection and the usage of tools, is slated for completion this spring.
Elizabeth Steere, a lecturer in English at the University of North Georgia, has written about the efficacy of AI detectors. She and other UNG faculty members use the AI detector iThenticate from Turnitin. Students’ work is automatically checked when they turn in assignments to their Dropbox.
Several journals also use the iThenticate tool, although the value of the costly software has been debated. Turnitin, the company behind iThenticate, offers customized pricing based on organizations’ size and needs. Otherwise, it’s generally $100 for each manuscript of fewer than 25,000 words.
Steere said the AI detector is just one tool in preventing plagiarism.
“It is a fraught issue, and each institution really does need to weigh the pros and cons and come to their own decisions, because it’s complex—it’s thorny,” she said.
The issue is further complicated by the inclusion of AI in common writing tools, like Grammarly, Google Docs and various spell-checkers.
“A lot of times it was [students saying], ‘No, I didn’t use AI,’ then it comes out they were using an overall rephrasing tool, not thinking it’s an AI tool,” Steere said. “The boundaries are much blurrier now; I really feel for the students, because we didn’t have that when we were in school.”
Steere uses those instances as teachable moments to explain the various degrees of plagiarism.
“If every student said, ‘I didn’t use AI,’ and I say, ‘Yes, you did,’ it’s not helping anyone,” she said. “But you can speak with them directly and figure out their writing process—have they used tools or augmenting, and do they consider that to be AI?”

What comes to mind when you hear the word “robot”? Do you picture a metallic humanoid in a spaceship in the distant future? Perhaps you imagine a dystopian future where humanity is enslaved by its robot overlords. Or maybe you think of an automobile assembly line with robot-like machines putting cars together.
Whatever you think, one thing is sure: robots are here to stay. Fortunately, it seems likely that robots will be more about doing repetitive or dangerous tasks than seizing supreme executive power. Let’s look at robotics, defining and classifying the term, figuring out the role of Artificial Intelligence in the field, the future of robotics, and how robotics will change our lives.
What Is Robotics?
Robotics is the engineering branch that deals with the conception, design, construction, operation, application, and usage of robots. Digging a little deeper, we see that robots are defined as an automatically operated machine that carries out a series of actions independently and does the work usually accomplished by a human.
Incidentally, robots don’t have to resemble humans, although some do. Look at images of automobile assembly lines for proof. Robots that appear human are typically referred to as “androids.” Although robot designers make their creations appear human so that people feel more at ease around them, it’s not always the case. Some people find robots, especially ones that resemble people, creepy.
Types of Robots
Robots are versatile machines, evidenced by their wide variety of forms and functions. Here's a list of a few kinds of robots we see today:

Healthcare: Robots in the healthcare industry do everything from assisting in surgery to physical therapy to help people walk to moving through hospitals and delivering essential supplies such as meds or linens. Healthcare robots have even contributed to the ongoing fight against the pandemic, filling and sealing testing swabs and producing respirators.
Homelife: You need look no further than a Roomba to find a robot in someone's house. But they do more now than vacuuming floors; home-based robots can mow lawns or augment tools like Alexa.
Manufacturing: The field of manufacturing was the first to adopt robots, such as the automobile assembly line machines we previously mentioned. Industrial robots handle a various tasks like arc welding, material handling, steel cutting, and food packaging.
Logistics: Everybody wants their online orders delivered on time, if not sooner. So companies employ robots to stack warehouse shelves, retrieve goods, and even conduct short-range deliveries.
Space Exploration: Mars explorers such as Sojourner and Perseverance are robots. The Hubble telescope is classified as a robot, as are deep space probes like Voyager and Cassini.
Military: Robots handle dangerous tasks, and it doesn't get any more difficult than modern warfare. Consequently, the military enjoys a diverse selection of robots equipped to address many of the riskier jobs associated with war. For example, there's the Centaur, an explosive detection/disposal robot that looks for mines and IEDs, the MUTT, which follows soldiers around and totes their gear, and SAFFiR, which fights fires that break out on naval vessels.
Entertainment: We already have toy robots, robot statues, and robot restaurants. As robots become more sophisticated, expect their entertainment value to rise accordingly.
Travel: We only need to say three words: self-driving vehicles.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Robots
Like any innovation today, robots have their plusses and negatives. Here’s a breakdown of the good and bad about robots and the future of robotics.
Advantages

They work in hazardous environments: Why risk human lives when you can send a robot in to do the job? Consider how preferable it is to have a robot fighting a fire or working on a nuclear reactor core.
They’re cost-effective: Robots don’t take sick days or coffee breaks, nor need perks like life insurance, paid time off, or healthcare offerings like dental and vision.
They increase productivity: Robots are wired to perform repetitive tasks ad infinitum; the human brain is not. Industries use robots to accomplish the tedious, redundant work, freeing employees to tackle more challenging tasks and even learn new skills.
They offer better quality assurance: Vigilance decrement is a lapse in concentration that hits workers who repeatedly perform the same functions. As the human’s concentration level drops, the likelihood of errors, poor results, or even accidents increases. Robots perform repetitive tasks flawlessly without having their performance slip due to boredom.

Disadvantages

They incur deep startup costs: Robot implementation is an investment risk, and it costs a lot. Although most manufacturers eventually see a recoup of their investment over the long run, it's expensive in the short term. However, this is a common obstacle in new technological implementation, like setting up a wireless network or performing cloud migration.
They might take away jobs: Yes, some people have been replaced by robots in certain situations, like assembly lines, for instance. Whenever the business sector incorporates game-changing technology, some jobs become casualties. However, this disadvantage might be overstated because robot implementation typically creates a greater demand for people to support the technology, which brings up the final disadvantage.
They require companies to hire skilled support staff: This drawback is good news for potential employees, but bad news for thrifty-minded companies. Robots require programmers, operators, and repair personnel. While job seekers may rejoice, the prospect of having to recruit professionals (and pay professional-level salaries!) may serve as an impediment to implementing robots.
The Future of Robotics: What’s the Use of AI in Robotics?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) increases human-robot interaction, collaboration opportunities, and quality. The industrial sector already has co-bots, which are robots that work alongside humans to perform testing and assembly.
Advances in AI help robots mimic human behavior more closely, which is why they were created in the first place. Robots that act and think more like people can integrate better into the workforce and bring a level of efficiency unmatched by human employees.
Robot designers use Artificial Intelligence to give their creations enhanced capabilities like:

Computer Vision: Robots can identify and recognize objects they meet, discern details, and learn how to navigate or avoid specific items.
Manipulation: AI helps robots gain the fine motor skills needed to grasp objects without destroying the item.
Motion Control and Navigation: Robots no longer need humans to guide them along paths and process flows. AI enables robots to analyze their environment and self-navigate. This capability even applies to the virtual world of software. AI helps robot software processes avoid flow bottlenecks or process exceptions.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Real-World Perception: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) help robots better understand their surroundings, recognize and identify patterns, and comprehend data. These improvements increase the robot’s autonomy and decrease reliance on human agents.


A Word About Robot Software
Software robots are computer programs that perform tasks without human intervention, such as web crawlers or chatbots. These robots are entirely virtual and not considered actual robots since they have no physical characteristics.
This technology shouldn't be confused with robotic software loaded into a robot and determines its programming. However, it's normal to experience overlap between the two entities since, in both cases, the software is helping the entity (robot or computer program) perform its functions independent of human interaction.
The Future of Robotics and Robots
Thanks to improved sensor technology and more remarkable advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, robots will keep moving from mere rote machines to collaborators with cognitive functions. These advances, and other associated fields, are enjoying an upwards trajectory, and robotics will significantly benefit from these strides.
We can expect to see more significant numbers of increasingly sophisticated robots incorporated into more areas of life, working with humans. Contrary to dystopian-minded prophets of doom, these improved robots will not replace workers. Industries rise and fall, and some become obsolete in the face of new technologies, bringing new opportunities for employment and education.
That’s the case with robots. Perhaps there will be fewer human workers welding automobile frames, but there will be a greater need for skilled technicians to program, maintain, and repair the machines. In many cases, this means that employees could receive valuable in-house training and upskilling, giving them a set of skills that could apply to robot programming and maintenance and other fields and industries.
The Future of Robotics: How Robots Will Change the World
Robots will increase economic growth and productivity and create new career opportunities for many people worldwide. However, there are still warnings out there about massive job losses, forecasting losses of 20 million manufacturing jobs by 2030, or how 30% of all jobs could be automated by 2030.
But thanks to the consistent levels of precision that robots offer, we can look forward to robots handling more of the burdensome, redundant manual labor tasks, making transportation work more efficiently, improving healthcare, and freeing people to improve themselves. But, of course, time will tell how this all works out.

An Educause report released Monday found higher education jobs related to artificial intelligence have seen the largest increase in time demands since the COVID-19 pandemic and that digital literacy skills are important for future careers in teaching and learning spaces. 
The report surveyed more than 1,000 professionals in positions related to teaching and learning, including top-level administrators to faculty members — most of whom have been in their positions for more than five years. However, many respondents indicated that they are considering leaving higher education due to heavy workloads and burnout. 
“The teaching and learning field is evolving, yet at many institutions, teaching and learning professionals are struggling to keep up because they are currently working in an environment of constraint, having to do much more with much less and only having time to focus only on the most urgent needs,” the report reads.
Workloads have increased across the board in higher education teaching and learning roles — 65% of respondents said they have excessive workloads. Roles related to AI ranked highest in increased in time demands, however there was fairly minimal growth in terms of budgeting to expand those roles. Researchers said this suggests “the demand for AI functions is outpacing the growth in AI staff.”

Most of those who responded to the survey have multiple areas of responsibility, such as added duties related to faculty training and development, distance learning and evaluating new technologies.
A majority of respondents indicated that skills in adaptability, agility and change management are important for sustaining current and future teaching careers, especially AI disrupts education.
Educause recommends in the report that higher education institutions prioritize employee well-being and morale, professional development opportunities and collaboration across campus. One of the top areas higher education institutions can begin to address these concerns is by offering remote or hybrid work options. Sixty-one percent of respondents called job flexibility “very important.” While more universities are offering employees that flexibility, about one-third of the survey’s respondents reported working from “unpreferred locations.”
“Moving forward, institutions will need to find ways to offer support for continuous professional development and training so that their teaching and learning professionals can not only adapt but also thrive,” the report reads.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, educators, administrators and other higher education stakeholders have grappled with the implications of generative artificial intelligence on intellectual property, academic integrity and ethical use, among other topics. 
While the majority of U.S. students have yet to latch on to the trend, they’re still outpacing their instructors, with a Tyton Partners report in October 2023 finding only 22 percent of faculty members utilize AI. 
Among faculty who do use AI, 43 percent are running prompts to understand what their students might be using the tools for, 35 percent are using it to teach and 29 percent are using it for in-class activities, according to the report.

Survey Says 
A November 2023 report from Anthology found 38 percent of students in the U.S. are using generative AI tools at least monthly. A November 2023 study from Chegg found only 20 percent of U.S. students have used generative AI for their coursework. 
In the workforce, only 35 percent of U.S. adults say they are comfortable integrating these tools into work and school, with worries about the accuracy of information also a top concern, according to a University of Phoenix survey from September 2023. 
Across higher education, the main barriers to AI adoption are security concerns, a need for AI training programs and ethical implications, according to a Ellucian survey of administrators in the U.S. from summer 2023. 

Here are four ways faculty members can employ artificial intelligence: 
To improve student writing. Pamela Bourjaily, a business communication professor at the University of Iowa, created an assignment that requires students to experiment with ChatGPT and learn how to create the best prompts. Students learned to edit and revise prompts to produce more accurate and helpful outputs.  To prepare slide decks. Rodney B. Murray, host of the Pulse podcast, used AI-powered tools to put together a presentation for his podcasting course. Murray compares working with MagicSlides and SlidesGPT in design, images and prices.

To provide students with feedback. Harvard University’s Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science course uses an AI tool to highlight areas of code that could be improved, as well as provide solutions. The tool is designed to make the work of TAs and professors more efficient as well as provide students with a personalized learning experience. To provide workforce tools. Following their time in college, today’s learners will encounter AI in the workplace, and it is the responsibility of the institution to prepare them for this experience, Ray Schroeder wrote in a September 2023 blog post for Inside Higher Ed. Learning modules in senior capstone courses or certificates could credential students for their future jobs. Anand Rao, professor of communication at the University of Mary Washington, introduces students to low- and no-code options to build their own generative AI tools in his special topics course on digital studies. 
Food for thought: For educators considering implementing AI into their classrooms, experts in the field share some considerations.

Create guidelines. A September 2023 report from Cornell University’s Center for Teaching and Learning encourages faculty to explicitly set expectations for when and how students can employ generative AI into their work with proper attribution. Ohio University’s Center for Teaching and Learning offers example AI policies and assignments from faculty members at the university to provide a reference point. Teach ethical use. While some institutions are teaching about AI, many lack requirements around teaching students ethics and how they can be ethical users of the technology, particularly in the U.S. Understand limitations. AI is not free from bias and sometimes hallucinates, so teaching students the shortcomings of tools such as ChatGPT can promote better learning and make them more prepared to engage with the resources.

					Artificial intelligence continues to expand and grow, not just in our everyday lives but in nearly every occupation many of us work in, including construction.AI is getting dirty. Suffolk Construction is using AI to help on job sites. Spot, the robotic dog, is able to do things at a construction site that previously took hours on end, if not days, and revolutionizing the construction industry.""This is a really wild thing,"" said Spots handler Andy Kunkle, Manager for Solution Development.The robotic dog is a big attraction for workers on site. ""Spots probably the most loved individual on the job site,"" said Ben Wilson, Chief Operating Officer of Suffolk Gulf Coast region.  ""Spots the latest in robot technology being deployed on construction sites,"" said Wilson.The spot is making surveying and documenting construction sites easier for developers.""He's designed as a data collection tool for a range of activities that focus on safety, efficiency, scheduling, and ultimately accuracy with construction projects. What Spot can do when walking a corridor is verify every element along that corridor was installed properly, at the place it should be within the overall sequence of the schedule, and alert the team to what work is needed to take place,"" said Wilson.Suffolk Construction is using Spot, designed by Boston Dynamics, on several projects, including at the new development site of the Great Wolf Lodge in Naples.""Spot will know what this building will look like before it comes out of the ground,"" said Wilson.On construction sites, Spot can capture data and is controlled by its handler, effectively making work on construction sites more accurate.""The data is being stored in the different devices attached to it. So, it walks around collects the data. Some of it can be streaming data, others you can download later. They've really designed this with that in mind. You could really have anyone on the job site run it. When you get into the specialized equipment, that's where it becomes a little more complex, like 3d scanning,"" said Andy Kunkle, operator of Spot on the job site.Spot doesn't come cheap; it costs tens of thousands of dollars but is well worth the price of admission. But, just like other technology, in time, it should eventually be affordable for more construction companies.""Is the investment in Spot worth it? Absolutely, and I would tell you Spot is the latest in a series of investments that's gotten us to this place,"" said Wilson.Spot can do things a lot quicker and more accurately, and most importantly, cut down work time on the site.""Under normal circumstances, it will take a supervisor a matter of hours to walk a job, come back process, distribute information through email, and make phone calls. Spots do that effectively in real time through a series of automated processes. The results are exponential. So, it's an incredible amount of time savings,"" said Wilson.It's a look into the future of construction and a step forward in reducing time and labor to get a project off the ground a lot quicker and more efficiently.""I want to be very clear that spot is not taking the jobs of the workforce on the job site; in fact, what he is allowing is those people being more efficient with their time,"" said Wilson.""It's a cool time to be alive,"" said Kunkle.No doubt artificial intelligence is developing quickly and is now moving into new fields of business, and more growth can be expected.The Great Wolf Lodge in Naples is expected to open up later this year.

""This is a really wild thing,"" said Spots handler Andy Kunkle, Manager for Solution Development.The robotic dog is a big attraction for workers on site. ""Spots probably the most loved individual on the job site,"" said Ben Wilson, Chief Operating Officer of Suffolk Gulf Coast region.  ""Spots the latest in robot technology being deployed on construction sites,"" said Wilson.
The spot is making surveying and documenting construction sites easier for developers.

""He's designed as a data collection tool for a range of activities that focus on safety, efficiency, scheduling, and ultimately accuracy with construction projects. What Spot can do when walking a corridor is verify every element along that corridor was installed properly, at the place it should be within the overall sequence of the schedule, and alert the team to what work is needed to take place,"" said Wilson.Suffolk Construction is using Spot, designed by Boston Dynamics, on several projects, including at the new development site of the Great Wolf Lodge in Naples.""Spot will know what this building will look like before it comes out of the ground,"" said Wilson.On construction sites, Spot can capture data and is controlled by its handler, effectively making work on construction sites more accurate.""The data is being stored in the different devices attached to it. So, it walks around collects the data. Some of it can be streaming data, others you can download later. They've really designed this with that in mind. You could really have anyone on the job site run it. When you get into the specialized equipment, that's where it becomes a little more complex, like 3d scanning,"" said Andy Kunkle, operator of Spot on the job site.Spot doesn't come cheap; it costs tens of thousands of dollars but is well worth the price of admission. But, just like other technology, in time, it should eventually be affordable for more construction companies.""Is the investment in Spot worth it? Absolutely, and I would tell you Spot is the latest in a series of investments that's gotten us to this place,"" said Wilson.Spot can do things a lot quicker and more accurately, and most importantly, cut down work time on the site.""Under normal circumstances, it will take a supervisor a matter of hours to walk a job, come back process, distribute information through email, and make phone calls. Spots do that effectively in real time through a series of automated processes. The results are exponential. So, it's an incredible amount of time savings,"" said Wilson.It's a look into the future of construction and a step forward in reducing time and labor to get a project off the ground a lot quicker and more efficiently.""I want to be very clear that spot is not taking the jobs of the workforce on the job site; in fact, what he is allowing is those people being more efficient with their time,"" said Wilson.""It's a cool time to be alive,"" said Kunkle.No doubt artificial intelligence is developing quickly and is now moving into new fields of business, and more growth can be expected.The Great Wolf Lodge in Naples is expected to open up later this year.

								Oklahoma AI task force recommends government workforce reduction in final report							

								Oklahoma state officials said they partially modeled their AI recommendations off a Japanese economic strategy dating back the 1980s.

Oklahoma’s artificial intelligence task force this week submitted its final recommendations in a report to Gov. Kevin Stitt for how the state can implement artificial intelligence to make government more efficient, including reducing the number of “redundant” government positions throughout the state.
According to the report, 21% of the workforce in Oklahoma is a federal, state or local government employee, which combined with the state’s low unemployment rate, the report argues, creates a challenge for the state’s private sector to find staff. For instance, the report estimates there are 100,000 job vacancies but only 65,000 unemployed Oklahomans to fill them.
However, the task force argues that using AI to perform administrative tasks and other digital services will return some of the available workforce to the private sector and reduce the number of government workers to 13%, calling it “an ideal percentage.”
“AI also has the potential to help us steward taxpayer dollars in a more responsible way by cutting redundant positions and replacing some positions with AI technology. Artificial intelligence creates possibilities for more efficient employment and government services,” Stitt said in a press release announcing the report.

The task force said it based its recommendations on Japan’s economic model, which began incorporating automation into its workforce in the 1980s, when it was able to do the work of three human employees with each robot. The report argues that if Oklahoma were to adopt a similar model using artificial intelligence, the state would reduce public sector human employees by 40% in favor of a more efficient workforce of “digital employees.”
Like many states racing to get ahead of the rapidly advancing technology, Stitt established a task force last September to develop policy and administrative recommendations for implementing artificial intelligence and generative AI throughout state government.
To accomplish a workforce reduction, the task force recommends automating repetitive tasks such as managing public inquiries on government websites and replacing human-staffed call centers with digital employees.
“By automating routine inquiries and responses, AI allows for a more consistent, round-the-clock service, reducing wait times and improving the overall customer experience. This dual advantage of cost reduction and enhanced service quality positions AI as a transformative tool in the customer service industry, offering a compelling case for its widespread adoption.” the report states.
In addition to business and administrative strategies using AI, the task force recommends hiring chief artificial intelligence officers within state agencies to promote the use of AI and manage its risks, following President Biden’s executive order for federal agencies to create such roles.

The task force also emphasized the need for Oklahoma to create ethical guidelines for AI implementation, such as ensuring human oversight and proper data-storage practices.

At the time, the minister had dismissed all talk of AI taking away jobs in India as “nonsense, bakwas”.&nbsp;He had also said that the “advent of Artificial Intelligence is not leading to any job losses,” and that it is only being ""used as a tool for augmenting capability.""&nbsp; New RolesIn his new statement, the minister seemed to hint that these job-losses can be offset by the new ones created by this technological revolution.But ""this will require reskilling and upskilling,” he said.He said his ministry has initiated “FutureSkills PRIME” program giving training in 10 new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence.&nbsp;The program has trained 2.9 lakh youth out of the 16.52 lakh who have signed up, he added. In addition, 2,258 trainers and 10,986 government officials have been trained on these technologies, he added..&nbsp;He also pointed to another program -- YUVAi: Youth for Unnati and Vikas with AI -- for familiarizing school students from classes 8th to 12th with AI tech and social skills. It explores the application of AI in eight areas - agriculture, health, education, transportation, environment, rural development, smart cities and law and justice.New Industrial RevolutionMeanwhile, experts believe that the rise of AI is likely to lead to massive unemployment among white-collar workers, such as those who work in finance, law, medicine and technology. In its scale and pain, it is expected to be similar to what was faced by blue-collar workers (artisans) during the time of the first industrial revolution 300 years ago.The jobs most likely to see declines are ones that involve highly repeatable tasks and pattern recognition and those that involve&nbsp; analyzing or processing large volumes of structured data.Algorithms are increasingly able to handle jobs that involve gathering data, processing paperwork, tracking inventories, or interacting with customers.As a result, they can affect jobs such as data entry clerks, administrative assistants and secretaries, accountants &amp; bookkeepers, financial analysts, manufacturing &amp; warehouse workers, retail salespeople, customer service representatives and drivers.Even some blue-collar jobs, such as driving, sales and warehouse management, are also under threat as a combination of advanced robotics and AI enable machines to do physical tasks that they were not able to earlier.The disruption will favor people who are better able to adapt to changes.For example, a customer service rep may have their more routine tasks automated, but transition into more complex complaint and dispute resolution that requires human judgement. Similarly, a financial analyst may spend less time crunching numbers in excel and more time interpreting data patterns identified algorithmically.As for the new jobs that are emerging, they often require very different skill sets compared to those possessed by people who are facing job losses.

However, the fourth industrial revolution, characterised by digital technologies and AI, is complicating the historical narrative: global studies have highlighted its impact on higher-wage earners.AI Is Projected to Have the Greatest Impact on Knowledge WorkersThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that almost 40 per cent of global employment will be exposed to AI, with the number climbing to 60 per cent in advanced economies due to their proportion of highly skilled jobs. These predictions are in line with other global studies indicating that “knowledge workers” will be most prone to automation and augmentation. With reference to the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) and the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has predicted that high-skilled, white-collar occupations (such as managers, chief executives, and science and engineering professionals) are likely to face considerable exposure to AI’s recent progress.These occupations, previously assumed to be safe from job displacement, have recently come under scrutiny due to GenAI’s startling ability to automate the type of tasks that are part of many white-collar jobs: analysing large datasets, information synthesis and content generation, all at astonishing speeds. Addressing the impact of GenAI, industry projections indicate that it could lead to the loss of 300 million full-time jobs, and that half of today’s work tasks will be automated somewhere between 2030 and 2060.However, caveats remain. Limitations (such as the speed at which AI is being adopted, and bottlenecks due to certain skills being more resistant to automation) challenge the accuracy of these estimates. So too do rapid technological advancements: an update to a decade-old study that estimated up to 47 per cent of jobs in the United States were at risk indicates that, instead, lower-skilled workers actually stand to benefit most from GenAI.These findings are echoed elsewhere too. A study of customer-support agents found that when call-centre operators used GenAI-based assistants in their work they became 14 per cent more productive. There was also a 34 per cent increase in productivity for the lowest-skilled agents, who moved up the learning curve faster with GenAI assistance. Another study on the use of LLMs, involving more than 750 business consultants, reached a similar conclusion.There is also agreement that most jobs that are partially exposed to automation are more likely to be transformed than fully automated, emphasising the potential of augmentation in many occupations.Asia’s Unique Labour-Market Environment Warrants a Closer LookAlthough some degree of consensus can be found in studies from around the globe, most of the above insights were derived from research that tapped into the O*NET database. This is a comprehensive, standardised, occupation-specific set of descriptors covering the entire US economy that is generally applicable to many Western economies. However, the data may have limited application in Asia, not least due to the continent’s unique labour-market environment and regional concerns.In South Asia, large parts of the workforce are in the informal sector, where employees don’t have fixed working hours and wages. As such, their data are not adequately captured. Informal work in Asia rose from an average of 50 per cent in the 2000s to 60 per cent over the period between 2010 and 2016. In India alone about 90 per cent of the workforce engages in informal work, notwithstanding fast economic growth and technology adoption. Data capture aside, there are pertinent concerns over the lower wages and protections for workers in the informal sector, as well as the knock-on effect for productivity.The growth of the informal sector in Asia can be seen through the increasing prominence of digital labour platforms, which mediate jobs that are short-term, task-based and on-demand. Increasingly, studies have highlighted the emergence of “microtasks” (image and data annotation, labelling, categorisation and data processing, for example) on such platforms. These tasks, which power the development of AI systems in advanced economies, are often outsourced to workers in South Asia and Africa. Studies highlight how some microtasks can be harmful to workers’ mental health (such as reviewing disturbing images or videos) and are often unrelated to their educational qualifications. More importantly, the poor quality of such jobs can lead to the deskilling of workers and the creation of low-end service economies.While digitalisation can create jobs and raise productivity and competitiveness, there are concerns that GenAI could imminently absorb roles in the business-process outsourcing (BPO) sector in the Philippines. BPO is a key sector: it employs about 1.3 million workers in call centres, knowledge-process outsourcing and back offices, software development, game development and the like, generating $30 billion a year (or 7 per cent of GDP). More than half of employers in information technology BPO in the country – 59 per cent – reported that they had adopted “4IR technologies” (referring to data exchange technologies, cyber-physical systems, the internet of things, AI, cloud computing and cognitive computing).With the forecast that at least 1.1 million Filipinos will have lost their jobs as a result of AI by 2028, Senator Imee Marcos has filed a resolution to the Senate of the Philippines to review AI use in the country’s factories and call centres. While more jobs in developed markets are exposed to automation than in emerging markets, it is predicted that nearly 20 per cent of jobs in the Philippines – and more than 10 per cent in India – could be lost to AI.More Efforts Are Needed to Achieve a Balanced Distributional EffectHistorical evidence suggests that technological advancements can boost wages without reducing the labour share. While some jobs will inevitably be lost or transformed, the impact will be counterbalanced by the beneficial productivity effect and the creation of novel job opportunities; this can lead to market expansion and the emergence of new sectors through technological innovation. AI may have the potential to create positive impact on workplace safety but concerns persist regarding job displacement, job quality, income distribution and gendered impact.Asia’s unique labour-market environment means that low- and middle-income countries in the region need to act urgently to realise the potential of digitally driven jobs as a step towards improved sustainable development. Failure to act promptly could exacerbate digital and wage inequality, and ramp up social tensions. Policymakers need to consider the current and longer-term needs of the workforce and economy, taking into account ways to integrate the future of work with economic and industrial strategies. While new jobs are being created through the development and adoption of new AI technologies, governments need to ensure that their economic, education and skills strategies work in a cohesive way to bring about structural transformation, sustainable growth and good work.Given the significant presence of BPO jobs in Asia, one focus area could be to encourage and incentivise employers to support middle- and low-skilled workers in benefitting the most from AI technologies, putting the emphasis on tech adoption and upskilling. Education and skills strategies also need to go hand in hand with the needs of the economy to ensure that the skills and talent pipeline is robust. People should be able to not only use and adopt technology, but also innovate and create value-added businesses.A Multifaceted, Participatory Approach Is NeededAcknowledging the dual nature of AI’s impact, researchers have proposed policy measures to manage disruption effectively. Existing recommendations include strategic workforce planning, lifelong learning systems and social safety nets. Other integral components of policy suggestions are the enforcement of principles for the use of AI, support for low-wage workers and consultation between employers and workers.AI’s impact on the future of work will depend on the paths and decisions that policymakers take. The IMF findings revealed that, although advanced economies face greater exposure to AI, they are also more prepared for the disruption that it will bring. Countries such as Singapore and the US, which are top of IMF’s AI Preparedness Index, are poised to take advantage of the AI wave thanks to their consistent and strategic investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, innovation and AI governance. As such, policymakers in other countries should explore ways to enable a systematic approach to developing human capital for the fourth industrial revolution, not least by focusing on linking up education and skills with industrial strategies.Given the rapid development of AI, it is paramount that multi-stakeholder groups come together – and this includes a voice for workers, who are so often on the receiving end of technology adoption. Countries should put concerted effort into uncovering real-life insights on the ground and take a participatory approach to engage workers, employers and unions alike. The disruptive nature of technology warrants this multifaceted and inclusive approach so that all of us can benefit from its transformational potential.Lead image: GettyArticle TagsArtificial IntelligenceScience & InnovationTechFuture of Work",True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://lb.institute.global/insights/tech-and-digitalisation/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-work-focus-on-asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Tony Blair Institute', 'url': 'https://institute.global/', 'sameAs': ['https://twitter.com/InstituteGC', 'https://www.instagram.com/institutegc/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/tony-blair-institute-for-global-change/', 'https://www.youtube.com/TonyBlairInstituteforGlobalChange/', 'https://www.facebook.com/instituteglobal/']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK’s artificial intelligence minister has offered to work with the EU on regulation, and said that London would likely take an approach to copyright in AI that was “reasonably close” to Brussels. 
Jonathan Berry took part in a Brussels discussion last week on AI regulation including MEP Axel Voss, rapporteur on the EU’s AI Act, which is now close to being agreed. 
While the UK is still not close to enacting similar legislation, and has instead told existing regulators to draw up rules on AI, Berry said the two sides should work with each other and trade information as the technology evolves.

Vocal assessments. Gamified tests. CV scanners. These are some of the tools companies use to screen candidates with artificial intelligence recruiting software. Job applicants face these machine prompts – and AI decides whether they are a good match or fall short.Businesses are increasingly relying on them. A late-2023 IBM survey of more than 8,500 global IT professionals showed 42% of companies were using AI screening ""to improve recruiting and human resources"". Another 40% of respondents were considering integrating the technology.Many leaders across the corporate world hoped AI recruiting tech would end biases in the hiring process. Yet in some cases, the opposite is happening. Some experts say these tools are inaccurately screening some of the most qualified job applicants – and concerns are growing the software may be excising the best candidates.""We haven't seen a whole lot of evidence that there's no bias here… or that the tool picks out the most qualified candidates,"" says Hilke Schellmann, US-based author of the Algorithm: How AI Can Hijack Your Career and Steal Your Future, and an assistant professor of journalism at New York University. She believes the biggest risk such software poses to jobs is not machines taking workers' positions, as is often feared – but rather preventing them from getting a role at all. Untold harmSome qualified job candidates have already found themselves at odds with these hiring platforms.In one high-profile case in 2020, UK-based make-up artist Anthea Mairoudhiou said her company told her to re-apply for her role after being furloughed during the pandemic. She was evaluated both based on past performance and via an AI-screening programme, HireVue. She says she ranked well in the skills evaluation – but after the AI tool scored her body language poorly, she was out of a job for good. (HireVue, the firm in question, removed its facial analysis function in 2021.) Other workers have filed complaints against similar platforms, says Schellmann.AlamyMany selection algorithms are trained on one type of employee – which means candidates with different backgrounds or credentials may be filtered out (Credit: Alamy)She adds job candidates rarely ever know if these tools are the sole reason companies reject them – by and large, the software doesn't tell users how they've been evaluated. Yet she says there are many glaring examples of systemic flaws.In one case, one user who'd been screened out submitted the same application but tweaked the birthdate to make themselves younger. With this change, they landed an interview. At another company, an AI resume screener had been trained on CVs of employees already at the firm, giving people extra marks if they listed ""baseball"" or ""basketball"" – hobbies that were linked to more successful staff, often men. Those who mentioned ""softball"" – typically women – were downgraded.Marginalised groups often ""fall through the cracks, because they have different hobbies, they went to different schools"", says Schellmann.In some cases, biased selection criteria is clear – like ageism or sexism – but in others, it is opaque. In her research, Schellmann applied to a call centre job, to be screened by AI. Then, she logged in from the employer's side. She'd received a high rating in the interview, despite speaking nonsense German when she was supposed to be speaking English, but received a poor rating for her actual relevant credentials on her LinkedIn profile. She worries the negative effects will spread as the technology does. ""One biased human hiring manager can harm a lot of people in a year, and that's not great,"" she says. ""But an algorithm that is maybe used in all incoming applications at a large company… that could harm hundreds of thousands of applicants."" 'No-one knows exactly where the harm is'""The problem [is] no-one knows exactly where the harm is,"" she explains. And, given that companies have saved money by replacing human HR staff with AI – which can process piles of resumes in a fraction of the time – she believes firms may have little motivation to interrogate kinks in the machine. One biased human hiring manager can harm a lot of people in a year, and that's not great. But an algorithm that is maybe used in all incoming applications at a large company… that could harm hundreds of thousands of applicants – Hilke SchellmanFrom her research, Schellmann is also concerned screening-software companies are ""rushing"" underdeveloped, even flawed products to market to cash in on demand. ""Vendors are not going to come out publicly and say our tool didn't work, or it was harmful to people"", and companies who have used them remain ""afraid that there's going to be a gigantic class action lawsuit against them"".It's important to get this tech right, says Sandra Wachter, professor of technology and regulation at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute.""Having AI that is unbiased and fair is not only the ethical and legally necessary thing to do, it is also something that makes a company more profitable,"" she says. ""There is a very clear opportunity to allow AI to be applied in a way so it makes fairer, and more equitable decisions that are based on merit and that also increase the bottom line of a company.""  Wachter is working to help companies identify bias through the co-creation of the Conditional Demographic Disparity test, a publicly available tool which ""acts as an alarm system that notifies you if your algorithm is biased. It then gives you the opportunity to figure out which [hiring] decision criteria cause this inequality and allows you to make adjustments to make your system fairer and more accurate"", she says. Since its development in 2020, Amazon and IBM are among the businesses that have implemented it. Schellmann, meanwhile, is calling for industry-wide ""guardrails and regulation"" from governments or non-profits to ensure current problems do not persist. If there is no intervention now, she fears AI could make the workplace of the future more unequal than before.Artificial intelligenceFeaturesHow we workTechnology of BusinessWork culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI is one of the most transformative technologies that humans have ever had access to. And the impact of this new technology will be felt right across organizations – including, of course, in the HR function. According to Gartner, 76 percent of HR leaders believe that if their organization does not adopt AI solutions, including generative AI, in the next 12–24 months, they will lag behind those companies that do. So, this is clearly a topic on HR leaders’ minds.


But how exactly might generative AI influence the work of HR? Here are my top predictions.

Increasing HR Productivity With Generative AI
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT will revolutionize so much of what HR does. It will streamline processes such as recruitment, onboarding, personal development, and day-to-day HR administrative tasks. Plus, it will be used to automatically create content, analyze data, and generate reports. In short, generative AI can unlock significant productivity gains – potentially up to 30 percent, according to that same Gartner report.

PROMOTED
Providing A Better, More Personalized Service To Employees
Generative AI isn’t just about behind-the-scenes improvements; it can also lead to new employee-facing tools that provide a better employee experience.

A super-simple example is HR chatbots. These conversational AIs can be used to aid recruitment, assist with onboarding tasks, and generally answer routine employee questions. Generative AI, therefore, enables HR teams to provide more self-service applications – but in a more intuitive, more personal, and more helpful way than ever before. With their advanced language capabilities, generative AI chatbots can understand context as well as content – making them infinitely better than the basic chatbots of old. And, of course, these tools can be available 24/7, on-demand. Best of all, by not having to manually respond to routine queries, HR professionals will have more bandwidth for more complex issues and situations that absolutely require the human touch.

Generative AI can also enable a more personalized approach to serving employees. For example, HR “co-pilots” can help guide employees on aspects such as career development, learning opportunities, reminders about personal goals, or even flagging when an employee might be stressed, in need of some time off, or in need of additional support. What’s more, Generative AI can be used to create customized learning and development plans or onboarding plans for each individual employee.

Managing The Human Implications of Digital Transformation
Of course, another thing that HR functions will be grappling with is the impact of generative AI on the wider workforce. This isn’t just about supporting the workforce through job augmentation and job displacement – important as that is – it’s also about equipping people with the skills needed to thrive in the generative AI era. HR teams will need to guide business leaders accordingly, striking a balance between the efficiency boosts that generative AI can provide and the human qualities that will still be essential for businesses. For instance, we can expect that human qualities and abilities like strategic thinking, complex problem solving, creativity, and emotional intelligence will be more in demand in the future.

Enabling HR To Play a Deeper Role In Shaping The Organization’s Future
By automating many of the daily, repetitive, and simpler HR tasks, generative AI frees up human HR professionals to focus their time on more complex or bigger-picture tasks. This, in turn, allows the HR team to become a more insightful, more strategic partner within the business. With all organizations facing a massive wave of digital transformation, the need for HR to play a leading role in navigating business change has never been more pressing. In other words, generative AI can help HR functions add even more value to the organization.
HR Can Lead The Way
With many business leaders unsure where to start the digital transformation, there’s an opportunity for HR to lead by example – by embracing generative AI and digital transformation in general.
Of course, this is easier said than done. But here are some pointers to help you on that journey:
· Plan for workforce impact. Consider carefully how generative AI – and AI in general – will impact the workforce, the kinds of skills that will be essential to future business success, and how HR can support people through the changes.
· Practice empathy. Change is scary, so as you lead the way in navigating change and uncertainty, do so with compassion and empathy.
· Embrace new tools. Learn from how other organizations have successfully implemented generative AI and find your own use cases – ideally a mixture of longer-term, more strategic ways to deploy generative AI, and some shorter-term quick-win projects that can help to build knowledge and enthusiasm.
· Publicize your successes. When generative AI adds value to HR’s work, tell that story within the business. Showcase the wins, big and small, to help increase buy-in across the business.
Generative AI heralds a new frontier in HR, offering a transformative pathway for enhancing efficiency and shaping the future of work, positioning HR leaders at the helm of digital innovation and organizational progress.

Governments and public service agencies understand the enormous potential of generative AI. Recent research by McGuire Research Services for Avanade, shows 82% of government employees are using AI on a daily or weekly basis, while 84% of organisations plan to increase their IT investments by up to 24% to take advantage of AI.
Many see AI as a driving force for a sector that has often lagged behind on technology, but which now has an opportunity to take a leadership position. What’s more, the technology is available right now.
Microsoft Copilot brings the power of large language models (LLMs) directly into the applications agencies already use, enabling powerful productivity tools to be harnessed through simple words and phrases. It can bring vast pools of data together from Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, calendars and emails, chats and meeting notes, along with Power BI reports. It can then use this data to generate new content and deliver information and insights when most needed: as a brief summary, an answer to a question or the first draft of a detailed proposal or report.
In a sector where huge amounts of time and energy are spent on mundane and repetitive tasks, the impact is dramatic. A copilot can help employees by prepopulating digital forms with data from word documents, then automating reminders and follow-up communications, summarising meetings and drafting paperwork. According to Avanade’s research, improving efficiency is the number one objective for AI in government right now, according to 44% of respondents. It’s estimated that by automating mundane tasks, workers might gain up to 20 hours per week to focus on activities where their intervention counts.
Yet this is only the beginning, given Copilot’s ability for content synthesis and summarisation. Take case workers in a government agency. Right now, simply pulling in all the information on a specific case is challenging, particularly with multiple workers or agencies involved. Copilot can summarise data from submitted applications, case notes, email or social media interactions, then synthesise it with existing policies and guidance to give workers the best available information and advice, complete with references where required. There are also obvious benefits for new workers. After all, nobody has all the relevant knowledge and resources at their fingertips from day one.
Transforming data to informed decisionsCopilot can also help teams develop a more data-driven approach to strategy and decision-making. Just by asking simple questions, workers can extract insights from a range of complex data sources, isolating trends and patterns, or even getting recommendations on potential actions. This could help supervisors generate reports to highlight where their teams need to focus resources, or recruiting teams to fill new roles to cover changes in requirements or demand. It could aid project managers in identifying how climate events or emerging financial pressures might impact budgets and delivery timelines.  
What’s more, using Copilot could transform the way governments and agencies interact and communicate with citizens, enabling them to generate more relevant, personalised content at scale. It becomes easier to target and tailor communications to specific groups and individuals, enabling them to access public services in their own language. And by helping workers generate everything from reports and requirement documents to statements of work, speeches and policy proposals, a copilot can assist them in delivering high-quality work in less time.
Getting up to speed with Generative AI takes work and vision, but this is where Avanade can help. With its established expertise in Microsoft technologies, including generative AI and data management, Avanade is uniquely equipped to help agencies and organisations work through potential use cases and workflows. Along with the supporting technical architecture. With the right strategy in place, the time and cost savings could be significant, and the potential for improvement stellar.

Well, you certainly aren’t alone, but depending on your industry, you might have nothing to worry about at all.Given the rise in popularity of platforms like ChatGPT and Google Bard, it’s safe to assume that employees around the world are concerned about the longevity of their careers. After all, these tools have been proven to seriously improve productivity when it comes to a wide range of tasks performed in the workplace.But is AI actually replacing jobs in the business world today? In this guide, we’ll explore which roles are at risk, how widespread AI job replacements actually are, and what might be holding back advancements in the technology.

Which Jobs Is AI Replacing?Our research into the Impact of Technology on the Workplace solicited a lot of information, not the least important of which was the kinds of jobs and tasks that are being replaced by AI.Given the generative nature of AI platforms on the market today, some jobs seem riper for replacement than others. However, our research actually found the opposite, with writing (63%), design (51%), and language translation (50%) representing the tasks where AI tools have no impact on removing job roles.However, other roles were not so lucky. Supply chain optimization, for example, was the most likely to be replaced by AI, with 72% of businesses admitting that had removed at least some jobs to perform the task. Other roles at the bottom of the list include legal research (65%), financial analysis (64%), and predictive maintenance on fixed assets (65%).As for why, the report had some notable insights around the reasoning for job roles being replaced by AI:“This is likely nothing more than a bottom-line decision, with these time-consuming, complex data-processing roles costing a lot of money to fill with well-trained professionals. Subsequently, being able to replace them with an automated system will save the company the most money, which is why they’re willing to risk forgoing a full-time employee to make it happen.” – Jennifer McIlveen, managing editor of Tech.coAs is often the case, the decisions on which roles are replaced by AI is largely driven by money. Subsequently, understanding how widespread AI job replacement can help you plan for the future.      How Widespread Are AI Job Replacements?Artificial intelligence (AI) and the many platforms that have arisen from its advancement over the last few years are providing businesses with the tools to tackle big problems. In many cases, these services are streamlining and even automating roles, which means that some jobs are being replaced.But how widespread is this change? Our research found that AI isn’t influencing job replacement nearly as much as you’d think, with only 4% of businesses saying that AI has had an extensive impact on replacing job roles. Even better, a whopping 53% of businesses surveyed noted that AI has had no impact on removing job roles.“The problem isn’t dire just yet. Obviously, technology and AI have begun having an effect on job roles, but for the majority of professionals, there’s plenty of time before the need to sound any alarms.” – Jennifer McIlveen, managing editor of Tech.coSimply put, if you’re worried about your job being replaced by AI, you probably have some time before you need to start updating your resume, particularly because the AI platforms on the market now are far from perfect.      What Is Keeping AI Job Replacement Low?Considering AI platforms have become so popular and productivity over such a short period of time, it might be hard to understand exactly why job replacement isn’t higher. Don’t get us wrong, we’re happy to global economy isn’t crumbling due to this new technology, but what is keeping AI job replacement so low?Well, according to our research, trust in AI isn’t very high right now, particularly when it comes to providing false information. In fact, 49% of businesses surveyed said that they were concerned about the risk of large language AI models generating false information.Subsequently, most businesses don’t feel comfortable turning over their entire operation to an AI that makes mistakes, which means that there are still plenty of jobs and skills that won’t be replaced in the near future.      Which Job Skills Are Still Valued?While some roles and tasks are eliminated by AI, there are still some valuable skills that recruiters, business owners, and managers are looking for when it comes to new employees, and they are some of the most human skills you can imagine.“Those still worried about AI taking their job, or worse, preventing them from finding a new one, will likely be reassured by Tech.co’s findings on what hiring managers consider to be the most valuable skills in a new employee.” – Jennifer McIlveen, managing editor of Tech.coCommunication, problem solving, and time management, for instance, were at the top of the list, with 98% of respondents noting these skills as at least moderately important when it comes to hiring. People management (91%) and networking (90%) were also quite notable in regard to these kinds of valuable skills.Perhaps more importantly, the value of AI skills in the workplace hasn’t taken off yet either. In fact, only 43% of respondents said that AI expertise was at least moderately important to the hiring decision, the lowest score across our research.

Is artificial intelligence coming for your banking job? That depends, experts say.
The more senior you are, the less likely your role will see an impact from AI. Generative AI technologies are much more likely to impact entry-level roles, according to research from Gartner. About 52% of entry level individual contributor positions will be impacted by generative AI, compared to 16% of first level managers and 17% of mid-level managers, Gartner finds. By the time you reach the executive level, that percentage shrinks even further. Just 3% of senior management (think: CEO, COO) are set to be impacted by AI technology.
AI is never going to fully replace human employees, and is widely expected to be a boon for the workplace. About 30% of the hours employees currently work will be automated by 2030, according to a report from McKinsey. This will free up some workers to focus on more strategic projects. But it will require some employees to embrace new skills — particularly those working in customer service and office support.
But why, exactly, are certain roles set to be affected more significantly than others? Below, we broke down which roles will be the most impacted by AI and the trends bank employees can expect over the next few years.

Entry-Level Jobs Will Experience the Most Significant Change
Less experienced workers will see the most impact from artificial intelligence. In some cases, certain tasks or responsibilities could be entirely automated, says Agustín Rubini, director analyst in the Financial Services and Banking team at Gartner.
“AI doesn’t replace jobs, AI replaces tasks,” he says. “The jobs that typically a junior person does, they have more tasks. Eighty percent of your tasks can be automated.”
This isn’t always a bad thing, Rubini adds. AI can open up new job opportunities for employees or make onerous tasks less difficult, freeing up time for more interesting pursuits.
“What you end up having is a worker who is being helped by IT to do some of their tasks, so they’re going to have to distribute their time in a different way,” he says.
However, while generative AI tools are getting smarter, they still aren’t very good at dealing with complicated people problems. There will always be a need for customer service jobs — but AI may be used to handle more basic queries or keep track of worker productivity.
Across the board, individual contributors are much more likely to use artificial intelligence than top managers. AI is “doing activities on a computer rather than being face to face with people,” Rubini says.

AI Will Create New Jobs at Banks
Big banks are rapidly developing AI technology — in some cases even outpacing tech companies.
For example, five big banks including JPMorgan Chase and TD Bank, published 67% of all the AI research done between 2017 and 2023, according to a report from Evident, a platform that tracks AI adoption in financial services. Capital One, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and TD Bank filed for 94% of the AI patents in that same time period, the report found.
In some cases, banks are poaching tech talent from Big Tech companies. Roughly 68% of leaders say they are hiring for general AI expert roles, Gartner research found. The next highest role they’re hiring for is data scientists (57%).

And many are also investing in upskilling their current workforces. Ally Bank, for example, has a program specifically focused on improving workers’ fluency with AI, says Sathish Muthukrishnan, the bank’s chief information, data and digital officer. The bank has its own proprietary, cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform called Ally.ai.
The AI fluency program gives workers the opportunity to learn more about the bank’s tools and policies surrounding AI. They also focus on how employees can incorporate AI into their work, and addresses common challenges and questions.
“We have several versions of training that we allocate and make available for our employees,” Muthukrishnan says. “The goal is to drive AI fluency for our organization.”
The drive for digital transformation needs to come from within the bank, Muthukrishnan says. Investing in developing current employees who already know your business and culture, is a good way.
“We want fair and equitable access to technology and more important AI. That should start from within,” Muthukrishnan says. “You have to give opportunities for internal employees and create a culture of a learning organization.”

AI Can Save Time on Difficult Tasks
Right now, the biggest way employees are seeing the impact of generative AI is by using large language models to synthesize information. Ally, for example, has used generative AI to help write more concise FAQs for the bank’s website, creating a more streamlined experience for customers, Muthukrishnan says.
“The time it takes to sift through information and arrive at an answer is considerably reduced, their ability to manage FAQs is so simple now,” he adds. Tools like ChatGPT can also help to write emails or other communications.
Generative AI could also be used to synthesize and transcribe information from earnings calls to create a summary, Muthukrishnan says. The tools save Ally’s investor relations teams tons of time when compiling information for earnings reports.
“It’s about how you apply the technology,” he says.



Every Bank is Different
Remember: No two banks’ AI strategies are the same. The impact of AI felt on everyday workers will likely vary greatly from organization to organization. Community banks, for example, may be slower to implement new technologies than mid-sized or large banks. However, community banks are still investing in these technologies at a rapid pace.

There are likely business opportunities that can be pursued using AI at every level of the bank, says Sophia Velastegui, chief product officer at Aptiv and the former chief technology officer for AI at Microsoft.
“Banks will need to evaluate jobs and divisions to uncover where the biggest business opportunities are for AI to provide a competitive advantage,” she says. “The real question is, what are key areas where both traditional and generative AI can assist?”

Late last week, OpenAI announced a new generative AI system named Sora, which produces short videos from text prompts. While Sora is not yet available to the public, the high quality of the sample outputs published so far has provoked both excited and concerned reactions.
The sample videos published by OpenAI, which the company says were created directly by Sora without modification, show outputs from prompts like “photorealistic closeup video of two pirate ships battling each other as they sail inside a cup of coffee” and “historical footage of California during the gold rush”. 



At first glance, it is often hard to tell they are generated by AI, due to the high quality of the videos, textures, dynamics of scenes, camera movements, and a good level of consistency. 
OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman also posted some videos to X (formerly Twitter) generated in response to user-suggested prompts, to demonstrate Sora’s capabilities.

How does Sora work?
Sora combines features of text and image generating tools in what is called a “diffusion transformer model”. 
Transformers are a type of neural network first introduced by Google in 2017. They are best known for their use in large language models such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini.
Diffusion models, on the other hand, are the foundation of many AI image generators. They work by starting with random noise and iterating towards a “clean” image that fits an input prompt.



Diffusion models (in this case Stable Diffusion) generate images from noise over many iterations.

A video can be made from a sequence of such images. However, in a video, coherence and consistency between frames are essential. 
Sora uses the transformer architecture to handle how frames relate to one another. While transformers were initially designed to find patterns in tokens representing text, Sora instead uses tokens representing small patches of space and time.
Leading the pack
Sora is not the first text-to-video model. Earlier models include Emu by Meta, Gen-2 by Runway, Stable Video Diffusion by Stability AI, and recently Lumiere by Google. 
Lumiere, released just a few weeks ago, claimed to produce better video than its predecessors. But Sora appears to be more powerful than Lumiere in at least some respects.
Sora can generate videos with a resolution of up to 1920 × 1080 pixels, and in a variety of aspect ratios, while Lumiere is limited to 512 × 512 pixels. Lumiere’s videos are around 5 seconds long, while Sora makes videos up to 60 seconds. 
Lumiere cannot make videos composed of multiple shots, while Sora can. Sora, like other models, is also reportedly capable of video-editing tasks such as creating videos from images or other videos, combining elements from different videos, and extending videos in time.



Both models generate broadly realistic videos, but may suffer from hallucinations. Lumiere’s videos may be more easily recognised as AI-generated. Sora’s videos look more dynamic, having more interactions between elements. 
However, in many of the example videos inconsistencies become apparent on close inspection.
Promising applications
Video content is currently produced either by filming the real world or by using special effects, both of which can be costly and time consuming. If Sora becomes available at a reasonable price, people may start using it as a prototyping software to visualise ideas at a much lower cost. 
Based on what we know of Sora’s capabilities it could even be used to create short videos for some applications in entertainment, advertising and education.
OpenAI’s technical paper about Sora is titled “Video generation models as world simulators”. The paper argues that bigger versions of video generators like Sora may be “capable simulators of the physical and digital world, and the objects, animals and people that live within them”.

If this is correct, future versions may have scientific applications for physical, chemical, and even societal experiments. For example, one might be able to test the impact of tsunamis of different sizes on different kinds of infrastructure – and on the physical and mental health of the people nearby.
Achieving this level of simulation is highly challenging, and some experts say a system like Sora is fundamentally incapable of doing it.
A complete simulator would need to calculate physical and chemical reactions at the most detailed levels of the universe. However, simulating a rough approximation of the world and making realistic videos to human eyes might be within reach in the coming years.
Risks and ethical concerns
The main concerns around tools like Sora revolve around their societal and ethical impact. In a world already plagued by disinformation, tools like Sora may make things worse.
It’s easy to see how the ability to generate realistic video of any scene you can describe could be used to spread convincing fake news or throw doubt on real footage. It may endanger public health measures, be used to influence elections, or even burden the justice system with potential fake evidence.

Video generators may also enable direct threats to targeted individuals, via deepfakes – particularly pornographic ones. These may have terrible repercussions on the lives of the affected individuals and their families.
Beyond these concerns, there are also questions of copyright and intellectual property. Generative AI tools require vast amounts of data for training, and OpenAI has not revealed where Sora’s training data came from.
Large language models and image generators have also been criticised for this reason. In the United States, a group of famous authors have sued OpenAI over a potential misuse of their materials. The case argues that large language models and the companies who use them are stealing the authors’ work to create new content.

It is not the first time in recent memory that technology has run ahead of the law. For instance, the question of the obligations of social media platforms in moderating content has created heated debate in the past couple of years – much of it revolving around Section 230 of the US Code.
While these concerns are real, based on past experience we would not expect them to stop the development of video-generating technology. OpenAI says it is “taking several important safety steps” before making Sora available to the public, including working with experts in “misinformation, hateful content, and bias” and “building tools to help detect misleading content”.

Automation may be possible — but when will businesses want to do it?

Why It Matters		



Looking specifically at computer vision, the researchers found that technical and cost barriers could lead to gradual rather than rapid AI task automation.

The emergence of generative artificial intelligence has companies scrambling to define AI strategy and find use cases as workers fret that automation is coming for their jobs.

But while AI job displacement will likely be substantial in the long run, the roll out will be gradual. A new working paper, “Beyond AI Exposure: Which Tasks Are Cost-Effective to Automate With Computer Vision,” found that while AI will likely change labor patterns, predictions of rapid, widespread automation do not consider a slow adoption curve and the technical feasibility and economic attractiveness of building AI systems to do a specific job.
Researchers Neil Thompson, Maja S. Svanberg, and Wensu Li of MIT; Martin Fleming of The Productivity Institute; and Brian Goehring of IBM created a new AI task automation model to more accurately predict the pace of automation. Looking specifically at computer vision, they found that technical and cost barriers could leave about three-quarters of jobs unchanged in the near term.
“Our work highlights the importance of moving beyond ‘AI exposure,’ which looks at technologically what might be automated, to accounting for the economics of the adoption decision to know what is attractive to automate,” said Thompson, a research scientist at MIT Sloan and the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “It is important to split apart the impact of AI on job automation from job augmentation, which is likely to have much different effects on the economy.”
A new model to predict AI automation 
While previous automation studies have measured the overall potential for AI to affect a particular area or job, the researchers created a model to look at when AI adoption is economically attractive, based on the following:
The level of performance required for an automated system to complete a particular task, based on surveys of workers familiar with the task.
The technical considerations of actually building an AI system capable of that performance.
The economic factors involved in building and deploying such a system.
The model looked specifically at computer vision applications, where cost modeling is more developed. The researchers found that at today’s costs, only 23% of worker wages associated with vision tasks would actually be attractive to automate. This means U.S. businesses would likely opt out of automating most vision tasks that lend themselves to AI.
To illustrate how the model works, the researchers used the example of a small bakery deciding whether to automate with computer vision. Bakers visually check ingredients for quality, a task that could be replaced by a computer vision system able to detect when food has gone bad.
Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, bakers spend about 6% of their time checking food quality. That means a small bakery with five bakers making a typical salary of $48,000 each is looking at a potential labor savings of $14,000 a year to automate that one task. “This amount is far less than the cost of developing, deploying, and maintaining a computer vision system,” the researchers write. “We would conclude that it is not economical to substitute human labor with an AI system at this bakery.”
Many tasks are simply not attractive to automate because the AI systems required to do them would be far too costly to build to ensure a proper return on investment, Thompson said, and there typically aren’t enough workers doing a task to justify the cost of creating and deploying a system for automation.
The researchers also noted that most evaluations of AI’s impact mix together full task automation, which is more likely to displace workers, and partial automation, which will likely improve worker productivity.
Other key findings from the research
Expect an adoption curve. Large companies are more likely to be interested in and ultimately deploy AI systems than smaller companies with more limited resources. However, the slow rollout of AI could be accelerated if costs for systems decline or if applications are deployed using AI-as-a-service platforms, which deliver greater scale.
There are challenges with the AI-as-a-service approach, however. It will require industry collaboration and policy initiatives to promote data sharing across companies, and it will also demand major industry and organizational recalibration if tasks are parceled out and handed off to third-party providers.

AI automation probably won’t outpace existing job automation. Automation has already come for workers’ jobs, and it is unclear whether adding AI to the mix will substantially alter the number of jobs lost, the researchers found. A large part of AI task automation will be channeled to areas where traditional automation is already happening. “Hence the two types will substitute for each other, at least in part, and the net effect will be less than the sum of each,” the researchers write.
The researchers also found that after an initial spike, job loss from computer vision will likely be smaller than the existing job churn seen in the market.
Gradual adoption allows time for intervention. A slow adoption curve creates time to institute new policies or employee retraining programs that address the impact of automation on workers.
“Our results point to a notably different path for AI automation than previously explored in the literature — one where the pace is more in-line with traditional job churn and more amenable to traditional policy interventions, and where the cost-effectiveness of systems is crucial to determining their spread,” the researchers write.

Search algorithms are algorithms designed to search for or retrieve elements from a data structure, where they are stored. They are essential to access desired elements in a data structure and retrieve them when a need arises. A vital aspect of search algorithms is Path Finding, which is used to find paths that can be taken to traverse from one point to another, by finding the most optimum route.
In this tutorial titled ‘A* Algorithm - An Introduction To The powerful search algorithm’, you will be dealing with the A* algorithm, which is a search algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points.
Your AI/ML Career is Just Around The Corner!AI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore Program
What is an A* Algorithm?
It is a searching algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between an initial and a final point.
It is a handy algorithm that is often used for map traversal to find the shortest path to be taken. A* was initially designed as a graph traversal problem, to help build a robot that can find its own course. It still remains a widely popular algorithm for graph traversal.
It searches for shorter paths first, thus making it an optimal and complete algorithm. An optimal algorithm will find the least cost outcome for a problem, while a complete algorithm finds all the possible outcomes of a problem.
Another aspect that makes A* so powerful is the use of weighted graphs in its implementation. A weighted graph uses numbers to represent the cost of taking each path or course of action. This means that the algorithms can take the path with the least cost, and find the best route in terms of distance and time.

Figure 1: Weighted Graph
A major drawback of the algorithm is its space and time complexity. It takes a large amount of space to store all possible paths and a lot of time to find them.

Applications of A* Algorithm
The A* algorithm is widely used in various domains for pathfinding and optimization problems. It has applications in robotics, video games, route planning, logistics, and artificial intelligence. In robotics, A* helps robots navigate obstacles and find optimal paths. In video games, it enables NPCs to navigate game environments intelligently. Route planning applications use A* to find the shortest or fastest routes between locations. Logistics industries utilize A* for vehicle routing and scheduling. A* is also employed in AI systems, such as natural language processing and machine learning, to optimize decision-making processes. Its versatility and efficiency make it a valuable algorithm in many real-world scenarios.
Why A* Search Algorithm?
A* Search Algorithm is a simple and efficient search algorithm that can be used to find the optimal path between two nodes in a graph. It will be used for the shortest path finding. It is an extension of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra’s Algorithm). The extension here is that, instead of using a priority queue to store all the elements, we use heaps (binary trees) to store them. The A* Search Algorithm also uses a heuristic function that provides additional information regarding how far away from the goal node we are. This function is used in conjunction with the f-heap data structure in order to make searching more efficient.
Let us now look at a brief explanation of the A* algorithm.
Explanation
In the event that we have a grid with many obstacles and we want to get somewhere as rapidly as possible, the A* Search Algorithms are our savior. From a given starting cell, we can get to the target cell as quickly as possible. It is the sum of two variables’ values that determines the node it picks at any point in time. 
At each step, it picks the node with the smallest value of ‘f’ (the sum of ‘g’ and ‘h’) and processes that node/cell. ‘g’ and ‘h’ is defined as simply as possible below:

‘g’ is the distance it takes to get to a certain square on the grid from the starting point, following the path we generated to get there. 
‘h’ is the heuristic, which is the estimation of the distance it takes to get to the finish line from that square on the grid.

Heuristics are basically educated guesses. It is crucial to understand that we do not know the distance to the finish point until we find the route since there are so many things that might get in the way (e.g., walls, water, etc.). In the coming sections, we will dive deeper into how to calculate the heuristics.
Let us now look at the detailed algorithm of A*. 
Your AI/ML Career is Just Around The Corner!AI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore ProgramAlgorithm
Initial condition - we create two lists - Open List and Closed List.
Now, the following steps need to be implemented -

The open list must be initialized. 
Put the starting node on the open list (leave its f at zero). Initialize the closed list. 
Follow the steps until the open list is non-empty:


Find the node with the least f on the open list and name it “q”.
Remove Q from the open list.
Produce q's eight descendants and set q as their parent.
For every descendant:

i) If finding a successor is the goal, cease looking
ii)Else, calculate g and h for the successor.
successor.g = q.g + the calculated distance between the successor and the q.
successor.h = the calculated distance between the successor and the goal. We will cover three heuristics to do this: the Diagonal, the Euclidean, and the Manhattan heuristics.
successor.f = successor.g plus successor.h
iii) Skip this successor if a node in the OPEN list with the same location as it but a lower f value than the successor is present.
iv) Skip the successor if there is a node in the CLOSED list with the same position as the successor but a lower f value; otherwise, add the node to the open list end (for loop).

Push Q into the closed list and end the while loop.

We will now discuss how to calculate the Heuristics for the nodes.
Master Tools You Need For Becoming an AI EngineerAI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore ProgramHeuristics
We can easily calculate g, but how do we actually calculate h? 
There are two methods that we can use to calculate the value of h:
1. Determine h's exact value (which is certainly time-consuming).
(or)
2. Utilize various techniques to approximate the value of h. (less time-consuming).
Let us discuss both methods.
Exact Heuristics
Although we can obtain exact values of h, doing so usually takes a very long time.
The ways to determine h's precise value are listed below.
1. Before using the A* Search Algorithm, pre-calculate the distance between every pair of cells.
2. Using the distance formula/Euclidean Distance, we may directly determine the precise value of h in the absence of blocked cells or obstructions.
Let us look at how to calculate Approximation Heuristics.
Master Gen AI Strategies for Businesses withGenerative AI for Business Transformation ProgramExplore ProgramApproximation Heuristics
To determine h, there are typically three approximation heuristics:
1. Manhattan Distance
The Manhattan Distance is the total of the absolute values of the discrepancies between the x and y coordinates of the current and the goal cells. 
The formula is summarized below -
h = abs (curr_cell.x – goal.x) + 
     abs (curr_cell.y – goal.y)
We must use this heuristic method when we are only permitted to move in four directions - top, left, right, and bottom.
Let us now take a look at the Diagonal Distance method to calculate the heuristic.
2. Diagonal Distance
It is nothing more than the greatest absolute value of differences between the x and y coordinates of the current cell and the goal cell. 
This is summarized below in the following formula -
dx = abs(curr_cell.x – goal.x)
dy = abs(curr_cell.y – goal.y)
h = D * (dx + dy) + (D2 - 2 * D) * min(dx, dy)
where D is the length of every node (default = 1) and D2 is the diagonal
We use this heuristic method when we are permitted to move only in eight directions, like the King’s moves in Chess.
Let us now take a look at the Euclidean Distance method to calculate the heuristic.
3. Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean Distance is the distance between the goal cell and the current cell using the distance formula:
 h = sqrt ( (curr_cell.x – goal.x)^2 + 
            (curr_cell.y – goal.y)^2 )
We use this heuristic method when we are permitted to move in any direction of our choice.

A heuristic algorithm sacrifices optimality, with precision and accuracy for speed, to solve problems faster and more efficiently.
All graphs have different nodes or points which the algorithm has to take, to reach the final node. The paths between these nodes all have a numerical value, which is considered as the weight of the path. The total of all paths transverse gives you the cost of that route.
Initially, the Algorithm calculates the cost to all its immediate neighboring nodes,n, and chooses the one incurring the least cost. This process repeats until no new nodes can be chosen and all paths have been traversed. Then, you should consider the best path among them. If f(n) represents the final cost, then it can be denoted as :
f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where :
g(n) = cost of traversing from one node to another. This will vary from node to node
h(n) = heuristic approximation of the node's value. This is not a real value but an approximation cost

Figure 2: Weighted Graph 2
Consider the weighted graph depicted above, which contains nodes and the distance between them. Let's say you start from A and have to go to D.
Now, since the start is at the source A, which will have some initial heuristic value. Hence, the results are
f(A) = g(A) + h(A)f(A) = 0 + 6 = 6
Next, take the path to other neighbouring vertices :
f(A-B) = 1 + 4
f(A-C) = 5 + 2
Now take the path to the destination from these nodes, and calculate the weights :
f(A-B-D) = (1+ 7) + 0
f(A-C-D) = (5 + 10) + 0
It is clear that node B gives you the best path, so that is the node you need to take to reach the destination.
Pseudocode of A* Algorithm
The text below represents the pseudocode of the Algorithm. It can be used to implement the algorithm in any programming language and is the basic logic behind the Algorithm.

Make an open list containing starting node

If it reaches the destination node :



Make a closed empty list 
If it does not reach the destination node, then consider a node with the lowest f-score in the open list


We are finished

Else :

Put the current node in the list and check its neighbors

For each neighbor of the current node :

If the neighbor has a lower g value than the current node and is in the closed list:


Replace neighbor with this new node as the neighbor’s parent

Else If (current g is lower and neighbor is in the open list):

Replace neighbor with the lower g value and change the neighbor’s parent to the current node.

Else If the neighbor is not in both lists:

Add it to the open list and set its g
How to Implement the A* Algorithm in Python?
Consider the graph shown below. The nodes are represented in pink circles, and the weights of the paths along the nodes are given. The numbers above the nodes represent the heuristic value of the nodes.

Figure 3: Weighted graph for A* Algorithm
You start by creating a class for the algorithm. Now, describe the open and closed lists. Here, you are using sets and two dictionaries - one to store the distance from the starting node, and another for parent nodes. And initialize them to 0, and the start node.

Figure 4: Initializing important parameters
Now, find the neighboring node with the lowest f(n) value. You must also code for the condition of reaching the destination node. If this is not the case, put the current node in the open list if it's not already on it, and set its parent nodes.

Figure 5: Adding nodes to open list and setting parents of nodes
If the neighbor has a lower g value than the current node and is in the closed list, replace it with this new node as the neighbor's parent.

Figure 6: Checking distances and updating the g values
If the current g is lower than the previous g, and its neighbor is in the open list, replace it with the lower g value and change the neighbor's parent to the current node.
If the neighbor is not in both lists, add it to the open list and set its g value.

Figure 7: Checking distances, updating the g values, and adding parents
Now, define a function to return neighbors and their distances.

                                              Figure 8: Defining neighbors
Also, create a function to check the heuristic values.

Figure 9: Defining a function to return heuristic values
Let’s describe our graph and call the A star function.

Figure 10: Calling A* function
The algorithm traverses through the graph and finds the path with the least cost
 which is through E => D => G.
Advantages of A* Algorithm
The A* algorithm offers several advantages.

Firstly, it guarantees finding the optimal path when used with appropriate heuristics.
Secondly, it is efficient and can handle large search spaces by effectively pruning unpromising paths.
Thirdly, it can be easily tailored to accommodate different problem domains and heuristics.
Fourthly, A* is flexible and adaptable to varying terrain costs or constraints. Additionally, it is widely implemented and has a vast amount of resources and support available.

Overall, the advantages of A* make it a popular choice for solving pathfinding and optimization problems.
Disadvantages of A* Algorithm
While the A* algorithm has numerous advantages, it also has some limitations.

One disadvantage is that A* can be computationally expensive in certain scenarios, especially when the search space is extensive and the number of possible paths is large.
The algorithm may consume significant memory and processing resources.
Another limitation is that A* heavily relies on the quality of the heuristic function. If the heuristic is poorly designed or does not accurately estimate the distance to the goal, the algorithm's performance and optimality may be compromised.
Additionally, A* may struggle with certain types of graphs or search spaces that exhibit irregular or unpredictable structures.

What if the search space in A* Algorithm is not a grid and is a graph?
The A* algorithm can be applied to non-grid search spaces that are represented as graphs. In this case, the nodes in the graph represent states or locations, and the edges represent the connections or transitions between them. The key difference lies in the definition of neighbors for each node, which is determined by the edges in the graph rather than the adjacent cells in a grid. A* can still be used to find the optimal path in such graph-based search spaces by appropriately defining the heuristic function and implementing the necessary data structures and algorithms to traverse the graph.
Examples of A* Algorithm
A* has been successfully applied in numerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in robotic path planning, A* helps robots navigate through dynamic environments while avoiding obstacles. In game development, A* is used to create intelligent enemy AI that can chase and follow the player efficiently. In logistics and transportation, A* assists in finding the optimal routes for delivery vehicles, minimizing time and cost. Additionally, A* has applications in network routing, such as finding the shortest path in a computer network. These examples highlight the versatility and practicality of A* algorithm concepts and implementations in various domains.

The generative AI revolution has the power to transform how banks operate. Banks are increasingly turning to AI to assist with a wide range of tasks, from customer onboarding to fraud detection and risk regulation.
For generative AI to be truly effective it must have access to the right data, but banks are almost unique in their complexity when it comes to how their data is siloed on legacy systems. So, as they leap into AI, banks must first ensure that their data is AI-ready.  This is a significant step and vital to success.
 Copilot: welcome to your virtual team
Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 helps banks get the most from generative AI. Copilot combines large language models (LLMs) with the bank’s data, providing staff access to a virtual PA, copywriter and analyst.
Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 and automatically inherits the company’s security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. It allows employees to interact with familiar work tools, from Microsoft Word to PowerPoint, using everyday language prompts or inputs.
Banks reported that harnessing Copilot for meeting summaries, email drafting and content generation was saving between half an hour and two hours a week per employee. Copilot can also help with security issues, setting up an early warning system to detect malware, trojans or phishing, as well as identify potential anti-money laundering issues and provide auto-healing for security loopholes.
 More human(s), not less
The job of Copilot is not to replace human banking activity but to make bank staff more human. Not just to increase productivity, efficiency and innovation but to free up staff to create deeper customer relationships. According to Avanade research, almost two-thirds of banks (62%) will need more people to help with AI in 2024 not less. Over half (53%) think they will need significant support to train staff in the use of generative AI tools, such as Copilot.
Avanade can help banking teams to work out how to get the most value from generative AI. Being a key Microsoft partner means we have access to the latest tools from the Microsoft portfolio,  including the latest OpenAI technologies.
Avanade can partner with banks to assess the readiness of employees and ecosystem partners.  We can prioritise actions that enable banks to use AI at scale, including governance and new operating models.

      Image    February 20, 2024 •Press ReleaseWASHINGTON — Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced the establishment of a bipartisan Task Force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to explore how Congress can ensure America continues to lead the world in AI innovation while considering guardrails that may be appropriate to safeguard the nation against current and emerging threats. 
Speaker Johnson and Leader Jeffries have each appointed twelve members to the Task Force that represent key committees of jurisdiction and will be jointly led by Chair Jay Obernolte (CA-23) and Co-Chair Ted Lieu (CA-36). The Task Force will seek to produce a comprehensive report that will include guiding principles, forward-looking recommendations and bipartisan policy proposals developed in consultation with committees of jurisdiction.
“Because advancements in artificial intelligence have the potential to rapidly transform our economy and our society, it is important for Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to understand and plan for both the promises and the complexities of this transformative technology,” said Speaker Mike Johnson. “I am happy to announce with Leader Jeffries this new Bipartisan Task Force on Artificial Intelligence to ensure America continues leading in this strategic arena.    
“Led by Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-Ca.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Ca.), the task force will bring together a bipartisan group of Members who have AI expertise and represent the relevant committees of jurisdiction. As we look to the future, Congress must continue to encourage innovation and maintain our country’s competitive edge, protect our national security, and carefully consider what guardrails may be needed to ensure the development of safe and trustworthy technology.”
“Congress has a responsibility to facilitate the promising breakthroughs that artificial intelligence can bring to fruition and ensure that everyday Americans benefit from these advancements in an equitable manner,” said Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “That is why I am pleased to join Speaker Johnson in announcing the new Bipartisan Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, led by Rep. Ted Lieu and Rep. Jay Obernolte.” 
“The rise of artificial intelligence also presents a unique set of challenges and certain guardrails must be put in place to protect the American people. Congress needs to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that America continues to lead in this emerging space, while also preventing bad actors from exploiting this evolving technology. The Members appointed to this Task Force bring a wide range of experience and expertise across the committees of jurisdiction and I look forward to working with them to tackle these issues in a bipartisan way.” 
“It is an honor to be entrusted by Speaker Johnson to serve as Chairman of the House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence,” said Chair Jay Obernolte (CA-23). “As new innovations in AI continue to emerge, Congress and our partners in federal government must keep up. House Republicans and Democrats will work together to create a comprehensive report detailing the regulatory standards and congressional actions needed to both protect consumers and foster continued investment and innovation in AI.”
“The United States has led the world in the development of advanced AI, and we must work to ensure that AI realizes its tremendous potential to improve the lives of people across our country. I look forward to working with Co-Chair Ted Lieu and the rest of the Task Force on this critical bipartisan effort.”
“Thank you to Leader Jeffries and Speaker Johnson for establishing this bipartisan House Task Force on Artificial intelligence. AI has the capability of changing our lives as we know it. The question is how to ensure AI benefits society instead of harming us. As a recovering Computer Science major, I know this will not be an easy or quick or one-time task, but I believe Congress has an essential role to play in the future of AI. I have been heartened to see so many Members of Congress of all political persuasions agree,” said Co-Chair Ted Lieu (CA-36). 
“I am honored to join Congressman Jay Obernolte in leading this Task Force on AI, and honored to work with the bipartisan Members on the Task Force. I look forward to engaging with Members of both the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference, as well as the Senate, to find meaningful, bipartisan solutions with regards to AI.”MembershipRep.

[+] hundreds, of iterations and scenarios to choose from.getty
Cities, the pulsating hubs of human civilization, face poly-crises: growing population pressures, emissions, waste, traffic and noise, aging obsolete infrastructure, chronic housing affordability, employment and the ever-present need for climate resiliency (more than 40% of the world’s urban population lives on the coasts) .


Most of the urban policies, tools, planning and engineering ideas of the mid-20th century that scaled globally have failed and sent virtually every city on an unsustainable and vulnerable path. More than half the world’s population now live in cities, and that number jumps to 80% in the next 25 years necessitating billions of tons of new material and expanded urban footprints. The needed changes to avert accelerating the crisis is immense and urgent. Cities are not buildings, streets or energy systems, cities are about people, culture, behavior, power and politics- the very word comes from Ancient Greek πολιτικά (politiká) 'affairs of the cities. We can’t keep using the same tools expecting different results- something has to to give.

In comes generative urban AI, an emerging and transformative technology poised to radically change urban planning, design, and city management. Imagine generating optimized city layouts, built form, energy, water, transport, waste and community systems. Imagine integrated systems offering personalized public services in one stop shop fashion – the possibilities are truly mind-boggling because they are data driven and they’re being developed in adjacent industries as we speak.

From AI dreams to real-time urban design and decision making

Just like the latest text to video tools like Open AI’s Sora, you can now describe and generate your ideal urban environment - walkable streets, green spaces, and a vibrant mix of shops and homes. New urban generative AI platforms can move from vision into reality in seconds with dozens, if not hundreds, of iterations and scenarios to review and choose from. Specifically generative AI allows a major shift in how cities plan, decide and design:


From reactive to proactive: Shift from fixing problems to predicting and preventing them.
Data-driven insights: Uncover hidden patterns and trends for smarter decision-making,
Personalized experiences: Tailor offerings to individual city stakeholder needs and preferences simultaneously.
Augmenting city staff expertise: AI empowers staff capabilities for more rapid piloting, knowledge transfer and accuracy.

Proactive Data-Driven Decisions 
Cities are treasure troves of data, reflecting development and travel patterns, energy consumption, and citizen needs. However, they are usually siloed, not connected and in different formats. The saying “without data there is no AI” holds very true for cities. Generative AI can only optimize and analyze data that is in a usable format. In my work, I’ve personally seen what AI is capable of and the ability to optimize the urban fabric, the movement of people and goods, predict congestion hotspots, and suggest infrastructure improvements is just the beginning. Several companies are offering urban AI-powered solutions for predicting the probability of weather related impacts on city infrastructure, severity of vehicle collisions, infrastructure maintenance optimization, and localized urban planning simulations. This data-driven approach allows for proactive planning, permitting and mitigating issues before they arise by creating more responsive, transparent and inclusive urban governance.

Empowering Citizens Democratizing City Processes
Traditionally, urban planning has been a top-down affair. Generative AI is changing that, democratizing the often labyrinthian bureaucracy by opening doors for citizen engagement, transparency and participation from the ground up. From deciphering complex zoning and building codes, to finding often contradictory engineering rules and planning regulations, residents can leverage AI-powered tools including conversational chatbots to answer their questions on their schedules, while city staff gather feedback on proposed plans, increasing transparency and inclusivity. Several companies are utilizing immersive VR and AI to visualize future virtual urban environments allowing citizens to understand and contribute to the planning process in a meaningful way.Generative AI democratizes the urban planning process for community groupsgetty
Global Cities Leading the Urban AI Transition
Most cities are at the beginning of their generative AI journey and in my work I;ve ben speaking with several sharing the best practices from adjacent and relevant industries. Several cities are starting to test and pilot AI concepts. They have been utilizing various forms of AI from computer vision to machine learning and some have started applications using generative AI. Here are just a few city AI examples by region:


Americas: Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston trialing AI in public transport, public spaces and traffic management, Pittsburgh prioritizing green development, Toronto and Curitiba managing traffic flow with AI systems, Buenos Aires streamlines waste collection with AI prediction, and Santiago pilots AI for noise control and urban simulations.
Europe And Middle East: Copenhagen and Amsterdam leverages AI to optimize building and district energy use, Helsinki spearheads the future of mobility with AI-powered solutions, Oslo embraces AI to predict and optimize waste collection routes, and Barcelona, Dubai and Tel-Aviv are utilizing AI for their transport and sustainable energy management.
Africa: Cape Town tackles traffic and crime with AI-powered management and surveillance, Lagos pilots AI tools for smarter land use and infrastructure development and in Kigali, AI-powered drones deliver and drive smart city and medical initiatives, aiming to streamline efficiency and leapfrog 20th century legacy infrastructure.
Asia Pacific: Singapore has a comprehensive AI policy for all their services, training and investments, Tokyo tackles traffic, disasters, and personalized public transport with AI, while Beijing utilizes it for air quality, building energy optimization, and smart city infrastructure. Seoul, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane utilizing AI for traffic management, public safety, demand prediction and route optimization.

Singapore is a leader in AI applications as part of their Smart Nation policy.getty
Challenges and Considerations
In my work I’m witnessing a wave of generative AI adoption in every industry and vertical that I’m currently working with and urban planning is no exception. I’ve been conducting workshops and initiating conversations on this topic with business, city leaders and AI startups to help them understand the enormous opportunities and to be aware of the potential pitfalls and lessons learned from other sectors. While the potential of generative AI is immense, challenges remain. Data bias can lead to discriminatory outputs, highlighting the need for responsible development and ethical considerations. Human oversight and transparency in model development are crucial. Additionally, the social and economic implications of urban AI adoption need careful consideration as it can exacerbate inequities if left unchecked.
Generative urban AI is here, are urban planners ready?
The tide is turning, and generative urban AI is surging. While its potential to optimize urban form, streets, energy, emissions, waste, communications and public services is undeniable, are urban planners, engineers and administrators prepared to navigate this revolutionary wave? From my recent experience and conversations in this space the skillsets are in need of an upgrade: from story telling, data governance, urban analysis, coding fluency, and an ethical framework for AI. Universities are just beginning to teach the next generation of city planners and communities need engagement and training with these tools to build trust.
It has to be better than what they have today which is a fragmented mosaic of siloed data sets, policy, bureaucracy and departments at various local, state and federal levels that at times work at cross purposes. And then there is the politics. But it is not insurmountable. In my experience planners and engineers are brilliant problem solvers, just get the politics out of the way (or at least hold it back) and watch them deliver amazing projects, polices and programs. I’ve seen that first hand and when it happens it’s incredible.Preparing for generative urban AI requires a multi-pronged approach.getty
Preparing for generative urban AI demands a three-pronged approach: upskilling the workforce with AI company partnerships, genuine community engagement, and establishing ethical AI and data governance frameworks. So what it is the starting point? Build awareness among the staff. Focus on the problem to solve. Explore key city problems that relevant AI enabled projects could help with, engage with the private sector for their partnership and proceed with care. Develop robust AI policy frameworks making it clear what staff can and cannot use AI for, how communities will have their privacy protected, link to you cyber security framework, and how you will tackle ethics, bias and fairness.
By embracing these challenges and navigating them responsibly, planners can unlock AI's potential to build inclusive, resilient, and truly smart cities for the future. Let's co-create a future where responsible generative AI shapes a better urban landscape for all. Billions of people are counting on us to get it right. We owe them that.

The Office of Personnel Management last week announced the latest step in a years-long effort to prepare federal agencies for artificial intelligence: surveying federal workers already dealing with AI.The 2020 AI in Government Act requires OPM to identify the key skills and competencies required of a federal employee working with AI, including the creation of new or revision of existing job series associated with artificial intelligence. And President Biden’s 2023 executive order on AI requires federal agencies, including OPM, to ensure that AI is used safely and securely, as well as conduct a “national AI talent surge” to recruit feds who specialize in the new technology.Last July, OPM completed the first step of its work, identifying 43 general and 14 technical competencies required for work with AI. And in a memo last week, Veronica Hinton, OPM’s associate director for workforce policy and innovation, announced the HR agency’s next task: surveying current federal employees who are already working with AI to confirm OPM’s initial list of skills.“The OPM artificial intelligence job analysis survey represents the next phase of the study and will be used to validate the AI competencies identified by technical and human resources subject matter experts as needed for performing AI work governmentwide,” Hinton wrote. “OPM plans to issue the OPM AI Job Analysis Survey today, the results of which will be used to develop an AI competency model.”Targeted for the survey are federal employees doing AI work at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, chief information and chief data officers, along with other technical and subject matter experts across government. Feds who work with AI but who have not been contacted via email to complete the survey may email competency@opm.gov to be added to the list.Later in the process, OPM may revise occupational series—or create new ones—to incorporate AI-related skills, as well as determine both how many federal employees are working in positions related to AI at each agency, and conduct two- and five-year forecasts of how many feds in AI jobs each agency will need to hire or otherwise employ.“Agencies will have the ability to identify AI talent with the needed skillsets to meet their missions and strategic goals,” Hinton wrote. “The newly validated AI competency model will serve as the foundation for assessing, hiring, developing and promoting talent into newly emerging work roles as well as enhancing the federal workforce skillsets. OPM’s AI competency model will also inform the creation of an AI competency framework through our partnership with the National Science Foundation.”

A “bold and thoughtful” adoption of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) could significantly boost productivity and improve the quality of life of all Australians, a new report has found.
McKinsey’s Generative AI and the future of work in Australia report found that the technology has the potential to increase Australian labour productivity by up to 1.1 percentage points per year through to 2030 and automate as much as half of all workplace activities within the decade.
It found that the proper implementation of technologies such as ChatGPT could help to reverse Australia’s lagging productivity.
“If Australia were to achieve even half of the potential productivity uplift, it could be on track to rekindle the faster economic growth of the post-1990s heyday,” the McKinsey report said.
“Generative AI unlocks a future that may differ markedly from the present.
“Supporting an optimistic outlook, Australia’s economy has proved robust through challenging times, and shifts from genAI could unlock benefits for Australia – including higher job demand and productivity.”
“However, this potential may only be realised if employers, governments, and educators are able to adopt the technology in a bold and thoughtful way.
“Such strategic action could ensure that future generations of Australians benefit from the same prosperity that the country has experienced over the past three decades.”
The report found that 62 per cent of existing workforce tasks have the potential to be automated using today’s genAI technology, up from 44 per cent in a McKinsey report from 2019.
This, along without economic changes, could see about 1.3 million people, or just under 10 per cent of the Australian workforce, needing to transition into new jobs by 2030.
The report separated industries in Australia into three categories based on how they will respond to the growth in generative AI: resilient and growing, stalled but rising, and disrupted and declining.
Resilience and growth
According to the report, science and technology jobs are resilient and growing, and can expect to see a net demand of 1.5 million additional jobs from 2022 to 2030.
Modelling in the report found that if genAI is adopted early and quickly, just over 50 per cent of workplace activities could be automated by 2030.
But the late adoption scenario looked in the report would see this figure being just 2 per cent.
“Advances in genAI have accelerated Australia’s automation opportunity,” the report said.
“If implemented well, these technologies could improve Australia’s productivity – and the quality of life of its people.”
GenAI tools are a “significant new force with the potential to reshape the future of work” and “could become ubiquitous, embedded into knowledge workers’ everyday tools”.
These knowledge workers will likely experience the biggest impact from generative AI too, the report found, with the demand for social, emotional, and technological skills set to increase rapidly.
Australians currently spend more than 40 per cent of their work hours on decision-making and collaboration, applying expertise, managing people, and interacting with stakeholders.
To adapt to the changes to be brought about by these technologies, Australian workers will need to be constantly building their skills.
The report backs up the findings of a recent Productivity Commission study that warned the government against “overzealous lawmaking”, and called for it to lead by example with a “stepped, gradual approach” to regulating AI.
The Productivity Commission found that AI has the potential to help to resolve Australia’s productivity slump.
A study last year found Australian companies are more likely than their international peers to ban ChatGPT, but also said that its use could improve efficiency and enhance creativity.

Kelcey Gibbons, a doctoral student who studies African Americans in technology and the Black middle class, is not quite sure what she makes of generative artificial intelligence and how it might impact the racial wealth gap. 
Gibbons anticipates that generative AI will force organizations to rethink which skills matter in the workplace, aggravating existing inequalities without a strong emphasis on access and education. 
It could also become a scapegoat for why disadvantaged groups struggle with upward mobility. Whether it narrows the racial wealth gap will depend on participation from the bottom up, Gibbons said.
Generative AI is a broad term for artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as art, audio, code, music, text and videos. It uses machine learning, another form of artificial intelligence that gleans patterns from data and algorithms that help to process new and more information.
The technology can increase productivity by automating tasks now done by humans. For example, chatGPT is a tool trained to produce text and code. It can provide detailed responses to questions, translate languages, identify errors in code and provide copywriting in the voice of a brand.  
Other generative AI tools and platforms can create interactive virtual learning or gaming environments. Professional sports leagues like the NBA and NHL are using generative AI to provide more detailed sports content to their consumers and better understand their audiences.
Workers fear generative AI will replace human jobs, which will affect Black people, who have the highest unemployment rates in the nation. 
In other words, generative AI is just the latest version of the old saying: “When America catches a cold, Black people get pneumonia.” In this case, it’s because Black people are disproportionately in the jobs that technology is likely to replace. And it could mean, once again, that fewer Black people will have decent jobs. 
According to a recent report by the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, part of the business management and consulting firm McKinsey & Co., generative AI has the potential to widen the racial wealth gap between Black and white Americans by $43 billion annually over the next 20 years. 
But if generative AI is applied with equity in mind, it could instead help close the racial wealth gap and remove barriers to Black economic mobility, the report says. 
Not so fast, said Amy Slaton, a professor of history at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Despite discourse around inclusion and a “tremendous faith in the idea of merit,” the systems in which people of color and marginalized groups operate seldom change.  
“Generative AI comes in with a high-tech promise for the economy, but it’s not,” Slaton said. “Nothing is changing for the communities that make up that economy.”
Big technological shifts have a history of keeping Black people at or near the bottom already.
During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, global trade networks yielded tremendous profits from buying and selling human beings. As global trade, including cotton and sugar production, grew, so did regimes of enslavement.
Slavery ended. Agriculture became more mechanized. New industrial opportunities popped up in cities amid a massive scale-up in manufacturing and consumption.
Black people exercised agency in their lives by migrating from the rural South to economic opportunities in urban areas in the North. But as companies developed assembly lines, new managerial techniques and later automation, reducing jobs, they did so in service to white capitalists, Slaton said.

“Capitalism in America is racial capitalism,” Slaton said.
To be sure, the Civil Rights era and integration ushered in sweeping changes for disadvantaged groups. “Individuals’ lives are drastically changed,” Slaton said. “But it’s a hierarchical economy, and people of color are historically at the bottom. AI will exacerbate that.” 
According to the McKinsey report, Black workers are overrepresented in four of the top five occupations most at risk of automation. They include office support, production work, food services and mechanical installation and repair. Roughly three in four Black workers lack a college degree. 
But in the past five years, one in every eight Black workers without a four-year degree has moved to a job that rewards experience, offers annual salaries above $42,000 and provides a path of upward mobility. These jobs include training and development specialists, and sales managers. 
The problem is that these paths are likely to disappear, too. Between 2030 and 2060, the report says, generative AI is expected to replace about half these jobs that don’t require college degrees. 
To avoid being displaced, the report argues that workers should gain skills that machines cannot do. Those “future-proof skills” include “socioemotional understanding” and “comfort with ambiguity.” Occupational health and safety specialists and special education teachers are two examples of occupations that use those skills.
In the tech industry, workers should not merely know how to use a “specific coding language to code formulaically,” but should instead understand “computational and statistical principles in order to troubleshoot and solve problems with machine-generated code,” the report says.
“Capitalism in America is racial capitalism.”Amy Slaton, a professor of history at Drexel University in Philadelphia
That’s true for any technological development, said James Pristas, professor in the department of computing and information technology at the College of Southern Nevada in North Las Vegas. Pristas teaches an introduction to artificial intelligence course at the school, a public community college where more than half the student body is Latino, Asian or Black. 
It’s too soon to know how generative AI will shape the workforce, he said. The immediate impact, though, is how students are using it to complete their assignments, which makes it difficult for professors like him to assess them. 
“It’s a major step change that is going to change the way we teach and the way kids learn,” Pristas said.
So can generative AI be deployed in a way that narrows the racial wealth gap? 
“I think that’s a question of power and access,” said Gibbons, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Who gets to say what generative AI is, and for whom?”
Generative AI tools are already used to evaluate job candidates through keyword requirements, multiple choice exams and even voice or video analysis. They risk engaging in employment discrimination by excluding people based on race, religion, gender identity and other protected classes, according to the ACLU.
Last fall, President Biden signed an executive order on developing AI safely and responsibly. And in January, the administration said that major AI companies must now report their safety tests to the government. “My Administration cannot — and will not — tolerate the use of AI to disadvantage those who are already too often denied equal opportunity and justice,” Biden’s executive order says.  
Congress has yet to enact legislation on generative AI. Meanwhile, state and local governments are writing their own rules.
According to McKinsey, generative AI can be used with an equity lens by establishing regulatory guardrails, training it on unbiased and “authentically representative” datasets, growing “diverse tech talent,” engaging all stakeholders in the design of new products and encouraging leaders to use the technology only where it can make unbiased decisions. 
The goal is to “have all people and communities — including Black communities, previously left behind by seismic shifts in tech — benefit from this amazing technology transformation,” the report says in closing. 
“The time to act is now, using the foresight of past transformations as a guide.”

Specifically, the Guidelines encourage City employees, contractors, consultants, volunteers, and vendors to use generative AI tools for purposes such as preparing initial drafts of documents, “translating” text into levels of formality or for a particular audience, coding tasks, generating diagrams or images, and developing service interfaces such as chatbots.  The Guidelines also warn these individuals about common pitfalls when using generative AI, including “making an inappropriate decision that affects residents based on AI-generated content,” “producing information, either to the public or internally, that is inaccurate,” “incorporating biases found in the AI’s training data, resulting in inequities,” “cybersecurity problems or other errors,” “exposing non-public data as part of training data sets,” and “inaccurately attributing AI-generated content to official SF sources.” 
City employees, contractors, volunteers and vendors are cautioned by the Guidelines not to enter any information that cannot be fully released to the public, publish content created by generative AI without human review and disclosure, conceal the use of generative AI during interactions with colleagues or the public, or generate images, audio, or video that could be mistaken for real people (such as “deepfakes”), even with disclosure.
The Guidelines place responsibility on information technology (IT) leaders in connection with the use of generative AI by City employees. Among other things, departmental IT leaders have “a responsibility to support right-sized generative AI uses that deliver the greatest public benefit,” and should work with vendors to ensure that AI built into procured tools is explainable and auditable; experiment with training internal models on internal data; and, when considering implementing public-facing chatbots, thoroughly test and develop a language access plan.
The Guidelines follow President Joseph Biden’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, issued in October 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom’s Executive Order N-12-23, issued in September 2023, and the California Legislature’s Senate Concurrent Resolution 17, affirming the state’s commitment to The White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.
Although limited in scope, private-sector employers who seek to be proactive in establishing AI guidelines or policies around employee use of generative AI should look to the Guidelines as one of many points of reference.  Given the rapid and fluid nature of this space, private-sector employers should also consult with counsel to make sure that they are implementing all workplace AI tools, including generative AI, in a legally compliant manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['https://www.linkedin.com/company/epstein-becker-&amp;-green-p-c-', 'https://twitter.com/ebglaw', 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/Epstein-Becker-Green/140779175933414', 'https://www.instagram.com/ebglaw', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ebglaw']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Krithivasan, in a conversation with CNBC-TV18 Managing Editor Shereen Bhan, discussed generative AI's potential impact on business and jobs, expressing cautious optimism. He addressed the perceived decoupling in the IT industry hiring, highlighting TCS's adaptive approach. By Vijay Anand   February 20, 2024, 8:37:54 PM IST (Updated)4 Min ReadTata Consultancy Services (TCS) Chief Executive Officer K. Krithivasan on Tuesday, February 20, shared his thoughts on the intricacies of generative AI, TCS's hiring strategy, and the nuanced impact of AI on business and jobs.
In an exclusive conversation with CNBC-TV18 Managing Editor Shereen Bhan on the sidelines of the 32nd Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum, Krithivasan acknowledged the transformative potential of artificial intelligence — especially generative AI — but said it is too early to say how much of an impact it would have in the years to come.
Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in an exclusive interview, said AI could cause some displacement in the job market. 
Krithivasan started the conversation by acknowledging the surge in interest surrounding generative AI and recognising its potential while remaining cautious about potential disruptions in the short-to-medium term. ""Everyone wants to leverage generative AI, so there's so much work that needs to get done. So we believe there is a lot of opportunity there. But there could be medium-to-short-term disruptions because of the overall economic outlook. So we remain optimistic, at least cautiously optimistic, in the medium to long term,"" he said.

The discussion shifted to a perceived decoupling between revenue growth and hiring in the IT industry. Krithivasan countered this narrative, providing a nuanced perspective. ""Decoupling is too strong a word. Many organisations hired over the quota during the pandemic. As the demand stabilised and softened, we started using our existing workforce and training them, so we've been using the bench to fulfil the new requirements. So to call it decoupling is too early and to say that it is because of generative AI is not accurate,"" he explained.
On the potential impact of AI on the workforce, Krithivasan aligned with Nadella's view, emphasising the coexistence of displacement and opportunity. ""We agree with him. With every technology, there will be some displacement, and some disruption, but eventually, we'll be able to do more work. When you have to do more work; you need more people to do that,"" he stated.
On hiring trends, Krithivasan detailed the company's stance. ""We don't see any significant decline in hiring. But we probably may need to change the way we train people. The kind of people we hire may also change. But we don't expect to reduce hiring or for our headcount to decrease.""
Diving into the specifics of AI's role in the workforce, Krithivasan highlighted the need for a nuanced approach to training and skill development. ""So what generative AI is doing is increasing productivity in the middle where the programming takes place. But where you are trying to gather the requirements, validate the requirements, the design, or the planning process all towards the end, where you need to validate the output of the machine and create a superior user experience, you still need humans. Those areas will not go away very quickly. What probably may get replaced, or disrupted or where you get more productivity, is the middle,"" he said.

He added that critical thinking, strategic planning and creativity will always be in demand and that TCS will reorient its training to reflect that. ""These (human-centric skills) will not go away; you probably are going to need them in higher numbers.""
The conversation extended to the broader adoption of AI across companies, with Krithivasan outlining a phased approach. ""The way we look at generative AI or any of these AI technologies is in two three phases"" he explained.
He called these phases to assist, augment, and transform.
""Assist is just helping a human do the job better. Automate is participating in the work that a human is doing. So the first, assist, could be in a call centre where a question comes on what is in this document. The answer is the summary of the document. Augment means, say, like helping a wealth advisor suggest better products,"" he added.
""So in the initial stages, you will see more assist and augment. For you to see more programmes or work that gets in the transform space, it will take more time,"" he elaborated, providing a roadmap for the evolution of AI applications in the industry.

UK will miss AI goldrush unless Government adopts a more positive vision 
2 February 2024




The Communications and Digital Committee’s report, says large language models will produce epoch defining changes comparable with the invention of the internet.



Report: Large language models and generative AI [PDF]
Report: Large language models and generative AI [HTML]
Enhanced report summary: Advances in AI large language models
Inquiry: Large language models
Communications and Digital Committee

Overview
The Government’s approach to Artificial Intelligence and large language models (LLMs) has become too focused on a narrow view of AI safety. The UK must rebalance towards boosting opportunities while tackling near-term security and societal risks. It will otherwise fail to keep pace with competitors, lose international influence and become strategically dependent on overseas tech firms for a critical technology.
The report issues a stark warning about the “real and growing” risk of regulatory capture, as a multi-billion pound race to dominate the market deepens. Without action to prioritise open competition and transparency, a small number of tech firms may rapidly consolidate control of a critical market and stifle new players, mirroring the challenges seen elsewhere in internet services.
Main findings 
The Committee welcomes the Government’s work on positioning the UK as an AI leader, but says a more positive vision for LLMs is needed to reap the social and economic benefits, and enable the UK to compete globally. Key measures include more support for AI start-ups, boosting computing infrastructure, improving skills, and exploring options for an ‘in-house’ sovereign UK large language model.
The Committee considered the risks around LLMs and says the apocalyptic concerns about threats to human existence are exaggerated and must not distract policy makers from responding to more immediate issues.
The report found there were more limited near-term security risks including cyber attacks, child sexual exploitation material, terrorist content and disinformation. The Committee says catastrophic risks are less likely but cannot be ruled out, noting the possibility of a rapid and uncontrollable proliferation of dangerous capabilities and the lack of early warning indicators. The report called for mandatory safety tests for high-risk models and more focus on safety by design.
The Committee calls on the Government to support copyright holders, saying the Government “cannot sit on its hands” while LLM developers exploit the works of rightsholders. It rebukes tech firms for using data without permission or compensation, and says the Government should end the copyright dispute “definitively” including through legislation if necessary. The report calls for a suite of measures including a way for rightsholders to check training data for copyright breaches, investment in new datasets to encourage tech firms to pay for licensed content, and a requirement for tech firms to declare what their web crawlers are being used for.
To steer the UK toward a positive outcome, the Committee sets out 10 core recommendations. These include measures to boost opportunities, address risks, support effective regulatory oversight - including to ensure open competition and avoid market dominance by established technology giants - achieve the aims set out in the AI White Paper, introduce new standards, and resolve copyright disputes.
Chair's quote
Baroness Stowell of Beeston, Chairman of the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee, said:
“The rapid development of AI Large Language Models is likely to have a profound effect on society, comparable to the introduction of the internet. That makes it vital for the Government to get its approach right and not miss out on opportunities – particularly not if this is out of caution for far-off and improbable risks. We need to address risks in order to be able to take advantage of the opportunities – but we need to be proportionate and practical. We must avoid the UK missing out on a potential AI goldrush.
“One lesson from the way technology markets have developed since the inception of the internet is the danger of market dominance by a small group of companies. The Government must ensure exaggerated predictions of an AI driven apocalypse, coming from some of the tech firms, do not lead it to policies that close down open-source AI development or exclude innovative smaller players from developing AI services. We must be careful to avoid regulatory capture by the established technology companies in an area where regulators will be scrabbling to keep up with rapidly developing technology.
“There are risks associated with the wider dissemination of LLMs. The most concerning of these are the possibility of making existing malicious actions quicker and easier - from cyber attacks to the manipulation of images for child sexual exploitation. The Government should focus on how these can be tackled and not become distracted by sci-fi end of the world scenarios.
“One area of AI disruption that can and should be tackled promptly is the use of copyrighted material to train LLMs. LLMs rely on ingesting massive datasets to work properly but that does not mean they should be able to use any material they can find without permission or paying rightsholders for the privilege. This is an issue the Government can get a grip of quickly and it should do so.
“These issues will be of huge significance over the coming years and we expect the Government to act on the concerns we have raised and take the steps necessary to make the most of the opportunities in front of us.”

But do they work?Zoë CorbynSat 3 Feb 2024 08.00 ESTShare122122Investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of work, Hilke Schellmann thought she had better try some of the tools. Among them was a one-way video interview system intended to aid recruitment called myInterview. She got a login from the company and began to experiment – first picking the questions she, as the hiring manager, would ask and then video recording her answers as a candidate before the proprietary software analysed the words she used and the intonation of her voice to score how well she fitted the job.She was pleased to score an 83% match for the role. But when she re-did her interview not in English but in her native German, she was surprised to find that instead of an error message she also scored decently (73%) – and this time she hadn’t even attempted to answer the questions but read a Wikipedia entry. The transcript the tool had concocted out of her German was gibberish. When the company told her its tool knew she wasn’t speaking English so had scored her primarily on her intonation, she got a robot voice generator to read in her English answers. Again she scored well (79%), leaving Schellmann scratching her head.“If simple tests can show these tools may not work, we really need to be thinking long and hard about whether we should be using them for hiring,” says Schellmann, an assistant professor of journalism at New York University and investigative reporter.The experiment, conducted in 2021, is detailed in Schellmann’s new book, The Algorithm. It explores how AI and complex algorithms are increasingly being used to help hire employees and then subsequently monitor and evaluate them, including for firing and promotion. Schellmann, who has previously reported for the Guardian on the topic, not only experiments with the tools, but speaks to experts who have investigated them – and those on the receiving end.Not only do many of the hiring tools not work, they are based on troubling pseudoscience and can discriminateThe tools – which aim to cut the time and cost of filtering mountains of job applications and drive workplace efficiency – are enticing to employers. But Schellmann concludes they are doing more harm than good. Not only are many of the hiring tools based on troubling pseudoscience (for example, the idea that the intonation of our voice can predict how successful we will be in a job doesn’t stand up, says Schellmann), they can also discriminate.In the case of digital monitoring, Schellmann takes aim at the way productivity is being scored based on faulty metrics such as keystrokes and mouse movements, and the toll such tracking can have on workers. More sophisticated AI-based surveillance techniques – for example, flight risk analysis, which considers various signals, such as the frequency of LinkedIn updates, to determine the chance of an employee quitting; sentiment analysis, which analyses an employee’s communications to try to tap into their feelings (disgruntlement might point to someone needing a break); and CV analysis, to ascertain a worker’s potential to acquire new skills – can also have low predictive value.It is not, says Schellmann, that she’s against the use of new approaches – the way humans do it can be riddled with bias, too – but we should not accept technology that doesn’t work and isn’t fair. “These are high stakes environments,” she says.It can be hard to get a handle on how employers are using the tools, admits Schellmann. Though existing survey data indicate widespread use, companies generally keep quiet about them and candidates and employees are often in the dark. Candidates commonly assume a human will watch their one-way video but, in fact, it may only be seen by AI.View image in fullscreenHilke Schellmann: ‘These tools aren’t going away so we have to push back.’ Photograph: Jennifer AltmanAnd the use of the tools isn’t confined to employment in hourly wage jobs. It is also creeping into more knowledge-centric jobs, such as finance and nursing, she says.Schellmann focuses on four classes of AI-based tools being deployed in hiring. In addition to one-way interviews, which can use not just tone of voice but equally unscientific facial expression analysis, she looks at online CV screeners, which might make recommendations based on the use of certain keywords found in the CVs of current employees; game-based assessments, which look for trait and skills matches between a candidate and the company’s current employees based on playing a video game; and tools that scour candidates’ social media outputs to make personality predictions.None are ready for prime time, says Schellmann. How game-based assessments check for skills relevant to the job is unclear, while, in the case of scanning a candidate’s social media history, she shows that very different sets of traits can be discerned depending on which social media feed the software analyses. CV screeners can embody bias. Schellmann cites the example of one that was found to be giving more points to candidates who had listed baseball as a hobby on their CV versus candidates who listed softball (the former is more likely to be played by men).Even vendors may not know precisely how their tools are working, let alone the companies that use them – or the candidatesMany of the tools are essentially black boxes, says Schellmann. AI let loose on training data looks for patterns, which it then uses to make its predictions. But it isn’t necessarily clear what those patterns are and they can inadvertently bake in discrimination. Even the vendors may not know precisely how their tools are working, let alone the companies that are buying them or the candidates or employees who are subjected to them.Schellmann tells of a black female software developer and military veteran who applied for 146 jobs in the tech industry before success. The developer doesn’t know why she had such a problem but she undertook one-way interviews and played AI video games, and she’s sure was subject to CV screening. She wonders if the technology took exception to her because she wasn’t a typical applicant. The job she eventually did find was by reaching out to a human recruiter.Schellmann calls on HR departments to be more sceptical of the hiring and workplace monitoring software they are deploying – asking questions and testing products. She also wants regulation: ideally a government body to check the tools to ensure they work and don’t discriminate before they are allowed to hit the market. But even mandating that vendors release technical reports about how they have built and validated their tools so others could check them would be a good first step. “These tools aren’t going away so we have to push back,” she says.In the meantime, jobseekers do have ChatGPT at their disposal to help them write cover letters, polish CVs and formulate answers to potential interview questions. “It is AI against AI,” says Schellmann. “And it is shifting power away from employers a little bit.”

But new research suggests that generative A.I. — the kind used in chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will have its biggest impact on white-collar workers with high-paying jobs in industries like banking and tech.A report published Thursday by the Burning Glass Institute, a nonprofit research center, and SHRM, formerly the Society for Human Resource Management, stops short of saying the technology will do away with large numbers of jobs. But it makes clear that workers need to better prepare for a future in which A.I. could play a significant role in many workplaces that until now have been largely untouched by technological disruption.For people in tech, it means they may be building their A.I. replacements.“There’s no question the workers who will be impacted most are those with college degrees, and those are the people who always thought they were safe,” said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor hundreds of corporations, the researchers estimated the share of payroll spending that goes to workers employed in the 200 occupations most likely to be affected by generative A.I. Many of those jobs are held by affluent college graduates, including business analysts, marketing managers, software developers, database administrators, project managers and lawyers.Companies in finance, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, have some of the highest percentages of their payrolls likely to be disrupted by generative A.I. Not far behind are tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Meta.Getting A.I. to do human work could result in big savings for those companies. The research estimates that banks and some tech companies spend 60 to 80 percent of their payrolls, or more, on workers in occupations most likely to be affected by the new technology.The retail, restaurant and transportation industries are least likely to be affected by generative A.I., the report found. Companies like Walmart, McDonald’s and Delta Air Lines mostly employ workers without college degrees who perform roles like helping customers, stocking shelves, cooking food and handling baggage. They spend less than 20 percent of their payrolls on employees in occupations most likely to be affected by generative A.I.The report doesn’t predict potential job losses related to generative A.I. That will be up to employers, the report said, and whether they want to bank the savings from A.I. automation or use that money to invest and grow, adding more workers. Most experts expect that A.I. will mostly change jobs for the next few years rather than eliminate them — though that could change if the technology improves sharply.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe report highlights the need for increased training to prepare workers to adapt to a fast-arriving technology, said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., chief executive of SHRM.“Corporations and governments are going to have to seriously invest to get ahead of this,” he said.ImageRetail, restaurants and transportation are at the bottom of the list of industries expected to be affected by generative A.I.Credit...Amir Hamja/The New York TimesThe report is the latest entry in a growing field of work trying to predict the effect of generative A.I. on the economy and the workplace. Other studies have forecast a surge in economic growth and productivity, automating activities that add up to the equivalent of millions of jobs, and time savings of up to 50 percent for routine office and coding tasks.In its research, the Burning Glass Institute started with the estimates of generative A.I. exposure by occupation in a widely cited academic paper that was published last year. It then added its own data sets — including job listings, payroll information, government statistics and corporate disclosures — for the company-by-company calculations. The SHRM report includes a ranking of selected companies. The Burning Glass Institute did the percentage estimates of the payroll spending by company for The New York Times.Manav Raj, a co-author of the academic paper that the Burning Glass Institute relied on, said the new research appeared to be a credible effort to parse company-level data. But at this stage, he said, all the studies are educated guesses.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The many papers out there generally conclude that this wave of A.I. has the potential to have a very large effect,” said Mr. Raj, an assistant professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “But it’s going to take some time to find out what that effect really looks like.”Steve Lohr writes about technology and its impact on the economy, jobs and the workplace.

Managing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools will entail big changes in culture and procedures as its use continues to spread like wildfire through developer teams.







According to Kiran Minnasandram, vice-president and chief technology officer for Wipro FullStride Cloud, this is not just about adopting new tools, but transforming how developers interact with technology, solve problems and create new paradigms in software engineering.
A “comprehensive cultural and procedural metamorphosis” is needed, he says, to properly manage risks associated with GenAI, which range from hallucinations, technical bloat, data poisoning, input manipulation or prompt injection to intellectual property (IP) violations, and theft of GenAI models themselves.
“You’ve got to worry about the validity of the model,” says Minnasandram. “You’ve got to worry about model drift or model hallucinations. Every model is based on data, and data inherently has bias. Even if it is a small percentage of bias, and you start to extrapolate that to more and more and more data, the bias is only going to increase.”
For that reason, organisations must be “very careful” with the amount of data with which they engage the models, because bias is going to get into the data. When organisations extrapolate from limited datasets, results are restricted to that quality and quantity. Desired data may be sensitive and private – and data not available in your own explicit datasets can easily introduce model hallucination.
“You therefore need good mitigation strategies, but it’s all on a case-by-case basis,” says Minnasandram. “We’ve got to be very cautious. For instance, if it’s sensitive data, how do you anonymise it without losing data quality?”
Generated content can need guardrails, too. Even if it’s source-code generation, writing some code for machine completion, that code is not complete. Appropriate guardrails for that may entail measuring the quality of that content, he says.

Responsibility frameworks
Enterprise value will require responsibility frameworks that cover individual use, as well as tech and its technicalities in a given environment. Wipro has developed its own, and looks at how it should be taken and implemented, including internally and while maintaining responsiveness to clients.
That includes working to fully understand risk exposures around code review, security and auditing, regulatory compliance and more to develop guardrails.
The good news is that more code quality and performance improvement tools are emerging, including code and compiler optimisation, for integration into CI/CD pipelines, says Minnasandram.
It cannot be a matter of just setting GenAI aside, however. Demand for tasks like code refactoring and more advanced techniques like predictive coding or collaborative coding – where a machine “sits with the dev” and does initial code lifting – are rising.
Don Schuerman, chief technology officer (CTO) of workflow automation company Pegasystems, says the key challenges are not from a lack of code so much as “a mountain of technical debt”, with poorly managed GenAI simply increasing tech burdens.
For that reason, he sees GenAI as better used for tasks other than “cranking out code”.
“Far better to use GenAI to step back into the business problem that code is trying to solve: how do we optimise a process for efficiency? What’s the fastest way to support our customers while adhering to regulatory guidelines?” he says. “Design the optimal workflows of the future, rather than cranking out code to automate processes we already know are broken.”


Workplace pressures
Even if you have experienced and skilled oversight at all levels, editing and checking code after it has been written, workplace pressures can introduce errors and mean things get missed, he agrees.
Ensure users have “safe versions of the tools” and then use GenAI more to “get ahead of the business”. With low-code tools, IT teams often found themselves cleaning up shadow IT failures, and the same could be true with GenAI – with it being more useful to deploy it specifically to deliver speed and innovation within guardrails that at the same time ensure compliance and maintainability, Schuerman points out.
Adopt methods such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help control how GenAI accesses knowledge without the overhead of building and maintaining a custom large language model (LLM), creating knowledge “buddies” that answer questions based on a designated set of enterprise knowledge content. RAG can help prevent hallucinations while ensuring citations and traceability.
Use GenAI to generate the models – workflows, data structures, screens – that can be executed by scalable, model-driven platforms. The risk comes from using GenAI to “turn everyone into developers”, creating more bloat and technical debt, says Schuerman.
Limit it to generating workflows, data models, user experiences and so on that represent the optimal customer and employee experience, grounded in industry best practices. If you do that, you can execute the resulting applications in enterprise-grade workflow and decisioning platforms that are designed to scale.
“And if you need to make changes, you aren’t going into a bunch of generated code to figure out what’s happening – you simply update business-friendly models that reflect the workflow steps or data points in your application,” says Schuerman.

While artificial intelligence will not live up to its name any time soon, mass adoption of large language models, whether by customers or in-house, requires thinking about by enterprise IT leaders.
As the hype surrounding artificial intelligence enters a new phase with the rising enterprise and hyperscale interest in generative AI, operators are not sure how to proceed with new datacentre builds, it is claimed.



Chris Royles, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) field CTO at data platform provider Cloudera, says it’s important to also train people to augment their prompts with better, more relevant information. That may mean providing a limited, thoroughly vetted collection of datasets and instructing the generative tool to only use data that can be explicitly found in those datasets and no others.
Without this, it can be tough to ensure your own best practice, standards and consistent principles when building new applications and services with GenAI, he says.
“Organisations should think quite clearly about how they bring AI into their own product,” says Royles. “And with GenAI, you’re using credentials to call third-party applications. That is a real concern, and protecting credentials is a concern.”
You always want to be able to override what the GenAI does, he says.
Make development teams broader and wider, with more accessibility or shorter test cycles. Built applications should be testable for validation features, such as whether the right encryption frameworks have been used, and whether credentials have been protected in the appropriate and correct manner.
Royles adds that GenAI can be used for other dev-related tasks, such as querying complex contracts, or whether it’s in fact legal to build or use the application in the first place. This, too, must be managed carefully due to the risk of hallucination of non-existent legal proofs or precedents.
Mitigation might be achieved in part by training people to augment their prompts with better, more relevant information. For example, providing a limited, thoroughly vetted collection of datasets and instructing the tool to only use data that can be explicitly found in those datasets and no others, he notes.


Bans won’t work
Tom Fowler, CTO at consultancy CloudSmiths, agrees that forbidding devs to use GenAI will not work. People will typically choose to use tech they perceive as making their lives easier or better, whether that flies in the face of company policy or not.
However, organisations should still apply themselves to avoiding the slippery slope to mediocrity or the “rubbish middle” that is a real risk when inadequate oversight or a team with too much technical debt seeks to use GenAI to patch over a gap in their dev skillset. “Organisations need to be cognisant of and guard against that,” says Fowler. “You need to try to understand what LLMs are good at and what they’re bad at.”
While capabilities are evolving quickly, LLMs are still “bad” at helping people write code and get it into production. Some sort of restriction might need to be placed on its use by developer teams, and organisations will still have a requirement for software engineering, including good engineers with solid experience and strong code review practices.
“For me, you can use GenAI to help you solve lots of small problems,” says Fowler. “You can solve a very small task very, very quickly, but they just don’t have the capability of holding large amounts of complexity – inherited systems, engineering systems designed to be able to solve big problems. That way humans are good. You need insight, you need reasoning, you need the capability to hold this big picture in your head.”
This can actually mean you’ll be looking at upskilling your dev teams, rather than hollowing it out to save money, he agrees.
A good engineer can functionally decompose what he or she is trying to do down into lots of small problems, and to those individual chunks, GenAI can be used. When GenAI is asked for help with a big complex problem or to do something end to end, “you can get rubbish”.
“You either get code that’s not going to work without some massaging, or just get bad ‘advice’,” says Fowler. “It’s about helping to scale your team and do more with less [partly as a result]. And the advent of multiple modalities, and domain-specific models, whether built from scratch or fine-tuned, will be 100% the future.”


Copyright considerations
Big players are beginning to offer enterprise offerings with protections around data and leakage and the like, which is “fantastic”, yet relatively little attention has so far been paid to copyright and other IP risk as it pertains to code, says Fowler.
Look at what happened when Oracle sued Google around using the Java API. Organisations might want to look at similarities and precedents to head off potentially nasty surprises in future.
“There’ll be precedents around what’s OK in terms of how much of it being tweaked and changed enough to be able to say that it’s not exactly the same as something else – but we don’t know yet,” he points out.
With the generic, broad uses of GenAI, data can easily come from something on Google or Stack Overflow, and somewhere amid all that, someone else’s IP can be replicated via the algorithm. Organisations building an LLM-based tool into their offering may need guardrails on that.
“All of that being said, I’m not convinced it’s a large risk that will deter most organisations,” says Fowler.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

Tries 20 Jobs | WIREDVimGPT is an experimental open-source program built by Ishan Shah, a lone developer, not a product in development, but you can bet that Apple, Google, and others are doing similar experiments with a view to upgrading Siri and other assistants. VimGPT is built on GPT-4V, the multimodal version of OpenAI’s famous language model. By analyzing a request it can determine what to click on or type more reliably than text-only software can, which has to attempt to make sense of the web by untangling messy HTML. “A year from now, I would expect the experience of using a computer to look very different,” says Shah, who says he built vimGPT in only a few days. “Most apps will require less clicking and more chatting, with agents becoming an integral part of browsing the web.”Shah is not the only person who believes that the next logical step after chatbots like ChatGPT is agents that use computers and roam the Web. Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who was Apple’s director of AI research from 2016 to 2020, believes that Siri and other assistants are in line for an almighty AI upgrade. “The next evolution is going to be agents that can get useful tasks done,” Salakhutdinov says. Hooking Siri up to AI like that powering ChatGPT would be useful, he says, “but it will be so much more impactful if I ask Siri to do stuff, and it just goes and solves my problems for me.”Salakhutdinov and his students have developed several simulated environments designed for testing and honing the skills of AI helpers that can get things done. They include a dummy ecommerce website, a mocked-up version of a Reddit-like message board, and a website of classified ads. This virtual testing ground for putting agents through their paces is called VisualWebArena.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyTales from this testing ground suggest that AI agents will be able to do impressive things in the near future that will make digital life much easier.

Generative AI makes it possible for individuals in a wide variety of professions to become far more productive. They can do so without anyone's permission - at school, at work, at home. They don’t even have to be public about their use of the tools. I have used them to write a computer program (in a language that I don't know), to critique the writing of others as editor of a journal, to edit my own writing, and to create images far more interesting than any I would have created on my own.


A remarkable study by Fabrizio Dell'Acqua of Harvard University and his colleagues demonstrates the potential. The study was based on 758 consultants at the Boston Consulting Group who performed a wide variety of tasks generally required of a consultant. The authors reported that the consultants using AI completed 12.2% more tasks on average, and completed tasks 25.1% faster than usual. They also “produced significantly higher quality results (more than 40% higher quality compared to a control group),” according to the report. As Ethan Mollick, one of the co-authors of the study, pointed out in his personal Substack post, it was the lower performing consultants who benefited most, achieving almost parity with the top performers.

What should leaders do to engage productively with Generative AI – not just as a better grammar-checker or code generator, but as a general purpose tool with broad potential for reshaping the context of work? Here are a few suggestions:

PROMOTED



Actively encourage people to use the tools to improve their work and make themselves more efficient. You learn by doing.
Create the slack time necessary for them to do so.
Resist the temptation to capture the efficiency gains by reducing the number of employees doing a task; instead, encourage employees to use the time they save to learn more and build on the benefits.
Encourage the sharing of results among members of the work team.
Experiment as a leader with the use of these tools in your own work. (You cannot delegate this understanding!)


AI tools are so powerful and so broad in their application that a failure to use them threatens any company’s competitive advantage. But these tools are different from earlier generations of AI. They democratize AI and cannot be controlled or managed in the traditional sense. In order to gain the full benefit from tools like ChatGPT, leaders need to combine the use of generative AI with true empowerment of employees.

Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously asserted that ""the medium is the message."" The medium in McLuhan's formulation, is any new technology - from computers to roads to AI. The message is the eventual impact the medium has on our lives and our culture. The meaning of the automobile, in McLuhan's analysis, has been (among other things) the rise of suburbs, the emergence of the middle class, and the fragmentation of the extended family. The meaning of previous generations of automation has been the rationalization, standardization and fragmentation of work – from the factory floor to the social worker.

Managing this empowerment may be harder than mastering the generative AI tools themselves, especially under the pressure of day-to-day operations. It is complicated by concerns about AI bias, inadvertent error, misinformation and intellectual property loss. But it is important to get started. If your employees are unleashed, they can help to address the concerns based on real-world cases - at the same time that they are improving their own performance. If employees do not feel that they have permission to experiment, their use of the tools will go underground, limiting their value and sidestepping the very issues of concern..

As leaders, it’s important to create a mindset for experimentation and to democratize decision- making related to the application of AI tools. The technology, by its nature, can best be leveraged at the level of the individual worker. Trying to standardize its use or manage it top-down undermines its value.
ChatGPT and other tools for generative AI constitute a powerful new technology (a new medium in McLuhan's sense of that word). Their first applications will naturally be in making work more efficient and (perhaps) less boring. But the business meaning of generative AI tools will be empowerment - a redefinition of the way work is designed, supported and managed..

 Seventy nine percent of UAE workers who are using generative AI say it makes them more productive



Amy Clewlow | 5 February, 2024









The use of generative AI in the workplace is surging in the UAE, with 40% of workers already having implemented or experimenting with the technology, compared to just 28% of workers globally, according to Salesforce’s generative AI snapshot research titled ‘The Promises and Pitfalls of Generative AI at Work‘.
In a potential boon for employers, 79% of UAE workers who are using generative AI claim it makes them more productive, while 74% say generative AI increases their levels of engagement at work.
However, according to the survey, businesses’ policies and training around the technology are not clearly defined, and are ambiguous at best, in the UAE and globally.
Fifty two percent of UAE workers have not received or completed generative AI training, which shows room for improvement on the part of their employers. Even so, the situation among UAE employers compared favourably with their global counterparts, with nearly seven in 10 global workers having never completed or received training on how to use generative AI safely and ethically at work.
Workers globally also noted that their employers’ generative AI policies are either non-existent or are not clearly defined. In the UAE, 64% of workers say their companies do not have clearly defined policies for using generative AI at work.
Given employees’ surging use of AI, the survey demonstrates that businesses should take steps to ensure that generative AI is implemented effectively, safely and ethically.
Thierry Nicault, Area Vice President and General Manager, Salesforce Middle East, said: “AI is increasingly essential to achieving efficiency and innovation in organisations across all sectors. However, to achieve their aims, companies must invest in safe, ethical and trusted generative AI tools. It is imperative that organisations stay ahead of the curve and invest in the right technology, offer training and implement clear policies that help to foster career growth, trust and an understanding of the ethical use of AI within their business environment. This will lead to yet greater productivity and employee satisfaction, while helping to ensure that AI investments reach their full potential.”

But while the AI makes for a more interesting phone, it doesn't make for a better one.",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Without AI, there wouldn’t be much to say about Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra.While it’s a very nice Android phone overall, it’s not vastly different from last year’s Galaxy S23 Ultra. I could point to the new titanium frame, the flat display that feels a bit roomier than the old Ultra’s curved glass, or the requisite annual upticks in display brightness and processing power. Still the overall impression isn’t so different from the S23 Ultra.[Photo: Jared Newman]The real novelty with the S24 Ultra comes via on the software side, where Samsung has slathered on a range of generative AI features that let you can summarize web pages, rewrite text messages, fix up your handwriting, and translate phone calls in real time. It has a few AI camera tricks as well, including the ability to reposition objects in photos and add smooth slo-mo to existing videos.[Image: Samsung]But while the AI trickery makes for a more interesting phone, it doesn’t make for a significantly better one. Learning to use Samsung’s AI features requires some new habits, and many of them just aren’t useful enough to justify the extra effort. Right now the boring smartphone performance still matters more than the novel AI stuff.Stuck with the defaultsThe biggest problem with Samsung’s new AI features is that they’re tied to Samsung apps that I’d rather not use.Web page summaries, for instance, only work with Samsung’s stock web browser, which doesn’t sync my history with other devices and kept nagging me to use its Samsung Pass password manager (despite having set Bitwarden as my system-level password manager). The summaries themselves were also overly brief, with no room for follow-up queries, and I soon decided they weren’t worth the trade-offs.I had a similar experience with Samsung’s Chat Assist feature, which can rewrite text messages via a button on Samsung’s built-in keyboard. Its ability to intelligently insert emoji seemed especially promising, but I ended up retreating back to Google’s Gboard keyboard after too many run-ins with Samsung’s decidedly unintelligent gesture typing recognition.And while Samsung’s Notes app has some neat AI features—including a way to auto-format typed notes with headings and bullet points—I’d much rather use Obsidian for note-taking. I’ve yet to get in the habit of using Samsung Notes as a starting point, and wish the Galaxy S24 Ultra could just format the content of any selected text instead.Photo editing tricksOn the photo front, Samsung’s generative AI editing features have more obvious upsides, but some of them are tucked out of sight and others are hit-or-miss with their results.Being able to remove unwanted objects from photos is a great feature—and unlike with Google’s Magic Eraser, it doesn’t require a Google One subscription—but you can get some weird results if the conditions aren’t just right. I tried to remove the waiter from a restaurant photo with my kids and their grandparents, for instance, and Samsung replaced him with a lamp that did not exist in reality. I tried removing a few people in the bleachers behind my son at a flag football game, and what was left looked vaguely skeletal.advertisement[Photo: Jared Newman]Repositioning people in an existing photo is also hard to make work in practice, neat as it sounds in theory. I’ve yet to find a photo where I really wanted to use it, and the edited effect can look obvious if the cropping around the subject isn’t perfect.The photo features that most impressed me were Samsung’s shadow and reflection removal, but they were also the hardest to find: To use them, you must swipe up on an existing photo, the tap the screen to see your options.[Images: Samsung]That leaves just one photo trick that I found to be unequivocally great: With Instant Slo Mo, Samsung uses AI frame generation to slow down existing videos without making them choppier. Not only does it work as advertised, but I found it easily via a pop-up tip that appears when you’re editing a video for the first time. (You can also quickly preview the slow motion effect via a long press.)A noted absenceSince I’m using the Galaxy S24 Ultra in particular, I’m also bummed that Samsung didn’t build the audio recording app of my dreams—if only because it came so close to doing so.Much like the Recorder app on Pixel phones, Samsung’s Voice Recorder can generate a transcript (and, optionally, a summary) using AI, letting you tap on the words to hear what was being said at the time. It works well enough, but I’d pay good money for Android app that combined audio recording and transcripts with handwriting, so I can take notes while recording interviews. Samsung’s actual Notes app doesn’t offer that capability.This speaks to my broader ambivalence with Samsung’s AI features: They just feel bolted on in ways that could be just as easily accomplished with third-party software. If Samsung sees generative AI as more than just a parlor trick, it should find deeper ways to integrate the technology.Instead of a summarize feature in Samsung’s browser, for instance, how about a universal summarize shortcut that applies to any document? How about making AI rewrites work with any text field, regardless of which keyboard you’re using? How about using AI to automate actions on apps and websites, as we’ve seen from Rabbit?Of course, such things could also just get in the way, and one reason I like Samsung phones now is that they’ve gotten better at leaving you alone. Samsung may also eventually charge for AI features, and they’re not even worth buying the phone for at this point, let alone paying extra for them. Being able to ignore the AI features entirely—or just neglect them, as I often have—isn’t such a bad thing, especially when the rest of the phone is nice enough.

How about using AI to automate actions on apps and websites, as we've seen from Rabbit?\n\n\n\nOf course, such things could also just get in the way, and one reason I like Samsung phones now is that they've gotten better at leaving you alone. Samsung may also eventually charge for AI features, and they're not even worth buying the phone for at this point, let alone paying extra for them. Being able to ignore the AI features entirely—or just neglect them, as I often have—isn't such a bad thing, especially when the rest of the phone is nice enough.""}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91018140/the-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultras-ai-features-feel-like-an-afterthought', 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91018140/the-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultras-ai-features-feel-like-an-afterthought', 'name': ""The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's AI features feel like an afterthought"", 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91018140/the-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultras-ai-features-feel-like-an-afterthought#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91018140/the-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultras-ai-features-feel-like-an-afterthought#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms/uploads/2024/02/p-1-91018140-the-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultras-ai-features-feel-like-an-afterthought.jpg', 'datePublished': '2024-02-01T05:13:00+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-01-31T22:27:45+00:00', 'description': ""Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra features on a range of generative AI offerings.

Many people view these awe-inspiring capabilities with excitement and positivity. However, it&#x2019;s understandable that many others view these advancements with apprehension, fearing negative consequences even up to the beginning of the age of (intelligent) machines that will end and take over human race control of our world. Chief among these concerns are the potential loss of jobs and the fear of being supplanted by machines.AI represents the culmination of a rich history of technological advancements, which have firmly established computer technology as the cornerstone of the modern era.Alvin Toffler, in his 1970 book Future Shock and his 1980 book The Third Wave, prophesied that computers would be central to a new revolution in human history. He wrote that they would affect and change not only certain areas of our lives, but also global economy and security &#x2013; and through them, our entire culture.console.log(&quot;2390 BODY2.

The first occurred about 13,000 years ago, with the development of agriculture, after which humans stopped wandering from place to place to hunt and gather food. The second, the Industrial Revolution, happened about 250 years ago, with the invention of modern science.

Indeed, it has the immense potential to tackle societal challenges such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and poverty reduction. Moreover, its implementation can foster the creation of high-skilled, well-paying jobs, while automating repetitive and mundane tasks, thus boosting efficiency and productivity.However, we cannot ignore the challenges and negative aspects of AI. Automation may result in the displacement of certain jobs, particularly those that involve mundane manual or repetitive tasks. Some traditional jobs may likely become obsolete, requiring workers to acquire new skills to remain employable. In short, AI is poised to significantly impact the world of work in the near future. However, concerns about the potential risks involved have prompted calls for the controlled and moderated advancement of AI.I do not concur with this popular opinion. On the contrary, I believe that these concerns are exaggerated and that the implementation of AI will have a gradual effect on the work market and will not cause extensive job losses.In the first instance, AI is not a threat to those jobs that involve physical human labor. Secondly, in most cases, AI will not replace workers but be an auxiliary tool, helping workers to better identify problems. Just as ultrasound did not replace medical doctors but enhanced their capabilities, so AI will not replace jobs but augment them.Upgrading professional lifeThe intensive integration of AI into the labor market will lead to the upgrading and development of new professions, but will not completely change most of the existing professions. I recognize that new ethical concerns may arise, such as algorithmic bias and invasion of privacy, and these issues will need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible AI deployment. AdvertisementI urge us not to fear the advancement of technology. AI is a powerful tool, but it is not a lethal tool. Its use depends on the users, and it can serve humanity for better or worse. We must and we certainly can use it responsibly and build a policy ensuring its use for the common good.In summary, the impact of AI on the workforce is multifaceted. It is crucial for societies, businesses, and policymakers to proactively address challenges, foster education and re-skilling initiatives, and create a balanced approach to AI integration that considers both economic and social aspects.The writer is director of the Blavatnik Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center at Tel Aviv University &#x2013; and chairman of AI Day, February 5, 2024, TAU.",,,,,,,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post', 'https://www.facebook.com/TheJerusalemPost/', 'https://twitter.com/Jerusalem_Post', 'https://www.instagram.com/thejerusalem_post/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLLLdCANnMAdMyrXdYbSlxg', 'https://www.reddit.com/domain/jpost.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/jerusalem-post']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JPOST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It cannot sit on its hands for the next decade and hope the courts will provide an answer.”The committee recommended the government decides whether copyright law provides enough protection to copyright holders. If it believes there are legal uncertainties around the issue, peers said, it should set out options for updating legislation.Lady Stowell, the committee’s Conservative chair, said: “The government needs to be clear whether copyright law provides sufficient protections to rights holders because of the introduction of LLMs. If the government is clear that the legislative framework is not adequate then it should update that legislative framework.”The government’s intellectual property office is drawing up a code of practice on copyright and AI. Under the 1988 Copyright Act an exemption is made for text and data mining if it is research for “a non-commercial purpose”. In 2022 the government indicated that it would widen that exemption to any use but has now rowed back on that.1:52Robot says AI is 'threat and opportunity' to artists during Lords address – videoStowell added that the UK, with its wealth of private and government-owned data, could offer licensed datasets to AI firms hoping to build models on a secure legal basis. “If we can create new licensed datasets, there is a market we ought to be able to take advantage of,” she said.OpenAI, the US-based developer of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot, is being sued in the US by the New York Times and a number of authors for alleged copyright infringement. One group of writers, which includes the bestselling John Grisham, has accused OpenAI of “systematic theft on a mass scale”.OpenAI said in its submission to the committee that it would be impossible to create tools like ChatGPT without access to copyrighted material. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the image generator company Stability AI and Microsoft, an investor in OpenAI, also told the committee that limiting access to data could result in substandard or biased models.In the US, OpenAI’s defence relies on the concept of “fair use”, which allows use of content in certain circumstances without seeking the owner’s permission. In the UK there are also copyright exemptions under “fair dealing”, which relates to areas such as research, private study and news reporting.Elsewhere in the report, the committee warns the government of a protracted period of “technological turbulence” owing to AI and urges ministers to act against market power being concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies.Stowell said: “There has to be open competition. The market has to remain open. It’s dangerous if we have a situation where it is under the control of a small number of large firms.”A government spokesperson said: “The IPO [intellectual property office] has engaged with stakeholders as part of a working group with the aim of agreeing a voluntary code on AI and copyright. We will update on that work soon and continue to work closely with stakeholders to ensure the AI and creative industries continue to thrive together.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsComputingIntellectual propertynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggestsWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma Aydemir‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himWho might Kamala Harris pick for VP?

Tim Cook says that Apple is spending ""a tremendous amount of time and effort"" on AI features that will be announced in the coming months.


Apple's Cook took the opportunity of the firm's latest financial earnings call to enthuse about the Apple Vision Pro and the future of AI. ""We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be an historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing,"" he said. ""Moments like these are what we live for at Apple, they're why we do what we do.""
He said that this is ""why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation,"" and also ""why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users.""
""As we look ahead,"" he continued, ""we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future that includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.""

Cook initially said nothing more than that, and it was only an implication that the news would happen during the year instead of at the end. That does fit with recent reports that Apple will make significant AI and Siri announcements at WWDC in June.
In response to questioning about AI, Cook did expand on his brief statement. ""In terms of generative AI,"" he added, ""we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before.""
""Our MO, if you will, has always been to to do work and then talk about work, and not to get out in front of ourselves and so we're going to hold that to this as well,"" he continued. ""But we have got some things that we're incredibly excited about, that we'll be talking about later this year.""
Perhaps the most significant element of Cook's promise of forthcoming news was how he set up that initial announcement. Apple is a technology company but also one that is very much focused on how it can ""enrich the lives of our users.""
Cook is saying that Apple is not leaping onto the AI bandwagon just in order to catch up with the rest of the industry. He's saying that Apple has been looking for a point for adding AI features —  and that it has found it.

It is well documented that Australian teachers face challenges incorporating Indigenous perspectives and content in their classrooms. The approach can sometimes be somewhat tokenistic, as if the teacher is “ticking a box”. We need a more culturally responsive teaching workforce. 
Generative AI is advancing at a fast pace and quickly finding a place within education. Tools such as ChatGPT (or Chatty G as the kids say) continue to dominate conversations in education as these technologies are explored and developed.

There are many concerns around academic integrity and things to consider on how to best introduce and control this technology in practice.
As teachers continue to look for ways to meet Indigenous content requirements, it makes sense they would turn to generative AI to assist them in an area they struggle with. But using these tools could do more harm than good.
Indigenous peoples’ concerns around AI
Indigenous people have raised a range of concerns around generative AI. These include the risks these technologies pose for Indigenous people and knowledges. 
For example, AI-generated art is causing a significant threat to Indigenous peoples’ incomes, art and cultural knowledges.
The lead image of this article was created using the generative AI platform Midjourney. The prompts included the terms Indigenous, artwork, colourful, artificial intelligence, Aboriginal, Western Sydney and painting styles. 
This shows that with AI, anyone can easily produce “Indigenous-style” art and content. This poses a threat to Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights. 
With AI being trained on vast data sets primarily from the western corpus of knowledge, there are also concerns relating to Indigenous data sovereignty – the right to “govern the collection, ownership and application of data about Indigenous communities, peoples, lands and resources”.
Generative AI can also perpetuate misinformation that harms Indigenous communities. This happened during the Voice referendum campaign, when fake, AI-generated images of Indigenous “no” voters were published on social media.

Importantly, there is also the potential impact to Country due to the environmental costs of data centres – an issue that must be addressed as more generative AI tools come online.

      The environmental cost of data centres is substantial, and making them energy-efficient will only solve half the problem




How do these concerns translate into the classroom?
All students should see themselves reflected in the classroom. This especially applies to Indigenous students, as attested by Closing the Gap targets for educational attainment.
A 2022 report by the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership states:

The legacy of colonisation has undermined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students’ access to their cultures, identities, histories and languages. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students have not had access to a complete, relevant and responsive education.

Children need both “windows and mirrors” in the classroom. American education scholar Rudine Sims-Bishop has aptly put this in the context of children’s literature:  

When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part.

Students need to see themselves reflected in the curriculum, including the technologies used.
By using generative AI, teachers risk perpetrating and promoting inaccuracies and spreading false information instead of meaningfully engaging with Indigenous values and knowledge systems.
This can potentially harm the student–teacher relationship, which is incredibly important, particularly for Indigenous students.
Late last year, the Australian government released a framework for generative AI in schools. It offers “guidance on understanding, using and responding to generative AI” to everyone involved in Australian school education.  
The framework also affirms the necessity of respecting Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights. But we need more extensive work to ensure teachers can do this appropriately. Currently, there is a lack of research that looks at the intersection between generative AI and Indigenous content inclusion in the classroom. 

Indigenous futures and AI
Generative AI, and other forms of AI, have extensive potential to benefit Indigenous people and their communities. Many Indigenous people are engaging with the technologies to this effect.
For example, you can take a virtual trip to the Torres Strait Islands, spend time at the AI Marae in New Zealand or engage with the Indigenous Protocols and AI Laboratory 
But to make room for what is seemingly an inevitable future that involves AI, work needs to be done in policy and professional bodies to ensure Indigenous inclusion at all levels – from development to use. 
Teachers and students must be supported with the necessary resourcing to promote critical thinking when engaging with generative AI. Teachers will look to the relevant government bodies, whereas students will look to their teachers for guidance.
It is clear we need further guidance on Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, and culturally appropriate AI use for educators.  
Generative AI still has much to learn, and Indigenous knowledges have much to teach it.

Ever since ChatGPT became the fastest-growing new tech platform in Internet history, I’ve been expecting artificial intelligence (AI) tools built using large language models (LLMs) to start to transform how political campaigns work. Well, that moment is here.

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGEMuch of the early attention on AI and campaigns has centered on how synthetic media, also known as “deep fakes,” will increase the supply of disinformation, further weakening democracies and potentially upending elections. Just last week, voters in New Hampshire reported receiving a robocall from a voice sounding like Joe Biden, urging people to not vote in the primary.
To the degree that legislators have started to focus on the impact of AI on politics, they’ve responded by trying to make campaigns disclose when they use synthetic media in political advertising. So far, the main response from tech companies is to add digital watermarks to political ads made with AI, to make them easier to spot. Such moves will only affect how official campaign committees operate; they don’t do anything about this new wave of anonymous dirty tricks.
But while videos with realistic replicas of Presidents Biden, Trump, and Obama have circulated widely, showing how easy it has suddenly become to put words into their mouths or pose them in compromising positions, this is just the froth at the top of a much bigger wave. AI is on the verge of changing the practice of campaigning itself.
I got a full blast of what’s coming not long ago, when I got a preview of VotivateAI, an impressive new tool that is emerging out of a joint venture between Votivate, LLC (a spinoff of the Working Families Party’s tech division) and a Louisiana-based AI start-up launched by a former ACORN organizer. By itself, Votivate is an alternative to VAN, the constituent-relationship-management software package that is ubiquitous on both the hard and soft side of liberal/progressive political engagement. The WFP initially built Votivate because in some states the Democratic Party would only give incumbents access to VAN.
VotivateAI is an attempt to leap-frog over existing campaign tools into the future. Three of its offerings stand out. The first, Campaign Assistant, may both appeal to and threaten professional campaign managers. Essentially, if you tell it some basic information about the race you’re involved in, including whether it’s a competitive race or a below-the-radar contest, how much has been raised, and so on, the tool will produce an in-depth campaign strategy memo, which it will continue to update as news develops and variables change.


Current Issue






July 2024 Issue



Will campaign managers use it? Based on a beta sample that I saw, they should at least try it. That’s because campaign professionals can benefit from more opinions than their own and maybe getting the advice of an AI coach can only help. This isn’t the only example of progressives experimenting with training LLMs to do political coaching—New/Mode is also in the process of developing an AI Campaign Strategist for social good and advocacy campaigns.
Votivate AI’s second offering is a low-latency AI voice-calling tool that doesn’t need a precise script, but rather can work from an overview of the campaign to have a natural-seeming conversation. It’s an AI campaign volunteer; unlike a human, it can make thousands of calls without needing a break, or pizza. I listened to a three-minute recording provided by Nic Zateslo, Votivate’s chief operating officer, and the speed and intonation of the AI agent’s banter was quite impressive. It was far more versatile and human-sounding than the ethereal “Ashley” voice that Civox, a London-based start-up, has created for Shamaine Daniels’s congressional campaign in Pennsylvania.
Arguably, the availability of AI campaign volunteer callers could help level the campaign playing field for underdog candidates like Daniels, who says she’s excited about Ashley’s potential to help her reach more voters, understand them better, and connect in more languages (the bot speaks more than 20). “This is going to scale fast,” Ilya Mouzykantskii, the London-based CEO of Civox, told Reuters back in mid-December. “We intend to be making tens of thousands of calls a day by the end of the year and into the six digits pretty soon. This is coming for the 2024 election and it’s coming in a very big way.”
Do we want AI campaign volunteers taking over for human phone-bankers? Compared to auto-dialers, which deliver prerecorded messages, AI callers are far more versatile. And unlike human volunteers, an AI caller can be trusted to stay on message (assuming the tool doesn’t “hallucinate” and the recipient of the call doesn’t try to bait it into silliness). But if campaigns start using AI this way, voters may recoil, worsening a problem we already have thanks to all the unwanted e-mails, texts, and calls they already get. Will campaigns use AI callers to free up human volunteers for more labor-intensive tasks like door-knocking? Or will they make less of an effort to get volunteers in the first place, since they won’t need them as much? A rich candidate with no actual base could buy an army of these things.

There’s an even more troubling question, which also arises around VotivateAI’s third offering: using AI to automatically create high-quality individualized media aimed at moving voters to action. If campaigns now gain the ability to create unique video messages for specific people and to do so quickly, cheaply and at scale, the potential for abuse is enormous. While campaigns may justify this approach since it can help them win elections—and who doesn’t want to find the best way to successfully reach a voter?—hyper-personalized campaign messaging will give politicians who already like to pander to voters the ability to sneakily be all things to all people.
The team at Votivate say they are committed to make sure their tools are only used by progressive candidates and to fight against fascism, to their credit. The founders of Civox also say they intend to mainly work with Democratic campaigns and candidates. (Unspoken are all the opportunities to make money selling these services to businesses.) Unfortunately, one of the most important lessons of the last decade also applies here. Bad actors, including foreign adversaries, will also use these tools.
This means the political waters we swim in are only going to be more polluted. Voters are going to need to be vigilant and, hopefully, more people will share what they are seeing in their inboxes and hearing on their phone lines, which could make it harder for personalized campaigning to tip over into blatant pandering and manipulation. But there’s no simple solution to the use of AI to power campaigns; the future is arriving, and we all had better watch out.

The data input for a Generative AI can be a specific dataset or instructions provided to it by the user or it can be any public access information directly taken from the vast repository of the World Wide Web.

Sources revealed that in January 2024 a report was made on&nbsp; a survey of 300 leaders, from six entertainment industries, including c-suite executives, senior executives and mid-level managers, between November 17, 2023 and December 22, 2023. The firm is expected to have found that 75% of survey respondents indicated Gen AI tools, software and models had supported the elimination, reduction or consolidation of jobs in their business division. It is believed that about 55% of leaders expect sound designers can be affected in the next three years. Over 40% see music editors, audio technicians and sound engineers as vulnerable, with around 33% anticipating impacts on songwriters, composers and studio engineers.

<div id=""p1"">
<div></div>
<div>A new report by Consulting firm CVL Economics has revealed that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) will lead to the loss of more jobs in the films and animation industry than other industries.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The report is based on a survey of 300 leaders from six entertainment industries, including C-Suite executives, senior executives, and mid-level managers late in 2023.</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to the report titled <em>“<a href=""https://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Future-Unscripted-The-Impact-of-Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Entertainment-Industry-Jobs-pages-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FUTURE UNSCRIPTED: The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Entertainment Industry </a><a href=""https://animationguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Future-Unscripted-The-Impact-of-Generative-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Entertainment-Industry-Jobs-pages-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Jobs</a>”,</em> 55% of business leaders surveyed foresee Sound Designers facing the greatest degree of displacement over the next three years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It added that a little over 40% of respondents considered Music Editors, Audio Technicians, and Sound Engineers vulnerable, and roughly 33% expect Songwriters, Composers, and Studio Engineers to experience similar impacts over the next three years.</div>
<ul>
 	<li>
<div><i>“Almost half (47%) of business leaders felt that over the next three years, GenAI will be </i><i>effective in generating 3D assets as well as realistic sound design for film, television, and </i><i>video games.
</i></div></li>
 	<li>
<div><i>“Another 44% believed GenAI would be able to generate realistic and convincing foreign </i><i>language dubbing for film or television dialogue, and 39% believed GenAI would be </i><i>generating music mixes and masters by 2026,” </i>the report stated.</div></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Job cuts in the entertainment industry
</b></h4>
<div>At a time when several entertainment industries are facing challenges, the report noted that the desire to increase productivity, cut costs, and identify new revenue streams will be top of mind.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Already, companies like Riot Games, Unity Software, Amazon MGM Studios, Pixar, and Universal Music Group have announced layoffs within the first few weeks of 2024.</div>
<div></div>
<div>CVL Economics said further job cuts are expected in the months ahead.</div>
<ul>
 	<li>
<div><i>“The introduction of GenAI potentially signifies a large-scale transition from existing </i><i>techniques into new processes, which will likely rebalance the demand for labour and capital </i><i>across the entertainment industries. In doing so, creative workers will be facing an era of </i><i>disruption, defined by the consolidation of some job roles, the replacement of existing job </i><i>roles with new ones, and the elimination of many jobs entirely,” </i>the company added.</div></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>What you should know</b></h4>
<div>Before now, several other reports have established the fact that the entertainment industry will be one of the most impacted by AI.</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to Indeed’s report, Software Development, Media &amp; Communications, and Arts &amp; Entertainment are among the top 20 sectors economy-wide facing exposure to GenAI.</div>
<div></div>
<div>OpenAI’s analysis addresses industry exposure to language model-based AI technologies specifically. It includes Publishing, Broadcasting, Motion Picture and Sound Recording, and Performing Arts among their top 25, underscoring the broad impact GenAI will have across the entertainment sector.</div>
<div></div>
<div>LinkedIn’s research offers a more nuanced view by differentiating between augmentation and disruption. The Technology, Information, and Media sector — which encompasses the Software and Entertainment industries — ranks highest in total GenAI exposure, suggesting that GenAI is likely to play a significant role both in assisting and potentially displacing traditional roles.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Entertainment Providers also appear on the list, with a sizable percentage of the industry experiencing both augmentation and disruption.</div>
