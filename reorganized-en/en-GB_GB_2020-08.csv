By Social EuropePublisher: Social Europe (in cooperation with Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung and Weizenbaum Institut)Published: 1st August 2020Free PDF DownloadDossier Description
Artificial Intelligence is permeating a wide range of areas and it is bound to transform work and society. This dossier, published in cooperation with our partner Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and Weizenbaum Institute, addresses possibilities and challenges of AI. Above all, it asks what needs to be done politically in order to shape this transformation for the sake of the common good.
AI has conjured up a dystopia of robots displacing human workers from employment. Some have predicted very large-scale job substitution but others question whether such a predetermined outcome can be envisaged: whether jobs are lost and how they are changed depends on whether workers are involved in the decisions that are made. Similar concerns apply to issues of recruitment and monitoring of workers: will AI data serve a ‘surveillance capitalism’ or could it assist workers in the performance of their jobs if they have more power to influence the outcome?
AI raises wider questions about the society in which we live and that of the future. Market-research institutes foresee huge efficiency gains, but are these credible and, if so, how will such gains be distributed? Feminists and anti-racists have expressed concern that the algorithms on which AI depends unconsciously embed the social prejudices of their human authors. Issues of privacy and civil liberty surround the possession and control of the data mined by AI. How education must change so that citizens can feel empowered rather than alienated by AI is also at stake—as is the ever-present issue of where AI fits in meeting the existential challenge of climate change and biodiversity loss.

3 Important Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Your Business And Turbocharge Success Adobe Stock

But before you can develop a robust AI strategy – in which you work out how best to use AI to drive business success – you first need to understand what’s possible with AI. To put it another way, how are other companies using AI to drive success?

Broadly speaking, organizations are using AI in three main ways:

·        Creating more intelligent products

PROMOTED
·        Offering a more intelligent service
·        Improving internal business processes
Let’s briefly look at each area in turn.
Creating more intelligent products

Thanks to the Internet of Things, a whole host of everyday products are getting smarter. What started with smartphones has now grown to include smart TVs, smartwatches, smart speakers, and smart home thermostats – plus a range of more eyebrow-raising ""smart"" products such as smart nappies, smart yoga mats, smart office chairs, and smart toilets.

Generally, these smart products are designed to make customers’ lives easier and remove those annoying bugbears from everyday life. For example, you can now get digital insoles that slip into your running shoes and gather data (using pressure sensors) about your running style. An accompanying app will give you real-time analysis of your running performance and technique, thereby helping you avoid injuries and become a better runner.

Offering a more intelligent service
Instead of the traditional approach of selling a product or service as a one-off transaction, more and more businesses are transitioning to a servitization model, in which the product or service is delivered as an ongoing subscription. Netflix is a prime example of this model in action. For a less obvious example, how about the Dollar Shave Club, which will deliver razor blades and grooming products to your door on a regular basis. Or Stich Fix, a personalized styling service that delivers clothes to your door based on your personal style, size, and budget.
Intelligent services like this are reliant on data and AI. Businesses like Netflix have access to a wealth of valuable customer data – data that helps the company provide a more thoughtful service, based on what it knows the customer really wants (whether it’s movies, clothes, grooming products or whatever).
Improving internal business processes
In theory, AI could be worked into pretty much any aspect of a business: manufacturing, HR, marketing, sales, supply chain and logistics, customer services, quality control, IT, finance and more.
From automated machinery and vehicles to customer service chatbots and algorithms that detect customer fraud, AI solutions and technologies are being incorporated into all sorts of business functions in order to maximize efficiency, save money and improve business performance.
So, which area should you focus on – products, services, or business processes?
Every business is different, and how you decide to use AI may differ wildly from even your closest competitor. For AI to truly add value in your business, it must be aligned with your company’s key strategic goals – which means you need to be clear on what it is you're trying to achieve before you can identify how AI can help you get there.
That said, it’s well worth considering all three areas: products, services and business processes. Sure, one of the areas is likely to be more of a priority than the others, and that priority will depend on your company’s strategic goals. But you shouldn’t ignore the potential of the other AI uses.
For example, a product-based business might be tempted to skip over the potential for intelligent services, while a service-based company could easily think smart products aren’t relevant to its business model. Both might think AI-driven business processes are beyond their capabilities at this point in time.
But the most successful, most talked-about companies on the planet are those that deploy AI across all three areas. Take Apple as an example. Apple built its reputation on making and selling iconic products like the iPad. Yet, nowadays, Apple services (including Apple Music and Apple TV) generate more revenue than iPad sales. The company has transitioned from purely a product company to a service provider, with its iconic products supporting intelligent services. And you can be certain that Apple uses AI and data to enhance its internal processes.
In this way, AI can throw up surprising additions and improvements to your business model – or even lead you to an entirely new business model that you never previously considered. It can lead you from products to services, or vice versa. And it can throw up exciting opportunities to enhance the way you operate.
That’s why I recommend looking at products, services, and business processes when working out your AI priorities. You may ultimately decide that optimizing your internal processes (for example, automating your manufacturing) is several years away, and that’s fine. The important thing is to consider all the AI opportunities, so that you can properly prioritize what you want to achieve and develop an AI strategy that works for your business.

AI is going to impact businesses of all shapes and sizes, across all industries. Discover how to prepare your organization for an AI-driven world in my new book, The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

Ensuring artificial intelligence is humane and regulated

August 5, 2020 



 




© Peshkova | 
Alejandro Saucedo, Member of the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group Reserve List on AI and Engineering Director at Seldon, argues that to ensure artificial intelligence is humane, it must be regulated
Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to bring about both transformational change and cost savings in virtually every sector. In fact, the improvements in productivity and innovation unlocked by AI are currently unleashing a “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, which PwC estimates will contribute over $15.7 trillion to the global economy and add at least 9.9% to Northern Europe’s GDP by 2030.
However, if our society doesn’t implement this technology properly, AI threatens to unleash a plethora of social injustices. The EU doesn’t currently have specific standards or legislative instruments to regulate the development and implementation of AI so as to help prevent it from being a source of injustice. In the coming years, I believe we need to see legislation — similar in scope to GDPR — come into play in this field.
The risks of AI
Despite the massive potential upsides, there are reasonable and legitimate fears regarding the widespread adoption of AI. The use of AI by bad faith actors raises a host of risks for personal and organisational cybersecurity, and AI’s use in predicting individual decisions raises a swathe of privacy concerns. We also know that the job displacement AI will bring to some industries may threaten livelihoods, let alone the less discussed mental health challenges that AI will bring.
More insidiously, improper practices with AI can lead to it perpetuating undesirable biases in society. The data that AI systems are “trained” with by data scientists and developers have a direct effect on the findings and decisions they output, meaning that feeding an AI model biased data can lead to it making socially unjust decisions. For example, many predictive policing AIs across the U.S. have been “trained” with falsified data that biases their decision-making against ethnic minorities. This is highly problematic and highlights the importance of training AI models with carefully-assessed and representative data.
Further, there is the risk that individuals and organisations can delegate decision-making entirely to AI systems, which reduces accountability and increases ambiguity. This is dangerous, as decisions made by AI models can influence major decisions, such as if a person receives a loan, gets hired for a job, or comes under suspicion by law enforcement.
To illustrate this problem, consider the case of a person who is wrongfully arrested on the basis of an AI model’s conclusions – who is responsible? Is it the individual policeman who acted on the AI’s predictions, or the whole department for not having a human-in-the-loop structure to vet their AI properly, or the compliance officer who signed the model off, or the developer who first deployed the AI model? This all shows that if improperly handled, the complexity of AI opens up a bureaucratic nightmare that’s rigged against those who may seek restitution or justice.
AI experts have the tools to tackle the risks
Regardless of how well we can automate processes with AI capabilities, any accountable structure will ultimately require humans at its core. Based on this, developers, data scientists and AI specialists have a professional responsibility throughout the development, deployment and operation of AI systems. Whether it is about mitigating undesired biases, ensuring AI processes remain accountable, or guaranteeing privacy by design in machine learning systems, there’s much that those who develop and operate AI models can do.
For mitigating bias, we can be more rigorous with our training data, ensuring that it’s properly representative of the real world by leveraging data science best practices together with domain knowledge, thus reducing the risk of our models making unjust and discriminatory decisions. We can also bring in subject experts in the areas we’re applying models in, ensuring that they subject the model to rigorous assessments of its decision-making abilities in their field throughout development.
In turn, we can also take steps to make models more interpretable. We can spend more time and resources, leveraging explainability tools and processes to introduce explainability into models and AI systems, so they are more understandable to laypeople. This way, the teams using the models know exactly why they’re making a decision and can decide whether the logic is valid. We can introduce humans into helping AIs make their decisions, so there’s always a human agent who shoulders responsibility if something goes wrong.
To make AI humane, regulation is essential
However, for the above to be implemented, we cannot realistically expect data scientists and developers to do it alone. Complex ethical decisions that impact people’s lives cannot just rest on the shoulders of a single developer or data scientist. Companies often tend towards short-run profitability over decisions that would benefit society in the long-run, and making AI humane means putting additional time and resources into an activity that doesn’t immediately generate revenue.
That’s why we need a regulatory environment for AI, and both policymakers and developers need to be proactive and engage in interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure it can be efficiently created. If done well, good regulation that compels organisations to adopt these best practices for AI development and deployment can be a catalyst for innovation, since the additional confidence and stability in the industry will encourage investment and new roles across the field.

Under favorable conditions, however, Russia is quite capable of becoming a serious player and even a local leader in certain areas.",,,,,"Russia’s leaders have been paying close attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for several years now. President Vladimir Putin has said on numerous occasions that the leader in the field of AI would become “the master of the world.” Until recently, however, Russia remained virtually the only large country without its own AI development strategy.
That changed in October 2019, when the country adopted a long-discussed National Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence Through 2030. One of the driving forces behind the strategy was Sberbank president German Gref. The state-owned bank has also developed a road map for developing AI in Russia and coordinated the creation of Russia’s AI development strategy, which is largely corporate, involving the internet giants Yandex and Mail.ru Group, along with Gazprom Neft energy company.
The same companies, along with MTS and the Russian Direct Investment Fund that joined later, have formed a structure known as the AI Russia Alliance, which is tasked with promoting Russia’s AI-based technologies. The alliance was established on November 9, 2019, at the AI Journey conference attended by Putin. The new entity is supposed to lobby for simpler procedures for introducing AI technologies, as well as the participation of business in two areas: developing driverless transportation, and legislation relating to industrial and personal data.
The alliance is expected to coordinate the efforts of the business and scientific communities to attain the objectives set forth in the national AI strategy. It can be concluded, therefore, that the driving force developing Russian AI technologies in the near future will be commercial—and that it will be large IT companies rather than start-ups.
The Russian government finances industry-specific projects—quite generously by Russian standards—which testifies to the high priority assigned to this field. The application of AI in the military industry, in which Russia’s position is traditionally strong, is the subject of particular attention.
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Russia will become a leader in the development of AI as set forth in the national strategy because of its current lag behind the leading technological powers, as well as some other factors, such as a small venture capital investment market. The successful development of specific areas of AI is more likely, and Russia may be capable of becoming a local leader in those fields.
On the international arena, Russia opposes banning lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) and the military use of AI, but it does engage in dialogue with other states and actors and supports formulating clear universal rules and ethical norms.
Russia’s Priorities
The national strategy stresses two defining time markers for the development of AI in Russia: 2024, by which time Russia is expected to have significantly improved its positions in this field, and 2030, when it should have eliminated its lag behind developed countries and attained global leadership roles in certain AI-related areas. According to the document, Russia’s key AI development priorities include increasing the number of entities involved in technological innovation by 50 percent, and creating а high-performance export-oriented sector equipped with modern technologies in key industries, primarily in manufacturing and agriculture.
The strategy focuses heavily on support for both state and privately sponsored scientific research. Citations of Russian scientific publications in the field of AI, as well as the number of patents and applied technological solutions registered and developed by Russian scientists, are expected to increase significantly by 2024. The government is also working to overhaul existing legal norms to simplify the development and implementation of AI-based technologies (for instance, driverless transportation). The document stresses the need for Russia’s international cooperation on issues of AI-based product standardization and certification.
Another of the strategy’s focus areas is the importance of preparing AI specialists. Apart from recruiting foreign specialists, the document proposes introducing AI-related educational modules at all educational levels, as well as creating respective job development and professional retraining programs. Special emphasis is placed on math and science education and its integration with humanities. According to the strategy, the number of Russian AI specialists is to grow significantly by 2024, and Russian universities are to acquire world-class educational programs that will make it possible to make up for personnel shortages.
The Russian strategy also emphasizes domestic AI-based software development, the creation of AI open-source libraries, better data access and quality, and improved hardware for AI projects.
As for military objectives, the document identifies them purely in terms of “guaranteeing national security.” But the overall strategy clearly favors commercial AI use.
Current Assessments
Unlike China and the United States, Russia isn’t a global leader in AI technologies. Although the strategy states that “the Russian Federation possesses significant potential to become one of the international leaders in the development and use of artificial intelligence technologies,” it’s unlikely the country will be able to achieve this goal in the short and medium term. Nevertheless, certain areas of AI development and application do exist; Russia enjoys strong positions there and can succeed in the future. Russia’s ranking in the AI technology race is hard to establish, since current international ratings use different methodologies. Many of them don’t list Russia at all, which is unsurprising, since the country lacked an official AI development strategy until November 2019.
In terms of individual AI-related technology indicators, Russia has only three supercomputers ranked among the 500 most powerful computers in the world, for example, while China has 228, the United States has 117, and Japan has 29. 
At the same time, Russia is doing quite well in terms of computer science education, which includes machine learning. Sixteen Russian universities that offer this major made it onto the list of the world’s 684 best educational institutions, according to the 2019 World University Rankings. However, only two Russian universities—Moscow State University and St. Petersburg’s ITMO (Information Technologies, Mechanics, and Optics)—were in the top one hundred.
The number of AI start-ups in a given country is also a key indicator of its progress in this field. According to TRAXCN statistics, Russia currently has 168 AI start-ups, compared with 6,903 in the United States and 1,013 in China. These estimates appear to be somewhat exaggerated, since the list includes twenty- and thirty-year-old “start-ups,” but still, they make it possible to assess the bigger picture of the state of venture capital investment markets with respect to AI. In part, the small number of Russian AI start-ups can be explained by the domination of established companies in this sphere. This is what distinguishes Russia from most other developed technological powers. According to Russia’s proposed Artificial Intelligence road map, the country has a total of 400 companies working on developing AI. 
Military Applications
International ratings obviously don’t include military programs, yet military science and the defense industry have been locomotives for the development of Russian technology for many years. It’s difficult to assess the extent to which AI is used in the military sector due to the classified nature of such projects. Nevertheless, public pronouncements by Russian government officials make it possible to draw certain conclusions. Defense Ministry representatives and other government officials have said repeatedly that the Russian Armed Forces boast a full lineup of AI-based weapons, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, fighter jets, and underwater robots.
In his address to the Federal Assembly on March 1, 2018, Putin stated that Russia had developed an unmanned deep-sea vehicle that is capable of global-range travel and can carry nuclear weapons. These autonomous vehicles, dubbed Poseidon, are slated to join the Russian naval arsenal by 2027.
That same month, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu urged military personnel and civilian scientists to combine their efforts in working on AI technologies “whose development is necessary to parry possible threats to Russia’s technological and economic security.” Shoigu was speaking at the first “Artificial Intelligence: Problems and Prospective Solutions” conference held at the Defense Ministry. It’s difficult to estimate Russian investments in the military applications of AI, but it is possible to list some structures affiliated with the Defense Ministry that are working on these issues.
The state-owned Rostec corporation has acknowledged that a number of its subsidiaries—the Kalashnikov and Tecmash concerns, High Precision Systems holding, and TsNIITochMash company—were working on developing AI-related weapons. Tecmash, for example, has been incorporating AI into the volley fire systems it produces for several years now. In a December 2019 speech at the Defense Ministry board meeting, Putin said: “Robotic systems and unmanned aerial vehicles are being rigorously introduced and used in combat training, which dramatically boosts the capabilities of armed units and subunits.”
New models of weapons and equipment are being actively tested in Syria. Back in 2016, the Russian Defense Ministry alluded to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor the ceasefire there. During the next few years, both serial UAV models such as Orlan-10 and Forpost and test models like the Orion medium-altitude long-endurance UAV—potentially capable of carrying weapons—took to Syria’s skies. Autonomous aerial vehicles are one of the most promising areas for the introduction of AI and its military use. The exact number of UAVs in the Russian army arsenal is unknown, but the head of the Russian General Staff’s office for UAV development, Major General Alexander Novikov, estimated it at more than 1,900 units in 2018, and their number has likely increased since that time. In August 2019, the Defense Ministry published a video of the maiden flight of the S-70 Okhotnik-B heavy combat UAV developed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. The Okhotnik (whose name translates as “hunter”) is likely capable of carrying weapons and striking both air and land targets.
In April 2020, the Defense Ministry announced a closed tender worth up to 387,751,000 rubles ($5.3 million) to complete a scientific project titled “Research on creating an experimental model of neural network development, training, and implementation for the new generation of artificial intelligence military systems” (code name “Kashtan”). In addition, the Era military innovation technopolis is due to be completed in the southern city of Anapa in the fourth quarter of 2020. It will specialize in robotics, AI, information security, and supercomputers.
The military sector is, therefore, one of the strongest in terms of developing Russian AI technologies. Roger McDermott of the Jamestown Foundation believes that in terms of decisionmaking speed, the new AI-based Russian combat control information systems that were showcased during the Tsentr 2019 strategic exercise give the Russian military a strategic advantage over NATO armed forces. 
Support Instruments
According to the proposed AI road map prepared by Sberbank under a government contract, Russia is planning to spend 244 billion rubles on the development of AI through 2024. Sberbank itself is planning to invest almost half of that: 112 billion rubles, while another 91 billion rubles will come from the federal budget. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) also wants to take part in the venture.
There is also a proposal to create a new 120 billion ruble AI federal project as part of the Digital Economy national program (the road map was also completed under this program, albeit under the Digital Technologies project). The artificial intelligence project was also developed by Sberbank and is supposed to be overseen by the Economic Development Ministry. In other words, there is some confusion now over instruments of AI development in Russia. 
In November 2019, the RDIF reported that it had raised $2 billion in domestic and international investments in Russian companies that use AI. The RDIF will also undertake to bring these companies to international markets. According to some media publications, the fund will invest some of its money in creating an Artificial Intelligence Institute at Moscow State University. 
Such investment volumes are unique for Russian science. But how significant are they on a global scale? It is certainly far less than the leaders of the tech race spend on AI. China annually invests tens of billions of dollars in AI, including at a regional level. Beijing alone is planning to invest $2.1 billion in an AI industrial park, while Tianjin is considering the creation of a $16 billion AI development fund. In turn, the U.S. government allocated $4.9 billion for AI research in 2020. Venture investors have contributed even more, investing over $8 billion in AI start-ups in 2018 alone.
Nevertheless, the Russian road map budget is quite comparable to what other technologically advanced countries spend on AI development. The UK, for example, revealed plans in 2018 to invest 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in AI development, and Germany is to invest 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) through 2025. It is assumed that private investors will contribute similar amounts.
The Russian government and Russian technology giants are making significant efforts to bridge the gap between Russia and leading countries when it comes to AI development. In February 2020, Putin endorsed the idea of creating a network of supercomputers and second-tier computing centers in large cities throughout the country.
Russia has already managed to make significant progress in this area. At the end of 2018, the first energy-efficient petaflop Zhores supercomputer was launched at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech). It’s specifically designed to solve machine learning and data-driven modeling problems. In the near future, its capacity is expected to increase to 2–3 petaflop per second, putting it in the same league as the top 500 supercomputers in the world. A year later, Sberbank launched its Christofari supercomputer. Specially designed to work with AI algorithms, the Christofari has an effective performance of about 6.7 petaflops per second, making it the most powerful in Russia and the twenty-ninth most powerful in the world at the time of its launch.
Sberbank and RDIF also intend to invest significant funds in the development of Russian software. In addition, there are state plans to develop a grant system, introduce new educational programs in the field of AI, and include AI training courses in the school curriculum. As a result, the number of Russian publications at top-level AI conferences is expected to increase from 30 in 2018 to 500 in 2030, while the number of AI specialists trained by higher and continuing education programs is expected to grow from 650 to 6,000 over the same period.
Russian businesses are willing to put AI technology into practice, giving Russia a competitive advantage. Microsoft has named Russia the world leader in the active implementation of AI in business. According to its research, 30 percent of Russian companies actively implement AI: the highest number among all countries studied, compared with an average of 22.3 percent.
Russian companies are also actively involved in the development of AI technology. They are, for example, at the forefront of developing driverless vehicles. Although Russia’s position in the Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index is still fairly weak (it was ranked 22 out of 25 in 2019), Russia has been actively developing this field with the help of a number of companies and organizations including the internet giant Yandex, KAMAZ truck maker, StarLine unmanned vehicle developer, the Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute (NAMI), and the Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University (MADI).
Driverless cars have been tested on the roads of Moscow and the Russian republic of Tatarstan since 2019, and in March 2020 the experiment was expanded to eleven more regions. A bill on the use of autonomous vehicles on public roads was introduced to the State Duma in late February 2020. In addition, in March of this year, the Non-Commercial Partnership for Development and Use of Navigation Technologies (NP GLONASS), which includes Yandex, Rostelecom, MTS, and other companies, sent letters to the foreign, transportation, and justice ministries requesting the suspension of certain provisions of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic that impede the introduction of driverless vehicles. The complete legalization of autonomous vehicles will be a major boost to the development of Russia’s driverless transportation industry.
Russian AI technologies have, therefore, been developing at an accelerated pace, largely due to the greater attention that the Russian government and major tech corporations now pay to this sector. Although state investments and grants can’t adequately replace venture investments, Russia does have an opportunity to significantly improve its positions in the AI race.
International Cooperation 
Russia believes it would be premature to discuss limitations on the military use of AI at an international level, citing the lack of commonly accepted terminology and the absence of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) as reasons for its position. In part, this is because Russia views itself as one of the leaders in developing AI and robotics. Many countries that have embarked on successful LAWS projects—the United States, Israel, the UK, and others—hold similar positions.
Today, the main forum regulating AI is the UN. Since 2017, a specially created group of government experts (GGE) has been discussing LAWS issues in the context of the Inhumane Weapons Convention. In the past, similar discussion formats have led to the banning of cluster bombs, napalm, blinding laser weapons, and anti-personnel mines. Russia is represented in the GGE by officials from the foreign, defense, and economic development ministries.
Thirty countries currently insist on restrictions on the development and use of LAWS. Russia’s official position is that “work on definition and basic functions should mainly be guided by the ultimate goal of LAWS discussion—i.e., explore possibilities to use this weapon type in a most adequate manner in future and maintain a due level of human control over it. At the same time, specific forms and methods of such control should remain at the discretion of states.” Russian officials underscore that the work of the GGE should not “upset the balance between humanitarian concerns and the interests of defense security of the participating states.” 
Another international platform for discussing AI problematics is UNESCO, which has had an ad hoc expert group working since March 2020 on formulating global standards and recommendations on AI ethics. Russia is represented in the group by Professor Maxim Fedorov, director of the Center for Computational and Data-Intensive Science and Engineering at Skoltech. The group plans to meet through August 2020, by which time it is expected to have come up with internationally applicable recommendations on formulating ethical principles for AI development and use.
The Committee on AI under the Commission of the Russian Federation for UNESCO is called upon to consolidate the Russian position on this issue. That committee is chaired by Alexander Kuleshov, the head of Skoltech and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Its first session featured a discussion on differences in global understanding of AI ethics, at which Fedorov said: “We need to move from polarity to international cooperation.”
On the whole, Russia seems to be supportive of developing international cooperation in the field of AI and formulating universal and legal norms in this sphere. As for Russia’s position on the possible LAWS ban, it proceeds from efforts to lobby the interests of the domestic defense industry, and is in line with the behavior of most countries that produce unmanned vehicles.
As of today, Russia cannot be described as a leader in the AI race. Even if AI development becomes Russia’s highest priority, Moscow essentially has no chance of catching up with Washington and Beijing in this field. Nevertheless, smart investing and capitalizing on the country’s competitive advantages, such as highly skilled computer specialists and large domestic IT companies, could deliver results in the medium and long term. Russian positions have been traditionally strong in the military sector, but the successful development of other AI-related sectors is also possible. Under favorable conditions, Russia is quite capable of becoming a serious player and even a local leader in certain areas.

The problems that we are solving today touch critical aspects of our customer’s life, helping how they manage their finances and plan for the future. For instance, our algorithms help identify recurring expenses and can estimate income to help our customers optimally plan their budget and maximize their savings.
  In your 10 years working in AI and data science, what has surprised you about the evolution of these fields?
 I’ve been surprised by the speed of innovation and adoption. In the past decade, AI has been applied to a wide variety of industries and now touches almost everyone’s life through chatbots, voice-based devices, smartphones, cameras, just to name a few examples. There are huge opportunities to innovate with AI and algorithmic engineering to help our digital banking customers even more in the future.
  In your view, what is the next frontier for AI and data science overall, and specifically within financial services and personal financial management?
 AI has the potential to unlock innovation, increase efficiency, accelerate digital transformation and improve the customer experience. While the technology is mature enough and has made a huge impact already, I believe the ongoing R&D in areas such as Explainable AI, Responsible AI and AI model productionizing will unlock numerous layers of adoption especially in regulated industries like financial services.
 Responsible AI focuses on ensuring the ethical and accountable use of AI and helps form new regulations and monitoring that is consistent with the values and expectations of the modern world, with fair consideration towards speed of innovation and positive impact. On the other hand, the research on Explainable AI aims to make the AI models more transparent, making it more clear on how the model came up with a certain outcome. This can help firms adhere to the regulatory guidelines. Lastly, reliable productionizing of AI models makes it easier to maintain the lifecycle of model deployment. In combination, these areas will be the next frontiers for AI.

The idea that the photos we share are being collected by companies to train algorithms that are sold commercially is worrying. Anyone can buy these tools, snap a photo of a stranger, and find out who they are in seconds. But researchers have come up with a clever way to help combat this problem.The solution is a tool named Fawkes, and was created by scientists at the University of Chicago’s Sand Lab. Named after the Guy Fawkes masks donned by revolutionaries in the V for Vendetta comic book and film, Fawkes uses artificial intelligence to subtly and almost imperceptibly alter your photos in order to trick facial recognition systems.running Fawkes on your photos is like adding an invisible mask to your selfiesThe way the software works is a little complex. Running your photos through Fawkes doesn’t make you invisible to facial recognition exactly. Instead, the software makes subtle changes to your photos so that any algorithm scanning those images in future sees you as a different person altogether. Essentially, running Fawkes on your photos is like adding an invisible mask to your selfies.Scientists call this process “cloaking” and it’s intended to corrupt the resource facial recognition systems need to function: databases of faces scraped from social media. Facial recognition firm Clearview AI, for example, claims to have collected some three billion images of faces from sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Venmo, which it uses to identify strangers. But if the photos you share online have been run through Fawkes, say the researchers, then the face the algorithms know won’t actually be your own.According to the team from the University of Chicago, Fawkes is 100 percent successful against state-of-the-art facial recognition services from Microsoft (Azure Face), Amazon (Rekognition), and Face++ by Chinese tech giant Megvii.“What we are doing is using the cloaked photo in essence like a Trojan Horse, to corrupt unauthorized models to learn the wrong thing about what makes you look like you and not someone else,” Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago who helped create the Fawkes software, told The Verge. “Once the corruption happens, you are continuously protected no matter where you go or are seen.”You’d hardly recognize her.

Image: The VergeThe group behind the work — Shawn Shan, Emily Wenger, Jiayun Zhang, Huiying Li, Haitao Zheng, and Ben Y. Zhao — published a paper on the algorithm earlier this year. But late last month they also released Fawkes as free software for Windows and Macs that anyone can download and use. To date they say it’s been downloaded more than 100,000 times.In our own tests we found that Fawkes is sparse in its design but easy enough to apply. It takes a couple of minutes to process each image, and the changes it makes are mostly imperceptible. Earlier this week, The New York Times published a story on Fawkes in which it noted that the cloaking effect was quite obvious, often making gendered changes to images like giving women mustaches. But the Fawkes team says the updated algorithm is much more subtle, and The Verge’s own tests agree with this.How much difference can a tool like Fawkes make?But is Fawkes a silver bullet for privacy? It’s doubtful. For a start, there’s the problem of adoption. If you read this article and decide to use Fawkes to cloak any photos you upload to social media in future, you’ll certainly be in the minority. Facial recognition is worrying because it’s a society-wide trend and so the solution needs to be society-wide, too. If only the tech-savvy shield their selfies, it just creates inequality and discrimination.Secondly, many firms that sell facial recognition algorithms created their databases of faces a long time ago, and you can’t retroactively take that information back. The CEO of Clearview, Hoan Ton-That, told the Times as much. “There are billions of unmodified photos on the internet, all on different domain names,” said Ton-That. “In practice, it’s almost certainly too late to perfect a technology like Fawkes and deploy it at scale.”Comparisons of uncloaked and cloaked faces using Fawkes. Image: SAND Lab, University of ChicagoNaturally, though, the team behind Fawkes disagree with this assessment. They note that although companies like Clearview claim to have billions of photos, that doesn’t mean much when you consider they’re supposed to identify hundreds of millions of users. “Chances are, for many people, Clearview only has a very small number of publicly accessible photos,” says Zhao. And if people release more cloaked photos in the future, he says, sooner or later the amount of cloaked images will outnumber the uncloaked ones.On the adoption front, however, the Fawkes team admits that for their software to make a real difference it has to be released more widely. They have no plans to make a web or mobile app due to security concerns, but are hopeful that companies like Facebook might integrate similar tech into their own platform in future. Integrating this tech would be in these companies’ interest, says Zhao. After all, firms like Facebook don’t want people to stop sharing photos, and these companies would still be able to collect the data they need from images (for features like photo tagging) before cloaking them on the public web. And while integrating this tech now might only have a small effect for current users, it could help convince future, privacy-conscious generations to sign up to these platforms. “Adoption by larger platforms, e.g. Facebook or others, could in time have a crippling effect on Clearview by basically making [their technology] so ineffective that it will no longer be useful or financially viable as a service,” says Zhao. “Clearview.ai going out of business because it’s no longer relevant or accurate is something that we would be satisfied [with] as an outcome of our work.”Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeTesla’s big, epic, confusing future | The Vergecast

Callaway used machine learning throughout the Mavrik line to introduce new design elements, some of which surprised even the veteran members of its 120-person R&amp;D team.\n\nCallaway’s AI efforts began with its Flash drivers, which relied on AI to determine the shape of its face. Driver faces typically employ a familiar shape which is thicker in the center and thins out around the edges. “The face thickness pattern that it first came out with looked nothing like what we designed,” says Alan Hocknell, Callaway’s senior vice president of research and development. “One of the thinnest areas was in the center. It had a pattern of ripples and ridges. It had thick areas directly adjacent to thin areas. It had things we really didn’t understand, but we could prove that it generated more ball speed.”\n\nComputers typically help club makers simulate thousands of ball strikes to analyze the consistency of its performance. Callaway, however, fed parameters into the AI and let it work to solve problems on its own. \n\nBy relying on AI simulations, the company can more effectively refine the groups of players it’s trying to help by adjusting the performance targets. That’s especially difficult to do with beginners. “The challenges of designing for the lower-ability golfers is that you have a higher degree of noise,” says Hocknell. “Shot-to-shot variation is a lot higher than with tour pros. The computer can help analyze that. It helps us capture what the challenges are that we need to address.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Flash Face on the Mavrik driver has a different shape than typical clubs.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAccording to Hocknell, the development process for a new set of clubs typically ranges between 12 and 16 months, which only provides enough time to create three or four prototypes. Once a club exists in the physical world outside of the simulation, the company uses a swing robot to evaluate its performance, but it also puts the club in the hands of real people. The AI can help analyze shots—even if there’s a lot of variation due to varying skill levels—and help guide the development in the right direction.\n\nCreating the clubs that AI designs isn’t always simple, however. Callaway says it has had to make some notable upgrades to its manufacturing process in order to bring the clubs off the screen and into the clubhouse. In order to manufacture the driver faces, for instance, it needed to revamp its forge. “We needed a new titanium alloy—one that we could fabricate this unusual thickness pattern,” says Hocknell. “There were only a couple machines in the world that could do that with the thin titanium grade we were using. We had to change the crystal structure in the titanium in such a way that it would be durable under the loads it was going to see.”\n\nThe measuring equipment needed a similar boost. “We developed a laser scanning system that puts millions of points of laser light onto the back of the face in order to measure in way greater detail than with a touch probe,” says Hocknell. “We went with a couple dozen points to millions.” Of course, the designs aren’t valuable if they can’t make it out onto the course.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHybrid clubs have replaced longer irons for some players, especially those who have trouble getting the ball in the air.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn order to handle all of the calculations, Callaway built its own supercomputer with around 1,000 cores on its campus. With the amount of operations they’re doing, Hocknell says it was more financially feasible than leasing time on a cloud-based system. “Things that used to take four to five weeks now take a couple days,” he says.\n\nAs time goes on, the size of Callaway’s data set about golf shots will only grow. It currently goes back 20 years and constantly pulls data from networked machines at Callaway fitting centers around the world. Eventually, AI can play a role in the actual fitting process. Right now, Callaway collects data about those shots for its own research, but down the road, a player could step into a fitting session and get real-time analysis of their game to help guide them toward the right clubs.\n\nCurrently, Callaway offers three different flavors of its AI-designed Mavrik clubs, including the standard version for average players, the Sub-Zero version for high-level and pro-grade players, and the Max edition, which places the emphasis on forgiving mishits over pure ball control and feel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe center of gravity has moved toward the face of the driver.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWhile that’s quite a few clubs to keep track of, Callaway says that each one has its own unique design. “Before, you’d typically pick an iron in the middle of the set and then use a spreadsheet to set the parameters for the rest of the clubs,” he explains. “That seems a little crude today.” Now, AI has refined the process to emphasize desirable traits for their specific use. Longer irons emphasize ball speed and trajectory to give more distance. Shorter irons aim to make launch trajectories and ball spin more consistent for hitting—and staying on—the green.\n\nCallaway will continue to feed data into its algorithm in hopes to figure out how it can further refine its clubs.

This is the first time Callaway has used AI to design a full range of clubs including irons. Callaway 






Artificial intelligence may regularly beat humans at games like chess and checkers, but it’s currently helping us out when it comes to golf. Callaway used machine learning throughout the Mavrik line to introduce new design elements, some of which surprised even the veteran members of its 120-person R&D team.
Callaway’s AI efforts began with its Flash drivers, which relied on AI to determine the shape of its face. Driver faces typically employ a familiar shape which is thicker in the center and thins out around the edges. “The face thickness pattern that it first came out with looked nothing like what we designed,” says Alan Hocknell, Callaway’s senior vice president of research and development. “One of the thinnest areas was in the center. It had a pattern of ripples and ridges. It had thick areas directly adjacent to thin areas. It had things we really didn’t understand, but we could prove that it generated more ball speed.”
Computers typically help club makers simulate thousands of ball strikes to analyze the consistency of its performance. Callaway, however, fed parameters into the AI and let it work to solve problems on its own. 
By relying on AI simulations, the company can more effectively refine the groups of players it’s trying to help by adjusting the performance targets. That’s especially difficult to do with beginners. “The challenges of designing for the lower-ability golfers is that you have a higher degree of noise,” says Hocknell. “Shot-to-shot variation is a lot higher than with tour pros. The computer can help analyze that. It helps us capture what the challenges are that we need to address.”

The Flash Face on the Mavrik driver has a different shape than typical clubs. Callaway 

According to Hocknell, the development process for a new set of clubs typically ranges between 12 and 16 months, which only provides enough time to create three or four prototypes. Once a club exists in the physical world outside of the simulation, the company uses a swing robot to evaluate its performance, but it also puts the club in the hands of real people. The AI can help analyze shots—even if there’s a lot of variation due to varying skill levels—and help guide the development in the right direction.
Creating the clubs that AI designs isn’t always simple, however. Callaway says it has had to make some notable upgrades to its manufacturing process in order to bring the clubs off the screen and into the clubhouse. In order to manufacture the driver faces, for instance, it needed to revamp its forge. “We needed a new titanium alloy—one that we could fabricate this unusual thickness pattern,” says Hocknell. “There were only a couple machines in the world that could do that with the thin titanium grade we were using. We had to change the crystal structure in the titanium in such a way that it would be durable under the loads it was going to see.”
The measuring equipment needed a similar boost. “We developed a laser scanning system that puts millions of points of laser light onto the back of the face in order to measure in way greater detail than with a touch probe,” says Hocknell. “We went with a couple dozen points to millions.” Of course, the designs aren’t valuable if they can’t make it out onto the course.

Hybrid clubs have replaced longer irons for some players, especially those who have trouble getting the ball in the air. Callaway 

In order to handle all of the calculations, Callaway built its own supercomputer with around 1,000 cores on its campus. With the amount of operations they’re doing, Hocknell says it was more financially feasible than leasing time on a cloud-based system. “Things that used to take four to five weeks now take a couple days,” he says.
As time goes on, the size of Callaway’s data set about golf shots will only grow. It currently goes back 20 years and constantly pulls data from networked machines at Callaway fitting centers around the world. Eventually, AI can play a role in the actual fitting process. Right now, Callaway collects data about those shots for its own research, but down the road, a player could step into a fitting session and get real-time analysis of their game to help guide them toward the right clubs.
Currently, Callaway offers three different flavors of its AI-designed Mavrik clubs, including the standard version for average players, the Sub-Zero version for high-level and pro-grade players, and the Max edition, which places the emphasis on forgiving mishits over pure ball control and feel.

The center of gravity has moved toward the face of the driver. Callaway 

While that’s quite a few clubs to keep track of, Callaway says that each one has its own unique design. “Before, you’d typically pick an iron in the middle of the set and then use a spreadsheet to set the parameters for the rest of the clubs,” he explains. “That seems a little crude today.” Now, AI has refined the process to emphasize desirable traits for their specific use. Longer irons emphasize ball speed and trajectory to give more distance. Shorter irons aim to make launch trajectories and ball spin more consistent for hitting—and staying on—the green.
Callaway will continue to feed data into its algorithm in hopes to figure out how it can further refine its clubs. Hocknell expects more surprises along the way.

Does Artificial Intelligence Go Against Islamic Teachings?



FacebookTwitterPinterestGoogle



The development of Artificial Intelligence is centred on the idea that we as humans can create devices and technologies that are capable of seeing, hearing and behaving like humans. The idea of the soul is fundamental to our beliefs as Muslims. But this field of work does not recognise the soul as an important differentiator as to what makes a human, human. So does AI go against Islamic beliefs? 
It is now quite ordinary to speak to inanimate objects and more often than not, to expect an intelligible answer or some task to be carried out, like respond to a search query, schedule an appointment or make a phone call. How is this possible? 
What is Artificial Intelligence? 
Have you ever wondered what is happening behind the screen or within the plastic boxes with flashing lights? 
And is there anything for Muslims to think about in relation to this new world of seemingly speaking, seeing, acting and thinking things?
All of this has become possible through advances in artificial intelligence, and in the above cases, through advances in language processing. 
Being able to understand and produce human speech is just one of dozens of areas that have advanced rapidly in less than half a decade due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI). 
The development of AI is the quest to design intelligent computer systems – systems that would be capable of the sophisticated array of behaviours and mental capacities that are associated with human intelligence such as learning, understanding language, reasoning, creativity and thought itself.
One of the major events that initiated this resurgence of interest in AI was when an AI system, named AlphaGo, developed by Google subsidiary DeepMind, defeated a leading human player in the board game Go, which is a game known to require high levels of intuitive thought and creativity.

Since then, there has been a huge amount of interest in AI from academics, technologists, investors, governments and policy makers, accompanied by billions of pounds in research funding and widespread public debates on the social, political and ethical implications of AI as its usage grows. 
The ultimate aim of AI research is to create intelligence comparable to, or exceeding, our own, which is known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).
The development of AI and AGI is firmly connected with one of the biggest mysteries in philosophy and science, which is understanding the basis of our intelligence and consciousness and uncovering their origins. 
Science and technology now lead the way in exploring ideas about human nature and human intelligence. 
Does AI Go Against Islamic Teachings? 
For Muslims, and most religious traditions, consciousness, intelligence and human nature are linked to the existence of the soul. 
However, a scientific approach to these questions does not allow for belief in anything immaterial, like the soul. 
AI should therefore be of interest to Muslims as key Islamic teachings are challenged by new scientific ideas emerging from AI research, and these scientific ideas gain credibility amongst people who don’t understand how the technology works and its limitations. 
Like ancient people seeing pharaoh’s magician conjure up false serpents, every new and seemingly magical technology gradually deceives modern people into believing scientists have gained, or will soon gain, the power to create living, animate beings.
What Does the Quran Tell Us About Intelligence and Our Souls? 
One of the key teachings, which we learn directly from the Qur’an, is that we have a unique form of intelligence, knowledge and understanding that differentiates us from animals, angels and jinns. 
The Qur’an tells us that when God created Prophet Adam, عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ, and brought him to life by placing a soul in his body, God instructed the angels and Iblis (the devil) to bow to him after he demonstrated his unique form of knowledge. 
As AI is infused with new devices and technologies, and hence into more aspects of our life, we are encountering new entities that seem to be capable of hearing, seeing, speaking, willing, knowing and intelligent, yet these new entities are not living and certainly don’t have anything like souls. 
What is The Impact of AI on Islam?
The hidden impact of AI is that it makes us believe we are nothing more than soulless machines even with all of our thinking, seeing, speaking and acting.
Muslims should ask how this complicates key stories in the Qur’an that are taught to children, such as when Prophet Ibrahim, عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ, asked his people what they worship. 
When his people replied that they worship idols and “remain constantly in attendance on them,” Ibrahim ,عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ , challenged them by asking, “Do they listen to you when ye call (on them)? Or do you good or harm?”.
Today, people remain constantly in attendance of their smart devices, which do seem to listen when called, and AI algorithms can push people in positive or negative directions. 
In sum, Muslims need to think more carefully about how they use new AI-powered devices in daily life and how they might complicate Islamic teachings in the minds of future generations.

There's a call to rethink Artificial Intelligence as Augmented Intelligence, to stress the capability of people working with AI instead of being replaced by AI..In present times, AI specialists, data scientists, designers, and engineers explore how we can function close by machines, when we should enable machines to make psychological decisions, and how all of society can gain from the productive and monetary benefits guaranteed by innovation in AI..Augmented Intelligence is a technological approach dependent on big data that joins techniques of machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics intending to produce relevant data for targeted choices. It is a development of artificial intelligence that includes human association in a procedure of constant inclusion, focused on improving the results obtained..Humans provide a variety of instances, the machine learns a model and reports results to people who assess the nature of the model itself and decide how to reintroduce these outcomes into the model. This innovation is dependent on Artificial Intelligence strategies in which human activity is fundamental and involved in a consistent cycle..According to Gartner, by 2021 artificial augmentation will reach up to US $2.9 trillion of business value and 6.2 billion hours of worker productivity worldwide..Augmented intelligence carries artificial intelligence into the work environment, permitting enterprises to gain new bits of knowledge, support group performance, and keep a stride ahead in front of the competition. One of the greatest misunderstandings about augmented intelligence is that it forfeits the human experience to drive efficiencies..In reality, augmented intelligence is intended to work close by individuals to release the combined power of innovation with human intelligence and emotions. Augmented intelligence and its capacity to help human workers is one of the most persuasive powers molding the future of work, empowering adopters to harness the best gifts of humans and machines, engaging both to perform the tasks that they're naturally most suitable for..Augmented intelligence can assist organizations with revealing new insights, find new opportunities, make new products and services, and define better approaches for working. By understanding their sharpness and flexibility to venture into new areas, they're finding new markets and clients for their services. Effectively installing and integrating Augmented intelligence into the workforce provides benefits for all partners, including employees, managers, and clients..With the assistance of augmented intelligence, information can be shared, stored, looked, and sorted out to dispose of redundancies across offices, at last uniting your enterprise under shared objectives to drive business development. At the point when the precise data is delivered at the correct time, the management turns out to be increasingly informed, progressively secure, and increasingly sure about their capacity to make strategic choices without the fear of passing up details that might be covered deep inside a report, or covered up in the fine print. At the point when your organization faces immense competition in your industry, it's simpler to face the determined challenges if you have to remain in front of the competition. Augmented Intelligence can wipe out repetitive tasks, helping teams to concentrate on complex research issues..Noteworthy changes might be incorporated by the preferences AI can bring, yet execution despite everything falls on the shoulders of your business knowledge group. Augmented intelligence eases the monotonous tedious work; however a human touch finishes the circle — changing raw data into substantial plans and forms, and progressive advancement..At the point when people join forces with machines, it opens up additional opportunities for associations to concentrate additional time on important tasks, such as building the brand or upgrading client experience. It's these sophisticated human activities, controlled by AI, that transform developing pioneers of the industry into genuine industry trailblazers..In truth, augmented intelligence and artificial intelligence are a piece of an inventive change that holds the possibility to transform the modern culture. Also, this leaves space for huge long haul development. Indeed, even as the current influxes of cognitive advancements dislodge a wide scope of occupations, it remains the case that augmented intelligence will be integral to numerous sorts of innovative work..From the innovative and scientific perspective, what's important is to raise the augmented intelligence and artificial intelligence from the degree of consideration and deliver it to the end client, making it simple for applications in regular day to day existence..In the coming decades, these innovations will turn out to be increasingly significant and will change regular daily existence. From banking and administrations to transport, to security and human relations for wellbeing and personal satisfaction..All services for the individual, even those with a more noteworthy cognitive contribution, will be automated. Augmented intelligence by 2050 won't supplant human activities but will be the cognitive component nearby the man who will accompany him to have a superior quality of work and life..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

 In early March, The Tory Burch Foundation hosted its Embrace Action 2020 Summit, which saw leaders and entrepreneurs from around the world gather to talk about gender parity and inclusion in the workforce. 
 At the Summit,Bank of America COO Thomas Montag spoke with former AOL CEO Steve Case , Goldman Sachs Partner Dina Powell , and Tory Burch about how their companies aimed to create a more inclusive industry. 
 Diane von Furstenberg also spoke at the conference, as did Gloria Steinem, former co-CEO of Ariel Investments Mellody Hobson , and activist-model Halima Aden . 
 Yasmin Green , director of research and development for Jigsaw, an internal tech incubator within Google parent company Alphabet, spoke about the role human bias plays when programming artificial intelligence.

        The   Tory Burch Foundation Summit  in early March was a gathering of some of the most prominent executives and entrepreneurs in the world.
    




        Bank of America COO   Thomas Montag  former AOL CEO   Steve Case  , and   Dina Powell McCormick  , partner and member of the Management Committee at Goldman Sachs, were a few of the execs who spoke about how   they sought to make their companies more inclusive. 





        A prominent theme throughout the conference was gender parity in the workplace.
    




        ""The word 'ambition' takes on a completely different meaning when applied to a woman than when applied to a man,Burch told Business Insider. ""Women are criticized for exhibiting the exact same quality men are praised for. This has to change. We do that by shining a light on unconscious gender bias, which was the focus of our Summit.""
    




  Yasmin Green,  director of research and development at Jigsaw, a unit of Google parent company Alphabet, spoke about one particularly complex hurdle in modern society: the difficulty of programming artificial intelligence without bias.
    




        The problem with training AI on humans, Green said, is that   humans are biased  , and when the data that feeds AI is biased, then the AI becomes biased itself.
    




         ""Are we content with algorithms that reflect back to us the way the world works?"" 
    




        Green detailed an experiment that demonstrated this unconscious bias in AI. She and her team created the same fake professional profile for a woman and a man and browsed online job sites as each of these imaginary people. In the end, they found that men were five times as likely to see ads for higher-paying jobs than women.
    




        This, she said, was because women believe they must fulfill 100% of the requirements before they apply to a job, whereas men believe they only need to meet at least 60% of the requirements before they apply to the job.
    




        ""So at the same skill level, we [women] are clicking on jobs that are less senior and less well paid,Green said. ""But if we click that way, then the internet is going to learn and that's what we're going to see.""

Conventional wisdom has it that physicians cannot work from home. In the field of healthcare, traditional leverage of AI has been on disease detection and prediction. AI engines have generally been efficient in predicting anomalies in CT scans to detect onset of a disease. Does it need to remain restricted to detection only? At specific scenario. Many of the Type1 diabetes patients now use a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to get a near real time reading of their blood sugar levels to determine insulin dosage. These commercially available devices pull the data and load into a cloud based data set-up at a regular interval. Physicians look at the data during review and suggest adjustment to foods and dosage. A simple AI algorithm can take this further by recommending precise set of treatment recommendations for physicians to validate. Since routine visits are getting deferred, this simple intervention has the potential to increase both precision and accuracy of the treatment process for all conditions that require timely and routine physician visits.This opens up the possibility of AI being used as a recommendation tool as opposed to a detection only model. This single change has the ability to transform the entire business model of physical healthcare. From a facility to physically host healthcare professionals along with patients, hospitals and clinics may start operating as a digitally driven operations nerve center.AI based scheduling service may listen to the patients conditions through a chat bot or voice application. It can ask a series of questions, look at the clinical records of the patients in the system and get a basic hypothesis ready for diagnosis based on data.It can then schedule an appointment with the most competent physician available depending on the urgency. Before the appointment, the AI engine may prepare a complete briefing with potential diagnosis and recommended treatments. It can answer a set of follow on questions and allow the recommendations to be overridden. In case of a required diagnostic intervention, AI driven scheduler should be able to arrange for an agent to collect the samples and add them in the patient dossier. Post tele or video consultation, a personal yet non-intervening Voice AI service may do regular follow-throughs, a reminder on medication and other recommended treatment follow through along with any future treatment recommendation. AI engine can sharpen this recommendation by constantly looking through data stream coming from devices that monitor the patient, by consulting physicians. While this sounds futuristic, we have the technology components commercially available. With a strong and progressively cheaper data network, communication has just got easier. Cloud based storage and delivery of information has cut down the cost of computing infrastructure to a fraction. AI can process faster with advanced hardware gaining speed. Finally, a compulsive situation out of a pandemic has changed our mindset to believe things can be equally good if not better in a remote mode.Through an efficient sharing of this data with suppliers, typical gaps of demand and supply can be bridged as well. Most important component of making the system work, the need for healthcare professionals may be calibrated as well and with increasing load on healthcare system, a changing model of treatment aided by AI seems to be a good option for future.

Image recognition and artificial intelligence make production at Volkswagen even more efficient. The key term: Industrial Computer Vision. A visit to the experts at the Smart.Production:Lab who helped develop the technology.

The blue boxes are positioned. A small camera records the contents – all ready for the test. A tense Reda Jaber and Nicolas Hummel turn their heads towards the monitor. A green check appears: All in place – the boxes are filled exactly as they should be. Smiles on their faces. What seems unspectacular at first glance is technologically highly sophisticated: In Volkswagen’s Smart.Production:Lab in Wolfsburg, IT specialists Jaber and Hummel are watching artificial intelligence (AI) at work. The experiment shows: AI can independently check whether delivery boxes are packed correctly – in the laboratory or in genuine logistics scenarios.Industrial Computer Vision is the name of the system that Reda Jaber and Nicolas Hummel have developed together with a seven-member team and in collaboration with other labs and Volkswagen’s Software Development Center in Dresden. The basic idea: people train artificial intelligence to evaluate optical data and detect errors – extremely reliably and in fractions of a second. The AI can check boxes for completeness, for example – but many other applications are conceivable. “The user interface is so simple that anyone can operate it and train the AI independently. You don’t have to be a computer scientist,” says Nicolas Hummel. Over the next few years, Volkswagen expects Computer Vision applications to generate savings in the double-digit million-euro range. The focus is on production and logistics.Industrial Computer Vision offers a toolbox for the implementation of AI use cases: All you need is a person who prepares enough training material – for example, photos with correctly and incorrectly packed boxes – and marks them accordingly. “The AI then learns independently to distinguish faultless from faulty results. After just a few hundred training images, you can achieve good results,” says Hummel. A few days are often enough to make a neural network ready for use. Artificial intelligence – not so difficult after all with Computer Vision.
































The Data Lab in Munich is a partner in the development of many new applications.




 The experts at the Wolfsburg Smart.Production:Lab do not usually develop promising new applications on their own, but in cooperation with other competence centers in the large Volkswagen Group. Take Computer Vision, for example: while the software is written in Wolfsburg, the Data Lab in Munich is concerned with improving neural networks. The Software Development Center in Dresden tests the system in practice and provides feedback. With success: In a logistics hall in Wolfsburg the automatic container control system is already in use. People in the images are automatically pixelated to comply with data protection regulations – a solution that will be standard in all Computer Vision applications.

“Our preferred solution is an online offering from which each department can download the appropriate applications.”Reda Jaber



Another possible application is currently being tested at Porsche in Leipzig: Here, AI checks labels that are attached to every car during production. The labels contain vehicle information or instructions for airbags, for example, and are written in various languages. AI checks the images in real time and provides feedback as to whether everything is in order. From next year, the application is to be used at other locations – rolled out via the Industrial Cloud, which links Volkswagen Group’s plants together. In the Smart.Production:Lab, Reda Jaber and Nicolas Hummel are also continuing to work on making the advantages of Computer Vision available throughout the entire company. “Our preferred solution is an online offering from which each department can download the appropriate applications as if they were in a library,” says Reda Jaber. A pilot test is already underway.
































Work on future ideas: Nicolas Hummel (left) and Reda Jaber show a test set-up for driverless transport systems in the Smart.Production:Lab.




And when everything is ready? Jaber and Hummel know they won’t run out of ideas. In addition to Computer Vision, the experts at the Smart.Production:Lab have also been working on driverless transport systems, data analysis, robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT) – all major topics for the future. 



“It’s fun to be able to help shape all this. I learn an incredible amount because we develop almost everything ourselves.”Nicolas Hummel

 Reda Jaber takes a similar view of the work in the Smart.Production:Lab: “What I like best is the freedom to try out new technology.” Flat hierarchies allow the individual teams to organize themselves independently and also have a say in selecting the most appropriate projects. “Anyone can contribute ideas, all employees are heard,” says Reda Jaber. This was also the case with the work on Computer Vision – the success proves the developers are right.

When Yann LeCun founded the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) lab in 2013, artificial intelligence was entering a boom period that his research helped trigger.  
Facebook’s chief AI scientist had been among a group of computer scientists who retained faith in deep neural networks during an “AI winter” of reduced funding and interest in the field. In 2019, his efforts earned him a share of the Turing Award, together with his friends Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton. 
Today, AI is now an essential component of Facebook’s vast array of applications, touching everything from Messenger to content moderation.
“You take AI out of Facebook, and basically the services crumble,” LeCun tells TNW.
TNW Conference 2025 - Back to NDSM on June 19-20, 2025 - Save the date!As we wrapped up our incredible 2024 edition, we're pleased to announce our return to Amsterdam NDSM in 2025. Registration now!
Early Booking = Best rates
But fears are now emerging that another winter will soon arrive if AI can’t live up to its current hype, particularly around the promise of artificial general intelligence (AGI): the idea that a machine can perform any intellectual task a human can — and many that they can’t. 
LeCun is not a fan of the term. He’s previously argued that “there is no such thing as AGI” because “human intelligence is nowhere near general.” However, he is keenly pursuing “human-level AI.” His chosen technique for reaching it is self-supervised learning.
In supervised learning, people painstakingly label data and then feed it to an algorithm to teach it what to look for when solving a problem. But in self-supervised learning — often confused with unsupervised learning — there’s no need for human annotation. Instead, the system generates signals from the data and uses them to train itself.
It’s already become an integral part of Facebook’s work on hate speech detection, language translation, and forecasting the spread of COVID-19. LeCun compares the method to how babies learn by interacting with their surroundings. If machines can better replicate their technique, he believes they could gain the common sense they need to reach human-level intelligence:

Once we have a working methodology for that, we’ll have a tool that enables a machine to learn enormous amounts of knowledge about how the world works from physical reality — just by observing the world. They’d be able to learn world models that are predictive, which is essential to intelligence.

FAIR origins
FAIR began life after Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook CTO Michael Schroepfer identified AI as critical to the company’s long-term future.
“They were 100% right about this,” says LeCun, now Facebook’s chief AI scientist.
They decided to create a new research lab from scratch — and handpicked LeCun to lead it.
“What attracted me was there was a lot of opportunity.  But also, I had somewhat of a carte blanche to organize the lab in the way I thought would be the most successful.”
LeCun immediately made open research the cornerstone of his plans. FAIR now publishes almost all of its work, and open sources the majority of its code, datasets, and tools — such as PyTorch, a toolkit for quickly creating new machine learning models.
The motivation behind this approach isn’t purely altruistic. It allows Facebook to influence what researchers work on, foster collaborations with academia and industry, and attract talent to FAIR.
“The currency for a scientist is his or her intellectual impact on the community,” says LeCun. “So if you want to hire the best scientists in the world, and you tell them you can come here but you can’t talk about what you do — they’re not going to join.”
But isn’t he worried that Facebook’s rivals could steal the lab’s secrets?
“That’s fine. Why would it be bad? The value of a lot of the technology we produce is multiplied by a coefficient that is basically Facebook’s ability to deploy them in its services. It’s much more difficult — even if it’s open source — for another company to deploy it in ways that would compete directly with us.”
On the contrary, sharing the research helps Facebook improve its own products:

The main problem we need to solve is not whether we are a few months ahead of Google in a particular piece of technology — because it’s never more than a few months — it’s more that we don’t have the science or the technology that we need for the stuff that we want to build. So we need to help the community advance as much as possible to open research. The fact that other people use it is irrelevant.

AI advances and challenges
Much of the fundamental research behind the AI in Facebook products now takes place at FAIR. Among its most impactful creations are Memory Networks, which improve how machines talk to people by helping them retain enough data to answer general knowledge questions. An influential 2014 paper showed how the approach could answer questions about the plot of the Lord of the Rings.
“DeepMind was working on a very similar idea exactly simultaneously,” LeCun recalls. “We posted a paper on arXiv, and then three days later DeepMind posted their paper, because they didn’t want to be completely scooped. ”

At that time, DeepMind was one of the driving forces behind London’s emergence as a global AI hotbed. FAIR had initially planned to join them by launching its first European lab in the city. But after studying the availability of talent, the company pivoted to Paris.
“It was a more difficult turf to enter, whereas continental Europe was completely open,” says LeCun. “There was essentially no ambitious fundamental research lab in AI or even in information technology in continental Europe really.”
The lab has since become one of FAIR’s largest AI research centers and the birthplace of many of its computer science breakthroughs. Its recent innovations include Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS), a tool for quickly finding videos, text, or images that are similar to each other. The system can be used to recommend Instagram posts or to detect extremist propaganda videos that have been tweaked and then reposted to evade removal.
FAIR has also helped Facebook use AI to find hate speech on the platform. But these systems have received criticism for not detecting every language.
However, self-supervised learning is expanding the linguistic range of the tools. But LeCun believes the technique will only reach its potential once it can reason like a human.
I think that once we’ve broken through that brick wall, we’ll make a significant advance in the capabilities of AI systems. But the thing is, there’s probably going to be a brick wall right behind it that we don’t know about right now — because it’s hidden from us. So we don’t know how many brick walls we have to go through to get to rat-level intelligence, cat-level intelligence, human-level intelligence.
We don’t know how long it’s going to take up to break through this first wall. It could be next year, it could be five years from now, it could be 10 years, it could be 20 years. There’s good hope it’s going to happen soon, but how do we know? And then we’ll most likely encounter other obstacles that we don’t realize exist.

Spectrum OffshoreWind farm operators are important customers for Jess HanhamWith that information project managers can decide whether to place turbines and other equipment a safe distance from the suspected bombs, or have them blown up by a specialist firm.At the moment marine surveying is done by teams who go out on boats, collect the data and bring it back for analysis.Sometimes that will involve a relatively small vessel with two crew members, a surveyor and his kit. But bigger inspection projects further out to sea can involve much larger boats, with dozens of crew members, costing in the region of £100,000 per day.The sensor equipment varies according to the job. Sometimes it might be a sonar array towed behind the boat, for other jobs it might be an underwater unmanned vehicle, which can be controlled by surveyors on the surface.Bad weather can disrupt the work and make life uncomfortable. ""I've been at sea in force nine and force 10 gales and they're not nice places to work,"" says Brian Allen, chief executive of Rovco.More Technology of BusinessThe headphones even a DJ can't breakThe coldest computers in the worldVirtual house hunting gets a pandemic boostWhat you need to become an internet streaming starTraining your brain to relax on a virtual islandHis company is one of several looking to disrupt that market using artificial intelligence (AI) systems. They see a future where underwater robots, known as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), will be able to do the surveying work without much human oversight, and send the data back to surveyors in the office.Bristol-based Rovco is working on key pieces of the technology. It has trained an AI system to recognise objects on the seabed from data collected at sea, a process which took four years.Adding AI means the data does not have to be analysed by a human on the ship, or taken back to shore for assessment. That work is actually being done there and then by the AI, which can operate on the ship, or soon on the underwater robot itself.""Without AI autonomous underwater robots are pretty dumb - only being able to follow pipelines and cables in pre-programmed lines,"" says Mr Allen.""Enabling the AUV to analyse data in real time means you can actually instruct the robot to do other things. If you come across a problem, the survey can be stopped, and more data collected, with the robot making decisions for itself,"" he says.So, for example, if the AI flagged up something that looked like an unexploded bomb it could stop, go back, and do further analysis.RovcoThe goal is for robots to survey underwater structures with minimal human oversightFor some jobs, like dismantling underwater oil and gas infrastructure, engineers need to know the exact dimensions and locations of the equipment.To help with this Rovco has also developed a vision system that produces accurate maps of underwater infrastructure.The system generates a 3D cloud of individual data points, a format used in modelling software like CAD. It combines those points with camera images to generate a realistic 3D reconstruction.Rovco is currently bringing together the vision system, the AI and the underwater vehicle into one package. Other companies are also racing to introduce AI into the industry.ModusCompanies are racing to introduce AI into their underwater vehiclesJake Tompkins is the chief executive of UK-based Modus, which owns a fleet of 12 unmanned underwater vehicles. It is about to start a two-year programme with Durham University to develop an artificial intelligence control system that would allow some of its underwater vehicles to recognise their location, objects and anomalies during a survey.He says that combining with Durham is a very efficient way to develop the technology, because they already have proven AI systems for the car and aerospace industries. Using autonomous subsea robots to survey the seabed and inspect underwater structures would be a ""game changer"", according to Mr Tompkins and should ""significantly"" cut costs.He thinks it won't be long before underwater robots will be stationed out at sea, perhaps at an offshore wind farm, or at an oil or gas facility.When needed, they will be woken up and sent to harvest data, which will be sent back to an onshore control centre for processing.ModusIn the coming years underwater vehicles will be based offshore""I think we're probably two or so years away from the first commercial deployment of field-resident autonomous vehicles, but that is certainly where we are heading,"" says Mr Tompkins.His company is currently working on ways to keep the AUVs charged while they are out at sea and on technology that allows them to send back data.There is a juicy prize for the firms that can make such intelligent underwater robots work. Over the next decade the offshore wind market is expected to see ""quite extraordinary"" growth, according to Søren Lassen, head of offshore wind research at the consultancy Wood Mackenzie.At the moment only six countries have a commercial-scale offshore wind power industry. In 10 years' time, he forecasts that 20 countries will have joined that club. RovcoRapid installation of wind farms is likely to drive demand for autonomous underwater vehiclesLast year 29 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity was connected to electricity grids around the world. In 2029 Wood Mackenzie forecasts that number will hit 180 gigawatts.That will involve building thousands of wind turbines and laying thousands of kilometres of cable to connect up those wind farms and all of that will need the services of underwater surveyors.By 2029, much of that work at sea might be done by autonomous systems, with humans back at the office.Jess Hanham will keep his business up to date with the latest technology, but fears the work will become less rewarding.""I love the variety. For me being stuck in the office - I'd hate that. Going out and doing survey work, coming back and seeing the whole thing from start to finish - it gives you ownership of the work. I thoroughly enjoy that. If we were to lose part of that, I think that would be a real shame.""",ReportageNewsArticle,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53218719,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1678A/production/_113924029_eb91544a-5a93-45ee-8fa1-bc4b4a26880a.png'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Ben Morris'}]","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",Robots go their own way deep in the ocean,2020-08-13T23:01:59.000Z,2020-08-13T23:01:59.000Z,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1678A/production/_113924029_eb91544a-5a93-45ee-8fa1-bc4b4a26880a.png,,,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53218719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leading solution is also dramatically transforming the logistics field. According to the research, the global AI in the logistics and supply chain market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 45.5% by 2027. In this article, we’re going to overlook the AI trends in logistics to look for in 2020.How Artificial Intelligence is transforming the logistics industryToday more and more AI-based logistics applications appear on the market to optimize the transportation companies’ and business performance. Each solution can help organizations to do certain tasks. So, let’s see 8 ways AI is transforming the logistics industry and how technology can improve your business.Automated warehousesIntegration of the AI solutions can decrease the costs by automating warehouses. The technology can do a lot of everyday routine tasks and change many processes like data collection, inventory, and so on. AI has the ability to analyze the data gathered, predict demand, re-route in-transit goods, modify orders, and communicate with each other for optimizing transportation between warehouses. Such agility and planning in logistics mean lower costs, better service, faster work.Jobs in MLAI-powered big dataIt’s not news that big data has great potential in various fields, including transportation and supply chain. There is tons of information gathered daily when dealing with logistics. It’s a true challenge to process and exploit all the data fast and accurately for planning. AI can do that. Besides that, the system considers such factors as political landscape, weather, and others. Today thanks to the AI solutions integrated, logistics companies can:Refine the data gathered from each touchpoint;Analyze all the data accurately;Come up with the patterns for better strategic decision making;Increase automation of repetitive tasks;Make clear and accurate predictions.Autonomous vehiclesWatching movies such as Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Demolition Man with Sylvester Stallone, the autonomous vehicles seemed to be just a fantasy. However, it’s a reality nowadays. Currently, such companies as Tesla and Google have already developed self-driving cars with AI implemented.Autonomous vehicles promise to reduce the costs, save time, decrease accident rates. Currently, human supervision is a must to drive autonomous vehicles on roads, yet in the future it’s expected that cars will be fully automated.Trending Bot Articles:1. Conversational AI: Code/No Code2. Chatbots 2.0: Simplifying Customer Service with RPA and AI3. Question Answering on Medical conversation4. Automating WhatsApp with NLP: Complete guideComputer visionAI-based computer vision can help logistics companies with a wide range of tasks and optimize performance. For instance, the AI computer vision used for automating warehouses can identify the needs and help with organization of the inventory. Another use-case is from logistics giant DHL — visual inspection powered by AI. The technology helps:Scan and identify the damage;Classify it by the type;Determine the appropriate remedial measures.The key feature of the computer vision in this case is speed. The AI solution does all listed tasks much faster than ever before.There is one more great example from the retail giant Amazon. The system helps unload a trailer of inventory in only 30 minutes when doing the same without the computer vision takes several hours.Smart roadsAI used for roads can improve transportation and make it more effective, in-time, and safe. Thus, the great example of the technology used for the purpose are highways with solar panels and LED lights. Thus, the panels provide electricity and LED lights alert about various road conditions. What’s more, solar panels prevent the appearance of the slippery surface on the road in winter.Drivers, using the roads with AI-based fiber optic sensors, can get the information about the traffic volumes, alerts about road conditions, accidents, etc. In the event that the vehicle or truck gets in an accident on such a road, the AI technology will immediately report appropriate emergency services.Artificial Intelligence of the back office operationsThe AI solutions integrated can automate the repetitive back-office tasks and operations. Combining AI with Robotic Process Automation (RPA), the logistics organizations can improve the accuracy, speed, productivity of the employees, and reduce the costs. The technology is helpful with the everyday data-related tasks that can be done by robotic assistance. This will free your workers and let them focus on other crucial aspects. That leads to a rise in their quality of work.Predictive capabilitiesAccurate predictions can save money and customers. The AI technology integrated provides various algorithms for forecasting the trends, goods, and/or supplies needed for your company in the future. As Deloitte reports, such algorithms forecast outcomes precisely and better than human experts. The technology tracks and measures all inputs and variables for creating contingency plans. That can reduce the costs of your company, navigating you successfully through any emergencies.Customer experienceIt’s no matter if your company is B2B or B2C, it’s crucial to keep your customers engaged. The fastest way to do it is to improve their experience. AI technology can increase customer loyalty and retention. The solution can personalize the service, suggest products according to the previous purchases, page views, and customizations based on the buying preferences, habits. In such a way the AI integration can turn users into consumers, increase revenue, build a brand.Final thoughtsAI technology dramatically reshapes the logistics field. The integration of the solution can improve inventory, transportation, accuracy, management, and power the employees to make their job more efficient. The key feature of the solution is the automation of the routine tasks, speed, and efficiency of the back office, big data analytics, and on and on. Artificial Intelligence can also eliminate the risks and reduce the accidents associated with the transportation of the cargos.

The contract has a one-year base period worth $31 million with three option years through August 2024.Work is scheduled to start Aug. 17, according to Lt. Cmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, spokesperson for the JAIC.“The Joint Common Foundation will provide an AI development environment to test, validate and field AI capabilities at scale across the Department of Defense,” Abrahamson said. “The impact of the JCF will come from enterprise‐wide access to AI tools and data for AI developers across the Department and its partners that will help synchronize AI projects, reduce development redundancy and enable the broad deployment of AI-enabled solutions to the tactical edge where front line operators can benefit from these capabilities.”Deloitte will serve as the lead system integrator for all contractor solutions for the JCF, he said. It will “provide, operate, maintain, secure and enhance the JCF with platforms and tools that can be shared and distributed to end-users across the Department of Defense enterprise,” according to the press release.The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is the DoD’s lead organization on accelerating AI adoption across the department. The center has undertaken several projects since being stood up in 2018, including predictive maintenance and disaster relief work. Its portfolio continues to expand, this year taking on its first lethality project—known as the joint warfighting initiative—and entering the information warfare fight as well. The JAIC also awarded a five-year contract potentially worth up to $800 million to Booz Allen Hamilton in May for work related to the joint war fighting initiative.The award of the JCF contract is an important step as the JAIC continues to mature. For the center, “the end state is an AI development environment that will accelerate the testing, validation and fielding of AI capabilities across the U.S. military,” Abrahamson said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

Just like any other profession, medicine is also having a taste of Artificial intelligence. According to various medical researches, about 50 percent of activities carried out by workers can be automated..How medical practitioners respond to the use of AI is important to its success. For instance, 25 years ago, certain medical innovations were almost impossible. .As a matter of fact, AI has contributed immensely to medicine but what does the future hold for medicine..What is artificial intelligence in medicine?.Artificial intelligence is the use of AI technology, also known as 'automated processes' in the diagnosis and treatment of patients that require medical attention..Although diagnosis and treatment could seem much like basic processes, nevertheless several other background procedures must be carried out for a patient to go through proper recovery. Below are some of the processes;.Garnering patient's data through tests and interviewsProcessing and analyzing test resultsUtilization of different data sources to come up with an accurate diagnosis. Resolving on a proper treatment processPreparing and administering the preferred method of treatmentMonitoring patientPost – care, follow-ups and appointments.The reason for the increasing use of AI in healthcare is because quite a number of the above may be automated. Don't forget, these processes mentioned above form part of the 50 percent of workers activities that can be automated..Besides, automation of these processes will ensure that tasks are completed more efficiently. It gives the medical professional more time to handle other activities. .According to a 2016 research, doctors spend a lot of time on data analysis and administrative work than talking to patients. According to AMA past President Steven Stack &quot;This Research expressed, what many doctors feel — data entry and administrative activities are reducing the doctor-patient time which is fundamental to medicine, and the major reason many of us became physicians,&quot; .However, excessively-automation of the medical and health care sectors will not produce the expected result. Meanwhile, the focus ought to be intentionally and rationally defining areas where automation could free up time and energy. The objective is to strike a balance between the successful use of AI and the human capabilities and judgment of qualified healthcare experts..How technology impacts on patient health care.No doubt, modern technology has made a huge impact on every aspect of our lives. Moreover, healthcare is one sector that has significantly benefited the most from the technology advancement experienced in the last 50 years..Technological advancements accomplished in recent years have saved millions of lives and improved the quality of human life..Let us look at some of the most notable developments in healthcare driven by the new technological advancements;.Facilitates Communication Between Clinicians.A variety of healthcare practitioners are also interested in a patient's healing journey. It can significantly increase the risk of miscommunication or mistake. Poor communication is one of the most common factors contributing to the occurrence of potential complications. .Reduction of Medical Error.Prescribing errors can lead to complications. Electronic prescriptions would significantly minimize prescription errors by allowing doctors to send prescriptions automatically to an online pharmacy..Provides access to information.With just a simple click, a physician can access all information needed to treat a patient. This will obviously rule out any room for mistakes. Information technology has dramatically increased access to reference materials.  .Increases patient-centred care.It encourages patients to become more involved in their treatment is essential for a variety of reasons. Some include increased compliance and patient satisfaction. Technology continues to contribute to patient-centred treatment by facilitating contact between clinicians and patients through online apps, text messages and email.  .Presence of artificial intelligence in health care.There are several levels of Artificial intelligence in healthcare. Often, Artificial intelligence uses web databases, which makes it easy for health experts to gain access to tons of diagnostic resources..The healthcare profession is actively engaged in conducting research; therefore the use of Artificial Intelligence will significantly improve the physician's work. Also, it will provide a better result that can be tailored to their medical knowledge. .AI's ability to &quot;think&quot; from data creates an opportunity for increased precision based on feedback. This feedback includes several back-end database sources, reviews from clinicians, health care professionals, and research organizations. .Interestingly, healthcare AI systems are always functioning in real-time. This ensures that the data is still up-to-date, thereby increasing quality and relevance. Besides, the data obtained is a collection of specific patient records, electronic recordings of medical instruments, laboratory results, medical tests and various demographics..Future of AI in healthcare.AI's future in health care may include activities that vary from basic to advance. In the nearest future, it may include answering calls, analyzing medical records, trending population health and analytics. .Also, developing medicinal drugs and devices, reading radiological images, making medical diagnostic and treatment plans, and even communicating with patients is part of AI's improvement..On the other hand, some physicians have argued that AI in medicine will do the following to the profession;.Dismantle medicineCreate room for non-experts to infuriate the professionLikely send the role of a doctor into extinctionIncrease inefficiency.Although these concerns are ideal, it will be almost impossible to reduce the use of Ai in medicine now. Effective monitoring and proper regulations remain the only solution..Artificial intelligence in pharmacy.In the pharmaceutical field, Artificial Intelligence works with researchers to help decision-making processes for approved drugs and to develop therapies for other diseases. .Also, it will expedite the process of clinical trials by selecting the right patients from a range of data sources. .The Pharmacy sector is also working on forecasting with some precision when and where infectious outbreaks can occur. Similarly, pharmaceutical Artificial Intelligence will also focus database to prescribe drugs for patients. .More so the history of previous outbreaks and some other mainstream outlets will form part of the database. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

From enhancing human capabilities to automating repetitive tasks and streamlining customer services to improving business efficiency, AI is already making its way into everyday business processes. According to PwC research, AI is likely to add US$15.7 trillion to global economic growth by 2030. While the technology's acceptance in mainstream society is becoming a new phenomenon, it has been around decades ago..The recent advances in AI significantly have augmented human cognition and decisions, taking every aspect of people's lives and business by storm. The rapid deployment of AI across industries is majorly driven by the growing investment in technology. In a recent IDC report, spending on AI systems is expected to reach US$97.9 billion in 2023, over two and one-half times the US$37.5 billion in 2019, growing at CAGR of 28.9 percent throughout the forecast period of 2018-2023..Business Opportunities Influenced by AI.AI typically delivers an incredible opportunity for automation and digital transformation. It has the potential to upgrade businesses' workforce, rather than eliminating them if implemented effectively. It can have a considerable impact on an organizational workflow as it confiscates repetitive, tedious tasks, offering more autonomy to apply creativity and human decision on other valuable tasks..Persistent AI innovations has given the rise to a horde of smart devices that are able to detect and react to sights, sounds, and other patterns, and do not require a constant connection to the cloud. From autonomous robots to vision cameras and medical devices, these smart devices are well set to unlock greater efficiency at an organizational level..As the current AI capability augments human decisions on everything, researchers and developers globally are attempting autonomous AI that will not require any human intervention, even in making highly complex decisions. However, many are also concerned about this and raise questions if things will go wrong how will be accountable?.Meanwhile, organizations that have already started the business transformation using AI now are looking for ways to reap repeatable value. In its survey, Deloitte Insights sees increasing levels of AI implementation and financial investment. The survey found that respondents are realizing competitive advantage and expecting AI-powered transformation to happen for their organization and industry alike. The survey report also noted that AI-driven businesses must work harder to maintain an edge over their peers..Artificial intelligence has also the potential to improve user experience. It can offer insights by decrypting spoken or written communications and inferring actions based on patterns of past behavior. Enterprises can derive the biggest ROI over their resources using this tech. Additionally, in order to drive automation and optimize business processes, leveraging AI can provide substantial benefits..Comprehensively, business leaders need to pilot high-return AI initiatives that can them help stay competitive in AI supremacy. They also must build AI capability at an organization level, bring technology implementation strategy to business strategy, and lay the foundation of appropriate AI governance..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Even before the COVID 19 outbreak affected the working of IT infrastructure, the organizations were looking out for recruiting good data analytics team. With the advancement of AI, it becomes imperative for organizations to not only harness good data analytics but also to reach out to skills that can be insightful towards data analytics..A data analytics team usually consists of data scientist, data engineers, data designers, statisticians, research analysts, and business analysts..For LinkedIn's emerging job reports for the year 2020, Data Scientists and Data Engineers gained the top positions. Both skills are flooded with young talent, new ideas, and a yearning to collaborate and advance data analytics. However, often due to the absence of coordination, communication, and focus, data scientists and data engineers can fail to deliver the required results, leading to instability within the infrastructure..Both Data Scientists and Data Engineers form the core of the data analytics team. .Data Engineers collect, manage, and store the data. They are responsible for data infrastructure, scale and quality to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They design, build, create, and integrate data from various sources, and write queries of the easily accessible data.  The Data Engineers are more focused on designing data, thus preparing a large amount of big data to be used in making Business Decisions..Data Scientists work on the usage of the data. They turn big data into legible insights with the application of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, to solve critical business problems..Creating the Hub.A Hub represents a cross-functional team, including Data engineers and Data Scientists, which display a mixture of skills and perspectives. It is operated by Chief Data Officers. Building a strong data ecosystem, one that is agile and responsible, data scientists and data engineers must be assigned responsibilities according to the skills exhibited by both. As they work in the same neighborhood in the IT infrastructure, it will embed a sense of accountability, which will help them in setting up priorities and achieving goals..A Hub also helps in nurturing the AI talent and creating communities, where the employees display their methods and ideas that works best for an organization. It also amplifies space for addressing multiple issues, along with the isolated business one..The Hub organizes different AI models and interprets various data insights by deploying new AI capabilities..Building Diverse Teams.Building a diverse team would consolidate a variety of opinions and ideas. It will allow data engineers and data scientists to apply different permutations and combinations of the existing algorithm to derive into a conclusion..A diverse team enables Data Scientists and Data Engineers to apply AI tools, address the new challenges, and acknowledge the loophole in the existing algorithm. As mistakes tend to learn, it will facilitate the employees to correct minor issues that were difficult to notice earlier..The diverse team can also include assigning executive projects that will enable the employees for incorporating a broader perspective, deploying and monitoring new AI capabilities by inputs from the frontline staff..Explaining the importance of the Project.For any organization to work smoothly, it becomes necessary that the employees and the team must understand the necessity and importance of a new or existing project..Making them understand, the aim, procedure, strategical process, and reason behind taking up a new or existing project would enhance their performance, thus rendering them to work towards a common goal..Providing Space to Learn and Grow.Data Scientists and Data engineers are young talents that thrive in learning and applying the knowledge for building new products. Redundant work can make them unenthusiastic towards their skills, hence organizations must focus on a broader overview for implementing growth and learning..This will also enhance in sharpening their AI tools, mature their AI capabilities, and make them more accountable, enthusiastic, and responsible towards the data ecosystem..Managing Relationships to Learn.Managing Relationship between employees helps in reviewing past barriers. Developing a portfolio of initiatives by managing relationships would enhance the prioritization of projects, provide a long term view, and would help in taking decisions for combined projects..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The technology has touched nearly every aspect of business and society, from transforming hiring to making marketing more effective to increasing crop yields. But most importantly of all, AI is hard at work saving lives. Here are some of the amazing ways that AI is becoming the superhero of the tech world. 
AI is hard at work saving lives. getty

1. Preventing Accidents
Each year, 1.35 million people die from vehicle-related accidents, and more than half of these victims are “vulnerable road users” (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists).

As autonomous vehicles become an increasing presence on roadways, there is growing concern about how everyone will share the road safely. A new app, !important, aims to minimize the risks of accidents with all certified connected vehicles: cars and trucks, buses, autonomous vehicles, construction equipment—even drones.

PROMOTED
The AI-enabled app creates a virtual protection zone around pedestrians, wheelchair users, cyclists or motorcyclists using their mobile devices. 

The app sends the user’s location coordinates to all nearby automated or connected vehicles, augmenting the vehicles’ sensor input to ensure the individual is recognized and tracked. If a connected vehicle gets too close to an !important user, its brakes will be triggered automatically before a collision can occur.

2. Improving Healthcare Delivery
Healthcare is one of the most important areas where AI is playing a critical role in saving lives. Despite the extensive training physicians and nurses receive, they cannot identify every ailment or medical condition. Furthermore, Covid-19 has certainly shown the challenges that remain in helping large numbers of critically ill patients. Companies are searching for—and finding—solutions thanks to machine learning and AI.
Health Catalyst has developed catalyst.ai, healthcare.ai and its healthcare analytics platform as potentially life-saving technologies for a wide range of clinical scenarios. For example, its machine-learning capability can identify those patients at greatest risk of readmission and provide clinicians with guidance that enables them to step in and address the problem. The technology has also helped to prevent hospital-acquired infections, predict chronic disease and reduce mortality rates.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, many frontline workers around the world have tragically lost their lives to the virus while assisting patients. Bracing for a second wave, the Sheba Medical Center in Israel is testing smart hospital rooms that could save patients’ lives as well as those of doctors and nurses. The Israeli hospital believes that AI-powered robots, virtual reality glasses and early warning systems can all provide better outcomes for Covid-19 patients and a safer environment for those who care for them.

3. Detecting Medical Conditions
AI can also save lives outside the hospital setting. Corti understands that many medical emergencies occur before or during ambulance dispatch when there are only minutes to save a life. This inspired the company to create an AI-enabled system that can identify cardiac arrest.
The voice-based digital assistant listens in on emergency calls and analyzes what patients say to determine their current medical state. Trials of the system in Copenhagen found that it decreased cases of undetected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by 43%. The company is already working on ways its solution can be used to diagnose other ailments and provide further life-saving assistance. 
4. Improving Pharmaceutical Solutions
Although drugs address medical conditions and save lives, many have side effects that can lead to other health risks. Okwin is one company that has taken on the challenge of improving pharmaceutical solutions through AI-powered medical research and development. 
It uses a machine-learning algorithm to create models designed to predict disease evolution, improve treatment and then enhance the way drugs are developed for these diseases. Okwin leverages an extensive amount of data from its hospital partners to find ways to help patients improve more quickly while minimizing side effects. 
5. Ending Human Trafficking
Not all threats to life are healthcare-related. The global issue of human trafficking is another pandemic that requires greater attention. Those who are fighting this global scourge have found that AI can come to the rescue of millions of women and children who are being trafficked.
Investigating human trafficking can take countless hours and resources to cull through online data. However, AI can step in, collect and process the data and identify patterns at a rate that humans are incapable of achieving. AI can also be used in image recognition software to track both the criminals and locate the victims. The result is an ability to catch traffickers in the act and uncover their global networks.
Delta 8.7 is an organization that applies AI and computational science to track and stop human traffickers. The organization is partnering with the United Nations University Centre for Policy Research, the Alan Turing Institute, the Computing Community Consortium, Tech Against Trafficking and others to find further ways to use technology to address this critical social issue. 
Changing the World for the Better
Human life is invaluable and must be protected. From preventing life-threatening traffic accidents to saving the victims of human trafficking, AI is giving human beings a greater chance at safe and happy lives.

NSF advances artificial intelligence research with new nationwide institutes



August 26, 2020





The U.S. National Science Foundation is establishing new artificial intelligence institutes to accelerate research, expand America's workforce, and transform society in the decades to come. Enabled by sustained federal investment and channeled toward issues of national importance, continued advancement in AI research holds the potential for further economic impact and improvements in quality of life.With an investment of over $100 million over the next five years, NSF's Artificial Intelligence Institutes represent the nation's most significant federal investment in AI research and workforce development to date. The $20 million investment in each of five NSF AI institutes is just the beginning, with more institute announcements anticipated in the coming years.




A new AI agent developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin takes a few ""glimpses"" of its surroundings, representing less than 20 percent of the full 360 degree view, and infers the rest of the whole environment. What makes this system so effective is that it's not just taking pictures in random directions but, after each glimpse, choosing the next shot that it predicts will add the most new information about the whole scene.

The Department of Defense’s (DoD) Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) is leveraging artificial intelligence tools and the department’s vast amount of medical data to identify cancers and other conditions.







The project, called Predictive Health, will aim to develop new tools that medical professionals can use to more accurately and quickly identify medical issues in patients.
Scientists will train AI algorithms to look at de-identified DoD medical images to teach it to identify cancers. The AI can then be used with augmented reality microscopes to help medical professionals better identify cancer cells.
Using these tools, providers will be able to catch diseases earlier and reduce costly healthcare procedures.
""From a big-picture perspective, this is about integrating AI into the DOD healthcare system,"" said Nathanael Higgins, the support contractor managing the program for DIU. ""There are four critical areas we think this technology can impact. The first one is, it's going to help drive down cost.""
The project will also develop tools to help healthcare professionals make more informed decisions.
""Medical professionals are already overworked,"" said Higgins. ""We're essentially giving them an additional tool that will help them make confident decisions — and know that they made the right decision — so that we're not facing as many false negatives or false positives. And ultimately we're able to identify these types of disease states earlier, and that'll help the long-term prognosis.""
To train these AI algorithms, the Predictive Health project will use DoD data from CT scans, MRIs, x-rays, and slide imagery made from biopsies. Because the department has access to a diverse set of data, the algorithms will be trained on information representative of all patient populations.
""If you think about it, the DOD, through retired and active duty service, is probably one of the largest health care systems in the world, at about 9 million people,"" said Dr. Niels Olson, the DIU chief medical officer and originator of the Predictive Health project.
""The more data a tool has available to it, the more effective it is. That's kind of what makes DOD unique. We have a larger pool of information to draw from, so that you can select more diverse cases. Unlike some of the other large systems, we have a pretty good representation of the US population. The military actually has a nice smooth distribution of population in a lot of ways that other regional systems don't have. And we have it at scale.""
Privacy will also be top of mind during the project, DoD officials noted.
""We'll use de-identified information, imaging, from clinical specimens,"" Olson said. ""So this means actual CT images and actual MRI images of people who have a disease, where you remove all of the identifiers and then just use the diagnostic imaging and the actual diagnosis that the pathologist or radiologist wrote down.""
Leaders stated that although the AI will eventually serve as a companion tool for providers, it won’t replace human experts entirely.
""The prototype of this technology that we're adopting will not replace the practitioner. It is an enabler — it is not a cure-all. It is designed to enhance our people and their decision making. If there's one thing that's true about DOD, it's that people are our most important resource. We want to give them the best tools to succeed at their job,” said Higgins.
""AI is obviously the pinnacle of that type of tool in terms of what it can do and how it can help people make decisions. The intent here is to arm them with an additional tool so that they make confident decisions 100 percent of the time.""
In addition to DIU, the Predictive Health project will involve the Defense Health Agency, three private-sector businesses, and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). JAIC will provide funding and added technical expertise for the broader initiative.
""The JAIC's contributions to this initiative have engendered the strategic development of required infrastructure to enable AI-augmented radiographic and pathologic diagnostic capabilities,"" said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Hassan Tetteh, the JAIC's Warfighter Health Mission Initiative chief.
""Given the military's unique, diverse, and rich data, this initiative has the potential to compliment other significant military medical advancements to include antisepsis, blood transfusions, and vaccines.”
Predictive Health is expected to end within 24 months, and the project might then make its way out to practitioners for further testing.
Through the Predictive Health project, DoD will aim to improve healthcare operations and outcomes.
""If you can cut down on the number of acute issues that come up that prevent people from doing their job, you essentially help our warfighting force,"" Higgins said.

7 Successful Ways To Use Artificial Intelligence To Improve Your Business ProcessesAdobe Stock

Here are seven ways AI is transforming everyday business processes for the better.

1. Improving meetings

Okay, so AI can’t eliminate meetings altogether. In fact, the coronavirus pandemic has shown us how maintaining human connections is vital, even from a distance – which means meetings are definitely here to stay. But AI can at least help to cut down the tiresome admin involved before, during, and after meetings.

PROMOTED
For example, voice assistants such as Google Duplex can schedule appointments for you. Then there’s Voicea’s EVA assistant, which can listen in on your meetings, capture key highlights and actions, and create and share actionable notes afterward. Another tool, called Sonia, does a similar thing, but is designed to capture client calls, transcribing the entire conversation, and automatically summarizing key items and actions.
2. Enhancing sales and marketing 
Many off-the-peg CRM solutions now incorporate AI analytics, enabling sales teams to automatically generate valuable insights. For example, Salesforce’s Einstein AI technology can predict which customers are most likely to generate more revenue, and which are most likely to take their custom elsewhere. Armed with knowledge like this, salespeople can focus their time and energy where it matters most.

Then there’s the widespread use of chatbots, which is helping organizations boost sales, drive revenue, and grow their audience. In one example, UK retailer Marks & Spencer added a virtual digital assistant function to its website to help customers solve common issues – a move which has reportedly saved millions of pounds worth of sales that would otherwise have been lost as frustrated customers bounce off the site.

3. Assessing and improving customer service
When it comes to call center operations, automation is nothing new; simple inquiries have been met with automated menu services for some time. But one tech company says it can help companies automatically judge the quality of human customer service calls. Transcosmos’s AI solution automatically assesses the quality of service given “at speed with human accuracy” – and can detect inappropriate and problematic customer service with more than twice the accuracy of a voice recognition system.

4. Improving product development processes
Generative design is a cutting-edge field that uses AI to augment the creative process. With generative design software, you simply input your design goals and other requirements and let the software explore all the possible designs that could fulfill those specifications – meaning you can quickly generate multiple designs from a single idea. The software does all the heavy lifting of working out what works and what doesn’t, saving many, many hours of time. Plus, you avoid the expense of creating prototypes that don’t deliver.
5. Automating content generation
This article wasn’t written by a robot. But it could have been. Because, thanks to AI, machines are now capable of generating engaging, informative text – to the extent that organizations like Forbes are producing articles with the help of AI.
From writing product descriptions and web copy, to industry articles and reports, there’s a range of AI-driven content tools available. For example, e-commerce leader Alibaba has come up with a tool called AI-CopyWriter that’s capable of generating more than 20,000 lines of copy in just one second.
6. Enhancing the manufacturing process
The use of robots in manufacturing is well established. But the latest generation of robotic systems is capable of working alongside humans and interacting seamlessly (and safely) with the human workforce. This has given rise to the term “cobots"" or collaborative robots.
Thanks to AI technologies like machine vision, cobots are aware of the humans around them and can react accordingly – for example, by adjusting their speed or reversing to avoid humans – meaning workflows can be designed to get the very best out of both humans and robots. Easy to program, fast to set up, and with an average price tag of around $24,000 each, cobots are a viable option to help smaller and mid-sized firms compete with larger manufacturers.
7. Refining recruitment 
HR may not seem an obvious match with AI. Yet AI is fast finding many uses in HR processes, including recruitment. For large employers like Unilever, which recruits around 30,000 people a year and handles 1.8 million applications, finding ways to streamline and improve the recruitment process is essential. That’s why Unilever partnered with AI recruitment specialist Pymetrics to create an online platform capable of conducting initial assessments of candidates in their own home.

KANSAS CITY, MO (August 26, 2020) – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the National Science Foundation announced today they are establishing seven new artificial intelligence institutes across the country to accelerate research, expand America's workforce and transform society for the future. Advancements in AI research have broad applications that can create economic, health and safety benefits across multiple industries and all levels of education.  This national network of Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes represents the nation's most significant federal investment in AI research and workforce development to date. The $20 million investment in each of five NSF AI institutes and two USDA-NIFA AI Institutes is just the beginning, with more institute announcements anticipated in the coming years.  “This major Federal investment in next generation agriculture signals our commitment to keeping American agricultural innovation on the leading edge of global science,” said USDA-NIFA Acting Director Parag Chitnis. “These future-focused centers of innovation will use the latest techniques from all corners of science including molecular science, engineering and robotics to seek solutions for myriad challenges facing agriculture, from crop improvement and animal welfare to labor shortages and farm safety.” By partnering U.S. scientific powerhouses USDA-NIFA and NSF with the U.S. Department of Homeland’s Security Science and Technology Directorate, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration and U.S. public research universities, these institutes will serve as hubs in a broader nationwide network determined to improve American competitiveness and transform key areas of society. The centers’ research will improve our national capacity in critical areas such as extreme weather preparedness, K-12 education advancement, next-generation workforce development and agricultural resilience and sustainability. Here are the specific focus areas: USDA-NIFA AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems, led by a team at the University of California, Davis, integrates a holistic view of the food system with AI and bioinformatics to understand biological data and processes, addressing issues of molecular breeding to optimize traits for yield, crop quality, and pest/disease resistance; agricultural production, food processing and distribution, and nutrition. Major emphasis is on inclusive education and outreach approaches to build a diverse, next-generation workforce.  USDA-NIFA AI Institute for Future Agricultural Resilience, Management and Sustainability, sponsored by USDA-NIFA and led by a team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will advance AI research in computer vision, machine learning, soft object manipulation and intuitive human-robot interaction to solve major agricultural challenges including labor shortages, efficiency and welfare in animal agriculture, environmental resilience of crops, and the need to safeguard soil health. The institute features a new joint Computer Science+Agriculture degree and global clearinghouse to foster collaboration in AI-driven agriculture research. NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography, led by a team at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, assembles researchers in AI, atmospheric and ocean science, and risk communication to develop user-driven trustworthy AI that addresses pressing environmental concerns. With AI certificate programs aimed at workforce skills, the institute is providing the research and training necessary for the future workforce to deliver the advances needed to deal with environmental hazard challenges. NSF AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning, led by a team at the University of Texas, Austin, focuses on major theoretical challenges in AI, including next-generation algorithms for deep learning, neural architecture optimization and efficient robust statistics. The institute's partners include large industrial technology companies and the city of Austin. Major online coursework and research initiatives will bring current AI tools to thousands of students and professionals across the country. ​​ NSF AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming, led by a team at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is developing groundbreaking AI that helps both students and teachers work and learn together more effectively, engagingly and equitably. The vision is to develop “AI partners” that will observe, participate in and facilitate collaborative learning conversations by interacting naturally through speech, gesture, gaze and facial expression in real-world classrooms. NSF AI Institute for Molecular Discovery, Synthetic Strategy and Manufacturing (or the NSF Molecular Maker Lab Institute), led by a team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, focuses on development of new AI-enabled tools and serves as a training ground for the next generation of scientists with combined expertise in chemical synthesis and bioengineering. NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, led by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, incorporates workforce development, digital learning, outreach and knowledge transfer programs to advance physics knowledge -- from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the universe -- and galvanize AI research innovation to broaden societal impacts.  “The AI institutes being awarded today comprise large, multi-disciplinary, and multi-sector collaborations: they bring together consortia of dozens of universities and other organizations, ultimately spanning academia, government, and industry,” said Michael Kratsios, U.S. Chief Technology Officer. “In effect, over the next five years, some of the best minds in the country will be tackling some of the grandest challenges that we face, both in terms of new AI techniques as well as breakthroughs in fields of science and engineering and sectors of our economy. And along the way, they will nurture the future American workforce in AI research and practice.” Learn more about the USDA-NIFA AI Institutes at nifa.usda.gov and the NSF AI Institutes(link is external) and artificial intelligence research(link is external) by visiting nsf.gov(link is external).NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges. This research supports Value-Added Innovations, Sustainable Ag Intensification, and Food and Nutrition Translation themes outlined in the USDA Science Blueprint and moves us closer to meeting the goals outlined in USDA’s Agriculture Innovation Agenda.  ###

Advanced AI systems can solve the most complex business problems and create significant economic benefits for organizations. But coupling such systems with poor interpretability – also referred to as explainability – can create a recipe for disaster. End users often have no insight into how complex AI systems work, so they are commonly viewed as black boxes. They take information and parameters as inputs, perform calculations on them in an unknown fashion, and generate predictions, recommendations, and classifications that do not always make sense to end users. The black box phenomenon can lead to issues such as unrealistic expectations for AI capabilities, poorly informed decision making, or a lack of overall trust in AI systems. These issues can jeopardize adoption across an organization and potentially cause AI implementations to fail altogether. A recent survey by IDC shows that most global organizations report some failures among their AI projects – a quarter of them report up to a 50 percent failure rate – citing as contributing factors such things as the black box phenomenon and interpretability challenges. Despite these failures, many organizations continue to rely on AI to drive business decisions in the belief that it can exceed human capabilities. Examples include predicting asset and equipment failure in advance, optimizing supply chains and inventory, and detecting fraudulent activity. Organizations place big bets on AI to help solve business problems. What executives don’t realize is that it can adversely affect their business and end users when AI systems are not interpretable. In this article, we outline the issues that can be addressed through implementing interpretable AI, the challenges to AI interpretability, and how the C3 AI® Platform supports AI interpretability. Issues Interpretable AI Can Help Address Interpretability provides the reasoning behind AI-generated predictions or recommendations to allow users to discern whether AI is “right for the right reasons.” Under this umbrella, interpretability provides benefits and reduces the risk of failure caused by the black box phenomenon on three fronts:  Interpretability sheds light on the inner workings of black-box AI systems. Interpretability augments the predictions and recommendations already provided, spelling out additional insights. Interpretability helps identify potential issues with how the AI system was designed.  Here are some issues and key questions interpretable AI can help address: Is your system learning the correct objective? Interpretability is critical to ensure that AI systems are being asked to address the correct business objectives. If an AI system has poorly defined objectives, it will learn the wrong criteria, leading to unwanted outcomes and decisions. In one case, researchers applied AI to simulate a mechanism that would help decelerate fighter jets as they landed on an aircraft carrier. The AI system counterintuitively exploited the fact that maximizing the aircraft’s landing force – essentially crashing it into the carrier’s deck – would lead to an overflow and flip the speed instantly to zero, thus perfectly solving for the deceleration problem. But this only optimized for stopping the aircraft as quickly as possible while disregarding aircraft safety altogether, that clearly was meant to be a critical component of the broader objective function. Using interpretability, researchers could uncover the system’s inner workings, identify the fact that it was using the wrong objective function, and ultimately correct this problem. Is your system trustworthy? AI interpretability is key to developing user trust and is an integral part of change management across organizations. To develop trust in AI systems, users expect the systems to establish logical relationships between the input data and the resulting predictions. Interpretability is paramount in presenting and describing the relationships and associations between the input data and model output. Interpretable models showcase where predictive power comes from, allowing subject matter experts to determine whether that association is logically correct according to their human knowledge and experience. In one example, researchers exploring intelligible models for health care developed a model to predict pneumonia risk across a group of patients. Through interpretability, researchers identified that the AI model counterintuitively correlated having asthma with a lower risk of dying from pneumonia. Upon investigation, researchers found that patients with asthma tended to receive treatment earlier, hence lowering the risk of severe pneumonia. The AI system did not know about this interrelation. Researchers improved the model by adding additional features, subsequently demonstrating that a positive correlation exists between the level of treatment a patient receives and the lower risk of death caused by pneumonia. This AI system was untrustworthy until interpretability surfaced illogical discrepancies between the input data and model predictions, ultimately helping to fix it. Does your system bring new insights? Intelligible models performing beyond human capabilities can identify previously unforeseen patterns, motivating user adoption of AI. This was seen when AlphaGo beat top world players in a Go tournament. AlphaGo showcased what some described as beautiful and creative moves that Go players now are trying out as new strategies. Interpretability helps explain how such strategies or knowledge came to be, leading to fresh takes and improved capabilities for existing solutions. Is your system ethical? AI interpretability is an essential part of ethical AI, ensuring auditability and traceability of outcomes. Auditing model decisions allows assessment of liability and avoids legal or ethical problems that can have a huge impact on people’s lives. For example, in January 2020, the Detroit Police Department deployed a facial recognition system to identify a thief. A suspect was arrested and held for 30 hours based solely on the system’s recommendation. Charges were dropped after later comparisons between the security camera footage used and the suspect made it clear it was a false positive. If the police had been told that the identification was based only on a skin color match, the improper arrest may not have occurred. Incidents such as this will lead to needed strict ethical guidelines for AI systems, as already is being seen in the EU’s recent GDPR legislation, that requires any decision-making system to provide citizens with an explanation. Researchers have proposed some high-level criteria for successfully integrating interpretability:  The interpretable AI system needs to showcase what factors led to the outcomes – in other words, what data led to the prediction or recommendation.  The interpretable AI system must permit ongoing effective control through interactive machine learning such as adding new training examples or correcting erroneous labels.  Challenges to AI Interpretability The first challenge comes from potential conflicts between predictive and descriptive accuracy within AI-enabled solutions. Improving descriptive accuracy – interpretability – can come at the expense of predictive accuracy and, therefore, model performance.  Simple AI systems that use linear regression or tree-based models are more interpretable and understandable than their more complicated, deep learning counterparts, but simpler systems tend to provide worse predictive accuracy. This often leads to a trade-off in AI system design. But both interpretability and predictive accuracy can be achieved using model-based and post-hoc approaches. The model-based approach improves descriptive accuracy by: Favoring simpler models  The C3 AI Readiness application helps improve the mission capability and readiness of military aircraft, such as helicopters. In one deployment of C3 AI Readiness, the application predicts when specific parts of the aircraft are at risk of failure – hence require maintenance – using gradient-boosted trees. For model training, we leverage data from maintenance logs and onboard sensors. By using a tree-based model – with high interpretability – maintainers now have more targeted information to troubleshoot aircraft and prioritize maintenance. In another case, we configured the C3 AI Predictive Maintenance application to reduce downtime in a drug manufacturing plant by predicting failure of clean-in-place (CIP) systems. These complicated pieces of equipment show little consistency over time, making it hard to model normal behavior. In this example, the application predicts the risk of failure after each cycle level using linear models. For model training, we construct sensor-based features; instead of using raw sensor values, we measure the relative deviation from the expected set points. Thanks to model interpretability, technicians can quickly check specific problematic parts to reduce the risk of overall machine failure.  Favoring features that rely on domain-specific and business-driven rules  In the C3 AI Readiness example mentioned earlier, the critical step was finding the right representation of the input data. Working with 1,800 features from disparate sensor and maintenance systems, the team determined that crafted features – some as simple as time-since-last-maintenance or average turbine speed – drove model performance while algorithm hyperparameter optimization provided only incremental gains. Within the C3 AI Inventory Optimization application, supply chain customers can designate the optimal time and quantity buffer to be used for future procurement of certain SKUs within specific facilities. Because the application employs a simulation-based optimization approach, it is heavily dependent on domain knowledge and the physical dynamics of a supply chain. In order to maintain the optimization’s robustness while still providing sufficient insights to end users, the different uncertainty sources are perturbated, causing some variation in the output. This analysis of the sensitivity caused by the perturbations directly helps to derive the importance of each uncertainty factor.  The post-hoc approach explains predictions and recommendations through generating feature contributions. This is typically accomplished using third-party libraries that either A) apply a surrogate model to approximate the predictions of the underlying model, or B) directly extract contributions from the model structure itself (for example, decision paths in tree-based methods or model parameters in linear regression algorithms). We describe some of these frameworks in the final section of this post.  A second challenge of interpretable AI systems is that they need to build trust at two levels: For the model itself, known as global interpretability, and for each individual prediction, known as local interpretability. The former prevents biased models, while the latter guarantees actionable and sensical predictions. Data scientists can use these considerations to evaluate their AI systems in accordance with the needs of end users.  This figure illustrates when global and local interpretability are most needed as the human perception of problem complexity and the trust needed in the system vary. Global interpretability always plays an important role because AI developers need to ensure that the model is learning the right objective and is unbiased. Local interpretability is critical when problems are hard to solve, and when humans need to be in the loop to make high-stakes decisions. This is the case in anti-money-laundering applications, where large amounts of money are involved, or in precision medicine, where people’s lives are at stake. Each use case has its own unique needs and requires thorough examination to see what works best. Interpretability on the C3 AI Platform The C3 AI Platform leverages some of the widely used and most impactful post-hoc interpretability frameworks during development and production stages of AI systems:  TreeInterpreter ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5) SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)  These commonly used techniques can be configured using ML Pipelines in the C3 AI ML Studio, a low-code, lightweight interface for configuring multi-step machine learning models. Users can call a single and consistent API to interpret model predictions and do not need to worry either about specific interfaces or writing custom code. These techniques are interchangeable, increasing user flexibility to pick the best diagnosis tool. TreeInterpreter is an interpretability framework focused on tree-based models such as random forest. This framework allows for the decomposition of decision trees into a series of decision paths from the root of the tree to the leaf. This makes interpretation of the model’s output straightforward, given the inherent interpretability of a decision tree. For example, we applied TreeInterpreter in a predictive maintenance application to detect boiler leakages in power plants. The underlying model in this AI system is a random forest classifier that predicts the likelihood of leakage. The features represent sound intensities of microphone sensors located at different points on the boiler. The spatial coordinates of the microphones are weighted with the corresponding feature contributions of each prediction to localize the potential leakage. Maintainers are preventing days of downtime by inspecting specific sections of the boiler to confirm and fix leakages more quickly. ELI5 is another interpretability framework that supports widely used machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM. We have leveraged ELI5 in financial services, helping financial institutions detect and prevent money laundering. Here we used a gradient-boosted classifier to learn suspicious patterns in transactions from historical cases. For regulatory and transparency reasons, our application needs to provide compliance investigators with prediction-level interpretability insights to help them make more informed decisions about client risk. Low-level features are usually neither useful nor actionable, so we constructed mapping to meaningful, high-level categories that aggregate individual feature contributions into money laundering typologies and scenarios such as shell accounts, trade finance, or structuring. This drove faster user adoption and supported regulatory approval. Lastly, the SHAP framework is the most general approach. We used SHAP in a securities lending application to predict securities that would be shorted by the bank’s clients. Automatically and quickly estimating client demand increased inventory visibility for each stock, allowing the bank to broker more deals and increase revenue. The feature contributions helped build confidence in the machine learning model amongst trading desk personnel, who are now better equipped to issue shares of securities as loans to clients. AI interpretability is a hot research area today and is evolving fast. At C3.ai, we contribute to global research and make use of the latest interpretability frameworks across our software stack to deliver value and trustworthy AI applications for our clients.

Big buildings move slowly
It is a truth universally acknowledged that artificial intelligence will change everything. In the next few decades, the world will become intelligible, and in many ways, intelligent. But insiders suggest that the world of big office real estate will get there more slowly - at least in the world’s major cities.


The real estate industry in London, New York, Hong Kong and other world cities moves in cycles of 10 or 15 years. This is the period of the lease. After a tense renewal negotiation, and perhaps a big row, landlord and tenant are generally happy to leave each other alone until the next time. This does not encourage innovation, or investment in new services in between the renewals. There are alternatives to this arrangement. In Scandinavia, for instance, lease durations are shorter - often three years or so. This encourages a more collegiate working relationship, where landlord and tenant are more like business partners.

Another part of the pathology of major city real estate is the landmark building. With the possible exception of planners, everyone likes grand buildings: certainly, architects, developers, and the property managers and CEOs of big companies do. A mutual appreciation society is formed, which is less concerned about the impact on a business than about appearing in the right magazines, and winning awards.

PROMOTED
Bottom-up demand
Outside the big cities, priorities are different. To attract a major tenant to Dixons’ old headquarters in Hemel Hempstead, for instance, the landlord will need to seduce with pragmatism rather than glamour.

Tim Oldman is the founder and CEO of Leesman, a firm which helps clients understand how to manage their workspaces in the best interests of their staff and their businesses. He says there is plenty of opportunity for AI to enhance real estate, and much of the impetus for it to happen will come from the employees who work in office buildings rather than the developers who design and build them. Employees, the actual users of buildings, will be welcoming AI into many corners of their lives in the coming years and decades, often without realising it. They will expect the same convenience and efficiency at work that they experience at home and when travelling. They will demand more from their employers and their landlords.

Responsive buildings
Buildings should be smart, and increasingly they will be. Smart buildings will be a major component of smart cities, a phenomenon which we have been hearing about since the end of the last century, and which will finally start to become a reality in the coming decade, enabled in part by 5G.


1/100:01Forbes Innovation

Buildings should know what load they are handling at any given time. They should provide the right amount of heat and light: not too little and not too much. The air conditioning should not go off at 7pm when an after-hours conference is in full flow. They should monitor noise levels, and let occupants know where the quiet places are, if they ask. They should manage the movement of water and waste intelligently. All this and much more is possible, given enough sensors, and a sensible approach to the use of data.
Imagine we are colleagues who usually work in different buildings. Today we are both in the head office, and our calendars show that we have scheduled a meeting. An intelligent building could suggest workspaces near to each other. Tim Oldman calls this “assisted serendipity”.
Generation Z is coming into the workplace. They are not naive about data and the potential for its mis-use, but they are more comfortable with sharing it in return for a defined benefit. Older generations are somewhat less trusting. We expect our taxi firm to know when we will be exiting the building, and to have a car waiting. But we are suspicious if the building wants to know our movements. Employees in Asian countries show more trust than those in France and Germany, say, with the US and the UK in between.
RPA and helpdesks
Robotic process automation, or RPA, can make mundane office interactions smoother and more efficient. But we will want it to be smart. IT helpdesks should not be rewarded for closing a ticket quickly, but for solving your problem in a way which means you won’t come back with the same problem a week later – and neither will anyone else.
That said, spreadsheet-driven efficiency is not always the best solution. Face-to-face “genius bar”-style helpdesks routinely deliver twice the level of customer satisfaction as the same service delivered over the phone, even when they use exactly the same people, the same technology, and the same infrastructure. There is a time and place for machines, and a time and a place for humans.
Predictive maintenance 
Rolls Royce is said to make more money from predictive maintenance plans than it makes by selling engines. Sensors in their engines relay huge volumes of real-time data about each engine component to headquarters in Derby. If a fault is developing, they can often have the relevant spare part waiting at the next airport before the pilot even knows there’s a problem. One day, buildings will operate this way too.
The technology to enable these services is not cheap today, and an investment bank or a top management consultancy can offer their employees features which will not be available for years to workers in the garment industry in the developing world. There will be digital divides, but the divisions will be constantly changing, with laggards catching up, and sometimes overtaking, as they leapfrog legacy infrastructures. China is a world leader in smartphone payment apps partly because its banking infrastructure was so poor.
Accelerated by Covid
Covid will bring new pressure to bear on developers and landlords. Employees will demand biosecurity measures such as the provision of air which is fresh and filtered air, not re-circulated. They may want to know how many people are in which parts of the building, to help them maintain physical distancing. This means more sensors, and more data.
The great unplanned experiment in working from home which we are all engaged in thanks to covid-19 will probably result in a blended approach to office life in the future. Working from home suits some people very well, reducing commuting time, and enabling them to spend more time with their families. But others miss the decompression that commuting allows, and many of us don’t have good working environments at home. In the winter, many homes are draughty, and the cost of heating them all day long can be considerable.
Tim Oldman thinks the net impact on demand for office space will probably be a slight reduction overall, and a new mix of locations. There are indications that companies will provide satellite offices closer to where their people live, perhaps sharing space with workers from other firms. This is the same principle as the co-working facilities provided by WeWork and Regus, but whereas those companies have buildings in city centres, there will be a new demand for space on local High Streets.
Retail banks have spotted this as an opportunity, a way of using the branch network which they have been shrinking as people shift to online banking. Old bank branches can be transformed into safe and comfortable satellite offices, and restore some life to tired suburban streets. Companies will have to up their game to co-ordinate this more flexible approach, and landlords will need to help them. They will need to collect and analyse information about where their people are each day, and develop and refine algorithms to predict where they will be tomorrow.
Some employers will face a crisis of trust as we emerge from the pandemic. Millions of us have been been trusted to work from home, and to the surprise of more than a few senior managers, it has mostly worked well. Snatching back the laptop and demanding that people come straight back to the office is not a good idea. Companies will adopt different approaches, and some will be more successful than others. Facebook has told its staff they can work from wherever they want, but their salary will be adjusted downwards if they leave the Bay Area. Google has simply offered every employee $1,000 to make their home offices more effective.
The way we work is being changed by lessons learned during the pandemic, and by the deployment of AI throughout the economy. Builders and owners of large office buildings must not get left behind.

Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) is interesting and all, but what does it mean to me personally? Will I still have a job? What does the future look like?Truth is, no one knows for sure. But there are a few indicators that help us envision where the Future of Work may lead when it comes to AI. What does AI mean to our livelihoods?AI in the Future“The Role Digital Plays in the HR IT Landscape “— Future of Work MediaWhat jobs will AI replace?Some jobs are relatively easily replaced by AI, not because they are easy tasks, but more so because they are formulated and run by a set of rules and regulations, which can be learned from, adapted to, and used by an AI.There is lots of speculation on which roles will be replaced, and perhaps some are far fetched, but I reviewed a few legitimate and realistic options that I found on HubSpot.Telemarketing — unfortunately, this role already feels like it has been taken over by robots! Surprisingly though, even with automation, the conversion rate is barely impacted.Bookkeeping Clerks — cheaper equivalents such as Quickbooks or Microsoft office software does a lot of the work for you, and there are standardized bookkeeping practices for the AI to follow.Compensation and Benefits Managers — automation here is being increasingly adopted as companies across the globe need to reduce costs.Receptionists — there have been scheduling applications and automated message receivers for years, but the number of businesses operating online, along with the reduced in-person office operations for this year and 2021, the need for this role has dramatically decreased.Couriers — it seems only a matter of time before drones and robots take over, and with automated driving, in test phases, this appears to be edging closer.AI JobsProofreaders — in my experience Grammarly and these types of applications can do the job with less error and more quickly than a person!Computer Support Specialists — with step-by-step guides, it will be easy to program software to answer simple questions. Hmm, machines helping to fix themselves, sound familiar?Market Research Analysts — technology can manage and organize more data than any human and therefore is capable of deriving insights more efficiently.Even in my limited knowledge, this list covers only a segment of jobs that are considered replaceable, and it is evident that there is an opportunity to simplify and replace the role responsibilities with automation or machine learning beyond these.The larger impact is however that some jobs are unlikely to even exist in the coming years because of reduced demand and the non necessity of them.Which jobs will be gone by 2030?Automation, AI, and self-determined processes have already begun to replace some of these roles per Career Addict.Job Loss from AI — ForbesWe have all influenced the transition or experienced the impact of the following:Travel Agents — most people book online themselves these days directly through the companies or hotel web services.Cashiers — it is common to use self-service checkouts, and some new retail models no longer have any personnel in store.Librarians — most content is online and while there is a great benefit to studying at the library for students, a self-check-in and check-out of the building can be automated and online books make re-filing unnecessary.Bank Tellers — most services are available through the ATMs and tellers are a residual vestigial service that we have continued for the elder demographic. Most business services are not available in branch and only through a central remote office.Textile Workers — machinery can replace even the most intricate work requirements these days.Postal Couriers, The Print Industry, Sports Referees and Umpires…There are roles that may well stay around, not from necessity, but as a vestigial and sentimental course of action, such as librarians or bank tellers. But eventually, anywhere there are rules and regulations for the AI to follow, job loss is likely to be experienced.Trending AI Articles:1.

Nicholas Mattei, an assistant professor of computer science who specializes in artificial intelligence, is the recipient of two recent awards.
Mattei received an IBM University Research Award for research that will help the next generation of AI technologies to learn, adapt and decide in complex environments.  He was also selected as one of only 14 researchers in the world to deliver an Early Career Spotlight Talk at the International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI), to be held in Kyoto, Japan (or virtually) in January 2021.
The one-year IBM University Award, valued at $40,000, will allow Mattei and his team to advance their research work on providing machines with the capability to combine features of symbolic and formal reasoning with data interpretation and machine learning in order to make better, more transparent, and ethical decisions.
While modern AI systems have demonstrated amazing performance in a number of domains including image processing, text translation, and simple question answering, Mattei said, many of the systems developed for these applications are narrow in scope and often don’t leverage multiple types of reasoning and learning for particular applications.
“The complex tasks that we often ask modern AI decision making algorithms to perform, expose a number of limitations of current AI systems including the lack of deep understanding of information coming from data, the absence of common sense reasoning, the difficulty in dealing with causality, and the inability to learn general concepts from small amounts of data,” he said.
Mattei said the goal of this project is to advance basic research in computer science that will hopefully have impacts in a variety of areas that rely on AI enabled decision making.
At the IJCAI Conference in Japan, Mattei will present his paper “Closing the Loop: Bringing Humans into Empirical Computational Social Choice and Preference Reasoning.”
Presenters are by invitation based on nominations from the IJCAI program committee. The organization started the Early Career Spotlight track in 2016 to introduce the work of some of the world’s most active early career researchers in AI.
“The paper is a summary of my work in what’s called preference reasoning and computational social choice.  In preference reasoning we want to understand, mathematically, how to model human preferences in terms of desires, constraints, complementarities, and other features.
“We then use these formal models of preference to feed into algorithms for group decision making / social choice. For instance, selecting matchings for ride sharing, allocating things like computing resources to individuals, or even picking proposals to fund.”

This technology has the potential to transform everything from transportation to entertainment to health care.The institute is one of five that the NSF announced Wednesday as part of a $100 million, five-year, national investment in the advancement of artificial intelligence research and workforce development.“In effect, over the next five years, some of the best minds in the country will be tackling some of the grandest challenges that we face, both in terms of new AI techniques as well as breakthroughs in fields of science and engineering and sectors of our economy,” said Michael Kratsios, U.S. Chief Technology Officer. “And along the way, they will nurture the future American workforce in AI research and practice.”Dr. Jay Golden, president of Wichita State, says this partnership and the research that will come from it are a direct fit with WSU’s goal of focusing on technology’s key role in diversifying the economy and further exemplifies our growing reputation as a national leader for innovation and research.“This institute is an important early milestone for our newly launched National Institute for Digital Transformation and will serve as an important driver in our priorities to diversify Kansas' economy and provide applied learning opportunities and careers for our students.""Dr. Kaushik Sinha, an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Wichita State, will work on a team that includes researchers from the University of Texas, Austin, where the institute will be based; the University of Washington, and Microsoft Research.Sinha was invited to join the team in its early stage of formation because of his expertise in theoretical machine learning. This field includes research in next-generation algorithms for deep learning, neural architecture optimization, and efficient robust statistics.“The primary focus of the AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning is to solve some of these fundamental questions over the next five years to ensure continued success of Machine Learning and AI over the next decade,” Sinha said.“Dr. Sinha has been important in forming our computer science, computing and data science degrees,” said Dr. Gergely Záruba, chair of WSU’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department. “This work will enable us to focus even more efforts on providing cutting-edge education and research-exposure to our undergraduate and graduate students.”Research opportunities for undergrad, grad studentsWichita State’s share of the grant is $700,000 over five years. According to Sinha, the grant will create many opportunities for students to participate in research. Graduate students will be funded from this grant and will work under the supervision of Sinha on the foundational machine learning research problems. Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to participate in theoretical or empirical research projects directed by faculty at their respective universities for a semester or a year.“Expanding our efforts in computing, data science and artificial intelligence is one of my biggest priorities,” said Dr. Dennis Livesay, dean of the College of Engineering at Wichita State University. “Dr. Sinha’s accomplishment, along with other recent computing-related research grants, highlights that our faculty and programs are garnering significant national recognition.”Once a year, IFML researchers will meet for a week-long retreat in Kansas where they will deliver public technical talks aimed at graduate students and faculty. Sinha believes this will provide Wichita state faculty and students the opportunity to learn about current technological advances in computer science and AI from world-renowned researchers.In addition, IFML will create opportunities for high school students to get exposure to AI as a discipline and career path. High schools often face challenges in providing upper-level electives in computer science because of the difficulty in recruiting qualified computer science teachers.To address this, IFML will develop a month-long mini course in “Introductory AI” that will be taught remotely by IFML-trained math and computer science teachers across Kansas, Texas and Washington. Five high school computer science/math teachers from the Wichita area will be invited annually to the Wichita State campus for a three-day summer workshop where the teachers will be given training in implementing the AI mini-course content. Sinha predicts this will ultimately boost enrollment in computer science undergraduate programs.Wichita State is distinctive for opening pathways to applied learning, applied research and career opportunities, alongside unsurpassed classroom, laboratory and online education. The university's beautiful 330-acre main campus is a supportive, rapidly expanding learn-work-live-play environment, where students gain knowledge and credentials to prepare for fulfilling lives and careers. Students enjoy a wide selection of day, evening and summer courses in more than 200 areas of study at the main campus and other locations throughout the metro area and online. WSU's approximately 16,000 students come from every state in the U.S. and more than 100 other countries. Wichita State's Innovation Campus is an interconnected community of partnership buildings, laboratories and mixed-use areas where students, faculty, staff, entrepreneurs and businesses have access to the university's vast resources and technology.

By: Stephen M. Hahn, M.D., Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
I frequently emphasize the importance of data in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s work as a science-based regulatory agency, and the need to “unleash the power of data” through sophisticated mechanisms for collection, review and analysis so that it may become preventive, action-oriented information. 
As one example of this commitment, I would like to tell you about cross-cutting work the agency is undertaking to leverage our use of artificial intelligence (AI) as part of the FDA’s New Era of Smarter Food Safety initiative. This work promises to equip the FDA with important new ways to apply available data sources to strengthen our public health mission. The ultimate goal is to see if AI can improve our ability to quickly and efficiently identify products that may pose a threat to public health. 

 

Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.

One area in which the FDA is assessing the use of AI is in the screening of imported foods. Americans want to enjoy a diverse and available food supply. They also want their food to be safe, whether it’s domestically produced or imported from abroad. 
So we launched a pilot program in the spring of 2019 to learn the added benefits of using AI, specifically machine learning (ML), in our import-screening processes. Machine learning is a type of AI that makes it possible to rapidly analyze data, automatically identifying connections and patterns in data that people or even our current rules-based screening system cannot see.  
The first phase of this pilot was a “proof of concept” to validate the approach we’re taking. We decided to test this approach on imported seafood to assess the utility of using AI/ML to better target seafood at the border that may be unsafe.  
Why seafood? Because the U.S. imports so much of it. Upwards of 94 percent of the seafood Americans consume each year is imported. 
Strengthening Our Predictive Capabilities, a Proof of Concept  
We embarked on the proof of concept by training the ML screening tool, using years of retrospective data from past seafood shipments that were refused entry or subjected to additional scrutiny, such as a field exam, label exam or laboratory analysis of a sample. This gave us an idea of how much our surveillance efforts might be improved using these technologies.  
The results are exciting, suggesting that this approach has real potential to be a tool that expedites the clearance of lower risk seafood shipments, and identifies those that are higher risk. In fact, this is great news. The proof of concept demonstrated that AI/ML could almost triple the likelihood that we will identify a shipment containing products of public health concern. 
The implementation team is now working to apply the AI/ML model algorithm to field conditions as part of the second phase of this work, an in-field pilot again focusing on imported seafood, and that’s where we are now. As part of the in-field pilot, the model will be applied to the screening methods used to help FDA staff decide which shipments to examine and will then provide information about which food in the shipment to sample for laboratory testing. We will then compare the results to the recommendations made by our current system. 
We see this opportunity as a critical step in the FDA employing the power of AI across the spectrum of product and process challenges facing the agency. Our initial proof of concept results indicate that such innovative approaches hold great promise in further strengthening protections for consumers.
Unleashing the Power of Data to Keep Americans Safe 
The pilot taps into two important new initiatives at the FDA. In addition to the New Era of Smarter Food Safety, it also reflects the priorities embodied in our Technology Modernization Action Plan – or TMAP.
On July 13, the FDA released a blueprint for the New Era of Smarter Food Safety outlining how the agency plans to leverage new technologies and approaches to create a more digital, traceable and safer food system. 
When we developed the blueprint, we knew that AI technology could be a game changer in expanding the FDA’s predictive analytics capabilities, enabling us to mine data to anticipate and mitigate foodborne risks. The pilot is revealing the specific, immediate benefits that this technology could have in helping us ensure the safety of imported foods. 
The TMAP describes important actions we are taking to modernize our technology information systems — computer hardware, software, data, analytics, advanced technology tools and more — in ways that accelerate the FDA’s pursuit of our public health mission.
Additionally, the plan lays out how the agency intends to transform our computing and technology infrastructure to position the FDA to close the gap between rapid advances in product and process technology and the technology solutions needed to ensure those advances translate into meaningful results for American consumers and patients. The TMAP provides a foundation for the development of the FDA’s ongoing strategy around data itself — a strategy for the stewardship, security, quality control, analysis and real-time use of data — that will illuminate the brightest path and the best tools for the FDA to enhance and promote public health.  
While both of these initiatives were well underway before the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons learned during this time of crisis have underscored the need for more real-time, data-driven approaches to protecting public health.
Scaling a Mountain of Data
The pilot also gives us the opportunity to learn how to untether the knowledge we need from the huge volume of data we have from screening millions of import shipments every year. In 2019, the FDA screened nearly 15 million food shipments offered for import into our country for sale to American consumers. Last year, the U.S. imported about 15% of the food we consume and that percentage continues to increase.
The FDA has a massive amount of data about these shipments and about the companies that are producing and processing the food, offering it for import, and selling it in the U.S. marketplace. In fact, every year the FDA collects tens of millions of data points on imports alone, and we screen all the data associated with every shipment of food against the information in our internal databases. One of the major goals of our pilot is to assess the ability of AI/ML to more quickly, efficiently, and comprehensively take advantage of all the data and information residing in our systems.  
In fact, we believe that we can use the knowledge that ML provides to know where best to concentrate our resources to find potentially unsafe products. In addition to improved import surveillance resources, the intelligence that ML can extract from the stores of data the FDA collects can also inform decisions about which facilities we inspect, what foods are most likely to make people sick and other risk prioritization questions.  
The bottom line is this: times and technologies change, and the FDA is changing with them, but the goal remains the same – to do everything in our power to strengthen the way we protect public health.

Protect lives and help shape the future of AI at Booz Allen
From using data to support citizens during the heart of a pandemic to playing a key role in national security, the opportunities to do impactful, innovative work with artificial intelligence (AI) at Booz Allen are practically endless. “As we understand it, we’re the largest single provider of AI and data science services to the Federal Government,” says Joe Rohner, director of AI for defense. “Here, you’d have the chance to impact some of the most groundbreaking projects in the world.”
Graham Gilmer, Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) program manager, agrees. “We work with unique, important data sets that no one else can access. Our clients trust us with their most sensitive information, and in turn, we bring them the finest people and the best technology.”
Build AI Capabilities for National Security and Defense
The missions Booz Allen serves with their work in AI are of national and global importance. Booz Allen recently won a contract to support several of the most high-profile AI development efforts across the Department of Defense (DoD). Together, they’ll work with industry experts to source and integrate the most fitting AI technologies for an enormous variety of defense missions. “AI has transformational potential,” says Steve Escaravage, analytics and AI business leader. “On this project, we’ll combine our deep understanding of both mission and technology to help the JAIC develop and operationalize AI-enabled capabilities across the DoD.”
Help Transform Healthcare with AI
To support our nation during this challenging time, the Booz Allen team used AI and specialized modeling software to build a COVID-19 forecasting platform. The goal? To help states and cities make more informed decisions about how, where, and when to loosen social distancing restrictions while keeping their populations safe.
The platform also serves as a repository for models that predict the spread of the disease and related demand for equipment and services. “We have the expertise to directly impact people’s health and safety during the current pandemic and beyond,” says Lauren Neal, director of health AI.
By joining their team, you’ll not only get to solve some of the toughest challenges clients face in the health sector, you’ll work closely with them to create pilot solutions using new technology. “From computer vision to natural language processing, we implement and operationalize these emerging technologies to see them at work in the real world,” adds Lauren. “Between the brand-new tech and the real impact we’re having on big health challenges, you can say what we do is exclusively Booz Allen.”
Break New Ground with Quantum Computing
“Few people in the world understand what quantum computing is, let alone know how to use it,” says Isabella Martinez, a quantum computing software researcher. “Here at Booz Allen, we are lucky to have an entire team dedicated to the field.”
Their team of Ph.D. quantum computing researchers represents diverse skills and interests within the realm. They work with clients to identify which of their needs are met by AI and which may, someday, be better solved using quantum computing. The team includes hardware and software researchers who focus on everything from writing software for quantum computers to vetting others’ software to figuring out the correct composition of a quantum bit or qubit.
Team members also play a role in creating market reports and leading educational workshops. “We do what we do because we honestly believe this technology will lead to a global paradigm shift, especially when it comes to AI” says Isabella.
If you’re fascinated by the latest advances in AI and want to be part of a team that employs cutting-edge technologies to protect lives and make an impact, there’s a place for you at Booz Allen.

His focus was more prosaic. A computational neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Gallant worked for years to improve our understanding of how brains encode information — what regions become active, for example, when a person sees a plane or an apple or a dog — and how that activity represents the object being viewed.By the late 2000s, scientists could determine what kind of thing a person might be looking at from the way the brain lit up — a human face, say, or a cat. But Dr. Gallant and his colleagues went further. They figured out how to use machine learning to decipher not just the class of thing, but which exact image a subject was viewing. (Which photo of a cat, out of three options, for instance.)One day, Dr. Gallant and his postdocs got to talking. In the same way that you can turn a speaker into a microphone by hooking it up backward, they wondered if they could reverse engineer the algorithm they’d developed so they could visualize, solely from brain activity, what a person was seeing.The first phase of the project was to train the AI. For hours, Dr. Gallant and his colleagues showed volunteers in fMRI machines movie clips. By matching patterns of brain activation prompted by the moving images, the AI built a model of how the volunteers’ visual cortex, which parses information from the eyes, worked. Then came the next phase: translation. As they showed the volunteers movie clips, they asked the model what, given everything it now knew about their brains, it thought they might be looking at.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe experiment focused just on a subsection of the visual cortex. It didn’t capture what was happening elsewhere in the brain — how a person might feel about what she was seeing, for example, or what she might be fantasizing about as she watched. The endeavor was, in Dr. Gallant’s words, a primitive proof of concept.And yet the results, published in 2011, are remarkable.The reconstructed images move with a dreamlike fluidity. In their imperfection, they evoke expressionist art. (And a few reconstructed images seem downright wrong.) But where they succeed, they represent an astonishing achievement: a machine translating patterns of brain activity into a moving image understandable by other people — a machine that can read the brain.Dr. Gallant was thrilled. Imagine the possibilities when better brain-reading technology became available? Imagine the people suffering from locked-in syndrome, Lou Gehrig’s disease, the people incapacitated by strokes, who could benefit from a machine that could help them interact with the world?VideoReconstruction of viewed movies from human brain activity measured by fMRI (Nishimoto et al., 2011)CreditCredit...By Derrick SchultzHe was also scared because the experiment showed, in a concrete way, that humanity was at the dawn of a new era, one in which our thoughts could theoretically be snatched from our heads. What was going to happen, Dr. Gallant wondered, when you could read thoughts the thinker might not even be consciously aware of, when you could see people’s memories?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“That’s a real sobering thought that now you have to take seriously,” he told me recently.The ‘Google Cap’For decades, we’ve communicated with computers mostly by using our fingers and our eyes, by interfacing via keyboards and screens. These tools and the bony digits we prod them with provide a natural limit to the speed of communication between human brain and machine. We can convey information only as quickly (and accurately) as we can type or click.Voice recognition, like that used by Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, is a step toward more seamless integration of human and machine. The next step, one that scientists around the world are pursuing, is technology that allows people to control computers — and everything connected to them, including cars, robotic arms and drones — merely by thinking.Dr. Gallant jokingly calls the imagined piece of hardware that would do this a “Google cap”: a hat that could sense silent commands and prompt computers to respond accordingly.The problem is that, to work, that cap would need to be able to see, with some detail, what’s happening in the nearly 100 billion neurons that make up the brain.Technology that can easily peer through the skull, like the MRI machine, is far too unwieldy to mount on your head. Less bulky technology, like electroencephalogram, or E.E.G., which measures the brain’s electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, doesn’t provide nearly the same clarity. One scientist compares it to looking for the surface ripples made by a fish swimming underwater while a storm roils the lake.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOther methods of “seeing” into the brain might include magnetoencephalography, or M.E.G., which measures magnetic waves emanating outside the skull from neurons firing beneath it; or using infrared light, which can penetrate living tissue, to infer brain activity from changes in blood flow. (Pulse oximeters work this way, by shining infrared light through your finger.)What technologies will power the brain-computer interface of the future is still unclear. And if it’s unclear how we’ll “read” the brain, it’s even less clear how we’ll “write” to it.This is the other holy grail of brain-machine research: technology that can transmit information to the brain directly. We’re probably nowhere near the moment when you can silently ask, “Alexa, what’s the capital of Peru?” and have “Lima” materialize in your mind.Even so, solutions to these challenges are beginning to emerge. Much of the research has occurred in the medical realm, where, for years, scientists have worked incrementally toward giving quadriplegics and others with immobilizing neurological conditions better ways of interacting with the world through computers. But in recent years, tech companies — including Facebook, Microsoft and Elon Musk’s Neuralink — have begun investing in the field.Some scientists are elated by this infusion of energy and resources. Others worry that as this tech moves into the consumer realm, it could have a variety of unintended and potentially dangerous consequences, from the erosion of mental privacy to the exacerbation of inequality.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRafael Yuste, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, counts two great advances in computing that have transformed society: the transition from room-size mainframe computers to personal computers that fit on a desk (and then in your lap), and the advent of mobile computing with smartphones in the 2000s. Noninvasive brain-reading tech would be a third great leap, he says.“Forget about the Covid crisis,” Dr. Yuste told me. “What’s coming with this new tech can change humanity.”Dear BrainNot many people will volunteer to be the first to undergo a novel kind of brain surgery, even if it holds the promise of restoring mobility to those who’ve been paralyzed. So when Robert Kirsch, the chairman of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University, put out such a call nearly 10 years ago, and one person both met the criteria and was willing, he knew he had a pioneer on his hands.VideoCreditCredit...By Derrick SchultzThe man’s name was Bill Kochevar. He’d been paralyzed from the neck down in a biking accident years earlier. His motto, as he later explained it, was “somebody has to do the research.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt that point, scientists had already invented gizmos that helped paralyzed patients leverage what mobility remained — lips, an eyelid — to control computers or move robotic arms. But Dr. Kirsch was after something different. He wanted to help Mr. Kochevar move his own limbs.The first step was implanting two arrays of sensors over the part of the brain that would normally control Mr. Kochevar’s right arm. Electrodes that could receive signals from those arrays via a computer were implanted into his arm muscles. The implants, and the computer connected to them, would function as a kind of electronic spinal cord, bypassing his injury.Once his arm muscles had been strengthened — achieved with a regimen of mild electrical stimulation while he slept — Mr. Kochevar, who at that point had been paralyzed for over a decade, was able to feed himself and drink water. He could even scratch his nose.About two dozen people around the world who have lost the use of limbs from accidents or neurological disease have had sensors implanted on their brains. Many, Mr. Kochevar included, participated in a United States government-funded program called BrainGate. The sensor arrays used in this research, smaller than a button, allow patients to move robotic arms or cursors on a screen just by thinking. But as far as Dr. Kirsch knows, Mr. Kochevar, who died in 2017 for reasons unrelated to the research, was the first paralyzed person to regain use of his limbs by way of this technology.This fall, Dr. Kirsch and his colleagues will begin version 2.0 of the experiment. This time, they’ll implant six smaller arrays — more sensors will improve the quality of the signal. And instead of implanting electrodes directly in the volunteers’ muscles, they’ll insert them upstream, circling the nerves that move the muscles. In theory, Dr. Kirsch says, that will enable movement of the entire arm and hand.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe next major goal is to restore sensation so that people can know if they’re holding a rock, say, or an orange — or if their hand has wandered too close to a flame. “Sensation has been the longest ignored part of paralysis,” Dr. Kirsch told me.A few years ago, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh began groundbreaking experiments on that front with a man named Nathan Copeland who was paralyzed from the upper chest down. They routed sensory information from a robotic arm into the part of his cortex that dealt with his right hand’s sense of touch.Every brain is a living, undulating organ that changes over time. That’s why, before each of Mr. Copeland’s sessions, the AI has to recalibrate — to construct a new brain decoder. “The signals in your brain shift,” Mr. Copeland told me. “They’re not exactly the same every day.”And the results weren’t perfect. Mr. Copeland described them to me as “weird,” “electrical tingly” but also “amazing.” The sensory feedback was immensely important, though, in knowing that he’d actually grasped what he thought he’d grasped. And more generally, it demonstrated that a person could “feel” a robotic hand as his or her own, and that information coming from electronic sensors could be fed into the human brain.Preliminary as these experiments are, they suggest that the pieces of a brain-machine interface that can both “read” and “write” already exist. People cannot only move robotic arms just by thinking; machines can also, however imperfectly, convey information to the brain about what that arm encounters.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWho knows how soon versions of this technology will be available for kids who want to think-move avatars in video games or think-surf the web. People can already fly drones with their brain signals, so maybe crude consumer versions will appear in coming years. But it’s hard to overstate how life-changing such tech could be for people with spinal cord injuries or neurological diseases.Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco, who works on brain-based speech recognition, said that maintaining the ability to communicate can mean the difference between life or death. “For some people, if they have a means to continue to communicate, that may be the reason they decide to stay alive,” he told me. “That motivates us a lot in our work.”In a recent study, Dr. Chang and his colleagues predicted with up to 97 percent accuracy — the best rate yet achieved, they say — what words a volunteer had said (from about 250 words used in a predetermined set of 50 sentences) by using implanted sensors that monitored activity in the part of the brain that moves the muscles involved in speaking. (The volunteers in this study weren’t paralyzed; they were epilepsy patients undergoing brain surgery to address that condition, and the implants were not permanent.)Dr. Chang used sensor arrays similar to those Dr. Kirsch used, but a noninvasive method may not be too far away.Facebook, which funded Dr. Chang’s study, is working on a brain-reading helmet-like contraption that uses infrared light to peer into the brain. Mark Chevillet, the director of brain-computer interface research at Facebook Reality Labs, told me in an email that while full speech recognition remains distant, his lab will be able to decode simple commands like “home,” “select” and “delete” in “coming years.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThis progress isn’t solely driven by advances in brain-sensing technology — by the physical meeting point of flesh and machine. The AI matters as much, if not more.Trying to understand the brain from outside the skull is like trying to make sense of a conversation taking place two rooms away. The signal is often messy, hard to decipher. So it’s the same types of algorithms that now allow speech-recognition software to do a decent job of understanding spoken speech — including individual idiosyncrasies of pronunciation and regional accents — that may now enable brain-reading technology.Zap That UrgeNot all the applications of brain reading require something as complex as understanding speech, however. In some cases, scientists simply want to blunt urges.When Casey Halpern, a neurosurgeon at Stanford, was in college, he had a friend who drank too much. Another was overweight but couldn’t stop eating. “Impulse control is such a pervasive problem,” he told me.VideoCreditCredit...By Derrick SchultzAs a budding scientist, he learned about methods of deep brain stimulation used to treat Parkinson’s disease. A mild electric current applied to a part of the brain involved in movement could lessen tremors caused by the disease. Could he apply that technology to the problem of inadequate self control?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWorking with mice in the 2010s, he identified a part of the brain, called the nucleus accumbens, where activity spiked in a predictable pattern just before a mouse was about to gorge on high-fat food. He found he could reduce how much the mouse ate by disrupting that activity with a mild electrical current. He could zap the compulsion to gorge as it was taking hold in the rodents’ brains.Earlier this year, he began testing the approach in people suffering from obesity who haven’t been helped by any other treatment, including gastric-bypass surgery. He implants an electrode in their nucleus accumbens. It’s connected to an apparatus that was originally developed to prevent seizures in people with epilepsy.As with Dr. Chang or Dr. Gallant’s work, an algorithm first has to learn about the brain it’s attached to — to recognize the signs of oncoming loss of control. Dr. Halpern and his colleagues train the algorithm by giving patients a taste of a milkshake, or offering a buffet of the patient’s favorite foods, and then recording their brain activity just before the person indulges.He’s so far completed two implantations. “The goal is to help restore control,” he told me. And if it works in obesity, which afflicts roughly 40 percent of adults in the United States, he plans to test the gizmo against addictions to alcohol, cocaine and other substances.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Halpern’s approach takes as fact something that he says many people have a hard time accepting: that the lack of impulse control that may underlie addictive behavior isn’t a choice, but results from a malfunction of the brain. “We have to accept that it’s a disease,” he says. “We often just judge people and assume it’s their own fault. That’s not what the current research is suggesting we should do.”I must confess that of the numerous proposed applications of brain-machine interfacing I came across, Dr. Halpern’s was my favorite to extrapolate on. How many lives have been derailed by the inability to resist the temptation of that next pill or that next beer? What if Dr. Halpern’s solution was generalizable?What if every time your mind wandered off while writing an article, you could, with the aid of your concentration implant, prod it back to the task at hand, finally completing those life-changing projects you’ve never gotten around to finishing?These applications remain fantasies, of course. But the mere fact that such a thing may be possible is partly what prompts Dr. Yuste, the neurobiologist, to worry about how this technology could blur the boundaries of what we consider to be our personalities.Such blurring is already an issue, he points out. Parkinson’s patients with implants sometimes report feeling more aggressive than usual when the machine is “on.” Depressed patients undergoing deep brain stimulation sometimes wonder if they’re really themselves anymore. “You kind of feel artificial,” one patient told researchers. The machine isn’t implanting ideas in their minds, like Leonardo DiCaprio’s character in the movie “Inception,” but it is seemingly changing their sense of self.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat happens if people are no longer sure if their emotions are theirs, or the effects of the machines they’re connected to?Dr. Halpern dismisses these concerns as overblown. Such effects are part of many medical treatments, he points out, including commonly prescribed antidepressants and stimulants. And sometimes, as in the case of hopeless addiction, changing someone’s behavior is precisely the goal.Still the longer-term issue of what could happen when brain-writing technology jumps from the medical into the consumer realm is hard to forget. If my imagined focus enhancer existed, for example, but was very expensive, it could exacerbate the already yawning chasm between those who can afford expensive tutors, cars and colleges — and now grit-boosting technology — and those who cannot.“Certain groups will get this tech, and will enhance themselves,” Dr. Yuste told me. “This is a really serious threat to humanity.”The Brain Business“The idea that you have to drill holes in skulls to read the brains is nuts,” Mary Lou Jepsen, the chief executive and founder of Openwater, told me in an email. Her company is developing technology that, she says, uses infrared light and ultrasonic waves to peer into the body.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOther researchers are simply trying to make invasive approaches less invasive. A company called Synchron seeks to avoid opening the skull or touching brain tissue at all by inserting a sensor through the jugular vein in the neck. It’s currently undergoing a safety and feasibility trial.Dr. Kirsch suspects that Elon Musk’s Neuralink is probably the best brain-sensing tech in development. It requires surgery, but unlike the BrainGate sensor arrays, it’s thin, flexible and can adjust to the mountainous topography of the brain. The hope is that this makes it less caustic. It also has hairlike filaments that sink into brain tissue. Each filament contains multiple sensors, theoretically allowing the capture of more data than flatter arrays that sit at the brain’s surface. It can both read and write to the brain, and it’s accompanied by a robot that assists with the implantation.A major challenge to implants is that, as Dr. Gallant says, “your brain doesn’t like having stuff stuck in your brain.” Over time, immune cells may swarm the implant, covering it with goop.One way to try to avoid this is to drastically shrink the size of the sensors. Arto Nurmikko, a professor of engineering and physics at Brown University who’s part of the BrainGate effort, is developing what he calls “neurograins” — tiny, implantable silicon sensors no larger than a handful of neurons. They’re too small to have batteries, so they’re powered by microwaves beamed in from outside the skull.He foresees maybe 1,000 mini sensors implanted throughout the brain. He’s so far tested them only in rodents. But maybe we shouldn’t be so sure that healthy people wouldn’t volunteer for “mental enhancement” surgery. Every year, Dr. Nurmikko poses a hypothetical to his students: 1,000 neurograin implants that would allow students to learn and communicate faster; any volunteers?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Typically about half the class says, ‘Sure,’” he told me. “That speaks to where we are today.”Jose Carmena and Michel Maharbiz, scientists at Berkeley and founders of a start-up called Iota Biosciences, have their own version of this idea, which they call “neural dust”: tiny implants for the peripheral nervous system — arm, legs and organs besides the brain. “It’s like a Fitbit for your liver,” Dr. Carmena told me.They imagine treating inflammatory diseases by stimulating nerves throughout the body with these tiny devices. And where Dr. Nurmikko uses microwaves to power the devices, Dr. Carmena and Dr. Maharbiz foresee the use of ultrasound to beam power to them.VideoCreditCredit...By Derrick SchultzGenerally, they say, this kind of tech will be adopted first in the medical context and then move to the lay population. “We’re going to evolve to augmenting humans,” Dr. Carmena told me. “There’s no question.”But hype permeates the field, he warns. Sure, Elon Musk has argued that closer brain-machine integration will help humans compete with ever-more-powerful A.I.s. But in reality, we’re nowhere near a device that could, for example, help you master Kung Fu instantaneously like Keanu Reeves in “The Matrix.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat does the near future look like for the average consumer? Ramses Alcaide, the chief executive of a company called Neurable, imagines a world in which smartphones tucked in our pockets or backpacks act as processing hubs for data streaming in from smaller computers and sensors worn around the body. These devices — glasses that serve as displays, earbuds that whisper in our ears — are where the actual interfacing between human and computer will occur.Microsoft sells a headset called HoloLens that superimposes images onto the world, an idea called “augmented reality.” A company called Mojo Vision is working toward a contact lens that projects monochrome images directly onto the retina, a private computer display superimposed over the world.And Dr. Alcaide himself is working on what he sees as the linchpin to this vision, a device that, one day, may help you to silently communicate with all your digital paraphernalia. He was vague about the form the product will take — it isn’t market ready yet — except to note that it’s an earphone that can measure the brain’s electrical activity to sense “cognitive states,” like whether you’re hungry or concentrating.We already compulsively check Instagram and Facebook and email, even though we’re supposedly impeded by our fleshy fingers. I asked Dr. Alcaide: What will happen when we can compulsively check social media just by thinking?Ever the optimist, he told me that brain-sensing technology could actually help with the digital incursion. The smart earbud could sense that you’re working, for instance, and block advertisements or phone calls. “What if your computer knew you were focusing?” he told me. “What if it actually removes bombardment from your life?”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMaybe it’s no surprise that Dr. Alcaide has enjoyed the HBO sci-fi show “Westworld,” a universe where technologies that make communicating with computers more seamless are commonplace (though no one seems better off for it). Rafael Yuste, on the other hand, refuses to watch the show. He likens the idea to a scientist who studies Covid-19 watching a movie about pandemics. “It’s the last thing I want to do,” he says.‘A Human Rights Issue’To grasp why Dr. Yuste frets so much about brain-reading technology, it helps to understand his research. He helped pioneer a technology that can read and write to the brain with unprecedented precision, and it doesn’t require surgery. But it does require genetic engineering.Dr. Yuste infects mice with a virus that inserts two genes into the animals’ neurons. One prompts the cells to produce a protein that make them sensitive to infrared light; the other makes the neurons emit light when they activate. Thereafter, when the neurons fire, Dr. Yuste can see them light up. And he can activate neurons in turn with an infrared laser. Dr. Yuste can thus read what’s happening in the mouse brain and write to the mouse’s brain with an accuracy impossible with other techniques.And he can, it appears, make the mice “see” things that aren’t there.In one experiment, he trained mice to take a drink of sugar water after a series of bars appeared on a screen. He recorded which neurons in the visual cortex fired when the mice saw those bars. Then he activated those same neurons with the laser, but without showing them the actual bars. The mice had the same reaction: They took a drink.He likens what he did to implanting an hallucination. “We were able to implant into these mice perceptions of things that they hadn’t seen,” he told me. “We manipulated the mouse like a puppet.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThis method, called optogenetics, is a long way from being used in people. To begin with, we have thicker skulls and bigger brains, making it harder for infrared light to penetrate. And from a political and regulatory standpoint, the bar is high for genetically engineering human beings. But scientists are exploring workarounds — drugs and nanoparticles that make neurons receptive to infrared light, allowing precise activation of neurons without genetic engineering.The lesson in Dr. Yuste’s view is not that we’ll soon have lasers mounted on our heads that play us “like pianos,” but that brain-reading and possibly brain-writing technologies are fast approaching, and society isn’t prepared for them.“We think this is a human rights issue,” he told me.In a 2017 paper in the journal Nature, Dr. Yuste and 24 other signatories, including Dr. Gallant, called for the formulation of a human rights declaration that explicitly addressed “neurorights” and what they see as the threats posed by brain-reading technology before it becomes ubiquitous. Information taken from people’s brains should be protected like medical data, Dr. Yuste says, and not exploited for profit or worse. And just as people have the right not to self-incriminate with speech, we should have the right not to self-incriminate with information gleaned from our brains.Dr. Yuste’s activism was prompted in part, he told me, by the large companies suddenly interested in brain-machine research.Say you’re using your Google Cap. And like many products in the Google ecosystem, it collects information about you, which it uses to help advertisers target you with ads. Only now, it’s not harvesting your search results or your map location; it’s harvesting your thoughts, your daydreams, your desires.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWho owns those data?Or imagine that writing to the brain is possible. And there are lower-tier versions of brain-writing gizmos that, in exchange for their free use, occasionally “make suggestions” directly to your brain. How will you know if your impulses are your own, or if an algorithm has stimulated that sudden craving for Ben & Jerry’s ice cream or Gucci handbags?“People have been trying to manipulate each other since the beginning of time,” Dr. Yuste told me. “But there’s a line that you cross once the manipulation goes directly to the brain, because you will not be able to tell you are being manipulated.”When I asked Facebook about concerns around the ethics of big tech entering the brain-computer interface space, Mr. Chevillet, of Facebook Reality Labs, highlighted the transparency of its brain-reading project. “This is why we’ve talked openly about our B.C.I. research — so it can be discussed throughout the neuroethics community as we collectively explore what responsible innovation looks like in this field,” he said in an email.Ed Cutrell, a senior principal researcher at Microsoft, which also has a B.C.I. program, emphasized the importance of treating user data carefully. “There needs to be clear sense of where that information goes,” he told me. “As we are sensing more and more about people, to what extent is that information I’m collecting about you yours?”Some find all this talk of ethics and rights, if not irrelevant, then at least premature.Medical scientists working to help paralyzed patients, for example, are already governed by HIPAA laws, which protect patient privacy. Any new medical technology has to go through the Food and Drug Administration approval process, which includes ethical considerations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT(Ethical quandaries still arise, though, notes Dr. Kirsch. Let’s say you want to implant a sensor array in a patient suffering from locked-in syndrome. How do you get consent to conduct surgery that might change the person’s life for the better from someone who can’t communicate?)Leigh Hochberg, a professor of engineering at Brown University and part of the BrainGate initiative, sees the companies now piling into the brain-machine space as a boon. The field needs these companies’ dynamism — and their deep pockets, he told me. Discussions about ethics are important, “but those discussions should not at any point derail the imperative to provide restorative neurotechnologies to people who could benefit from them,” he added.Ethicists, Dr. Jepsen told me, “must also see this: The alternative would be deciding we aren’t interested in a deeper understanding of how our minds work, curing mental disease, really understanding depression, peering inside people in comas or with Alzheimer’s, and enhancing our abilities in finding new ways to communicate.”There’s even arguably a national security imperative to plow forward. China has its own version of BrainGate. If American companies don’t pioneer this technology, some think, Chinese companies will. “People have described this as a brain arms race,” Dr. Yuste said.Not even Dr. Gallant, who first succeeded in translating neural activity into a moving image of what another person was seeing — and who was both elated and horrified by the exercise — thinks the Luddite approach is an option. “The only way out of the technology-driven hole we’re in is more technology and science,” he told me. “That’s just a cool fact of life.”Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the author of “An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases,” is a contributing opinion writer.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Clearview AI lawsuit   


The discovery of Chinese terracotta warriors is one of the greatest findings of the 20th century. It is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang—the founder of the Qin dynasty. Now, with the help of technology, one of the warriors has been brought to life.Hu Wengu, a Chinese coder and Indie game developer has created a new video where he used Artificial Intelligence to generate realistic moving faces of real and fictional figures in Chinese history. These characters were recreated based on images or paintings of the historic sculptures that impressed many netizens, even though some facial movements still appear wobbly and distorted.AI Brought Them Back to Life 

Terracotta Warrior
Bilibili

One of the figures, featured in the video which was uploaded in the Chinese video-sharing website, was a terracotta warrior from the huge collection of sculptures created in the Qin dynasty that was buried along with the Chinese emperor to protect him in his afterlife.powered by AdSparcPlayback speed1x NormalQualityAutoBack360pAutoBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/SkipAds by Wengu told media that to create the face of the warrior and make it look like real, he first used photoshop to replace the original metal-like face with color to make it look like human skin. Then the creator used Artbreeder—a website that can combine images using machine learning—to manipulate portraits and create a realistic face image of the terracotta warrior. He also made some adjustments and ran the image through the First-Order-Model algorithm to make an animation.The Indie game developer said the success rate of making such videos was not very high. But he spent two months to create this almost four-minute-long video during his spare time.From History The video created by Wengu also portrayed the founding emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, and one of the principal characters of Cao Xueqin's classic 18th-century Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber, Lin Daiyu.Many netizens who watched the video said that they were amazed after seeing the work of Wengu, while some of them had pointed out that the AI-restored Dauyu looks too beautiful from her original appearance that had deprived her the charm.

He also used synthetic media generating tools such as Stylegan-Art and Realistic-Neural-Talking-Head-Models. To make the video play smoothly, Wengu used the DAIN algorithm—the next-generation AI platform and specialized in addressing and solving AI problems—to add artificial frames, while Topaz Labs was used to sharpen the pictures.However, Wengu was also behind a video, which went viral in China in May. It used AI to revive color to black-and-white footage of old Beijing. He said the inspiration to create the previous video and the recent one came from YouTuber Denis Shiryaev's work. The YouTuber had created videos where he turned Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and other famous paintings into what looked like moving images.Read more Hackers Can Access Elon Musk's Neuralink to Steal Memories, Skills and Thoughts, Warn Experts AI Could Overtake Humans in 5 Years, Says Elon Musk, Whose 'Top Concern' is Google-Owned DeepMind British scientists researching on bees to develop new drone technology

3 Daunting Ways AI Will Transform The World Of Work Adobe Stock

But this fourth industrial revolution – what I call the “intelligence revolution,” because it is being driven by AI and data – feels unprecedented in terms of the sheer pace of change. The crucial difference between this and the previous industrial revolutions is we’re no longer talking about generational change; we’re talking about enormous transformations that are going to take place within the next five, 10 or 20 years.

Here are the three biggest ways I see AI fundamentally changing the work that humans do, within a very short space of time.



PROMOTED
1. More tasks and roles will become automated
Increasing automation is an obvious place to start since a common narrative surrounding AI is “robots are going to take all our jobs.” In many ways, this narrative is completely understandable – in a lot of industries and jobs, the impact of automation will be keenly felt.
To understand the impact of automation, PricewaterhouseCoopers analyzed more than 200,000 jobs in 29 countries and found:

·        By the early 2020s, 3 percent of jobs will be at risk of automation.
·        That rises to almost 20 percent by the late 2020s.

·        By the mid-2030s, 30 percent of jobs will be at the potential risk of automation. For workers with low education, this rises to 44 percent.
These are stark figures. But there is a positive side to increasing automation. The same study found that, while automation will no doubt displace many existing jobs, it will also generate demand for new jobs. In fact, AI, robotics, and automation could provide a potential $15 trillion boost to global GDP by 2030.

This is borne out by previous industrial revolutions, which ultimately created more jobs than they displaced. Consider the rise of the internet as an example. Sure, the internet had a negative impact on some jobs (I don’t know about you but I now routinely book flights and hotels online, instead of popping to my local travel agent), but just look at how many jobs the internet has created and how it’s enabled businesses to branch into new markets and reach new customers.
Automation will also lead to better jobs for humans. If we’re honest with ourselves, the tasks that are most likely to be automated by AI are not the tasks best suited to humans – or the tasks that humans should even want to do. Machines are great at automating the boring, mundane, and repetitive stuff, leaving humans to focus on more creative, empathetic, and interpersonal work. Which brings me to…

2. Human jobs will change
When parts of jobs are automated by machines, that frees up humans for work that is generally more creative and people-oriented, requiring skills such as problem-solving, empathy, listening, communication, interpretation, and collaboration – all skills that humans are generally better at than machines. In other words, the jobs of the future will focus more and more on the human element and soft skills.
According to Deloitte, this will lead to new categories of work:
·        Standard jobs: Generally focusing on repeatable tasks and standardized processes, standard jobs use a specified and narrow skill set.
·        Hybrid jobs: These roles require a combination of technical and soft skills – which traditionally haven’t been combined in the same job.
·        Superjobs: These are roles that combine work and responsibilities from multiple traditional jobs, where technology is used to both augment and widen the scope of the work, involving a more complex combination of technical and human skills.
For me, this emphasizes how employees and organizations will need to develop both the technical and softer human skills to succeed in the age of AI.

3. The employee experience will change, too
Even in seemingly non-tech companies (if there is such a thing in the future), the employee experience will change dramatically. For one thing, robots and cobots will have an increasing presence in many workplaces, particularly in manufacturing and warehousing environments.
But even in office environments, workers will have to get used to AI tools as “co-workers.” From how people are recruited, to how they learn and develop in the job, to their everyday working activities, AI technology and smart machines will play an increasingly prominent role in the average person's working life. Just as we've all got used to tools like email, we'll also get used to routinely using tools that monitor workflows and processes and make intelligent suggestions about how things could be done more efficiently. Tools will emerge to carry out more and more repetitive admin tasks, such as arranging meetings and managing a diary. And, very likely, new tools will monitor how employees are working and flag up when someone is having trouble with a task or not following procedures correctly.
On top of this, workforces will become decentralized (a trend likely to be accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic) – which means the workers of the future can choose to live anywhere, rather than going where the work is.

Preparing for the AI revolution
AI, and particularly automation, is going to transform the way we work. But rather than fear this development, we should embrace this new way of working. We should embrace the opportunities AI provides to make work better.

No doubt, this will require something of a cultural shift for organizations – just one of the many ways in which organizations will have to adapt for the intelligence revolution. Discover how to prepare your organization for an AI-driven world in my new book, The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

Millions of Americans are unemployed and looking for work. Hiring continues, but there’s far more demand for jobs than supply. 
As scholars of human resources and management, we believe artificial intelligence could be a boon for job seekers who need an edge in a tight labor market like today’s. 
What’s more, our research suggests it can make the whole process of finding and changing jobs much less painful, more effective and potentially more lucrative.
Make me a match
Over the last three years, we’ve intensely studied the role of AI in recruiting. This research shows that job candidates are positively inclined to use AI in the recruiting process and find it more convenient than traditional analog approaches. 
Although companies have been using AI in hiring for a few years, job applicants have only recently begun to discover the power of artificial intelligence to help them in their search. 
In the old days, if you wanted to see what jobs were out there, you had to go on a job board like Monster.com, type in some keywords, and then get back hundreds or even thousands of open positions, depending on the keywords you used. Sorting through them all was a pain. 
Today, with AI and companies like Eightfold, Skillroads and Fortay, it is less about job search and more about matchmaking. You answer a few questions about your capabilities and preferences and provide a link to your LinkedIn or other profiles. AI systems that have already logged not just open jobs but also analyzed the companies behind the openings – based on things like reputation, culture and performance – then produce match reports showing the best fits for you in terms of job and company.  
Typically, there is an overall match score expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100% for each job. In many cases the report will even tell you which skills or capabilities you lack – or have not included – and how much their inclusion would increase your match score. The intent is to help you spend your time on opportunities that are more likely to result in your getting hired and being happy with the job and company after the hire. 
Crafting a winning CV
Usually, when you look for a job, you apply to lots of openings and companies at the same time. That means two choices: save time by sending each one a mostly generic resume, with minor tweaks for each, or take the time and effort to adjust and tailor your resume to better fit specific jobs. 
Today, AI tools can help customize your resume and cover letter for you. They can tell you what capabilities you might want to add to your resume, show how such additions would influence your chances of being hired and even rewrite your resume to better fit a specific job or company. They can also analyze you, the job and the company and craft a customized cover letter. 
While researchers have not yet systemically examined the quality of human- versus AI-crafted cover letters, the AI-generated samples we’ve reviewed are difficult to distinguish from the ones we’ve seen MBA graduates write for themselves over the last 30 years as professors. Try it for yourself. 
Granted, for lots of lower-level jobs, cover letters are relics of the past. But for higher-level jobs, they are still used as an important screening mechanism.



One of these cover letters was written by an MBA student. The other was generated by artificial intelligence. Can you tell which one is which?

Show me the money
Negotiations over compensation are another thorny issue in the job search. 
Traditionally, applicants have been at a distinct informational disadvantage, making it harder to negotiate for the salary they may deserve based on what others earn for similar work. Now AI-enabled reports from PayScale.com, Salary.com, LinkedIn Salary and others provide salary and total compensation reports tailored to job title, education, experience, location and other factors. The data comes from company reported numbers, government statistics and self-reported compensation. 
For self-reported data, the best sites conduct statistical tests to ensure the validity and accuracy of the data. This is only possible with large databases and serious number crunching abilities. PayScale.com, for example, has over 54 million respondents in its database and surveys more than 150,000 people per month to keep its reports up-to-date and its database growing.
Although no academics have yet tested if these reports result in better compensation packages than in the old days, research has long established that negotiating in general gets candidates better compensation offers, and that more information in that process is better than less.

Growing use of AI in hiring
Use of these tools is growing, especially among young people.
A survey we conducted in 2018 found that half of employed workers aged 18 to 36 said that they were likely or highly likely to use AI tools in the job search and application process. And 64% of these respondents felt that AI-enabled tools were more convenient. 
Most of the research on the use of AI in the hiring process – including our own – has focused on recruitment, however, and the use of the technology is expected to double over the next two years. We’ve found it to be effective for companies, so it seems logical that it can be very useful for job candidates as well. In fact, at least US$2 billion in investments are fueling human resources startups aimed at using AI to help job candidates, according to our analysis of Crunchbase business data. 
While more research is needed to determine exactly how effective these AI-enabled tools actually are, Americans who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus could use all the help they can get.

Now, we’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution, one driven by artificial intelligence and big data.

I like to refer to this as the “Intelligence Revolution."" But whatever we call it – the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 or the Intelligence Revolution – one thing is clear: this latest revolution is going to transform our world, just as the three previous industrial revolutions did.

What makes AI so impactful, and why now?

AI gives intelligent machines (be they computers, robots, drones, or whatever) the ability to “think” and act in a way that previously only humans could. This means they can interpret the world around them, digest and learn from information, make decisions based on what they’ve learned, and then take appropriate action – often without human intervention. It’s this ability to learn from and act upon data that is so critical to the Intelligence Revolution, especially when you consider the sheer volume of data that surrounds us today. AI needs data, and lots of it, in order to learn and make smart decisions. This gives us a clue as to why the Intelligence Revolution is happening now.

PROMOTED
After all, AI isn’t a new concept. The idea of creating intelligent machines has been around for decades. So why is AI suddenly so transformative? The answer to that question is two-fold:
·        We have more data than ever before. Almost everything we do (both in the online world and the offline world) creates data. Thanks to the increasing digitization of our world, we now have access to more data than ever before, which means AI has been able to grow much smarter, faster, and more accurate in a very short space of time. In other words, the more data intelligent machines have access to, the faster they can learn, and the more accurate they become at interpreting the information. As a very simple example, think of Spotify recommendations. The more music (or podcasts) you listen to via Spotify, the better able Spotify is to recommend other content that you might enjoy. Netflix and Amazon recommendations work on the same principle, of course.
·        Impressive leaps in computing power make it possible to process and make sense of all that data. Thanks to advances like cloud computing and distributed computing, we now have the ability to store, process, and analyze data on an unprecedented scale. Without this, data would be worthless.

I guarantee your business is going to have to get smarter. In fact, every business is going to have to get smarter – from small startups to global corporations, from digital-native companies to more traditional businesses. Organizations of all shapes and sizes will be impacted by the Intelligence Revolution.

Take a seemingly traditional sector like farming. Agriculture is undergoing huge changes, in which technology is being used to intelligently plan what crops to plant, where and when, in order to maximize harvests and run more efficient farms. Data and AI can help farmers monitor soil and weather conditions, and the health of crops. Data is even being gathered from farming equipment, in order to improve the efficiency of machine maintenance. Intelligent machines are being developed that can identify and delicately pick soft ripe fruits, sort cucumbers, and pinpoint pests and diseases. The image of a bucolic, traditional farm is almost a thing of the past. Farms that refuse to evolve risk being left behind.
This is the impact of the Intelligence Revolution. All industries are evolving rapidly. Innovation and change is the new norm. Those who can’t harness AI and data to improve their business – whatever the business – will struggle to compete.
Just as in each of the previous industrial revolutions, the Intelligence Revolution will utterly transform the way we do business. For your company, this may mean you have to rethink the way you create products and bring them to market, rethink your service offering, rethink your everyday business processes, or perhaps even rethink your entire business model.

Forget the good vs bad AI debate
In my experience, people fall into one of two camps when it comes to AI. They’re either excited at the prospect of a better society, in which intelligent machines help to solve humanity’s biggest challenges, make the world a better place, and generally make our everyday lives easier. Then there are those who think AI heralds the beginning of the end, the dawning of a new era in which intelligent machines supersede humans as the dominant lifeform on Earth. 
Personally, I sit somewhere in the middle. I’m certainly fascinated and amazed by the incredible things that technology can achieve. But I’m also nervous about the implications, particularly the potential for AI to be used in unethical, nefarious ways.
But in a way, the debate is pointless. Whether you’re a fan of AI or not, the Intelligence Revolution is coming your way. Technology is only going in one direction – forwards, into an ever-more intelligent future. There’s no going back.
That’s not to say we shouldn’t consider the implications of AI or work hard to ensure AI is used in an ethical, fair way – one that benefits society as well as the bottom line. Of course, we should do that. But it's important to understand that; however, you feel about it, AI cannot be ignored. Every business leader needs to come to terms with this fact and take action to prepare their company accordingly. This means working out how and where AI will make the biggest difference to your business, and developing a robust AI strategy that ensures AI delivers maximum value.

AI is going to impact businesses of all shapes and sizes, across all industries. Discover how to prepare your organization for an AI-driven world in my new book, The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Starting a new life is difficult for criminals transitioning from prison back to regular society. To help those individuals, Purdue University Polytechnic Institute researchers are using artificial intelligence to uncover risky behaviors which could then help identify when early intervention opportunities could be beneficial.
Results of a U.S. Department of Justice study indicated more than 80 percent of people in state prisons were arrested at least once in the nine years following their release. Almost half of those arrests came in the first year following release.
Marcus Rogers and Umit Karabiyik of Purdue Polytechnic’s Department of Computer and Information Technology, are leading an ongoing project focused on using AI-enabled tools and technology to reduce the recidivism rates for convicted criminals who have been released.
Both are examining the forensic psychology aspect, by identifying risky behaviors, stressful situations and other behavioral and physiological factors connected to a risk of individuals returning to criminal behavior. Rogers is a professor and Karabiyik is an assistant professor in the fields of digital and cyber forensics.

“The major reason recidivism is so high is the parolees don’t feel like they belong in the community,” Karabiyik said. “They have a hard time, and they immediately go back to their old criminal habits. Their old criminal communities are very welcoming.”
Artificial intelligence will give researchers a window into the parolee’s daily life through bracelets that collect health information, including stress and heart rate.
Smart phones carried by each person also will collect information, ranging from where they are at any given time to the photos they may take. The artificial intelligence will be run in intervals with the data examined rather than real time.
Rogers said the information will be used to identify risky behaviors, stressful situations and other behavioral and physiological factors correlated with those individuals at risk of returning to their criminal behavior.
“The goal of the study is to identify opportunities for early intervention to better assist those individuals to integrate back into general society successfully,” he said.

The monitoring systems currently are being developed, with the parolees expected to use the system during the third year of the research.
The project will work with 250 parolees as they are released. Of that total, 125 people will be in a treatment group that will have the devices and use the system. The other 125 people will be a control group observed to compare the differences. All are volunteers who consent to participate in the research, and their family members are notified of the project.
The four-year project is being done with Tippecanoe County Community Corrections, the Tippecanoe County/Purdue High Tech Crime Unit and the Tippecanoe County Sheriff’s Department.
In addition to determining the factors that draw parolees back, the research also will study the effect of offering assistance to the individuals as they integrate back into society.
For example, Karabiyik said the AI tools could recommend communities or jobs that would work well for the parolees, helping them feel comfortable and eliminating their high-risk status.
Rogers said the research will look at how technology can be used to teach better coping and life skills to those individuals and to allow overburdened caseworkers to more easily work with them.
“In the end, we want to develop a system that will allow the caseworkers to more quickly identify those individuals that seem to be on a path that would lead to recidivism,” Rogers said.
Rogers and Karabiyik are partnering with faculty from Florida State University and the University of Alabama-Huntsville and have received multimillion-dollar grant funding from the U.S. Department of Justice.

Canberra electronica duo B(if)tek — Kate Crawford and Nicole Skeltys — with twin Korg keyboards.(Supplied: Nicole Skeltys)The opening track on B(if)tek's 2020 album, Machines Work, was inspired by an advertisement made by The Muppets creator Jim Henson, featuring the sounds of electronic instruments inventor Raymond Scott.In 1967, multinational technology company IBM asked Henson to make an ad about their new word processor and how its technology could help people control paperwork in the office.The resulting ad, with its montage of images and words to an electronic soundtrack by Scott, provided the sample for Machines Work.""Machines can do the work so that people have time to think,"" the sample intoned, but ended with a warning that, actually, ""people can do the work so that machines have time to think"".""It's a fantastic little film, made to promote the idea that humans and machines would cooperate and deal with all the messy paperwork of the office,"" Crawford said.""It's funny to see that those sorts of claims are still being made today. But, if anything, that work has filled more and more of our space, time and thoughts.""Assuming that machines can do the work and artificial intelligence will save the day is, in some ways, quite a trap."" Skeltys said this 1960s view that robots would ""always be our friend"" had since blurred into a more dystopian outlook, and the fear that robots were ""coming to invade our space"" was present with each new innovation.She said a lot of the artificial intelligence robotic revolution had been outsourced to ""very cheap female labour"" who made its essential electronic components.""This is the result of capital, and decisions that have been made about where it's invested, and what kind of technology is made,"" Skeltys said.""It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, something out of human control. It just depends on who's got their hands on the levers of power and influence.""YouTube Paperwork ExplosionLife after B(if)tek posed 'enormous sociological and political questions'After eight busy years, touring with US hip hop group the Beastie Boys, selling out the Sydney Opera House, and being shortlisted for an ARIA award, B(if)tek disbanded.Crawford went on to help set up New York University's AI Now Institute, which considers the social and political implications of artificial intelligence, and joined another duo, Metric Systems. She has never lost her love of analogue synthesisers in the 25 years she has been composing with them.""So many of the machines that Nicole and I used in B(if)tek were 20 to 30 years old,"" Crawford said.""They would function differently on a hot day versus a cool day. They're organic. You get to collaborate with them.""So they have personalities, which is something I find endlessly fascinating and a source of great curiosity when writing music.""YouTube B(if)tek - Machines WorkCrawford's work through the AI Now Institute ""is focused on how these tools that are part of everyday life are starting to produce, in some cases, serious forms of inequity, of bias and discrimination, in the systems we rely on"".From health care to education to criminal justice, artificial intelligence was ""a profoundly concentrated industry [with] social, economic and political power,"" she said.""We have to look behind the machines to see the broader economy of who is running these [systems]; who profits, who benefits, and who might be bearing the greatest risk.""Crawford said there were ""enormous sociological and political questions"" that needed to be asked about using AI in our everyday life.""It gets much more concerning when we look to the way in which artificial intelligence is used to decide who might get a job, or be seen as a more dangerous defendant in the criminal justice system; or what student is seen to have the greatest potential in how they are responding in a classroom,"" she said.""All of these systems I am describing already exist and we have an entire industry set up to try to extract data and to apply meanings to that data.""The more I work in the field and really study those systems, a lot of those meanings are very suspect, and I think we have to be much more critical in the way we might expect artificial intelligence systems to interpret the world."" Kate Crawford is now a leading researcher and professor of the social implications of data systems and machine learning.(Supplied: Kate Crawford)From electronic music to folk rockUnlike Crawford, Skeltys moved ""180 degrees away from electronic music"" towards folk rock, as a touring artist.""People still crave the live performance experience, that intimacy and joy of being with other people,"" she said.""We long to be together and have that sense of community in the real world.""She said much of her music was peppered with political and social commentary.""There's always people who say 'nothing to worry about', and philosophers and analysts who say we need to be worried because there's going to be surplus populations and so many of us are not going to be needed,"" Skeltys said.""That's another reason why I gravitated to [folk]. Some of the themes I've been writing and singing about … have unfortunately become more acute, rather than less so."" Nicole Skeltys is an Australian composer, writer and presenter, and former member of Canberra electronica duo B(if)tek.(Supplied: Nicole Skeltys)It was after B(if)tek's third album that Skeltys decided she ""wanted to work less with machines and more with people"".She lent her vintage collection of synthesisers to the Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio, ""an artist-run, living museum where anyone who's curious and interested in this technology and aesthetic can go in, touch them, and learn how to use them"".""One of the great inventors and pioneers of synthesisers, Bob Moog, called the experience [of using them] 'a feeling you're channelling some kind of spiritual, transcendental, universal energy' — the opposite of artificial intelligence,"" she said.""I thought and felt that as well.""Skeltys said the themes dealt with in her latest album, Deal With Your Disenchantment, had become ""more and more real for people as we all deal with our disenchantment of being in lockdown"".But Crawford thinks the disenchantment goes deeper.""We're coming to an inflection point where people are saying, 'We need to have more control over our data, over our digital lives,' just at the moment where the power of [AI] companies has become, in many ways, stronger than it has ever been.""Posted 11 Aug 202011 Aug 2020Tue 11 Aug 2020 at 8:45pm, updated 12 Aug 202012 Aug 2020Wed 12 Aug 2020 at 4:35pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesDocuments reveal AFP's use of controversial facial recognition technologyIndustry ripe for innovation turns to AI and robots to pollinate cropsIt's not just you — songs really can take you back to specific times in your lifeDid you know a Eurovision-inspired AI Song Contest was being held this year?

The ScienceDigital cancer registries collect, manage, and store data on cancer patients. They help scientists identify trends in cancer diagnoses and treatment responses. This information can in turn help guide research funds and other resources. However, cancer pathology reports are complex. Human cancer researchers must analyze these reports to interpret variations in how they record information. To better leverage cancer data for research, scientists developed an artificial intelligence-based natural language processing tool. The tool will help researchers extract information from textual pathology reports.The ImpactResearchers have developed a multitasking convolutional neural network (CNN) for cancer research. The CNN is the first of its kind for working with cancer pathology reports. The CNN is a deep learning model that learns to perform tasks, such as identifying key words in a body of text. It works by processing language as a two-dimensional numerical dataset. Researchers have previously used single-task CNN models to comb through pathology reports. However, each single-task model can extract only one characteristic from the range of information in the reports. Compared with the single-task CNN and conventional AI models, the new multitask CNN is much faster. It processed text reports in a fraction of the time as the single-task models. In addition, it more accurately classified each of the five cancer characteristics.SummaryPopulation-level cancer surveillance is critical for monitoring the effectiveness of public health initiatives aimed at preventing, detecting, and treating cancer. To train and test the multitask CNNs with real health data, researchers used a secure data environment, more than 95,000 pathology reports from the Louisiana Tumor Registry, and the capabilities of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, a Department of Energy Office of Science user facility. The researchers compared their multitask CNNs to three established AI models, including a single-task CNN. The researchers concluded that the multitask CNN offers superior classification accuracy for automated coding of cancer pathology documents. This finding was true across a wide range of cancers and across multiple information extraction tasks. The multitask CNN achieved this performance while needing training and inference time similar to that needed for a single task–specific model.ContactGina TourassiDirector, National Center for Computational Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratorytourassig@ornl.govFundingThis work was supported in part by the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program established by the Department of Energy and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health.

        UTS launches Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute






                            By

Touted as nation's largest AI research program.


The University of Technology Sydney launched a new research institute to develop the nation’s use of artificial intelligence for economic and social advancement.







The Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) will oversee what the university is calling the country’s largest AI research program, with both applied and fundamental research using AI and associated technologies such as the internet of things (IoT).
Researchers at the institute are set to work across a number of sectors including healthcare, financial services, transport, education, and defence.
The facility will be led by Distinguished Professor Jie Lu, an expert in “fuzzy” machine learning - where algorithms are intended to function more like humans with an ability to evaluate more nuanced possibilities - and its impact on data-driven decision making.
Eight separate labs exist within the institute, with focus areas covering computational intelligence and deep learning, blockchain, bioinformatics, software and security.
Lu was awarded $3.3 million by the Australian Research Council to lead one of the major projects at the AAII concerning autonomous learning capabilities for decision-making in complex situations, and to improve the scale and focus of machine learning-based research into decision-making and its applications.
“We aim to create a novel research direction – autonomous machine learning for data-driven decision-making from big data that supports decision-making in complex situations,” Lu said in a statement.
“This project will give a new set of theories, methodologies and algorithms to learn autonomously from data, and assist machine-learning to effectively handle tremendous uncertainties in data.”
Together with industry partners from across the healthcare, transportation, agriculture and logistics transportation sectors, the project will look at intelligent learning systems using large data domains, data streams and agent environments.
“This dedicated Institute will further enhance UTS' - and Australia’s - reputation in AI, particularly machine learning, which is having such a transformational impact on many areas of science, the economy and society,” Lu added.
“AAII will build world-class AI research capacity in Australia and globally through links with national and international researchers, research communities and industries in machine learning and decision support systems.”

The pandemic and business continuity planning
The pandemic is a severe stress test for the business continuity plans of global corporations. The operators of call centres are playing an important role in meeting that challenge, and it has not been easy. In normal times, if an earthquake hits Bangalore, you can switch capacity to your call centre in Manila. But what do you do when all the call centres around the world that serve your customers are hit – all at the same time?


The big outsourcing call centre companies which serve corporate giants have hundreds of thousands of employees, and many of these people are working from home now. Their employers can make sure they have adequate computer equipment, but staff in developing countries are often handicapped by lack of good internet access, and the lack of a calm environment without interruptions.

The pandemic will prompt another round of discussions about re-shoring call centre jobs to places which are less vulnerable in that way, but cost will remain a huge barrier. The salary of one person in a corporation’s home country will often pay for three people in an offshore location. Or you could employ a graduate in India, China, or the Philippines for the cost of a school leaver in the US or the UK, and keep some change.

PROMOTED
Accelerating automation
The pandemic is also reviving talk of automation slashing the number of humans working in call centres. In 2014, the CEO of Telstra, Australia’s largest mobile phone company, made headlines with a forecast that within five years there would be no people in its call centres. It didn’t happen, of course. Peter Monk, GM for Australia of Concentrix, one of the two big global customer engagement companies offering contact centre services, says that employment in call centres has grown modestly in recent years, but that the really significant change has been the shift from voice to digital.

When customer interactions are simple, they can often be automated. A chatbot is perfectly adequate to handle a password change, or the provision of some basic information. And the digitally native younger generations prefer to interact digitally, ideally with short videos. But when there is significant value to be generated and exchanged, a call will often still be better.

Concentrix’ rival for the top spot in contact centre management is the French multinational Teleperformance, whose CEO said in a recent interview, “When chatbots started to arrive about five years ago, I was depressed. But since then our company has never grown so fast. The chatbot does the rational part of the job and the customer expert manages the emotional part.”

Natural language processing (NLP)
Peter Monk is sceptical about vendors’ claims to offer services with artificial intelligence. “Most vendors offer clever natural language processing technology, but it is not yet real AI. Some exceptions are coming through, but the software is still mostly pre-programmed, using lookup tables and knowledge banks.”

One of the more interesting early applications of NLP is systems which can detect the emotional state of a customer on the other end of a phone line, or tapping away on their keyboard. These systems are deployed alongside call centre staff, alerting them if a customer seems to be running out of patience, and suggesting variations on the script. The more sophisticated ones can discern the context of a word or sentence, referring to words and phrases from earlier in an exchange, or even from a previous conversation.
Josh Feast is co-founder and CEO of Cogito, whose “AI coach” helps customer service representatives be more emotionally intelligent on the phone. He thinks that most of us under-estimate “the challenging job of handling numerous calls each day, working with customers’ varied circumstances and communication styles, and dealing with countless policies and procedures. This can cause cognitive overload. AI can help them recognize behavioural signals by providing contextual guidance. The focus has been on automation, so we have yet to realize AI’s power to coach people, helping them reach their full potential.”
IVR, and analytics
Thanks to the increasing sophistication of NLP systems, IVR, or Interactive Voice Response, is making a comeback. When these systems were first introduced a few years ago, they were clunky and awkward, and the voice recognition software was not quite good enough, so they were quickly abandoned.
As with most industry sectors, the other big application of early AI systems is analytics. Phone conversations can be converted to text and analysed, so that companies can track how often each customer has been interacting with them, and what they are saying, with greater and greater richness and depth of understanding. This is a big area of investment for the large call centre operators.
A big industry
The call centre industry is a big one, and what happens to jobs in it will be important. It employs many millions of people around the world, in countries both rich and poor. It began in the West when large telephone systems were developed, and gradually became a major global employer. In the UK, the Birmingham Press and Mail claims to have opened the first centre, but the call centre boom really got going in 1985, when Direct Line became the first company to sell insurance entirely by phone. Today the industry employs around 1.3 million people in the UK, and more than 6 million in the USA.
Entrepreneurs in the developing world soon realised that they could bring a massive cost advantage to the industry. India was the biggest player in this market for many years, but in 2011 the Philippines stole the crown. With no connection to the south-east Asian mainland, the Philippines had failed to attract the foreign investment in manufacturing that was improving living standards in Thailand and Vietnam, but its people speak excellent English, and 1.2 million of them now work in call centres.
Translation and gigs
Artificial intelligence and related technologies are driving two other significant trends within the call centre industry. One is real-time translation, which should accelerate global trade – so long as it isn’t derailed by the pandemic, and populist nationalism. Google’s focus on B2C (business-to-consumer) applications leaves some space for other companies to play in the B2B space, and one of the leaders here is Unbabel, a Portuguese company.
The other is the application of gig economy business models to the call centre industry. Companies like Concentrix, through their ‘Solv’ solution, enable individuals anywhere in the world to get themselves accredited to work on particular types of business, and then log on and log off to work whenever they like. As the support tools improve, there is less and less need for contact centre workers to know much about the products and services of the companies they are representing. This information can be accessed instantaneously from databases in the cloud. They are evaluated more on their client handling skills, their empathy, and their ability to work with continuously evolving technologies.
Designing out the human
More fundamentally, younger companies are designing their business processes so that customers never – or almost never – need to contact a human to obtain their goods and services. The websites and logistics operations of digital disruptors aim to be so intuitive and user-friendly that customers never need to search for the “Contact” link. When this works it generates a tremendous cost advantage. When it fails, it generates huge frustration. The worst problem is when legacy companies, which lack the slick ergonomics of the disruptors’ websites, try to pull off the same trick, and hide their contact links. We consumers are not so easily fooled, and this behaviour will be the downfall of many once-great companies.
The long and the short of it
The Telstra CEO’s remark about call centres going dark within five years was a classic case of Amara’s Law, which observes that we over-estimate the impact of any given technology in the short term, and under-estimate it in the long term. Pre-virus, employment in call centres was growing in single-digit percentages a year. Post-pandemic, assuming the economy recovers, call volumes will probably remain stable, but their share of customer contacts will decline, and the call centre will become more and more a contact centre, handling many more exchanges digitally than by voice.
In the long run, it is a fairly good bet that humans will become as scarce in contact centres as they are becoming in warehouses. The question is, how long will this take. As Peter Monk, the GM of Concentrix Australia says, “Of course, the endgame - in the not too distant future - is that many aspects of even my job can be done pretty much by a machine.”

MoU was signed in presence of Dr. Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, Chairman NHAI and Dr V Ram Gopal Rao Director, IIT Delhi and other senior officials.Under the partnership, IIT Delhi will work with NHAI on developing advance analytics based on AI and ML, prepare simulation models, enhance data storage and retrieval capacities to further strengthen NHAI’s capabilities in data-driven decision making.  The collaboration will be undertaken on the identified thrust areas like the Project Management and Data Management, Highway Network Traffic Demand and Incident Management, Highway safety, Highway Work-zone Management, Highway Pavement Management System. IIT Delhi will also give inputs for NHAI data management policy.As a part of the arrangement, IIT Delhi will provide space and infrastructural facility support to house the CoE along with providing scientific and technical expertise to extend research facilities at par with academic activities of the Institute. Efforts will also be made to attract students and research scholars for setting up start-ups and incubators on different transportation and highways related research solutions. NHAI on the other hand, will provide the critical data support and necessary access to its information resources including the data software, ‘Data Lake’. NHAI will also extend required financial support to carry out research and various activities at the proposed CoE.The operations at the CoE for Advance Data Management System for Highways, shall be governed and managed by a two-tier management structure. An advisory board will be the highest-level committee mentoring the activities of the collaborative platform including initiation, continuation of work, approval of joint collaborative projects and suggest mechanisms to achieve the desired objectives. It shall also monitor the activities being undertaken and shall review the overall progress. At the 2nd tier, a Co-ordination Committee will be constituted for overall coordination and timely progress.  Co-ordination Committee will be chaired by the Dean R&D, IIT Delhi; Co-chaired by a senior official from the NHAI and will comprise of expert members from academic & research institutes. A Professor will also be appointed as a coordinator of the center by the IIT Delhi.This arrangement is set to remain in effect for over a period of five years and is expected to bring out highly effective digitized systems on which the NHAI will thrive upon. This partnership will fuel advancement in various fields related to the new age data driven traffic and construction management systems for highways, that will not just benefit NHAI but the entire nation at large.The advance AI based Data Analytics of highways and traffic pattern at CoE will facilitate in data driven decision making at national level.

According to research from IDC, the global spending on AI (Artificial Intelligence) is expected to hit $97.9 billion by 2023, up from $37.5 billion in 2019. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 28.4%.


No doubt, this is an enormous opportunity for startups. “These days, almost every company needs to leverage AI in order to thrive and build a meaningful future,” said Saar Yoskovitz, who is the CEO of Augury. “This is true for younger startups, and it is true for the largest companies, even in the most traditional and nascent industries like manufacturing and insurance. In a sense, AI has become another layer in the tech stack, like databases, and not a business model.”

All this is true. But then again, finding the right product-market fit is extremely challenging. Consider that AI models generally require a lot of customization. In fact, there is often much variation even for companies in the same industry. 

PROMOTED
And yes, there must be a high-quality dataset. But of course, this is far from easy for a startup to develop.

“Data creates an interesting chicken-and-egg problem,” said Yoskovitz. “Without a customer, you don't have data, which means you cannot train your algorithms. Without algorithms, you are not able to provide value to your customers and compete in the market. Therefore you will not have customers to provide data.”
What to do? You can look at forming partnerships, such as with companies that may not have strong AI capabilities. Or another approach is to create a free app that collects data.
“What we have found is that to build a successful AI startup, the key is sourcing and building proprietary data,” said Saniya, who is the CEO and co-founder of Pilota. “This is what makes your business defensible and attractive to investors. Almost every investor has asked us where our data comes from and what would stop others who can access this data from replicating what we do. So when creating a business centered around AI, it is extremely important to make sure that your data is proprietary and you are not just building a business on analyzing public datasets.”

But even with a good dataset, this is still not enough. For example, does the AI model make a real difference? Or are the results mostly minor improvements?
“Investors are interested in startups that are building tailored AI solutions for previously unsolvable problems,” said Jay Srinivasan, who is the CEO and co-founder of atSpoke. “So focus on areas where there are many inefficiencies and repetitive human processes, such as call centers and back-office paperwork processing. Investors want successful AI solutions that address specific workflows and problems, such as a legal document review.”

Then there is the issue of adoption.  Let’s face it, customers are still leery of the powers of AI. It does not help that the models are often complex and opaque. There are also the nagging problems with bias.

“Know your customer,” said Vasiliy Buharin, who is the Associate Director of Product Innovation at Activ Surgical. “You may have the algorithm to solve the worst LA traffic or shorten airplane boarding time 10-fold. But if the solution requires people to behave like preprogrammed automatons, it will never be adopted, and your company will fail. Your customer has a certain way of doing things. Your product must fit this workflow.”
Given all the challenges, a startup will likely undergo multiple pivots.  This is why you need a top-notch team that works well together. 
“If you start with a problem and leave yourself open to many different solutions, you will learn from the market and find the best solution to build your business around,” said Sean Byrnes, who is the CEO of Outlier. “Spending six months exploring and selecting the right problem can save you six years of wasted effort trying to build a business around a flawed idea.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has generated a large amount of excitement in healthcare, mostly driven by the emergence of increasingly accurate machine learning models. However, the promise of AI delivering scalable and sustained value for patient care in the real world setting has yet to be realized. In order to safely and effectively bring AI into use in healthcare, there needs to be a concerted effort around not just the creation, but also the delivery of AI. This AI “delivery science” will require a broader set of tools, such as design thinking, process improvement, and implementation science, as well as a broader definition of what AI will look like in practice, which includes not just machine learning models and their predictions, but also the new systems for care delivery that they enable. The careful design, implementation, and evaluation of these AI enabled systems will be important in the effort to understand how AI can improve healthcare.



Artificial intelligence (AI) has generated much excitement, but relatively little impact in how healthcare is delivered. While progress has accelerated in using machine learning (ML) to develop prediction and classification models that make up the bulk of current AI methods1, efforts to use these models in the real world setting have not taken off at nearly the same pace2 and typically remain within the realm of “innovation” outside of the core processes that drive care delivery3. To address how AI can be leveraged at scale, we need to both broaden and deepen our thinking around how AI fits into the complexities of healthcare delivery. As the data and computer sciences for developing AI based solutions have matured, we now need a delivery science to bring those solutions into use in healthcare.Current efforts to use AI in healthcare often begin with “I have a ML model that can accurately predict or classify X”, but then get stuck at “how do I use it and for whom?”4 As a result, libraries of ML models remain on the shelf without finding appropriate use cases, or models are implemented but deemed to not be as valuable as initially imagined5. A recently published ML model that predicts acute kidney injury with high accuracy6 was assumed by the authors to provide valuable information to clinicians, but when implemented in a real clinical environment, did not significantly improve patient care and in fact resulted in additional work for the physicians that was of unclear value7. This example highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of care delivery associated with the clinical use case before building the ML model; just focusing on the capability to accurately perform a prediction task is not sufficient for improving care. This conundrum is not unique to AI; it frequently affects innovation pipelines for other biomedical technologies. For example, the lengthy and rigorous process required in drug development from preclinical experiments to observed health benefits in the real world illustrate the amount of work needed to translate scientific advances into useful therapies that actually improve care8. Much of the in silico work around training and validating ML models can be compared to the preclinical testing of active ingredients in pharmaceutical research. Just as the active ingredient alone is not sufficient for creating a drug that works in humans, much less a clinical intervention that improves outcomes for a patient population, a ML model alone is unlikely to make significant improvements in healthcare outcomes.It is time to move from model development in silico to design, implementation, and evaluation of AI enabled solutions in vivo where healthcare delivery happens. We propose a delivery science for AI in healthcare that rests on the following principles: (1) much of healthcare is delivered in complex adaptive systems9, so AI must accommodate this complexity, (2) AI should be viewed as not the end product, but rather an enabling component of broader solutions, and (3) solutions enabled by AI are often complex systems of people, processes, and technologies. We need to take a more holistic view of what AI enabled solutions would look like beyond just a set of ML models. Rather, the human and technical components of the end product, such as the workflows, teams, and digital tools made possible by tasks that a ML model can perform, should be designed and implemented together as a system. The effects—beneficial or harmful—of AI enabled solutions on healthcare should also be evaluated at the system level as emergent properties that may be greater than the sum of its individual components. Identifying these emergent properties and characterizing their impact will require the system to be designed and implemented in its entirety in the healthcare environment where it is meant to operate. The task of implementing AI in healthcare, therefore, should not be about deploying a ML model; rather, it should be about how to design the best possible care delivery system for a given problem, using the ML model as a component in that delivery system.Our initial experiences with the design, implementation, and evaluation of an AI enabled solution at an academic medical center has revealed the importance of marrying data science with disciplines, such as process improvement, design thinking, and implementation science (Fig. 1). We had previously developed an all-cause mortality prediction model to act as a proxy for who may benefit from palliative care services such as advance care planning10. Rather than jumping to a solution of simply showing the model output to physicians, we first leveraged methods from process improvement to derive the sources of process inefficiencies and breakdowns11, and design thinking to observe how these processes affected the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of frontline stakeholders12. These steps allowed us to first understand the complex system in which advance care planning is currently delivered before designing a solution enabled by our ML model that could improve on that delivery system.Fig. 1: Multidisciplinary process for creating, implementing, and evaluating an AI enabled system for healthcare.Methods from process improvement, design thinking, data science, information technology, and implementation science are combined into an iterative participatory process to build an AI enabled system for improving advance care planning. The expertize used across the different disciplines are as follows: (1) user experience design, (2) data science, (3) healthcare operations, (4) clinical informatics, (5) evaluation, and (6) ethical integrity assessment.Full size imageWe made a key decision upfront to engage a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders, including frontline nurses, physicians, social workers, and occupational therapists—all who participate in the care of patients with serious illnesses who may benefit from advance care planning—from the beginning of the design process without any preconceived notions of how the ML model would be used. Interviews and process analyses of the current state quickly revealed key barriers to advance care planning that would unlikely be solved by simply showing a model’s output to any one group of clinicians. For example, clinical and logistical considerations around the appropriate timing of advance care planning, what should be discussed, and how should these discussions fit into the broader context of the hospitalization require coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts. Similarly, design thinking tools such as empathy mapping13 helped us more deeply understand how underlying feelings around role clarity and power structures between physician and non-physician members of the care team affected advance care planning workflow. These insights led us to identify key design goals that otherwise would not have surfaced, such as the need to empower non-physician care team members to identify candidate patients and lead the coordination of advance care planning—a task that was enabled by making transparent to the entire care team the list of candidate patients generated by the mortality prediction model each day and creating a workflow for the physician and non-physician team members to discuss these patients with each other about advance care planning needs. This objective identification of candidate patients by the prediction model allowed for the democratization of responsibility for deciding who needs advance care planning to the non-physician providers such as nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists—all who spend a lot of time with patients and are trained to engage in this topic. The design process also includes analyses to verify that our model’s execution and runtime characteristics (such when in the day are predictions available) fit the logistical needs of these new workflows14. This deeper understanding of current state gaps and improvement opportunities allowed us to build a system of workflows, teams, and digital tools enabled by the mortality prediction model to drive change in the complex environment of healthcare delivery. Other AI efforts that address the broader sociotechnical components of healthcare beyond just the ML model have offered similar lessons. For example, recent work around using AI to improve the treatment of sepsis committed months to assessing clinical processes and user experiences prior to even training a ML model, which yielded important insights for implementation, such as the need to focus on not just sepsis detection, but a method for standardizing follow up care15.To be most useful, evaluations of AI enabled solutions should not simply ask whether it achieved the desired improvement in clinical process or outcome (e.g., did the frequency or quality of advance care planning improve), but also how well or poorly was the solution implemented. Implementation science and systems engineering tell us that we can use rigorous scientific methods for both effectiveness and implementation questions. Such hybrid evaluations can assess the mechanism(s) by which AI enables the changes that lead to the desired clinical outcome (how did the mortality prediction tasks performed by the ML model mediate the improvement in advance care planning) and the properties of the overall AI enabled systems (what are the structures, patterns, and processes of the workflows, teams, and technologies that make up the new AI enabled system for delivering advance care planning). Frameworks such as RE-AIM13 (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) can help identify the dimensions by which to assess implementation and subsequent dissemination efforts, and models for sociotechnical systems such as SEIPS14 (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) can help assess the complex interactions between people and technologies in a work system.Naturally, questions about who is responsible for implementing such delivery systems, and quality control of the ML workflows will arise. Aside from existing processes in healthcare systems to design standard operating procedures, additional attention will be needed to implement quality controls on the models itself. Specifically, to monitor a model’s calibration over time, it will be important to watch population drifts and ensure timely retraining so that the model’s performance remains with in the execution and runtime characteristics required by the AI enabled system16,17. Just as with clinical laboratory instruments, ML models in healthcare will need to be regularly re-calibrated and tuned. The characteristics of the ML models will also need to be appropriately communicated to clinical users18. Fortunately, there is deep experience in the technology sector to draw upon19,20. In-house informatics teams within health systems with expertize in data science, information technology, and clinical operations may be required to own this work. While the nature of these teams may vary across organizations, what is certain is that such a team will need to exist to ensure that AI will be used responsibly and deliver sustained value.It is time to move AI research out from in silico model development into real world design, implementation, and evaluation for improving healthcare delivery. We will likely see that ML models will be necessary, but not sufficient components of broader AI enabled solutions. The delivery science of AI will need to address how such systems are designed, implemented, and evaluated, and how their emergent properties can be captured and utilized to transform healthcare.

Many attempts to develop artificial intelligence are powered by powerful systems of mathematical logic. They tend to produce results that make logical sense to a computer program — but the result is not very human.
In our work building therapy chatbots, we have found using a different kind of logic — one first formalised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle more than 2,000 years ago — can produce results that are more fallible, but also much more like real people.

      The future of chatbots is more than just small-talk




The different kinds of logic
The underpinning science of our chatbots is formal logic. Modern formal logic has its basis in mathematics — but that wasn’t always the case.   
The discovery and formalisation of logic is attributed to Aristotle (384-322 BC) in his collected works, the Organon (or “instrument”).
Here he documented the first principle of reaching a conclusion from a set of premises. This would be later called inference, guided by rules known as syllogisms.  
Since the 20th century, the field of logic has moved away from Aristotle’s approach towards systems that use predicate and propositional logic. These types of logic have been developed by mathematicians for mathematical applications; hence they are referred to as mathematical logics. Their reasoning is required to be infallible.
Human reasoning, on the other hand, is not always infallible. We mainly reason via deduction, induction and abduction. 
You can think of deduction as using generalised rules to reason about a specific example, while induction and abduction involve looking at a collection of examples and trying to work out the rules that explain them. 
While deduction tends to be most accurate, induction and abduction are less reliable. These are complex processes not easily programmed into machines. 
Arguably, induction and abduction are what separate human intelligence, which is vast and general but often inaccurate, from the narrow yet increasingly accurate intelligence of machines.  
Chat logic
We have found that using mathematical logic makes our chatbots less able to have meaningful interactions with humans. 
For example, a single human utterance often makes little sense without a large context of what linguists call entailments, presuppositions and implicatures. 
While our brains factor in this context automatically, machines must use some form of equivalent logic.    
Artificial general intelligence
One school of thought suggests parts of Aristotle’s logic, nowadays referred to as term logic, and his rules of inference, could form core components of an artificial general intelligence (AGI).  
The OpenCog and OpenNars are prominent AGI research platforms with term logic at the core. At present these platforms are capable of general-purpose reasoning for potential applications in health and robotics.  


A robot using the OpenCog system in 2016.

Term logic
Term logic is composed of basic units of meaning, which are linked by what linguists call a “copula”. To write “a bird is an animal” in term logic, we could use the copula denoted “->” which intuitively means “is a special kind of”, like this: 
Bird -> Animal 
This is a very simple example, but more complex and expressive statements are also possible.
Term logic and syllogisms also avoid some of the logical paradoxes that often occur when fitting natural language into a logical framework. 
For example, in most systems of formal logic, a nonsense statement like “if the moon is made of cheese, the world is coming to an end” counts as a valid argument. (This is called the paradox of material implication, and occurs because if often has very different meanings in natural language and in formal logic.) 
Aristotle, however, stated syllogisms are what must follow from two independent premises that share one (and only one) term. This rule lets us dismiss the argument above, as the two pieces of the argument (“the moon is made of cheese” and “the world is coming to an end”) don’t share a term.
Fallible reasoning
AGI researchers have extended Aristotle’s syllogisms by allowing conclusions that may be true with a degree of uncertainty (fallible reasoning) as well as those that must be true (like those from deductive reasoning). Term logic readily supports these forms of reasoning. 



Examples of different forms of reasoning that term logic aptly supports. Conclusions are given in red. Deduction is infallible while induction and abduction are fallible.


Beliefs and truths
Now that we can derive conclusions that may be true, we need to identify these as beliefs  with a corresponding truth value. 
How to determine the truth value of a belief is where some AGI researchers differ. The OpenNars project approach is most similar to the human belief system, where it counts the number of independent pieces of evidence for and against a belief to to determine how much confidence to place in it.
Virtual AI companions
So how can Aristotle’s voice be heard in our chatbot technology? 
At the CSIRO Australian e-Health Research Centre we are developing chatbots to help people better manage their health and wellbeing.

      To stop the machines taking over we need to think about fuzzy logic




We have started to use AGI in our chatbot technology for those with communication challenges and who benefit from technology interactions. Our version is mostly inspired from the OpenNars platform but infused with other components we found useful. 
Rather than just computing a response from a sequence of words, responses from the chatbot are derived from the relationships between billions of terms. Beliefs with low confidence can be sent back to the user (for example, a person asking a health chatbot about symptoms) as questions. 
In the future we think this will allow for more engaging, deeper and natural interactions between humans and machine. The beliefs and “personality” of the chatbot will become tailored to the user.  
Aristotle’s 2,000-year-old logic has had a profound influence on Western civilisation. A revamp of his ancient works could very well shift us into a new frontier of human-computer interaction.

Philosophers Win Artificial Intelligence Award

The Tetrad Automated Causal Discovery Platform, a software and text project developed by Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, Richard Scheines and Joe Ramsey of Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of Philosophy, earned the “Leader” Award at the 2020 World Artificial Intelligence Conference this past July.

The Leader Award is one of four awards presented at the conference that aim to recognize “the best in terms of impact and innovation in AI”. There were over 800 nominees for the awards, including projects by Amazon, Bosch, Huawei, Nvidia, Open AI Lab, and Siemens, among others.
The Tetrad Automated Causal Discovery Platform is a tool for discovering “valid, novel, and significant causal relationships” in data. A press release from CMU provides further information about the project:
The Tetrad project was started nearly 40 years ago by Glymour, then a professor of history and philosophy of science at the University of Pittsburgh and now Alumni University Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at CMU, and his doctoral students, Richard Scheines, now Bess Family Dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and a professor of philosophy at CMU, and Kevin Kelly, now professor of philosophy at CMU.
Glymour was fascinated by English psychologist Charles Spearman’s argument for a single “general intelligence,” proposed in the early 20th century, and later work by Hubert Blalock, a sociologist. Both researchers explored the possibility of distinguishing causal models by patterns of constraints they implied on the data. Glymour and his students undertook to generalize that idea, turn it into a computer algorithm and explore related mathematical properties.
The first version of the Tetrad program became the basis of Scheines’ doctoral research, which required him to learn as much computer science and statistics as philosophy, an interdisciplinary approach that was encouraged at CMU.
Peter Spirtes joined the project while studying for a master’s degree in computer science at Pitt following his doctoral work. A number of doctoral students at CMU have based their work around the Tetrad project.
Fundamental to the work was providing a set of general principles, or axioms, for deriving testable predictions from any causal structure. For example, consider the coronavirus. Exposure to the virus causes infection, which in turn causes symptoms (Exposure –> Infection –> Symptoms). Since not all exposures result in infections, and not all infections result in symptoms, these relations are probabilistic. But if we assume that exposure can only cause symptoms through infection, the testable prediction from the axiom is that Exposure and Symptoms are independent given Infection. That is, although knowing whether someone was exposed is informative about whether they will develop symptoms, once we already know whether someone is infected or not — knowing whether they were exposed adds no extra information — a claim that can be tested statistically with data.
Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines then turned this kind of reasoning on its head and extended it to massively complex causal systems. They developed algorithms that take measured data and background knowledge as input, and then compute the set of underlying causal systems that might have produced specific patterns in the measured data. What can the algorithms tell us about the causal system that underlies the measured data? According to Scheines, “not everything, but in some cases quite a lot.” Spirtes led the effort to prove that the algorithms were theoretically reliable. This approach to causal discovery constituted a breakthrough in fundamental methods in AI.
The next step was to make the work practical — which required efficient algorithms and massive amounts of simulation and real scientific testing. In the late 1990s, Joe Ramsey joined the team as a systems developer, and he has developed several important algorithms, and has made many others dramatically more efficient. With help from Spirtes, Glymour, Scheines and many others, Ramsey developed the Java-based Tetrad platform, which supports model building and testing, full simulation, and implements dozens of causal discovery algorithms that can be executed on one’s laptop or on the Bridges Pittsburgh Supercomputer.
Over the last 15 to 20 years, the free, open-source software platform has been successfully applied to scientific problems from economics to psychology to educational research to neuroscience by the original team and by researchers around the world.

If you have the valid background knowledge and are writing effective and valid algorithms based on mathematical relations and axioms, you already know the causal relationships in the data you will acquire via machines. Therefore, by and large, you have a high degree of apriori knowledge of a system in terms of causal relationships. I would like to see or learn about what specifically machine learning and AI are providing us other than handling a very large set of data statistically that we may already have the knowledge of how the data would behave.

This is a great question, as I would believe AI and ML will provide the capacity of computation not currently capable of man. The way AI/ML can handle data is more sufficient and in turn more progressive towards predictive systems. Example I would say is creating a system that can take health data and predict possible health issues from possible long term habits, or tracking the growth of a tumor or cancer. The creation of writing the algorithms is great, but for that algorithm to grow instinctively and intuitively based on the way the data influences it can cut back a lot of time on many things we can create to help our world, and that to me is amazing.

“If you have the valid background knowledge and are writing effective and valid algorithms based on mathematical relations and axioms, you already know the causal relationships in the data you will acquire via machines.”
That’s often not the case. A common way to train AI is to just let it try something within an environment, “reward” or “punish” it depending on the result of what it tried, then repeat a bunch of times. For example, we don’t need to know the causal relationships between particular moves in a game of chess and a victory in a game of chess to be able to tell a computer “I’ll give you a 1 every time you win. Figure out how you can get as many 1s as you can.” We could be terrible at chess but get a computer to play pretty well by doing that. 
Algorithms that help AI learn don’t require that prior knowledge of relationships either. They usually have very broad application. For example, you can measure how badly the chess bot lost (some ways of measuring might be more useful than others but you can still measure it) and then tell it to make adjustments to how it decides what to do in proportion to how good/bad it did relative to the desired outcome using some other algorithm that nudges the AIs decisions in some direction other than where they were when it lost. This can be extended to countless other domains and you don’t need to have prior mastery over chess or any of those other domains. There are also other machine learning methods that don’t require prior human knowledge of the causal relationships that could be discovered by a machine. 
What I’m actually wondering about Tetrad is how it differs from forms of reinforcement and unsupervised machine learning that can already discover causal relationships that we weren’t aware of.

After looking into it more, it seems like Tetrad isn’t doing anything that can’t already be done by other programs as far as machine learning goes. Its big strength, from what I could tell, is in its aim to be more user friendly. You don’t need to be able to code to use it and its visualizations are probably easier to understand and manage than some other data visualization tools.

Most machine learning aims at generating good predictions. This can often be done without an understanding of causal structure. For example, you can pretty reliably predict the divorce rate in a state from the number of Waffle Houses there. (This is an example McElreath discusses at length in his book _Statistical Rethinking_.)
But having more Waffle Houses doesn’t cause the divorce rate to be higher. 
Tetrad isn’t aiming to produce good predictions; it is supposed to help us uncover causal structure. This is a completely different task, so I’m not sure why you think that “Tetrad isn’t doing anything that can’t already be done by other programs as far as machine learning goes.”

You cannot generate reliably good predictions without an understanding of causal structure. Causal modeling (whether from the CMU school or the UCLA school) allows you to make a lot of assumptions explicit (and in an intuitive way) so that you aren’t just blinding looking at data and haphazardly applying this or that statistical estimation or machine learning procedure.
Even if you are just interested in figuring out what is correlated with what, you need to be aware of how different underlying causal structure can generate those correlations so you are justified in making your claims. E.g., is policy brutality incidence is correlated with race? Some who just look at data and statistics say “no” after they condition on whether you’ve been stopped by police. But that third variable that is being conditioned on is likely a collider and conditing on the collider, in this case, can generate some associations and make others disappear. But the lingo of graphical causal modeling and, in particular, “collider” is completely missing from the discussion. Consequently, it is impossible to evaluate many claims being thrown around. 
Moreover, if you are interested in figuring out the expected value of Y given X, you are not making a justified inference absent a causal model. It is permissible to extrapolate outside the data set, to project to individuals (inside or outside) of the population data, or, more generally, to test subjunctives such as “if X were x, then P(Y = 1) would be p” only if you first have a causal model that graphically encodes your assumptions about how variables are causally related (okay, the graphical bit is not necessary, but it’s practically necessary given how clear and intuitive it is). You cannot get reliable counterfactual information outside of your data set from mere associations. Otherwise, all you can say (given assumptions that the data is representative, large, not given by the Trump administration, etc) is that I found a correlation in this data set and this data set is all I wish to talk about. Only die-hard empiricists make these claims.
The point is this: You need to have some understanding of causal structure to make responsible and reliable predictions. Consequently, the discovery of (or the theory-driven hypothesizing about) causal structure should not be separated from prediction. The two should go hand and hand.

“You need to have some understanding of causal structure to make responsible and reliable predictions.”
I’m not sure whether we disagree (partly because I’m not sure what you mean by “responsible”, “reliable”, and “some understanding of causal structure”).
I agree that causal knowledge is fantastic if you can get it. I agree that graphical causal models are important. But causal inference is really, really hard, and (this may be a point of disagreement) it’s often possible to get by with statistical or machine learning models that are blind to causal structure, depending on the context. 
Also, I shouldn’t have said that “Tetrad isn’t aiming to produce good predictions.” I don’t really know what the Tetrad folks’ goals are, so let’s pretend I didn’t say that!

“I’m not sure why you think that ‘Tetrad isn’t doing anything that can’t already be done by other programs as far as machine learning goes.'”
I think that because, after looking at the program, I don’t see anything that would prevent it from uncovering “causal structure” in, for example, data about waffle houses and divorce rates. What I’m seeing is a flexible and user-friendly tool for data visualization, predictions, and tinkering with variables to see the effects. 
I understand the point you’re making about the distinction between predictions and causal structure but it doesn’t seem like what’s meant by “causal structure” in Tetrad is what you mean by “causal structure.” 
The “causal structures” being uncovered by the program depend on the data sets that are fed to it. An example they use is a data set with variables like temperature, ice cream eaten, and sunscreen used. As expected, higher temperatures “cause” more ice cream to be eaten and more sunscreen to be applied. There’s nothing stopping someone from renaming the variables to include waffle houses and divorce rates. If someone did that, and unless someone explicitly tells Tetrad that there’s no causal relationship, the program would produce the same results because it doesn’t care about the names of the variables, it cares about the numeric values of the variables. 
If someone can point me to to a part of the program that I’m overlooking, please do. Again, I’m not trying to downplay the value of Tetrad, I can see it being very useful, but the write-up and people’s posts make it sound like Tetrad is doing something that it doesn’t actually do.

My understanding of the Tetrad project is that it is by and large used to discover a set of causal structures that are consistent with the data and some set of assumptions that link the joint probability distribution over the variables to causal structures. So, Tetrad is unique in that it’s backed up by theoretical assumptions concerning the link between joint probability distributions and causal structures. As far as I know, you can also build in prior background causal assumptions, but the point of using Tetrad is to look for a set of data-consistent causal structures chiefly with some axioms about how causal structure and probabilities are related. So Tetrad is not operating on reinforcement and unsupervised machine learning principles that are “theory-free.” To get reliable predictions that aren’t by sheer accident, you need a background theory. Also, to understand what the algorithm is doing, you need background theory; not brute machine learning. I don’t know how machine learning, as is typically practiced, can reliably “already discover causal relationships” if not by sheer happy accidents. The Tetrad algorithms can and have RELIABLY discovered causal relationships in a way that is comprehensible to humans because it is principled.

Wes, thank you and sorry if I came off as downplaying the value of the program. I’m much more familiar with ml in practice than theory. 
“it’s backed up by theoretical assumptions concerning the link between joint probability distributions and causal structures.” That’s helpful. If I’m understanding correctly, it’s essentially a broad-purpose encoder, which could be useful in pretty much any domain. 
I’m still a little confused about some other things you wrote. Would a typical instance of training a convolutional network to make predictions count as “theory-free”? If it would, there are reliable methods of training the networks that don’t rely on just hoping it accidentally finds good weights. Either way, isn’t it still discovering causal relationships? The difference would be in how those relationships are represented and how easy it is for anyone to understand the representation. In the case of Tetrad, it seems very straightforward for most people to understand, in the case of a cnn you could inspect the weights and represent those weights in different ways, making them more or less easy to understand what it is that they’re representing, but it presupposes you have certain math abilities.
Sorry, if I misunderstood anything.

“Either way, isn’t [a well-trained CNN] still discovering causal relationships?”
(I accidentally posted this comment below in the wrong place. I don’t see a way to delete the other version, unfortunately. Apologies to everyone in this thread!)
No. Suppose I create a dataset of ten thousand paintings as follows. I look at each painting, and if I like it, I add a big, red check mark in MS paint. I then train a CNN to take an image of a painting as input and predict whether I liked it.
One of the things that the CNN is going to latch onto is that the presence of a big, red check mark is positively correlated with Adam liking the painting. Is this uncovering causal structure? I don’t think so. What if you’re interested in the question, “if I add a check mark to [points to painting on the wall that is not in the training data], then will that cause Adam to like it?” You might try to answer this by adding a big, red check mark to the painting and feeding that to the CNN. The CNN is going to predict that I’ll like the painting. But that’s getting the causal structure backwards. I added the check mark because I liked the painting. I didn’t like the painting because of the check.
This case is basically the same thing as the Waffle House case I mentioned above, but with CNNs.

Yes, congratulations to Clark and everyone who contributed to Tetrad. Long time coming!
To Seymour: To my mind, the most important foundational thinkers on graphical causal modeling are the CMU group (and their students) and Pearl (and his students). But, it seems to me, that the emphasis of these two groups is different albeit complementary. The CMU group focuses on the discovery of a set of causal structures from data and some assumptions (chiefly assumptions that connect probability distribution to causal structure). The Pearl group focuses on identifying causal parameters, given a set of hypotheses about the causal structure, before willy-nilly statistical estimation. Both make fundamental use of graphical criteria such as d-separation. 
Also in another post, you write: “Glymour about 10 years ago wrote a manifesto that advocated de-funding the 99 percent of academic philosophy that could not be sensibly housed in a computer science department. Funny to see him and group of philosophers-turned-statisticians honored here.” 
This fundamentally misunderstands Glymour and is not at all charitable. Calling for a kind of philosophy with its roots in Euclid and proof is not advocacy for defunding philosophy. In addition, they certainly are not philosophers-turned-statisticians. This misunderstands either statistics or their work.

If I understand you correctly, the two schools use the same or interchangeable mathematical formalism but address different questions. Pearl showed that his formalism is equivalent to, or generalizes, some others in statistics, economics, epidemiology, etc. So it’s good to hear that the CMU stuff is fully compatible.
Glymour’s “manifesto” is archived at
https://web.archive.org/web/20120108061810/http://choiceandinference.com/2011/12/23/in-light-of-some-recent-discussion-over-at-new-apps-i-bring-you-clark-glymours-manifesto/
I don’t think it’s a mischaracterization to say he views most of traditional, and current academic, philosophy as somewhere between useless and a racket in need of external correction —- and he has stated similar views in other interviews and talks that can be found online. His views are pretty much identical to what you can hear in any STEM department, the only difference is that he is nominally within the field.
“Calling for a kind of philosophy with its roots in Euclid and proof is not advocacy for defunding philosophy. In addition, they certainly are not philosophers-turned-statisticians. This misunderstands either statistics or their work.”
That isn’t actually what Glymour was saying. He wasn’t merely calling for formal philosophy, but a kind that engages with mathematics (and science, statistics, engineering, CS) using the formal tools typical of those fields, not “formal” as used by philosophers. That means (inter alia) quantitative, numerical or probabilistic/statistical sorts of “formalism”, rather than logic and its relatives that he specifically criticizes (at least the style done by philosophers).
In interviews, Glymour says that were he a student today pursuing his interests from the time of his PhD he would do machine learning (a.k.a “statistics”). Similarly, Spirtes says he wasted five years getting a PhD in philosophy. Their papers that use math can be read knowing statistics, ML or causal DAG stuff and zero philosophy, and they frequently publish in ML/statistics/CS journals. Seems pretty ML-ish to me!

I understand the difference between correlation and causation but, again, the program doesn’t seem to be able to account for what you’re talking about. As they say on their website, people mean a lot of different things by causal, and they go on to give the ice cream example I mentioned. 
I’m going to look at the book Wes recommended to see if it makes better sense to me.

So, I decided to run some experiments with Tetrad.
I made a data set including every US state except about 5 that didn’t have complete data available. It included number of waffle houses, divorce rate, average annual temperature, rank by percentage of high school graduates, and the number of times I’ve visited the state. 
I fed the dataset with several different parameters that struck me as reasonable and it didn’t make a difference to the causal graph that was output, which indicated the following:
– Where A and B are Waffle Houses and temp, exactly one of the following holds: (a) A is a cause of B, or (b) B is a cause of A, or (c) there is an unmeasured variable that is a cause of A and B, or (d) both a and c, or (e) both b and c.
– Where A and B are temp and HS rank, exactly one of the following holds: (a) A is a cause of B, or (b) B is a cause of A, or (c) there is an unmeasured variable that is a cause of A and B, or (d) both a and c, or (e) both b and c.
– Where A and B are HS rank and visits, either A is a cause of B, or there is an unmeasured variable that is a cause of A and B, or both.
– Where A and B are divorce rate and visits, either A is a cause of B, or there is an unmeasured variable that is a cause of A and B, or both.
The last two seemed right to me in that I could easily think of some unmeasured variables that could explain the relationship. The first two seemed strange. I’ll probably continue playing with this as it is really useful and visualizes the relationships better than other options. My main problem is that people seem to think this is discovering causal structures beyond high correlation when the strongest relation that Tetrad actually claims acknowledges that ” there may be an unmeasured confounder of A and B.”
Adam, I just noticed that earlier today too! Thanks, though. I’m definitely going to check it out.

I might point to an old paper of ours which was a practical test of related methods that infer causation –
https://genepi.qimr.edu.au/contents/publications/staff/CV143.pdf
The point of that paper is that one can make correct inferences if the relative strengths of association between the different variables are favourable (and measurement error is known!), otherwise one cannot exclude a more distant unobserved cause. In the genetic models we were testing, the direction of some of the arrows is fixed by previous knowledge (eg genotype causes phenotype), and it is the propagation of that information through the model that allows inference about other variables. Mendelian Randomization is another nonexperimental method (an instrumental variables approach) that leverages genetic information to make causative inferences about pairs of phenotypes that is currently extremely popular among epidemiologists.

“arrays are given as the value of a variable?”. No, you’ll have to split those into multiple relevant variables – maybe higher dimensional summaries like principal components (remembering this is what the NN layers do “for free”). All this assume the variables are unitary in nature (like unobserved component parts don’t have grotesquely different relations with your putative causes), and causative relations are linear (or polynomial etc)

I’d like to hear more about why the first two outputs seem strange? 
Waffle house is a chain headquartered in Georgia that has more locations in the South, so it seems to me that there’s a fairly straightforward common factor that could explain the relationship between number of Waffle Houses and temperature; namely, being in the Southern part of the country. 
Rates of HS graduates and temps are a little trickier, but there too a common cause story isn’t that crazy; we know that some southeastern states in the US are poorer than the country as a whole, and its not too big a leap to think that this affects HS graduation rates in some way. 
If the correlation goes the other way in either case, such that high temps are associated with fewer waffle houses, or high temps are correlated with high graduation rates, then I’d be a bit stumped.

Turning an organization into one powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires everyone's participation and contribution. Even though transformation takes time, multiple tactics can begin democratizing AI right away. It has often been said that crises reveal real character, both in individuals and in organizations. Crises force organizations to rethink how they work and are often the source of lasting change and growth. The Covid-19 pandemic is a humanitarian crisis more enormous than any recently experienced. This situation has raised the importance and prominence of technology. As it recovers from human and economic ravages, AI is positioned to play a critical role.Entrepreneurs must fundamentally change their culture to one that embraces data, experimentation, and agile principles.1. Entrepreneurs can easily migrate to the digital environment.Digital and exponential transformation change the way companies and entrepreneurs run, optimizing processes, and evolve business models by incorporating exponential technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, Blockchain, advanced analytics, machine learning, etc. It is an urgent need for all organizations in all sectors.



Migrating to the digital environment is a first step that goes beyond digitizing or automating some tasks. It is about making that digital environment permeate and evolve all actions within organizations; it also seeks to have an impact on the way of working and on obtaining greater efficiencies and productivity in the strategies that are undertaken to grow businesses or improve customer experiences. Likewise, its objective is to determine how regulations are complied with so that a company can improve its risk management or fraud prevention.In all these processes, analytics allows you to convert data into intelligence to make better business decisions and become relevant. This is how SAS has helped the world's leading business organizations grow and transform by optimizing their operations and increasing their productivity.Additionally, artificial intelligence technology is no longer reserved for Fortune 500 tech companies as the number of small businesses and entrepreneurs entering the AI market is rapidly increasing. Here are the ways entrepreneurs can leverage artificial intelligence to transform the way they do business2. AI can help build better marketing strategies for entrepreneurs


Machine learning algorithms know us better than we know ourselves.  The ability to analyze data to increase sales is one of the most lucrative applications of artificial intelligence. AI algorithms can sift through large volumes of user data for patterns and trends, which could open the doors to more effective marketing and inform your content strategy. For instance, a recent report on Harvard shows that screening chats for words and phrases correlated to successful sales can improve success rates by 54%.3. Using Artificial Intelligence to get to know customersEntrepreneurs and their marketing professionals must be up to date with news in social networks and how Artificial Intelligence changes their working ways. For example, something that cannot be missing in the marketing and sales departments: study the users' search habits and discover the demographics to develop the strategies with your ads.Also, rather than guessing your target audience and customers' behaviors, AI uses data to conclude the various ways your business can serve them better. AI can also be used for data drive optimizations, improving the conversion rate on your website, analyze your customers' buying patterns, and generally excellent user experience.


4. AI as a competitive tool on social mediaIn business, knowing what a competitor is doing is as important as making your business plans. AI has helped online marketers track their competitors' activities, learn what they have done on their social media profiles to use that information, and reevaluate their business plan. For example, review the visual content, what is consumed the most, what types of interactions users have with it, and what kind of platform(s) work best.5. Artificial Intelligence in social networks to improve the user experienceEntrepreneurs can leverage on Artificial Intelligence on social media to get to their target audience. The number of social media users is approaching 2.8 billion, a large enough to immerse themselves in the world of Social Media. As more users join the platforms, the more work is needed, and the more elaborate the strategies will have to be.


6. To build task-centric applicationsAI algorithms can substitute human workers for various tasks, freeing up time, money, and resources. Although doomsayers may see it as the beginning of the robotic takeover and the inevitable loss of jobs, most entrepreneurs' trend is a more realistic view.AI is the perfect match for a human worker. Technology streamlines administrative tasks, allowing humans to focus on more exciting and creative jobs in more essential areas. As an entrepreneur, you can take a cue to outsource a part of your work to AI, thus reducing the number of employees you bring on board, and the amount of work to be done.Moreover, as an entrepreneur, the onus falls on you to make stringent decisions daily, and which is where AI comes in; it can be set up and harnessed to advise you against making hasty and wrong decisions daily. This can be achieved when AI goes through your work data with an insight to make critical business decisions, whatever it is.


7. Business process efficiencyImproving day-to-day operations can help your business grow faster, and machine learning algorithms are ready to do the heavy lifting. The IA can analyze systems like supply chains and workflows to identify areas for improvement.  With optimized workflow, resources are used more efficiently, and costs associated with lost time, maintenance, and redundancy are minimized. The manufacturing sector can benefit considerably from the integration of AI.Before investing in AI applications, make sure you have all the tools you need to make it work. Calculate the Internet speed you will need, decide which specialists you might have to hire and plan for additional costs you might incur.As an entrepreneur, keep in mind that you don't need to hire a data scientist to integrate AI into your business. There are tons of companies that design AI tools for entrepreneurs and small businesses.  For example, an AI-powered application like Grammarly can help you write consistently and with high quality across your brand, while tools like Legal Robot help you create transparent and compliant legal documents and contracts.

Olga Russakovsky, an assistant professor of computer science, has been recognized with two early-career awards from organizations that promote diversity in technical fields. The awards honor her contributions in research, education and outreach.
Russakovsky(link is external) was selected by the nonprofit organization AnitaB.org for its 2020 Emerging Leader Abie Award in Honor of Denice Denton(link is external), recognizing her work to fight bias in artificial intelligence through research and mentorship. The Computing Research Association’s Committee on Widening Participation in Computing Research (CRA-WP) honored Russakovsky with this year’s Anita Borg Early Career Award(link is external), given to a woman in computer science or engineering for significant research contributions and service to their profession, especially outreach to women.
Russakovsky leads the Princeton Visual AI Lab(link is external), which seeks to improve artificial intelligence (AI) systems’ ability to understand the visual world, both through improved image and video analysis and better object recognition and visual understanding. To that end, her team applies machine learning techniques to large data sets to allow systems to understand the context of a scene as well as identify the objects in the scene. They are also developing tools to track and mitigate biases(link is external) in computer vision data sets such as ImageNet, a groundbreaking database of more than 14 million images created by researchers at Princeton and Stanford.
With the goal of making AI technology more inclusive and beneficial to society, Russakovsky helped establish the national AI4ALL nonprofit(link is external) in 2017. Russakovsky co-directs Princeton’s AI4All summer program(link is external), which brings together high school students from underrepresented groups to learn the basics of the field through intensive training, group projects and guest lectures.
Russakovsky is being recognized “for using AI as a tool for social good, both through her individual research addressing algorithmic bias in AI, and the co-founding of AI4ALL to help develop and support a diverse future generation of AI technologists,” Brenda Darden Wilkerson, president and CEO of AnitaB.org, said in a statement.
She is among five Abie Award recipients selected this year by AnitaB.org for roles in supporting women in tech. The winners will speak at a virtual Grace Hopper Celebration, an annual event focused on the research and career interests of women in computing, to be held from Sept. 26 to Oct. 3.
Russakovsky earned her doctorate in computer science from Stanford University and was a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University before joining the Princeton faculty in 2017.

What was once science fiction or far-fetched research projects are now starting to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) market clearance. Some AI elements are already being used without clinicians knowing it, being integrated into the backend of cardiology imaging systems and IT reporting systems to help speed workflow.  However, beyond the hype of AI, there are practical concerns, including the need for validation, clinical evidence showing AI helps patient care, and the payment system based on how medicine did things 20-30 years ago needs to change. ACC gets Involved in AI Development for Cardiology “We have a huge gap between all this AI investment and how we actually take care of patients. We need to integrate it into our care, because if it is not part of how we take care of patients, this isn’t going to work,” explained John Rumsfeld, M.D., Ph.D., FACC, American College Cardiology (ACC) chief innovation officer, and professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “The clinical evidence needs to be there, and right now there is way more hype for artificial intelligence. We need to build that evidence and we also need alignment with our payment models.” Rumsfeld said there is a need to reverse engineer the current cardiac care system used by most hospitals if AI is going to play a big role. The reimbursement system also needs to change in order for the investment in AI to be justified. For these reasons, the Rumsfeld is involved with an ACC project called the “Roadmap for Innovation,” which is trying to coordinate cardiology AI efforts by working with AI vendors directly. He said there is a tremendous amount of investment in AI for healthcare, but to date there has been very little of this translating into changes in the way cardiology care is delivered.  Rumsfeld also discussed the current ACC efforts to advance evidence-based implementation of AI in cardiac care, including applications for ACC National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR). The ACC has partnered with numerous AI companies to co-develop technologies useful for cardiology. He said this includes integrating AI-enabled smartphone apps and patient monitoring devices like Apple Watches directly with electronic medical record (EMR), a remote monitoring platform for heart failure patient management, and use of natural language processing to get more meaningful data out of the EMR than can be found in structured data. This last point is aimed at using AI to reduce the staff burden now involved in data collection for registries and trials.  “What I am hoping is that we can get from where we are today to actually lead the digital transformation in healthcare,” Rumsfeld explained.  Another area where ACC offers an advantage to AI developers is its access to large amounts of data from its NCDR. For example, ACC is partnering with Yale University to use AI developed there and NCDR data to find where AI can make a difference in terms of outcomes.  “The best technology is what they call ‘quiet technology,’ you don’t even know it’s there and it makes you more efficient and does a task. In the non-healthcare world we don’t even realize when AI is being used,” Rumsfeld explained. This includes use of AI to automatically create local weather forecasts based on your cell phone location, traffic congestion maps based on real-time AI analysis of big data, instant driving directions to any location with alternate routes and estimate travel times, or even intelligent algorithms that power internet search engines. “As cardiologists we are comfortable with advances in technology, but we need it to be efficient, useful and make our lives better and not worse like many would argue the EMR has done, and it really should be in the background. But if it is going to run in the background, we need to know it has been clinically validated and that we have shown it is safe, effective and actually does what you need it to do,” Rumsfeld said. Hear more from Rumsfeld on this topic in the VIDEO: ACC Efforts to Advance Evidence-based Implementation of AI in Cardiovascular Care. Deep Learning AI Will help Address Personalized Medicine for Complex Patients Under the umbrella of AI is machine learning, which uses complex analytical software to problem solve, explained Anthony Chang, M.D., chief artificial intelligence officer, Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC), and founder of AIMed, an organization that is attempting to facilitate discussion, connections and collaboration between the various companies and hospitals developing AI. He said machine learning will eventually plateau with its abilities to solve more complex problems, which is where the newest iteration of AI, deep learning comes in.  This technology uses convolutional neuro networks to learn from mistakes and experience gained as it performs tasks, operating very similar to the human brain. When it comes to AI in the future helping manage complex patients, this is the technology that can do it. “Deep learning is harder to do and it requires a lot more data, but I think the dividends for particularly complex situations are going to be much bigger than anything we have seen before,” Change said.  For example, a complex heart failure patient might have several other chronic comorbities, take numerous drugs from different doctors that might have interactions, and they may have a long list of tests and past procedures. Chang said deep learning systems will be able to sort through all the patient’s data, prior and current lab test results, radiology reports, ECGs, and procedure reports and very quickly offer suggestions for how to best manage the patient based on current guidelines or recent large clinical study data. He said a big advantage of deep learning is that you can give the computer a lot of data where you know the outcome and then you let the computer sift through it. The AI then determines how to create a new algorithm needed to improve risk stratification. “This is a paradigm, because we do not set the rules, we let the computers figure it out, and then we take that algorithm developed by the computer and apply it to new patients and see if it makes sense,” Chang explained. “We should not let the algorithms be the only solution, there should be cognition as well, where there can be collaboration between humans and the machine to get the best outcome.” Many AI apps have been developed to aid identification of various radiological findings in medical images. However, the development of these automated detection algorithms are similar to training a computer to identify a cat or dog using thousands of photos. In cardiology, patient issues usually are much more complex than what is seen alone in the imaging.  “Cardiology is one of the best fields to use AI, because it has this set of problems, like complex patients, the need for decision support, wearable technology and the AI needed for that. Cardiology certainly has the portfolio of problems with the solutions that can be engendered by artificial intelligence,” Chang said.    AI Already in Use in Cardiology AI is already helping augment cardiologists and medical imaging. Examples of AI commercially available today include automated ejection fraction (EF) calculations for point-of-care ultrasound systems (POCUS), like on the GE Healthcare Vscan.  Premium cardiac ultrasound systems like the Philips Epiq and the Siemens SC2000 use AI to automatically identify the anatomy, segment, label it, identify the optimal echo views and perform automatic measurements before the physician begins to read the case.  The GE Healthcare Vscan app LVivo EF offers AI-automated ejection fraction calculations. The vendor said this has been helpful in assessing COVID-19 patients at the bedside without the need to use full-sized echocardiography systems that need to be sterilized following an exam. A couple CT software vendors now offer AI-automated calcium scoring software for cardiac CT scans, creating the report quantification information in seconds and color coding the calcium by vessel segment on the dataset slices. In the past year, GE healthcare and Canon gained FDA approval for AI-based CT iterative reconstruction algorithms to enable high diagnostic quality images from very low-dose CT scans. Siemens uses AI to isocenter patients on the scanning bed to aid in optimizing CT images. Comparison of a stabndard CT scan interative reconstruction method (left image) and artificial intelligence assisted CT image reconstruction for lower-dose CT scans using the Canon Aquilion Precision CT AiCE software. Arterys AI-based cardiac MRI analysis software automates the quantification required to speed exam post-processing. AI is also being applied to speedup exam times and enable multiple protocol images to be created from a single scan, greatly reducing the time patients need to spend inside the MRI machine, allowing more patients to be scanned per day.  Another example is an AI app developed at St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute to automatically risk stratify atrial fibrillation (AFib) patients. The Epic-based app stratifies patients into those who should be placed on anticoagulation, those who do not need anticoagulation, and those who are candidates for left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion, explained Sanjaya Gupta, M.D., electrophysiologist, St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, and assistant professor, University of Missouri – Kansas City School of Medicine. He said this has greatly enhanced the patient selection process for LAA occlusion procedures. “Most importantly, this helps us identify those patients that we did not realize had a problem, that’s what is really key. This also helps us identify as risk patients between their regular clinic visits and allow us to call and intervene. That is really where the next level of this is going and will make a big impact on patient care quality,” Gupta said.  Watch an interview with Gupta in the VIDEO: Artificial Intelligence to Automatically Risk Stratify Atrial Fibrillation Patients. AI algorithms are being used to automatically detect arrythmias and send alerts to patients using wearables or smartphone-based apps that record ECG. Examples of this technology are the Apple Watch and the Kardia Alivecor device. AI will likely see its biggest steps forward in cardiology for point-of-care (POC) triage apps and wearables cardiac monitoring technologies. This will speed the process of getting at-risk patients examined by a human cardiology specialist and aid in earlier detection of cardiovascular diseases.    Related Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology Content: Applications for Artificial Intelligence in Cardiovascular Imaging VIDEO: Artificial Intelligence Applications for Cardiology — Interview with Anthony Chang, M.D. Canon Medical Introduces Deep Learning-Based CT Image Reconstruction VIDEO: ACC Efforts to Advance Evidence-based Implementation of AI in Cardiovascular Care — Interview with John Rumsfeld, M.D. VIDEO: Example of Artificial Intelligence Integrated Into Cardiac Ultrasound VIDEO: Use of Artificial Intelligence To Speed Cardiac Clinical Research — James Januzzi, M.D., How Machine Learning Empowers Echo Users Today VIDEO: How Hospitals Should Prepare for Artificial Intelligence Implementation — Interview with Paul Chang, M.D. How Artificial Intelligence Will Change Medical Imaging PODCAST: Fitting Artificial Intelligence Into Cardiology — Interview with Anthony Chang, M.D. How Will Artificial Intelligence Impact Healthcare?

In February 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared artificial intelligence software to assist in the acquisition of cardiac ultrasound images. The Caption Guidance software from Caption Health is an accessory to compatible diagnostic ultrasound systems and uses artificial intelligence to help the user capture images of a patient’s heart that are of acceptable diagnostic quality. It is aimed at point of care ultrasound (POCUS) exams, where users may not be regular sonographers.

OfficeWhy Talent Management Needs Artificial Intelligence Aug. 18, 2020 at 8:30 amCorner OfficeExpert OpinionWhy Talent Management Needs Artificial IntelligenceCXOtoday News Desk4 years agoDecember 3, 2020By Ashish MedirattaHuman Resource (HR) departments in most organizations go through a constant talent-management crisis. It usually leaves most of them wondering where they are going wrong. Most HR recruiters will swear by their rulebooks of recruitment that they follow to the T. They churn through resumes and CVs, running the required numbers of interviews, tests, offering employee benefits. Signing bonuses and industry standard salary packages are all ticked off on their list. And yet, most of them are failing to attract the best available talent or keep their own best from moving out.Most HR Tools Work In SilosOrganizations can no longer afford to be satisfied with having just an applicant tracking system and human resource information system on board. They can’t expect those systems to solely be responsible for holistic HR management. ATS and HRMS are useful tools, but they do not really identify the right talent. They may aid in processing recruitment and management activities, but they are not designed to improve diversity and inclusion by removing data that triggers biases, or know what most and least motivates a high-performing applicant to move companies.This results simply because such systems are mostly designed to function independently, or in silos. A survey by Eightfold and Harris Interactive, the Talent Intelligence and Management Report how siloed ATS and HRIS systems are. Enterprises are finding their retention programs are ineffective; they don’t effectively keep individuals who want a new role and not a new company. Seventy-eight percent of CEOs and Chief Human Resource Officers say talent programs are important, but 56 percent say their current programs are ineffective. Fifty-seven percent of employees say diversity and inclusion initiatives aren’t working. Forty percent  say their companies lack qualified diverse talent.HR’s Complacency Can Be the Nail in The CoffinOnce they invest in an ATS or HRIS system, most organizations turn complacent. This is where the danger lies. A seasoned sales manager will agree that the sales process of a product or a service does not end with the client or customer making the complete payment; it continues with retaining the customer for future business, upselling, and getting references from them. Similarly, in HR, a recruitment journey does not end in closing the job requisition itself. It is about finding the right fit who will not only be an excellent performer, but one who will stick around and energize entire teams to excel. Having more of these advocates in the organization decides the fate of the business: whether it will survive and grow or stagnate. Yet, this does not stop talent from quitting within a short span of time for another opportunity that will enable them to grow and make the most of their potential. Replace Siloed Apps with AI Platforms To SucceedBusiness processes are changing faster than ever. Skill requirements change frequently, with the half-life of a skill now being just four years. Workers demand greater flexibility in their work arrangements, including shifting in and out of the full-time workforce, remote work, and contingent or contract work. Organizations hire for current skills matched to current needs, but these skills become obsolete quickly.Organizations accumulate a great volume of data in their talent hunt, but that data is mostly left ignored or are not used to its potential. Through Artificial Intelligence (AI and machine learning), great insights can be gained that will help in freeing up HR departments, hiring managers, and senior management to focus on improving candidates’ and employees’ experiences.An AI-based Talent Intelligence Platform relies on supervised and unsupervised machine learning to find the potential of each candidate. It helps companies to judge people by their capabilities, not on who they know, where they worked, or where they went to school. The AI has analyzed so many millions of data points, it knows what skills a candidate has that make them prime candidates for a job, even if they’re not in that actual job right now. AI helps companies through the whole employee lifecycle of sourcing, screening, retention, internal mobility, and succession planning. For example, regarding internal mobility, AI can help employees find internal jobs they may have never even considered, perhaps in a different department, based on their capabilities. Succession planning can identify replacements for people based on people’s capabilities, not more inequitable criteria. Screening with AI matches people based on capabilities, not based on a vague sense that someone is “passionate,” “enthusiastic,” a “go-getter,” and so on. ConclusionRecruitment and selection process is a complex one. Instead of scurrying through resumes and CVs in ATS and HRIS systems, machine learning and AI algorithms can find candidates with the right capabilities. AI Talent Intelligence Platforms offer HR, hiring managers, and senior management acuity of insight, intelligence, and speed across all of talent management. This leaves HR managers able to find more top candidates, and lower the cost of hire, all while removing bias from hiring decisions. (The author is Vice President and Principal, Talent Transformation, Eightfold India and the views expressed in the article are his own)    Tags :Artificial IntelligenceHRMachine learningTalent Intelligence PlatformTalent Managementadd a commentLeave a Response Cancel replyCommentNameEmailSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Harnessing artificial intelligence as a firefighting tool of the future




 AFP Relaxnews / 04:52 PM August 17, 2020














INQUIRER.net stock photo
Researchers have developed artificial intelligence (AI) models that will eventually be able to predict wildfires and megafires everywhere in the world.
In the collective imagination, global warming is responsible for the increasing power and frequency of forest fires. However, this is only partially true. As paradoxical as it may seem, some researchers suggest that the growing strength of fires is also due to the efficient work of fire services. By systematically extinguishing burning vegetation, firefighters would have inadvertently created the conditions for more and more fires.



This observation is based on the recent discovery of the essential role played by wildfire in the periodic regeneration of forests: the theory is that the oldest woods will naturally catch fire from the sun’s heat to make way for fresh growth.FEATURED STORIES

The occurrence of megafires
This cycle is now being amplified by climate imbalances, which have disrupted the frequency of fires. As a result, forest fires are increasingly powerful and difficult to control to the point where we have now entered an era of megafires like those that have been observed in Australia, the Amazon, and more recently in Siberia. Footage of millions of acres of burnt vegetation and hundreds of thousands of dead animals have raised awareness of the environmental and safety risks posed by such huge blazes.



In this context, prevention is the best remedy. Scientists and firefighters working together to develop new tools that can take into account the complexity of how fires emerge and spread have turned to artificial intelligence to provide solutions.




Artificial intelligence vs. megafires

The main advantage of artificial intelligence is its capacity to rapidly perform highly complex calculations that humans would take several days to resolve. For these calculations to be accurate, researchers have to feed massive amounts of information on past fires and associated meteorological conditions and vegetation into a computer. The goal is to enable the machine to mathematically link all of the data in a model that scientists can then use to predict future wildfire outbreaks.
The archiving work necessary for projects of this kind can take months, and even years, to optimize the AI agent’s understanding of the environment that it is supposed to supervise.

Several research groups are already experimenting with these futuristic firefighting tools, among them teams at the WiFire Lab in California, USA and the University of Alberta in Canada. Thanks to predictions provided by these AI agents, among other things, firefighters will soon be able to take advantage of recommendations for prescribed burns to save certain parts of the forest while allowing the natural process of forest regeneration to take its course.

Thanks to 'AI Readiness.' People are willing to take technological changes as they adapt to a society where intelligence and robotics do most of the job. But the problem here is ethics..While talking about artificial intelligence and AI Readiness, very less is taken into consideration on the ethical part. Ethical implications and setting up the mechanism for compliance is a must in opening the world to a high-tech position without trouble..What is AI Readiness?.The initiative by organisations to the next stage or to ongoing success depending on having the right elements in place across skills and resources, infrastructure and technology, process and module is AI readiness. The organisations could be at various stages in the AI journey. To pursue and generate real value for AI initiative, organisations must have a degree of AI readiness..Organisational readiness: Companies that prefer to work seriously on AI and bring development should have an appropriate organisational structure, leadership and talent among employees. The leadership in the AI sector should be strong with talented analytics-specialized role players. Vision on why, how and what to work and strategy to plan for making the vision reality are the mandatory readiness. Stakeholders of the company should show their willingness to sponsor and support the initiative..Technological readiness: The organisation requires equipped infrastructure and technologies like cloud-based tools and services, analytics tools and algorithms, effective software development processes and methodologies to comply with the AI readiness. Technologies are functional only when humans set their hands at work. So, technological improvement needs people to work on it. Another vital part is played by data readiness which includes its quantity, depth, balance, representativeness, completeness and cleanliness..Financial Readiness: AI could be expensive at times. Therefore, all the inventiveness requires a budget on money, labour and technological usage. It is not an easy task to acquire all these in a company that has multiple departments working in different initiatives. The AI development group should have a grip on their project, have an insight into its outcome and talk effectively to acquire financial and physical support..Cultural readiness: To promote scientific innovation and disruption, the organisation should have culture, mindset and a set of processes. Earlier, people used to make decisions based on their individual perception and gut feeling. But this doesn't work anymore. The decision one takes on AI-related queries should incorporate data into account..AI readiness plays a vital role in the development with its wide-angle coverage on all the AI-related extensions. But it neglects to follow 'Ethics' throughout the process. In a study conducted by Capgemini Consulting on Artificial Intelligence Benchmark, it is revealed that the term 'ethics' appears only once in 30 pages. Ethics should be embedded with the working system as it is often ignored in the AI development process. Ethics and trustworthy AI requires more than just a written or printed script in the paper. It needs to be followed practically with training and monitoring in the AI works..There are various ethical risks involved when the organisation is not sticking to ethical conduct. In general, ethics refer to standards of morally good or bad, right or wrong initiatives. When humans are given control over the robotics and AI, the possibility of them imposing their strategy on race, gender, inequality to the system is high. This is a societal threat as it could end with robots and AI technologies becoming discriminatory high-powered humans..Detecting unethical behaviour or processes with AI requires keen attention on numerous social contexts like discrimination, diversity and inclusion, gender equality, improper use of health records, invasion of privacy, lack of sustainability, missing governance, conflicts of interest, insensibility and inequality. If an AI system works without considering any of this, then it might face serious problems..A major setback to break the routine mistakes could be by learning the risks of using prohibited and high-risk data. By sensitizing the damage control ways to the organisation and learning the well known-failures, the wrong steps could be avoided in further use..AI should follow data ethics.Data ethics are a regulatory measure to current and historic frameworks, cultural mores and physical organizations. The most important part to understand when it comes to ethical issues involving data is the combination of personal information and ownership of data. The personal information of a person's data file could even feature the individual's qualification, living strategy, people and institutions they interact with..The use of such personal information involves a lot of issues if it fails to cope with ethics. Therefore, ethical applications should follow simple guidelines that could be useful for formulating a more detailed policy..• Technical experts need to sensitize policymakers regarding ethical threats..• AI researchers involved in AI technology development should acknowledge that their works could be used maliciously if it doesn't follow ethical guidelines..• The protection gears and techniques should be brought into use with the help of cybersecurity experts..• Ethical framework for AI should be developed and followed in accordance with the individual or the technology involved..• Discussion based on the ethical framework of AI should involve AI scientists, policymakers, businesses operating in the sector and the general public..• Identify data risks associated with the dataset, data collection and sourcing, data types, data utilisation and correct in as quickly as possible..• AI employees should learn the documentation techniques to guarantee reproducibility, interpretability and peer review..AI might look like a simple thing when people speak or read about it. However, working with AI and making use of it in everyday life involves a lot of process and strategies. AI mandates good infrastructure, skills and data to progress. What is left quite often is AI ethics. If AI takes initiative work with the ethics to protect human data privacy, then it could lead to a secure AI future..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Songistry is using the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to unlock value across the entertainment industry. It’s run by the innovative minds of CEO Curtis Serna, two-time nominee for Entrepreneur of the Year in Canada and Justin Gray, Founder and Chief Creative Officer. Justin is a Canadian born producer and songwriter who has worked with top tier artists, Avril Lavigne, Mariah Carey, John Legend, Amy Winehouse, and international artists including J-Pop Super Stars Superjunior, Chinese Mega Star Chris Lee and most recently enjoyed twelve, #1 hits in China including a hit with TF Boys’ Roy Wang. Justin brings a combination of music credibility and a personal understanding of the challenges faced by artists and the entertainment industry related to digital copyright, publishing, and royalties.
In 2019, approximately 46 million music creators and corporations lost out on the opportunity to collect royalties due to a lack of copyright information (often referred to as “metadata”), resulting in a 2.5-billion-dollar loss (USD). Songistry’s premier product, MDIIO (Music Data Intelligence In/Out), solves this problem and more. MDIIO is a music asset/copyright management tool and marketplace that leverages the latest developments in AI to protect the work of music creatives worldwide. By using copyright and other metadata details, MDIIO helps artists and music corporations protect their hard work, assets, and livelihoods. MDIIO is driven to provide Canadian artists a scientific, competitive advantage in getting their music discovered and licensed in TV/ film and advertising.
Justin was first inspired to create the platform when he realized how vulnerable songwriters were to being taken advantage of.
“A system that hasn’t traditionally supported songwriters is ripe for disruption,” said Justin. “Having worked in music for 20 plus years, I was really saddened to see songwriters and creators getting the short end of the stick. Especially with the onset of digital music streaming. Songwriters were the slowest to adapt and therefore the most vulnerable. I wanted to make sure that songwriters were provided a platform that not only fostered their creativity and organized their assets, but also democratized monetization of their hard work.”


Justin Gray, Founder and Chief Creative Officer 


When Justin was introduced to Curtis, who initially came on as an investor it quickly became evident that Curtis had the commercialization expertise that Songistry needed to help bring MDIIO to life and to help protect the interest of songwriters.


Curtis Serna, CEO 


MDIIO is now being featured in Global Affairs Canada’s Spring 2020 Software and Technologies Dealbook. The Dealbook is “a tool formulated to increase exposure to some of Canada’s most promising technology companies,” says Chief Trade Commissioner of Canada, Aillish Campbell. MDIIO fits the bill and their placement in the Dealbook has helped Songistry increase its profile to international audiences. In the first day the Dealbook was launched, Songistry was approached by two venture capital groups from Silicon Valley, that are interested in leading the investment into the Edmonton-based company.
The MDIIO platform allows creatives, from songwriters to artists, to musicians, bands, DJ’s and composers, to upload their music, apply metadata to their copyright, and then register the song with SOCAN, Canada’s performance rights organization that collects royalties for members. SOCAN is comprised of 170,000 members, 86% of which are unaffiliated independent artists and songwriters. MDIIO represents and helps protect these artists and their copyrights, while getting their work in front of companies such as Netflix, Hallmark, and Sony to name just a few studio networks. MDIIO works as a marketplace where these companies can come to license music for various projects – allowing more artists to monetize their work and gain exposure by leveraging science as their competitive advantage.






 

MDIIO has multiple features specifically designed to help spotlight the work of indie creators while simultaneously helping music supervisors find new music for their tv/ film or advertising projects. These licensors that use MDIIO have access to features such as mood track analysis, and dynamic emotional analysis (visualizing the emotion of the song on a second by second basis), as well as several additional A.I. features in development – all designed to allow licensors to find that perfect song that evokes the right emotions and story alignment without the complexity and the higher price points often associated with more well-known songs. For example, a mainstream Bruno Mars song can be licensed on average for $500,000. MDIIO’s recommendation/ search engine can identify songs that sound similar to Bruno Mars for a fraction of the cost, making the value proposition very attractive to licensors and network studios.
Creators who use MDIIO don’t have to compromise between gaining exposure and a paycheck. MDIIO receives a 20% commission on licensing transactions facilitated through the MDIIO platform, which is far less than agents who charge 50 to 75% in commission.
With so many innovative features and incentives, it is no surprise that there are more than 3,600+ creators from 19 different countries using MDIIO, representing 15,000 songs being hosted on the platform today. Not all users are indie creators; in fact, some of these users include high profile songwriters that have collaborated with the world’s biggest artists such as Beyonce, Rihanna, Shawn Mendes, and Madonna (to name a few). 
As MDIIO continues to grow on the home stage, Songistry is simultaneously striving to expand the platform farther into Asia, where Justin Gray continues to leverage his extensive success and relationships. Songistry has already begun preliminary conversations with labels, publishers, and management companies in Greater China and Asia.
“China is an important emerging market for us,” says Justin. “As copyright protection becomes more critical and major players such as Tencent and Youkou move into royalty-based payment systems, the necessity to track all of the pertinent and important data associated with copyright is more important than ever. Over the next 5 years, royalties and copyrights via China alone will amount to billions and billions of dollars. Someone needs to help provide the infrastructure and ability to shepherd these revenues and create new business models. Songistry/MDIIO is technologically prepared to do exactly that.”
“Despite the impacts of COVID, we continue to grow,” says Curtis, “but no amount of success will ever change the fact that we are an Alberta corporation with access to tremendous support and resources. Edmonton provides us the competitive advantage we would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.”

INDIAIIT Patna Joins Flipkart to Research on Artificial Intelligence

August 18, 2020August 18, 2020 

 

Flipkart which is owned by the e-commerce giant Walmart-owned has signed an MoU with IIT Patna for doing joint applied research with industry applicability in the focusing; on the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).
