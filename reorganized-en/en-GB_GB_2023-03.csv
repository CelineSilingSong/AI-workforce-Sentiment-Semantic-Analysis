The software allowed users to enter a simple description of an image they had in their mind and, after a brief pause, the software would produce an almost uncannily good interpretation of their suggestion, worthy of a jobbing illustrator or Adobe-proficient designer – but much faster, and for free. Typing in, for example, “a pig with wings flying over the moon, illustrated by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry” resulted, after a minute or two of processing, in something reminiscent of the patchy but recognisable watercolour brushes of the creator of The Little Prince.A year or so later, when the software got a wider release, the internet went wild. Social media was flooded with all sorts of bizarre and wondrous creations, an exuberant hodgepodge of fantasies and artistic styles. And a few months later it happened again, this time with language, and a product called ChatGPT, also produced by OpenAI. Ask ChatGPT to produce a summary of the Book of Job in the style of the poet Allen Ginsberg and it would come up with a reasonable attempt in a few seconds. Ask it to render Ginsberg’s poem Howl in the form of a management consultant’s slide deck presentation and it would do that too. The abilities of these programs to conjure up strange new worlds in words and pictures alike entranced the public, and the desire to have a go oneself produced a growing literature on the ins and outs of making the best use of these tools, and particularly how to structure inputs to get the most interesting outcomes.The latter skill has become known as “prompt engineering”: the technique of framing one’s instructions in terms most clearly understood by the system, so it returns the results that most closely match expectations – or perhaps exceed them. Tech commentators were quick to predict that prompt engineering would become a sought-after and well remunerated job description in a “no code” future, where the most powerful way of interacting with intelligent systems would be through the medium of human language. No longer would we need to know how to draw, or how to write computer code: we would simply whisper our desires to the machine and it would do the rest. The limits on AI’s creations would be the limits of our own imaginations.View image in fullscreenAI art created by Dall-E as a result of inputting ‘a pig with wings flying over the moon, painted by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’. Photograph: Dall-E/CraiyonImitators of and advances on Dall-E followed quickly. Dall-E mini (later renamed Craiyon) gave those not invited to OpenAI’s private services a chance to play around with a similar, less powerful, but still highly impressive tool. Meanwhile, the independent commercial effort Midjourney and the open-source Stable Diffusion used a different approach to classifying and generating images, to much the same ends. Within a few months, the field had rapidly advanced to the generation of short videos and 3D models, with new tools appearing daily from academic departments and hobbyist programmers, as well as the established giants of social media and now AI: Facebook (aka Meta), Google, Microsoft and others. A new field of research, software and contestation had opened up.The name Dall-E combines the robot protagonist of Disney’s Wall-E with the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dalí. On the one hand, you have the figure of a plucky, autonomous and adorable little machine sweeping up the debris of a collapsed human civilisation, and on the other a man whose most repeated bon mots include, “Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing,” and “What is important is to spread confusion, not eliminate it.” Both make admirable namesakes for the broad swathe of tools that have come to be known as AI image generators.In the past year, this new wave of consumer AI, which includes both image generation and tools such as ChatGPT, has captured the popular imagination. It has also provided a boost to the fortunes of major technology companies who have, despite much effort, failed to convince most of us that either blockchain or virtual reality (“the metaverse”) are the future that any of us want. At least this one feels fun, for five minutes or so; and “AI” still has that sparkly, science-fiction quality, redolent of giant robots and superhuman brains, which provides that little contact high with the genuinely novel. What’s going on under the hood, of course, is far from new.The fundamental concepts of academic artificial intelligence have not changed in the last couple of decades. The underlying technology of neural networks – a method of machine learning based on the way physical brains function – was theorised and even put into practice back in the 1990s. You could use them to generate images then, too, but they were mostly formless abstractions, blobs of colour with little emotional or aesthetic resonance. The first convincing AI chatbots date back even further. In 1964, Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a chatbot called Eliza. Eliza was modelled on a “person-centred” psychotherapist: whatever you said, it would mirror back to you. If you said “I feel sad”, Eliza would respond with “Why do you feel sad?”, and so on. (Weizenbaum actually wanted his project to demonstrate the superficiality of human communication, not to be a blueprint for future products.)Early AIs didn’t know much about the world, and academic departments lacked the computing power to exploit them at scale. The difference today is not intelligence, but data and power. The big tech companies have spent 20 years harvesting vast amounts of data from culture and everyday life, and building vast, energy-hungry data centres filled with ever more powerful computers to churn through it. What were once creaky old neural networks have become super-powered, and the gush of AI we’re seeing is the result.AI image generation relies on the assembly and analysis of millions upon millions of tagged images; that is, images that come with some kind of description of their content already attached. These images and descriptions are then processed through neural networks that learn to associate particular and deeply nuanced qualities of the image – shapes, colours, compositions – with certain words and phrases. These qualities are then layered on top of one another to produce new arrangements of shape, colour and composition, based on the billions of differently weighted associations produced by a simple prompt. But where did all those original images come from?The datasets released by LAION, a German non-profit, are a good example of the kind of image-text collections used to train large AI models (they provided the basis for both Stable Diffusion and Google’s Imagen, among others). For more than a decade, another non-profit web organisation, Common Crawl, has been indexing and storing as much of the public world wide web as it can access, filing away as many as 3bn pages every month. Researchers at LAION took a chunk of the Common Crawl data and pulled out every image with an “alt” tag, a line or so of text meant to be used to describe images on web pages. After some trimming, links to the original images and the text describing them are released in vast collections: LAION-5B, released in March 2022, contains more than five billion text-image pairs. These images are “public” images in the broadest sense: any image ever published on the internet may be gathered up into them, with exactly the kind of strange effects one may expect.In September 2022, a San Francisco–based digital artist named Lapine was using a tool called Have I Been Trained, which allows artists to see if their work is being used to train AI image generation models. Have I Been Trained was created by the artists Mat Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, whose own work led them to explore the ways in which artists’ labour is coopted by AI. When Lapine used it to scan the LAION database, she found an image of her own face. She was able to trace this image back to photographs taken by a doctor when she was undergoing treatment for a rare genetic condition. The photographs were taken as part of her clinical documentation, and she signed documents that restricted their use to her medical file alone. The doctor involved died in 2018. Somehow, these private medical images ended up online, then in Common Crawl’s archive and LAION’s dataset, and were finally ingested into the neural networks as they learned about the meaning of images, and how to make new ones. For all we know, the mottled pink texture of our Saint-Exupéry-style piggy could have been blended, however subtly, from the raw flesh of a cancer patient.“It’s the digital equivalent of receiving stolen property. Someone stole the image from my deceased doctor’s files and it ended up somewhere online, and then it was scraped into this dataset,” Lapine told the website Ars Technica. “It’s bad enough to have a photo leaked, but now it’s part of a product. And this goes for anyone’s photos, medical record or not. And the future abuse potential is really high.” (According to her Twitter account, Lapine continues to use tools like Dall-E to make her own art.)The entirety of this kind of publicly available AI, whether it works with images or words, as well as the many data-driven applications like it, is based on this wholesale appropriation of existing culture, the scope of which we can barely comprehend. Public or private, legal or otherwise, most of the text and images scraped up by these systems exist in the nebulous domain of “fair use” (permitted in the US, but questionable if not outright illegal in the EU). Like most of what goes on inside advanced neural networks, it’s really impossible to understand how they work from the outside, rare encounters such as Lapine’s aside. But we can be certain of this: far from being the magical, novel creations of brilliant machines, the outputs of this kind of AI is entirely dependent on the uncredited and unremunerated work of generations of human artists.AI image and text generation is pure primitive accumulation: expropriation of labour from the many for the enrichment and advancement of a few Silicon Valley technology companies and their billionaire owners. These companies made their money by inserting themselves into every aspect of everyday life, including the most personal and creative areas of our lives: our secret passions, our private conversations, our likenesses and our dreams. They enclosed our imaginations in much the same manner as landlords and robber barons enclosed once-common lands. They promised that in doing so they would open up new realms of human experience, give us access to all human knowledge, and create new kinds of human connection. Instead, they are selling us back our dreams repackaged as the products of machines, with the only promise being that they’ll make even more money advertising on the back of them.The weirdness of AI image generation exists in the output as well as the input. One user tried typing in nonsense phrases and was confused and somewhat discomforted to discover that Dall-E mini seemed to have a very good idea of what a “Crungus” was: an otherwise unknown phrase that consistently produced images of a snarling, naked, ogre-like figure. Crungus was sufficiently clear within the program’s imagination that he could be manipulated easily: other users quickly offered up images of ancient Crungus tapestries, Roman-style Crungus mosaics, oil paintings of Crungus, photos of Crungus hugging various celebrities, and, this being the internet, “sexy” Crungus.So, who or what is Crungus? Twitter users were quick to describe him as “the first AI cryptid”, a creature like Bigfoot who exists, in this case, within the underexplored terrain of the AI’s imagination. And this is about as clear an answer as we can get at this point, due to our limited understanding of how the system works. We can’t peer inside its decision-making processes because the way these neural networks “think” is inherently inhuman. It is the product of an incredibly complex, mathematical ordering of the world, as opposed to the historical, emotional way in which humans order their thinking. The Crungus is a dream emerging from the AI’s model of the world, composited from billions of references that have escaped their origins and coalesced into a mythological figure untethered from human experience. Which is fine, even amazing – but it does make one ask, whose dreams are being drawn upon here? What composite of human culture, what perspective on it, produced this nightmare?View image in fullscreen‘Twitter users were quick to describe crungus as ‘the first AI cryptid’, a creature who exists within the underexplored terrain of the AI’s imagination.’ Photograph: Dall-E/CraiyonA similar experience occurred to another digital artist experimenting with negative prompts, a technique for generating what the system considers to be the polar opposite of what is described. When the artist entered “Brando::-1”, the system returned something that looked a bit like a logo for a video game company called DIGITA PNTICS. That this may, across the multiple dimensions of the system’s vision of the world, be the opposite of Marlon Brando seems reasonable enough. But when they checked to see if it went the other way, by typing in “DIGITA PNTICS skyline logo::-1”, something much stranger happened: all of the images depicted a creepy-looking woman with sunken eyes and reddened cheeks, who the artist christened Loab. Once discovered, Loab seemed unusually and disturbingly persistent. Feeding the image back into the program, combined with ever more divergent text prompts, kept bringing Loab back, in increasingly nightmarish forms, in which blood, gore and violence predominated.Here’s one explanation for Loab, and possibly Crungus: although it’s very, very hard to imagine the way the machine’s imagination works, it is possible to imagine it having a shape. This shape is never going to be smooth or neatly rounded: rather, it is going to have troughs and peaks, mountains and valleys, areas full of information and areas lacking many features at all. Those areas of high information correspond to networks of associations that the system “knows” a lot about. One can imagine the regions related to human faces, cars and cats, for example, being pretty dense, given the distribution of images one finds on a survey of the whole internet.It is these regions that an AI image generator will draw on most heavily when creating its pictures. But there are other places, less visited, that come into play when negative prompting – or indeed, nonsense phrases – are deployed. In order to satisfy such queries, the machine must draw on more esoteric, less certain connections, and perhaps even infer from the totality of what it does know what its opposite may be. Here, in the hinterlands, Loab and Crungus are to be found.That’s a satisfying theory, but it does raise certain uncomfortable questions about why Crungus and Loab look like they do; why they tip towards horror and violence, why they hint at nightmares. AI image generators, in their attempt to understand and replicate the entirety of human visual culture, seem to have recreated our darkest fears as well. Perhaps this is just a sign that these systems are very good indeed at aping human consciousness, all the way down to the horror that lurks in the depths of existence: our fears of filth, death and corruption. And if so, we need to acknowledge that these will be persistent components of the machines we build in our own image. There is no escaping such obsessions and dangers, no moderating or engineering away the reality of the human condition. The dirt and disgust of living and dying will stay with us and need addressing, just as the hope, love, joy and discovery will.This matters, because AI image generators will do what all previous technologies have done, but they will also go further. They will reproduce the biases and prejudices of those who create them, like the webcams that only recognise white faces, or the predictive policing systems that lay siege to low-income neighbourhoods. And they will also up the game: the benchmark of AI performance is shifting from the narrow domain of puzzles and challenges – playing chess or Go, or obeying traffic laws – to the much broader territory of imagination and creativity.While claims about AI’s “creativity” might be overblown – there is no true originality in image generation, only very skilled imitation and pastiche – that doesn’t mean it isn’t capable of taking over many common “artistic” tasks long considered the preserve of skilled workers, from illustrators and graphic designers to musicians, videographers and, indeed, writers. This is a huge shift. AI is now engaging with the underlying experience of feeling, emotion and mood, and this will allow it to shape and influence the world at ever deeper and more persuasive levels.ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022 by OpenAI, and further shifted our understanding of how AI and human creativity might interact. Structured as a chatbot – a program that mimics human conversation – ChatGPT is capable of a lot more than conversation. When properly entreated, it is capable of writing working computer code, solving mathematical problems and mimicking common writing tasks, from book reviews to academic papers, wedding speeches and legal contracts.It was immediately obvious how the program could be a boon to those who find, say, writing emails or essays difficult, but also how, as with image generators, it could be used to replace those who make a living from those tasks. Many schools and universities have already implemented policies that ban the use of ChatGPT amid fears that students will use it to write their essays, while the academic journal Nature has had to publish policies explaining why the program cannot be listed as an author of research papers (it can’t give consent, and it can’t be held accountable). But institutions themselves are not immune from inappropriate uses of the tool: in February, the Peabody College of Education and Human Development, part of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shocked students when it sent out a letter of condolence and advice following a school shooting in Michigan. While the letter spoke of the value of community, mutual respect and togetherness, a note at the bottom stated that it was written by ChatGPT – which felt both morally wrong and somehow false or uncanny to many. It seems there are many areas of life where the intercession of machines requires some deeper thought.If it would be inappropriate to replace our communications wholesale with ChatGPT, then one clear trend is for it to become a kind of wise assistant, guiding us through the morass of available knowledge towards the information we seek. Microsoft has been an early mover in this direction, reconfiguring its often disparaged search engine Bing as a ChatGPT-powered chatbot, and massively boosting its popularity by doing so. But despite the online (and journalistic) rush to consult ChatGPT on almost every conceivable problem, its relationship to knowledge itself is somewhat shaky.Q&AAI explained: why do chatbots make errors?ShowLarge language models (LLM) do not understand things in a conventional sense – and they are only as good, or as accurate, as the information with which they are provided.They are essentially machines for matching patterns . Whether the output is “true” is not the point, so long as it matches the pattern.If you ask a chatbot to write a biography of a moderately famous person, it may get some facts right, but then invent other details that sound like they should fit in biographies of that sort of person.And it can be wrongfooted: ask GPT3 whether one pound of feathers weighs more than two pounds of steel, it will focus on the fact that the question looks like the classic trick question. It will not notice that the numbers have been changed.Google’s rival to ChatGPT, called Bard, had an embarrassing debut  when a video demo of the chatbot showed it giving the wrong answer to a question about the James Webb space telescope.Read more: Seven top AI acronyms explainedWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.One recent personal interaction with ChatGPT went like this. I asked it to suggest some books to read based on a new area of interest: multi-species democracy, the idea of including non-human creatures in political decision-making processes. It’s pretty much the most useful application of the tool: “Hey, here’s a thing I’m thinking about, can you tell me some more?” And ChatGPT obliged. It gave me a list of several books that explored this novel area of interest in depth, and described in persuasive human language why I should read them. This was brilliant! Except, it turned out that only one of the four books listed actually existed, and several of the concepts ChatGPT thought I should explore further were lifted wholesale from rightwing propaganda: it explained, for example, that the “wise use” movement promoted animal rights, when in fact it is a libertarian, anti-environment concept promoting the expansion of property rights.Now, this didn’t happen because ChatGPT is inherently rightwing. It’s because it’s inherently stupid. It has read most of the internet, and it knows what human language is supposed to sound like, but it has no relation to reality whatsoever. It is dreaming sentences that sound about right, and listening to it talk is frankly about as interesting as listening to someone’s dreams. It is very good at producing what sounds like sense, and best of all at producing cliche and banality, which has composed the majority of its diet, but it remains incapable of relating meaningfully to the world as it actually is. Distrust anyone who pretends that this is an echo, even an approximation, of consciousness. (As this piece was going to publication, OpenAI released a new version of the system that powers ChatGPT, and said it was “less likely to make up facts”.)The belief in this kind of AI as actually knowledgeable or meaningful is actively dangerous. It risks poisoning the well of collective thought, and of our ability to think at all. If, as is being proposed by technology companies, the results of ChatGPT queries will be provided as answers to those seeking knowledge online, and if, as has been proposed by some commentators, ChatGPT is used in the classroom as a teaching aide, then its hallucinations will enter the permanent record, effectively coming between us and more legitimate, testable sources of information, until the line between the two is so blurred as to be invisible. Moreover, there has never been a time when our ability as individuals to research and critically evaluate knowledge on our own behalf has been more necessary, not least because of the damage that technology companies have already done to the ways in which information is disseminated. To place all of our trust in the dreams of badly programmed machines would be to abandon such critical thinking altogether.AI technologies are bad for the planet too. Training a single AI model – according to research published in 2019 – might emit the equivalent of more than 284 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is nearly five times as much as the entire lifetime of the average American car, including its manufacture. These emissions are expected to grow by nearly 50% over the next five years, all while the planet continues to heat up, acidifying the oceans, igniting wildfires, throwing up superstorms and driving species to extinction. It’s hard to think of anything more utterly stupid than artificial intelligence, as it is practised in the current era.So, let’s take a step back. If these current incarnations of “artificial” “intelligence” are so dreary, what are the alternatives? Can we imagine powerful information sorting and communicating technologies that don’t exploit, misuse, mislead and supplant us? Yes, we can – once we step outside the corporate power networks that have come to define the current wave of AI.In fact, there are already examples of AI being used to benefit specific communities by bypassing the entrenched power of corporations. Indigenous languages are under threat around the world. The UN estimates that one disappears every two weeks, and with that disappearance goes generations of knowledge and experience. This problem, the result of colonialism and racist assimilation policies over centuries, is compounded by the rising dominance of machine-learning language models, which ensure that popular languages increase their power, while lesser-known ones are drained of exposure and expertise.In Aotearoa New Zealand, a small non-profit radio station called Te Hiku Media, which broadcasts in the Māori language, decided to address this disparity between the representation of different languages in technology. Its massive archive of more than 20 years of broadcasts, representing a vast range of idioms, colloquialisms and unique phrases, many of them no longer spoken by anyone living, was being digitised, but needed to be transcribed to be of use to language researchers and the Māori community. In response, the radio station decided to train its own speech recognition model, so that it would be able to “listen” to its archive and produce transcriptions.Over the next few years, Te Hiku Media, using open-source technologies as well as systems it developed in house, achieved the almost impossible: a highly accurate speech recognition system for the Māori language, which was built and owned by its own language community. This was more than a software effort. The station contacted every Māori community group it could and asked them to record themselves speaking pre-written statements in order to provide a corpus of annotated speech, a prerequisite for training its model.There was a cash prize for whoever submitted the most sentences – one activist, Te Mihinga Komene, recorded 4,000 phrases alone – but the organisers found that the greatest motivation for contributors was the shared vision of revitalising the language while keeping it in the community’s ownership. Within a few weeks, it created a model that recognised recorded speech with 86% accuracy – more than enough to get it started transcribing its full archive.Becoming a chatbot: my life as a real estate AI’s human backupRead moreTe Hiku Media’s achievement cleared a path for other indigenous groups to follow, with similar projects now being undertaken by Mohawk peoples in south-eastern Canada and Native Hawaiians. It also established the principle of data sovereignty around indigenous languages, and by extension, other forms of indigenous knowledge. When international for-profit companies started approaching Māori speakers to help build their own models, Te Hiku Media campaigned against these efforts, arguing, “They suppressed our languages and physically beat it out of our grandparents, and now they want to sell our language back to us as a service.”“Data is the last frontier of colonisation,” wrote Keoni Mahelona, a Native Hawaiian and one of the co-founders of Te Hiku Media. All of Te Hiku’s work is released under what it named the Kaitiakitanga License, a legal guarantee of guardianship and custodianship that ensures that all the data that went into the language model and other projects remains the property of the community that created it – in this case, the Māori speakers who offered their help – and is theirs to license, or not, as they deem appropriate according to their tikanga (Māori customs and protocols). In this way, the Māori language is revitalised, while resisting and altering the systems of digital colonialism that continue to repeat centuries of oppression.The lesson of the current wave of “artificial” “intelligence”, I feel, is that intelligence is a poor thing when it is imagined by corporations. If your view of the world is one in which profit maximisation is the king of virtues, and all things shall be held to the standard of shareholder value, then of course your artistic, imaginative, aesthetic and emotional expressions will be woefully impoverished. We deserve better from the tools we use, the media we consume and the communities we live within, and we will only get what we deserve when we are capable of participating in them fully. And don’t be intimidated by them either – they’re really not that complicated. As the science-fiction legend Ursula K Le Guin wrote: “Technology is what we can learn to do.” This article was amended on 17 March 2023, to clarify the author’s view that while today’s AI is based on many ideas that were theorised decades ago, that does not mean that more recent technological advances were not necessary for the development of programs such as ChatGPT.This article was adapted from the new edition of New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future, published by VersoExplore more on these topicsThe long readArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate. Each of us seeks to do work that gives us purpose — to write a great novel, to make a discovery, to build strong communities, to care for the sick. The urge to connect to the core of our work lives in all of us. But today, we spend too much time consumed by the drudgery of work on tasks that zap our time, creativity and energy. To reconnect to the soul of our work, we don’t just need a better way of doing the same things. We need a whole new way to work.
Today, we are bringing the power of next-generation AI to work. Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot — your copilot for work. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the planet.
“Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing, which will fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “With our new copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language.”
Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 in two ways. It works alongside you, embedded in the Microsoft 365 apps you use every day — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more — to unleash creativity, unlock productivity and uplevel skills. Today we’re also announcing an entirely new experience: Business Chat. Business Chat works across the LLM, the Microsoft 365 apps, and your data — your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings and contacts — to do things you’ve never been able to do before. You can give it natural language prompts like “Tell my team how we updated the product strategy,” and it will generate a status update based on the morning’s meetings, emails and chat threads.
With Copilot, you’re always in control. You decide what to keep, modify or discard. Now, you can be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook and more collaborative in Teams.

Microsoft 365 Copilot transforms work in three ways:
Unleash creativity. With Copilot in Word, you can jump-start the creative process so you never start with a blank slate again. Copilot gives you a first draft to edit and iterate on — saving hours in writing, sourcing, and editing time. Sometimes Copilot will be right, other times usefully wrong — but it will always put you further ahead. You’re always in control as the author, driving your unique ideas forward, prompting Copilot to shorten, rewrite or give feedback. Copilot in PowerPoint helps you create beautiful presentations with a simple prompt, adding relevant content from a document you made last week or last year. And with Copilot in Excel, you can analyze trends and create professional-looking data visualizations in seconds.
Unlock productivity. We all want to focus on the 20% of our work that really matters, but 80% of our time is consumed with busywork that bogs us down. Copilot lightens the load. From summarizing long email threads to quickly drafting suggested replies, Copilot in Outlook helps you clear your inbox in minutes, not hours. And every meeting is a productive meeting with Copilot in Teams. It can summarize key discussion points — including who said what and where people are aligned and where they disagree — and suggest action items, all in real time during a meeting. And with Copilot in Power Platform, anyone can automate repetitive tasks, create chatbots and go from idea to working app in minutes.
GitHub data shows that Copilot promises to unlock productivity for everyone. Among developers who use GitHub Copilot, 88% say they are more productive, 74% say that they can focus on more satisfying work, and 77% say it helps them spend less time searching for information or examples.
But Copilot doesn’t just supercharge individual productivity. It creates a new knowledge model for every organization — harnessing the massive reservoir of data and insights that lies largely inaccessible and untapped today. Business Chat works across all your business data and apps to surface the information and insights you need from a sea of data — so knowledge flows freely across the organization, saving you valuable time searching for answers. You will be able to access Business Chat from Microsoft 365.com, from Bing when you’re signed in with your work account, or from Teams.
Uplevel skills. Copilot makes you better at what you’re good at and lets you quickly master what you’ve yet to learn. The average person uses only a handful of commands — such as “animate a slide” or “insert a table” — from the thousands available across Microsoft 365. Now, all that rich functionality is unlocked using just natural language. And this is only the beginning.
Copilot will fundamentally change how people work with AI and how AI works with people. As with any new pattern of work, there’s a learning curve — but those who embrace this new way of working will quickly gain an edge.

The Copilot System: Enterprise-ready AI
Microsoft is uniquely positioned to deliver enterprise-ready AI with the Copilot System. Copilot is more than OpenAI’s ChatGPT embedded into Microsoft 365. It’s a sophisticated processing and orchestration engine working behind the scenes to combine the power of LLMs, including GPT-4, with the Microsoft 365 apps and your business data in the Microsoft Graph — now accessible to everyone through natural language.
Grounded in your business data. AI-powered LLMs are trained on a large but limited corpus of data. The key to unlocking productivity in business lies in connecting LLMs to your business data — in a secure, compliant, privacy-preserving way. Microsoft 365 Copilot has real-time access to both your content and context in the Microsoft Graph. This means it generates answers anchored in your business content — your documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings, contacts and other business data — and combines them with your working context — the meeting you’re in now, the email exchanges you’ve had on a topic, the chat conversations you had last week — to deliver accurate, relevant, contextual responses.
Built on Microsoft’s comprehensive approach to security, compliance and privacy. Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 and automatically inherits all your company’s valuable security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. Two-factor authentication, compliance boundaries, privacy protections, and more make Copilot the AI solution you can trust.
Architected to protect tenant, group and individual data. We know data leakage is a concern for customers. Copilot LLMs are not trained on your tenant data or your prompts. Within your tenant, our time-tested permissioning model ensures that data won’t leak across user groups. And on an individual level, Copilot presents only data you can access using the same technology that we’ve been using for years to secure customer data.
Integrated into the apps millions use every day. Microsoft 365 Copilot is integrated in the productivity apps millions of people use and rely on every day for work and life — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more. An intuitive and consistent user experience ensures it looks, feels and behaves the same way in Teams as it does in Outlook, with a shared design language for prompts, refinements and commands.
Designed to learn new skills. Microsoft 365 Copilot’s foundational skills are a game changer for productivity: It can already create, summarize, analyze, collaborate and automate using your specific business content and context. But it doesn’t stop there. Copilot knows how to command apps (e.g., “animate this slide”) and work across apps, translating a Word document into a PowerPoint presentation. And Copilot is designed to learn new skills. For example, with Viva Sales, Copilot can learn how to connect to CRM systems of record to pull customer data — like interaction and order histories — into communications. As Copilot learns about new domains and processes, it will be able to perform even more sophisticated tasks and queries.
Committed to building responsibly
At Microsoft, we are guided by our AI principles and Responsible AI Standard and decades of research on AI, grounding and privacy-preserving machine learning. A multidisciplinary team of researchers, engineers and policy experts reviews our AI systems for potential harms and mitigations — refining training data, filtering to limit harmful content, query- and result-blocking sensitive topics, and applying Microsoft technologies like InterpretML and Fairlearn to help detect and correct data bias. We make it clear how the system makes decisions by noting limitations, linking to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check and adjust content based on subject-matter expertise.
Moving boldly as we learn 
In the months ahead, we’re bringing Copilot to all our productivity apps—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Viva, Power Platform, and more. We’ll share more on pricing and licensing soon. Earlier this month we announced Dynamics 365 Copilot as the world’s first AI Copilot in both CRM and ERP to bring the next-generation AI to every line of business.
Everyone deserves to find purpose and meaning in their work — and Microsoft 365 Copilot can help. To serve the unmet needs of our customers, we must move quickly and responsibly, learning as we go. We’re testing Copilot with a small group of customers to get feedback and improve our models as we scale, and we will expand to more soon.

Photo: DADO RUVIC/REUTERSMany people have watched with delight and disquiet as generative AI has reached new levels of sophistication. Marketers are intrigued, but cautious. The ad industry already was experimenting with artificial intelligence to help with creative work, but the arrival of viral chatbot ChatGPT has marketers trying to figure out how they can effectively use the kind of generative AI that underpins it—systems that produce content from text to images. ChatGPT maker OpenAI this week released GPT4, the latest iteration of its tech, calling it the most capable yet. Some industry experts say the technology is helpful as a launching point for quickly producing creative assets on a large scale for social media and elsewhere, and may cut down on rote tasks that take up time. Many see big potential, but plenty of issues and questions remain. Here are five things marketers should know about the technology. Generative AI can hatch a lot of ideasJones Road Beauty, a makeup brand founded by cosmetics pioneer Bobbi Brown, leaned on generative AI for a video shoot this week using a concept developed by the productivity and AI company Notion AI.  Cody Plofker, chief marketing officer at Jones Road, expects generative AI to be a valuable way to come up with ideas and work more quickly. The technology could cut the time it takes to produce the dozens of ads a week that Jones Road runs with Meta Platforms Inc., which owns Facebook and Instagram, Mr. Plofker said.Newsletter Sign-upWSJ | CMO TodayCMO Today delivers the most important news of the day for media and marketing professionals.PreviewSubscribe“You can say, ‘Give me 10 ad angles for Miracle Balm based on customer reviews,’ or something like that,” he said. It could also streamline production work on those assets and more quickly make variations of them.AI may also help brands battle “creative fatigue,” said Wesley ter Haar, executive director at digital advertising and marketing services company S4 Capital PLC and co-founder of S4 company MediaMonks. “One of the key benefits of generative AI is its ability to generate large volumes of content in seconds, which means you can visualize and test out different concepts at speed,” he said. “You can also easily swap out different elements—like changing the background, changing characters—at any point in the production process without having to go back to the drawing board.”Generative AI may help agencies and brands do more with fewer people, Mr. ter Haar said. “I think it alleviates some of that head count pressure,” he said, adding that he believes the human element will always be there and that AI doesn’t fully replace a human’s perspective or skill set. Cutting back on busywork With generative AI, ad creatives will spend less time on rote tasks and more time working strategically, marketing experts said. “Some of those mundane tasks, some of those things that have traditionally been done by hand, so to speak, those go away,” said Paolo Yuvienco, chief technology officer at ad holding company Omnicom Group Inc. Jones Road Beauty’s Mr. Plofker said generative AI could largely relieve his marketing team of things like analyzing customer reviews.“If you can have AI read all of our customer reviews, and then kind of consolidate that and give a summary of what people are saying, good and bad—I see tremendous value in that,” he said. It’s not replacing creatives (yet)Mint Mobile, the wireless carrier that has agreed to be acquired by T-Mobile US Inc., in January released an ad featuring Ryan Reynolds—a part owner—reading an oddly off-key script written by ChatGPT. The ad created buzz for the brand, but got its power more from the copy the AI served up than from its ability to produce creative messaging, Mint CMO Aron North said. The ad got “an emotional response—it’s shock and amazement that a computer can do this,” Mr. North said. “But I don’t necessarily feel other emotions, like love or connection or humor. I’m not laughing with it—I’m laughing at it.” The new capabilities have invigorated a long-running discussion about the potential for automation in advertising, but haven’t changed the conclusion, according to Jay Pattisall, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. While some might look at generative AI’s ability to write prose, for instance, it is only generating output from data and not originating thought or expression, he said. “There has always been a tension between the art and the science of marketing and creativity, even when the technology was much more rudimentary than that of generative AI,” Mr. Pattisall said. “Machines in whatever form simply just can’t replace or replicate human creativity. That was true then, and it is absolutely true now.” Advertisement


Stay vigilantMarketers need to closely vet the data sources that train their generative AI models, and monitor the accuracy of their output, Mr. Pattisall said, citing risks such as an advertisement with incorrect prices.There are questions around ethics and bias that marketers must be aware of, Mr. Pattisall said. If generative AI is trained on specious or biased information or sources, its output will reflect that, possibly churning out offensive, incomplete or outright false content.Omnicom’s Mr. Yuvienco said that although it is leaning into and deeply exploring this area, the ad giant is cautious about using generative AI to create consumer-facing work given all the outstanding questions. “When it starts to generate things that are visible to our clients, that are visible to consumers, that’s when you start getting into some tricky legal things, ownership, biases, all the things that you can’t necessarily control or don’t have a good handle on today,” he said. If a machine creates it, how much do you need to actually alter the output from the machine in order to then take ownership of it? These things haven’t been answered. — Paolo Yuvienco, Omnicom GroupAmong those questions is who owns an idea if it came from generative AI.“If a machine creates it, how much do you need to actually alter the output from the machine in order to then take ownership of it? These things haven’t been answered,” Mr. Yuvienco said. “It’s a little bit of a wait-and-see game.” There is also legal uncertainty around what generative AI learns from, and what happens when it is trained using material owned by others.While human creativity also uses past work to build on new concepts, it isn’t clear yet how courts will treat the issue when it comes to generative AI, S4’s Mr. ter Haar added. “I’m sure the lawsuits will be extremely interesting.” And the technology itself still has room for improvement. Insofar as it might be used to create imagery or ads, Mr. Plofker says it’s just not ready for prime time. “I’ve tested them. None of them that I have seen are there yet,” he said. Carve out a place in the budget and the organizationIndustry players are reorganizing their teams to keep up with AI’s quickly changing capabilities. Omnicom has created a “center of excellence” around automation across its agencies, along with an AI steering committee. It uses these groups to explore what’s possible with areas such as generative AI and how it can affect its work, along with the constraints and legal implications. Mint Mobile dedicates 10% of its marketing budget to “unknown, unproven and untested” causes, according to Mr. North. It is using that budget to experiment with early-stage technologies, such as generative AI. “Because of that, we can assume risk that won’t hurt our business,” he said. “When you have money set aside, and you also have teams that have the mind-set that is not risk-averse, but risk-embrace … they’re willing to go out and try things.” Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.comCopyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence tools change everything. They are a disruptive technology, bringing radical change to the way in which we live. Our work lives have been especially disrupted by generative AI because it represents the first time in which artificial intelligence has been proven to be able to truly replace people at their jobs.
Generative AI’s Effect on the Tech Job Market1. It is jeopardizing jobs for “hands-on-only” tech people.
2. It is replacing systems administrators.
3. It is increasing the demand for human skills.
4. It is lightening the work load for business leaders.

ChatGPT, launched in November 2022, is the first AI platform to communicate exceptionally well, providing accuracy in its responses that are often better than what a person could provide. The technical work it performs is done on a professional level. Overall, it represents the first generative AI platform that is good enough to be a game changer in the tech space. 
Chat GPT’s design allows it to accomplish things that computers had been incapable of on their own up to this point. As a result, it is poised to replace a significant percentage of the workforce. Reports are already warning of its ability to replace jobs in many sectors, including the media, legal industry, finance, education, customer service and, of course, technology.
However, the news about generative AI’s impact on the job market is not all bad. Here are five key ways in which generative AI is changing the tech job market.

Generative AI Is Replacing Some Tech Positions
“Hands-on-only” tech people do not bring people skills to their positions. Their jobs only require them to touch the technology. As a result, they are truly in jeopardy of losing their jobs to generative AI.
Generative AI can program just like a programmer, but faster. It can do in five seconds or less what it would take a human 30 to 45 minutes to accomplish. That level of efficiency makes it extremely valuable in the business world.
Generative AI is not perfect, but it is comparable to human workers in terms of skills. What gives it the edge over its human counterpart is that it will work 24 hours per day, seven days per week without complaining or getting tired. Generative AI does not ask for a raise, does not ask for a four-day workweek, does not need health insurance or other benefits and does not get sick.
Programmers who are only techies and who occupy introductory to medium-level positions should be concerned about their careers. That’s because generative AI can take those jobs away and, in doing so, can save organizations a tremendous amount of money.
Microsoft has already provided an example of this. In January, it announced layoffs that it said would affect 10,000 employees. During the same month, it announced it was investing $10 billion in ChatGPT.
 
Generative AI Is Replacing Systems Admins
Systems administrators can also be the type of “hands-on-only” people whose positions will be replaced by generative artificial intelligence. In some cases, systems administrators’ responsibilities are limited to installing software, writing basic Python scripts and Windows power shell scripts, and other hands-on processes. Generative AI can do all of those things automatically.
This does not necessarily mean that generative AI will do away with the need for systems administrators. However, it will reduce the need. With the help of ChatGPT and other generative AI-driven technology, one superstar systems administrator or programmer can do the work of 10 to 20 people. 
 
Generative AI Is Replacing Digital Marketing Copywriters
Tech and software companies often rely heavily on digital marketing to promote their products and acquire new customers. Whether they create in-house positions for this role or rely on outside vendors, copywriters represent an expense for many tech companies. Generative AI is doing away with that expense.
Generative AI can write copy in a variety of voices, which the user can select. You can even train it to write in your voice, mimicking your tone and your word choice. Provide it with a topic, and it will find information and present it with great accuracy.
 
Generative AI Is Increasing the Demand for Human Skills
Generative AI can deliver a wide range of skills with better efficiency, speed, and effectiveness than humans. But it is not human and cannot deliver many qualities which are critical to the technology world. For many technology workers, this is great news.
Generative AI cannot develop a relationship with a client or coworker, lead a team or close a sale. All of these are essential tasks that companies must carry out to succeed and for which humans are required.
Generative AI also cannot do the work of cloud architects, network architects, and enterprise architects, which is to figure out holistic solutions that improve business performance with technology. By nature, those positions must communicate with and connect to a large number of people. They must manage stakeholders, design a solution, present a solution and sell the solution, all while leading large teams. For these positions, generative AI is a tool that can make the job easier, rather than a tool that will replace the job.

Generative AI Lightens the Load for Business Leaders
The capabilities that generative AI brings to the business world are a boon for many positions, especially those leadership roles in which a lot of collaboration is necessary. Leaders can dramatically improve their efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging generative AI to assist them with a wide range of business responsibilities. It serves as a valuable tool in any leader’s toolbox, playing a role in creating presentations, drafting documents, and responding to RFIs, RFPs and RFQs.
Overall, technology professionals who want to benefit from the changes that artificial intelligence is bringing to the workplace need to understand that generative AI can spit out code and copy, but it can’t connect with others. The technology job market will always have opportunities for those who can build teams and speak across cultural boundaries in a way that so we can bring out the best in others.
For programmers, systems administrators, and copywriters, generative AI promises to create a much more challenging job market. For professionals like cloud architects, network architects and enterprise architects, however, the growth of generative AI will only mean more opportunities. 
The key for any tech worker looking for a successful career in the age of artificial intelligence will be to bring to the workforce tech savvy along with the people skills that generative AI cannot deliver.

The success of ChatGPT and its competitors is based on what's termed emergent behaviors. These systems, called large language models (LLMs), weren't trained to output natural-sounding language (or effective malware); they were simply tasked with tracking the statistics of word usage. But, given a large enough training set of language samples and a sufficiently complex neural network, their training resulted in an internal representation that ""understood"" English usage and a large compendium of facts. Their complex behavior emerged from a far simpler training.
A team at Meta has now reasoned that this sort of emergent understanding shouldn't be limited to languages. So it has trained an LLM on the statistics of the appearance of amino acids within proteins and used the system's internal representation of what it learned to extract information about the structure of those proteins. The result is not quite as good as the best competing AI systems for predicting protein structures, but it's considerably faster and still getting better.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

LLMs: Not just for language
The first thing you need to know to understand this work is that, while the term ""language"" in the name ""LLM"" refers to their original development for language processing tasks, they can potentially be used for a variety of purposes. So, while language processing is a common use case for LLMs, these models have other capabilities as well. In fact, the term ""Large"" is far more informative, in that all LLMs have a large number of nodes—the ""neurons"" in a neural network—and an even larger number of values that describe the weights of the connections among those nodes. While they were first developed to process language, they can potentially be used for a variety of tasks. Ars VideoHow Scientists Respond to Science Deniers
The task in this new work was to take the linear string of amino acids that form a protein and use that to predict how those amino acids are arranged in three-dimensional space once the protein is mature. This 3D structure is essential for the function of proteins and can help us understand how proteins misbehave after they pick up mutations or allow us to design drugs to inactivate the proteins of pathogens, among other uses. Predicting protein structures was a challenge that flustered generations of scientists until this decade, when Google's AI group DeepMind announced a system that, for most practical definitions of ""solved,"" solved the problem. Google's system was quickly followed by one developed along similar lines by the academic community.
Both of these efforts relied on the fact that evolution had already crafted large sets of related proteins that adopted similar 3D configurations. By lining up these related proteins, the AI systems could make inferences about where and what sort of changes could be tolerated while maintaining a similar structure, as well as how changes in one part of the protein could be compensated for by changes in the other. These evolutionary constraints let the systems work out what parts of the protein must be close to each other in 3D space, and thus what the structure was likely to be.
The reasoning behind Meta's new work is that training an LLM-style neural network could be done in a way that would allow the system to sort out the same type of evolutionary constraints without needing to go about the messy business of aligning all the protein sequences in the first place. Just as the rules of grammar would emerge from training an LLM on language samples, the constraints imposed by evolution would emerge from training the system on protein samples. 
Paying attention to amino acids
How this worked in practice was that the researchers took a large sample of proteins and randomly blocked out the identity of a few individual amino acids. The system was then asked to predict the amino acid that should be present. In the process of this training, the system developed the ability to use information like statistics on the frequency of amino acids and the context of the surrounding protein to make its guesses. Implicit in that context are the things that required dedicated processing in the earlier efforts: the identity of proteins that are related by evolution, and what variation within those relatives tells us about what parts of the protein are near each other in 3D space.
Assuming that reasoning about how LLMs would work is true (and Meta was building on earlier research that suggested it was), the trick to developing a working system is getting the information contained in the neural network back out. Neural networks are often considered a ""black box,"" in that we don't necessarily know how they come to their decisions. But that's becoming increasingly less true over time, as people build in features like the ability to audit the decision-making process.
In this case, the researchers relied on the LLM's ability to describe what's termed its ""attention pattern."" In practical terms, when you give the LLM a string of amino acids and ask it to evaluate them, the attention pattern is the set of features that it looks at in order to perform its analysis.
To convert the attention pattern to a 3D structure, the researchers trained a second AI system to correlate the attention pattern for proteins where we know their 3D structures with the actual structure. Since we only have experimentally determined structures for a limited number of proteins, the researchers also used some of the structures predicted by one of the other AI systems as part of this training.
The resulting system was termed ESM-2. Once it was fully trained, ESM-2 was able to ingest a raw string of amino acids and output a 3D protein structure, along with a score that represents its confidence in the accuracy of that structure.

Various forms of AI already power TikTok’s “For You” feed, Spotify’s personalized music playlists, Tesla’s Autopilot driving systems, pharmaceutical drug development and facial recognition systems used in criminal investigations.

But AI is not a monolith, and anyone who says it’s either all good or all evil is oversimplifying. At this point, he said, it’s not clear whether generative AI will turn out to be a transformative technology or a passing fad.“Given how quickly generative AI is developing and how frequently we’re learning about new capabilities and risks, staying grounded when talking about these systems feels like a full-time job,” Narayanan said. “My main suggestion for everyday people is to be more comfortable with accepting that we simply don’t know for sure how a lot of these emerging developments are going to play out.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe capacity for a technology to be used both for good and ill is not unique to generative AI. Other types of AI tools, such as those used to discover new pharmaceuticals, have their own dark sides. Last year, researchers found that the same systems were able to brainstorm some 40,000 potentially lethal new bioweapons.More familiar technologies, from recommendation algorithms to social media to camera drones, are similarly amenable to inspiring and disturbing applications. But generative AI is inspiring especially strong reactions, in part because it can do things — compose poems or make art — that were long thought to be uniquely human.The lesson isn’t that technology is inherently good, evil or even neutral, said O’Mara, the history professor. How it’s designed, deployed and marketed to users can affect the degree to which something like an AI chatbot lends itself to harm and abuse. And the “overheated” hype over ChatGPT, with people declaring that it will transform society or lead to “robot overlords,” risks clouding the judgment of both its users and its creators.“Now we have this sort of AI arms race — this race to be the first,” O’Mara said. “And that’s actually where my worry is. If you have companies like Microsoft and Google falling over each other to be the company that has the AI-enabled search — if you’re trying to move really fast to do that, that’s when things get broken.”Share115 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

In a pre-recorded demo event dubbed “The Future of Work With AI” — which felt to this reporter like a highly produced infomercial (“Wait, there’s more!”) — Microsoft capped an epic week in generative AI by announcing Copilot 365 to “change work as we know it.”
Layering on to the earlier “Copilot” verbiage that accompanied its Bing announcements last month,  Copilot 365 combines large language models — namely GPT-4, which Microsoft confirmed powers Bing —  with Microsoft Graph data (from your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings) and Microsoft 365 apps including Teams, Word, Outlook and Excel.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise






For example, by plugging into your calendar and email, Copilot 365 can help you get ready for the day, generating bullets for you to focus on in your next meeting. It can also generate documents based on existing documents; create a PowerPoint, complete with layouts and images; use natural language to analyze data in Excel; and automatically capture meeting notes. 
In addition to being embedded in 365 apps, Copilot is also offered as a sidekick in a new Business Chat experience.
According to a Microsoft blog post, Business Chat “works alongside you, using the power of the Microsoft Graph to bring together data from across your documents, presentations, email, calendar, notes, and contacts. Bring together information from multiple sources to keep everyone on the team on the same page and moving forward together. Spend less time focused on the tools and more time focused on the most important work. Today, our preview customers will be able to access Business Chat in Microsoft Teams.” 
In a separate announcement, Microsoft also debuted the new Copilot in Power platform for AI-powered no-code/low-code software development, including:  
Copilot in Power Apps: Describe what you want the app to do, and it will generate a data table. You can then refine and improve the app with natural language.Copilot in Power Automate: Automate flows with natural language in seconds to digitize and speed up business processes.Copilot in Power Virtual Agents: Use generative AI to build intelligent, conversational chatbots in minutes.
Microsoft Copilot 365 offers starting point for nearly all knowledge work 
Copilot now essentially becomes the starting point for all knowledge work in Microsoft. advertisement
Forrester AI analyst Rowan Curran weighed in on the announcements. “Embedding generative AI capabilities like text and image generation into everyday office and productivity tools has the potential to significantly change people’s workflows in an enormous swath of job roles,” he told VentureBeat. “Having capabilities to generate a summarization of a white paper into a blog post, and the ability to do it within your core productivity app, reduces the friction around integrating these tools into workflows, because the user doesn’t have to go to a different tool to use them.”
However, he pointed out that the models become far more powerful when they are fine-tuned on a company’s specific data.
“When the major productivity-suite providers start enabling this capability is when we may start to see an acceleration of the use of these capabilities, even if they don’t immediately take off in their initial version,” he said. 
The impacts might not transform the workplace tomorrow, he explained. “But the wheel has started rolling forward, and over the next several years we can expect to see compounding effects from the use of these embedded generative capabilities.”
Microsoft caps an epic generative AI weekadvertisement
The Microsoft Copilot 365 release caps an epic week in generative AI. It began with Google’s announcements on Monday of new generative AI capabilities and features for developers, through a PaLM API and in Google Cloud, as well as new integrations for users of Google Workspace, including in Gmail and Google Docs.
Google’s announcements felt far more like a generative AI laundry list than Microsoft’s finely-honed marketing effort. And they came just a month after Google unveiled its search chatbot Bard and less than a week after Bloomberg reported that a new internal Google directive “requires generative AI to be incorporated into all of its biggest products within months.” 
The hot AI productivity party continues
Still, this two-horse Big Tech productivity race shows no signs of slowing down. One bigger question is what will happen to the hot AI productivity app party that’s been dancing its way around Silicon Valley for months now. 
For example, can the start-up productivity darlings, from Jasper and Tome to HyperWrite and Writer, compete with Microsoft and Google’s offerings? Or will Big Tech take over this dance floor for good?

Another major goal, he said, is to “create policies and guardrails for agencies that allow them to be able to use those tools responsibly.”The best way to follow issues you care about.The best way to follow issues you care about.The best way to follow issues you care about.Cities are changing fast.

In many instances, they have learned to proceed with caution. There are several ethical considerations raised by the application of AI, including privacy concerns and questions of bias that can have disproportionate impacts on people of color or women when applied to criminal justice or hiring decisions.The position of AI director isn’t an entirely new one for New York. In 2019, under then-Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, New York City hired Neal Parikh, a start-up founder who got his PhD in machine learning from Stanford University, to run artificial intelligence strategy, a role that was then under the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer.“The idea was, essentially, we can't really write these AI policies governing the city's own use of this without understanding what is even out there,” Parikh recalled. His main priority then was shaping New York City’s AI strategy, with a document that laid out the city’s philosophy of digital rights and the areas of opportunity for using artificial intelligence and machine learning within city government. Doing this work within the structure of government was sometimes challenging, he said.“The diversity of tasks is a great challenge in doing something like AI policy, because it's not a one-size-fits-all thing. It's often very context-based,” said Parikh. “It's a much harder job than being an AI ethics researcher, I'll tell you that.”Prior AI-focused initiatives, like a task force convened in 2017 to shape algorithmic policy, have run into bureaucratic roadblocks like a lack of transparency around what automated decision-making was currently being used by the city.Parikh left the job in 2021, just before mayor Eric Adams took office and consolidated the city’s tech agencies under the newly formed Office of Technology and Innovation. The Adams-era office is now “responsible for operating, maintaining, and securing IT infrastructure and systems that touch every aspect of City life,” according to the job description. Under this new office, Foard says the director will have more oversight over AI initiatives, and will be expected to be the “citywide subject matter expert” on the technology and its responsible use. The city is looking for someone with the technical expertise required who can also understand the “business value” of the technology, he said. There’s at least one candidate who says it’s ready to do the job: ChatGPT. “I would work to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner to benefit all New Yorkers,” the chatbot promised, when prompted to write a cover letter for the role. “I would also collaborate with other city agencies, academic institutions, and industry partners to promote innovation and develop cutting-edge solutions to the city’s most pressing problems.”Alas, the agency plans to hire a human.LinkCopy LinkSarah Holder is a writer for CityLab in New York, focused on urban politics, housing, and work.Plus FollowingPlus Get AlertsPlus Get AlertsTwitterFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailLinkGiftBookmarkSaveHave a confidential tip for our reporters?

Mere months after its last large-scale layoff, Meta is putting another set of jobs on the chopping block. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report was confirmed on March 14, when Meta announced layoffs affecting about 10,000 people, or 13% of its workforce, in another round of job cuts. The announcement was posted on the company’s website in a message titled “Update on Meta’s Year of Efficiency.”

Since mid-2022, Meta has been struggling to reel back costs. It spent too much, too quickly, on its big metaverse dreams while ad revenue slid due to a macroeconomic downturn and increased competition. A $12-a-month subscription for blue ticks won’t be enough to make up for it all.

A brief timeline of Meta’s jobs shuffle

November 2022: Meta trimmed its workforce by 13% last November, when it slashed 11,000 roles to save costs and increase efficiency. It was the first time since Facebook was founded 18 years ago that the company announced mass layoffs.

January 2023: Meta rescinds full-time offers made to a “small number of candidates” while it readjusts hiring priorities—a cut of this kind is a first for the company. Engineer and writer Gergely Orosz tweeted that the decision affected around 20 new grads in London with offers due to start in February.

February 2023: Meta starts “flattening” its organizational structure, asking managers and directors to transition to individual contributor jobs—non-managerial posts focused on coding, designing and research—or leave. It also delays setting team budgets as it plans a fresh round of layoffs.

Culling the Metaverse

Besides all the payrolls, there’s another massive black hole that’s been sucking Meta’s money: the metaverse.

Just after the pandemic, when everyone was working, living, and breathing online, Zuckerbeg floated the metaverse as the next big thing and touted Facebook as its leader. He went all in to create an immersive world that can be accessed through virtual reality (VR) headsets and special glasses—albeit a slightly creepy world of floating torsos. It led to a brand and name change, and gobbled up billions of dollars in investment.

But it didn’t quite catch on.

Nobody used Horizon Worlds, the social universe that was quickly dismissed as a poor quality video game despite Zuckerberg’s insistence that it was more. In making it accessible, Meta made it subpar. And if Zuckerberg thought he could tap into the 13- to 17-year-old market to make the product work, he has to think again. US Senators are opposing the move to open the platform to teens.

Zuckerberg is quietly killing the metaverse and pivoting to a “new top-level product group at Meta focused on generative AI to turbocharge our work in this area,” as he wrote in a Feb. 27 Facebook post—the same day OpenAI teased dialogue-based ChatGPT. The team building AI-powered products is led by Ahmad Al-Dahle, who’ll report to Facebook Meta’s chief product officer Chris Cox.

Facebook’s focus on ChatGPT-like AI 

Last month, on Feb. 24, the company introduced a new large language model called LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI. It’s the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, which entails mining vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content.

“In the short term, we’ll focus on building creative and expressive tools. Over the longer term, we’ll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post.

For now, the most pronounced remnant of that remains of the metaverse is the hardware–the headsets—meant for enthusiasts like gamers and crypto fans. 

Quotable: Meta messed up the Metaverse mission

“It’s just flabbergasting to me that people with so many resources can so spectacularly mess things up when the opportunity to do something cool is there,” -Celia Pearce, a professor of game design at Northeastern who has been studying non-game virtual worlds since the mid-1990s, on the Metaverse failure

Meta’s dashed Metaverse dreams, by the digits

42%: Share of 1,000 Meta employees surveyed in October 2022 who did not understand and internalize the company’s metaverse vision

$24 billion: Cumulative loss amassed by Reality Labs, the division housing metaverse projects, in 2021 and 2022. Of this, $13.7 billion was last year’s loss, which grew from the year before.

“About 80%...a little more”: Meta’s investments going towards the core business, namely its family of apps—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and the ads business associated with that. 

“A little less than 20%”: Meta’s investment goes towards Reality Labs, as told to The New York Times Dealbook conference last November.

$562 billion: The current market cap of the once trillion dollar company Meta

275%: How much more expensive Meta’s Quest Pro VR headset was that its predecessor Quest 2 at $1,500 when it launched five months ago

$1,000: The price of Meta’s Quest Pro VR headset fell 33% in the US and Canada as of Sunday (Mar. 5) as Meta brings it in line with competitors like HTC Vive XR Elite. By March 15, other markets are due to follow suit

$30: The difference between the low-end, 128GB version of the Quest 2 headset at $400 and the expanded-storage 256GB Quest 2 headset, which is now retailing at $430 instead of $500 

20 million: Units of the Quest line sold to date, but how often are they being used? Meta Vice President for VR Mark Rabkin reportedly told employees that “the newer cohorts that are coming in…they’re just not as into it.” Maybe the thinner 2024 variant at “the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market” will make it more popular.

LinkedIn Launches Generative AI Writing Assistant for Profiles and Job Descriptions



Eric Hal Schwartz  on March 16, 2023 at 8:00 am

LinkedIn has introduced generative AI writing tools to help users put together their personal profiles and create job descriptions. The social media platform has also curated a collection of 100 courses on AI for LinkedIn Learning, with another 20 specifically covering generative AI.
LinkedIn Storytelling
LinkedIn is using two different versions of OpenAI’s large language models for its new features. The job descriptions rely on GPT-3.5, while the profiles employ the brand new GPT-4 model. The profile help is only available for LinkedIn Premium subscribers right now, but any recruiter can use the job description assistant. Recruiters fill in basic details about the job, including the title and the company hiring for the role, and the AI then offers a job description to review and post. Users struggling to describe themselves on LinkedIn can use the new personal profile AI to construct a narrative about themselves. The AI will pick out experiences and skills to showcase, then write a headline and an about section to match.
“Maintaining your authenticity and using the content already on your profile, our tool identifies the most important skills and experiences to highlight in your About and Headline sections and crafts suggestions to make your profile stand out. By doing the heavy lifting for you, the tool saves you time and energy while still maintaining your unique voice and style,” LinkedIn chief product officerTomer Cohen said. ” One thing that will always stay our guiding principle: How can we use AI — or any other technology — to help you connect to economic opportunities? Everything we do at LinkedIn starts there.”
Generative Muse
LinkedIn’s tools are narrowly tailored to the social media platform’s needs, but the idea of supporting writing tasks with generative AI is very popular. Similar tools are almost a standard feature now for any software or app that supports or requires written content. For instance, Grammarly recently released its new GrammarlyGO tools based on precisely that concept. OpenAI and rivals like Jasper have created APIs to further extend their offerings in the space. The new Notion AI assistant, website creator Wix, and graphic design platform Canva all count AI writing assistance powered by a mix of generative AI APIs among their features. Not to mention the writing-specific generative AI companies like Regie. Google even jumped on the trend this week with generative text tools for Google Docs and Gmail.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved in recent years, becoming a valuable tool for businesses to streamline operations, reduce production costs, and meet company objectives. In 2023, AI will play an increasingly vital role in leadership decision-making, with predictive analytics, natural language processing, and more.


The Role of AI in Today’s Workplace

Whereas digital technology was once a source of leisure, it is now the very means by which society functions on an everyday basis.

We live in a time of exponential growth, with technological advances becoming more fundamental than ever to today’s workplace. According to recent findings, 35% of businesses already use AI, with 42% of companies considering implementing AI in the future.

Predictive analytics is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses data mining, machine learning, and statistical algorithms to analyze current and historical data to make predictions about future events or trends. By identifying patterns in data, predictive analytics can help businesses make more informed decisions about everything from inventory management to customer behavior.

Businesses use predictive analytics to forecast demand for particular products based on past sales data and market trends. Predictive analytics help companies optimize their production and inventory levels to avoid stockouts, ultimately reducing costs and improving profitability.
Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is another branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on understanding and interpreting human language. NLP algorithms analyze text data to extract meaning, sentiment, and intent. This enables businesses to understand customer feedback better, automate customer service interactions, and generate personalized content.
Businesses might use NLP algorithms to analyze customer feedback on social media to identify common issues and trends. NLP algorithms can help companies address these issues proactively, improving overall customer experience.
Fraud Detection
Fraud is a significant concern for businesses, as it leads to financial loss and legal consequences, not to mention the reputational damage fraud can inflict. Fraud is also challenging to detect, especially when it’s sophisticated and targeted.
In addition to machine learning, behavior analysis, and natural language processing, AI is also effective in analyzing large amounts of data to identify anomalies or patterns that deviate from the norm. AI can help identify potential fraudulent activity, such as unusual spending patterns or transactions. AI can also analyze user networks, which helps identify possible fraud rings and block access to prevent further fraudulent activity.
How Leaders Can Leverage AI Initiatives to Improve Decision-Making
Successful implementation of AI requires strategy and collaboration between various stakeholders, and business leaders play a critical role in driving the success of those initiatives.
Leaders and executives must be proactive in allocating sufficient funding, attracting and developing the right talent, collaborating and partnering with other organizations, and considering the ethical implications. Here are some key ways leaders can begin leveraging AI initiatives to improve decision-making:
1. Vision and Strategy
Leaders must first understand AI’s potential benefits and risks and how it fits into the business strategy. Leaders must communicate intentions and goals to the organization and garner support from stakeholders, ensuring that everyone shares the same vision.
2. Investment and Funding
Executives must then allocate sufficient resources, and not just when it comes to funding. Finding and fostering the right talent and ensuring the company has the right technology infrastructure are both necessary for AI initiatives to succeed. As a result, many leaders hire data analysts, AI engineers, and other specialists who can design, develop, and deploy AI systems.
3. Collaboration and Partnership
Leaders can collaborate with other organizations, including technology vendors and research institutions, to stay up-to-date with the latest AI trends and innovations.
4. Ethical Considerations
Consider the ethical implications of AI: issues related to data privacy, bias, and transparency. Leaders must ensure that AI systems are developed and used responsibly, with appropriate controls and safeguards in place.
5. Managing Change
Understand that implementing AI initiatives also drives organizational change. Leaders should prepare to be in consistent dialogue with stakeholders about the progress of their AI initiatives. They should also prepare training and support for everyone involved in AI implementation, including managing teams who may be resistant to organizational change.
AI rapidly transforms businesses across industries. Organizations that successfully leverage AI can gain a competitive edge in an unstable and confusing market. By leveraging AI to inform leadership decision-making, companies can improve accuracy, reduce errors, and optimize their operations, leading to better outcomes and increased profitability. As AI technology continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, we can expect to see even more significant improvements in accuracy and productivity in the workplace.

AI-generated art can be copyrighted, say US officials – with a catch

Some non-artificial intelligence needed




Katyanna Quach                                



Thu 16 Mar 2023                                     // 
23:54 UTC                                



































The US Copyright Office will consider an AI-generated work copyrightable if a human can prove they themselves put a meaningful amount of creative effort into the final content, according to a policy published on Thursday.
AI software capable of automatically generating images or text from an input prompt or instruction has made it easier for people to churn out content. Correspondingly, the USCO has received an increasing number of applications to register copyright protections for material, especially artwork, created using such tools.
US law states that intellectual property can be copyrighted only if it was the product of human creativity, and the USCO only acknowledges work authored by humans at present. Machines and generative AI algorithms, therefore, cannot be authors, and their outputs are not copyrightable. 







Digital art, poems, and books generated using tools like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, ChatGPT, or even the newly released GPT-4 will not be protected by copyright if they were created by humans using only a text description or prompt, USCO director Shira Perlmutter warned. 











""If a work's traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not register it,"" she wrote in a document outlining copyright guidelines.
""For example, when an AI technology receives solely a prompt from a human and produces complex written, visual, or musical works in response, the 'traditional elements of authorship' are determined and executed by the technology – not the human user. 







""Instead, these prompts function more like instructions to a commissioned artist – they identify what the prompter wishes to have depicted, but the machine determines how those instructions are implemented in its output.""

The USCO will consider content created using AI if a human author has crafted something beyond the machine's direct output. A digital artwork that was formed from a prompt, and then edited further using Photoshop, for example, is more likely to be accepted by the office. The initial image created using AI would not be copyrightable, but the final product produced by the artist might be.
Thus it would appear the USCO is simply saying: yes, if you use an AI-powered application to help create something, you have a reasonable chance at applying for copyright, just as if you used non-AI software. If it's purely machine-made from a prompt, you need to put some more human effort into it.
In a recent case, officials registered a copyright certificate for a graphic novel containing images created using Midjourney. The overall composition and words were protected by copyright since they were selected and arranged by a human, but the individual images themselves were not.
""In the case of works containing AI-generated material, the Office will consider whether the AI contributions are the result of 'mechanical reproduction' or instead of an author's 'own original mental conception, to which [the author] gave visible form'. The answer will depend on the circumstances, particularly how the AI tool operates and how it was used to create the final work. This is necessarily a case-by-case inquiry,"" the USCO declared.


Perlmutter urged people applying for copyright protection for any material generated using AI to state clearly how the software was used to create the content, and show which parts of the work were created by humans. If they fail to disclose this information accurately, or try to hide the fact it was generated by AI, USCO will cancel their certificate of registration and their work may not be protected by copyright law. ® Sponsored: Don’t be complacent on cybersecurity resilience

There’s a common perception that artificial intelligence will help streamline our work. There are even fears that it could wipe out the need for some jobs altogether.But in a study of science laboratories I carried out with three colleagues at the University of Manchester, the introduction of automated processes that aim to simplify work – and free people’s time – can also make that work more complex, generating new tasks that many workers might perceive as mundane.In the study, published in Research Policy, we looked at the work of scientists in a field called synthetic biology, or synbio for short. Synbio is concerned with redesigning organisms to have new abilities. It is involved in growing meat in the lab, in new ways of producing fertilisers and in the discovery of new drugs.Synbio experiments rely on advanced, robotic platforms to repetitively move a large number of samples. They also use machine learning to analyse the results of large-scale experiments.These, in turn, generate large amounts of digital data. This process is known as “digitalisation”, where digital technologies are used to transform traditional methods and ways of working.Some of the key objectives of automating and digitalising scientific processes are to scale up the science that can be done while saving researchers time to focus on what they would consider more “valuable” work.Paradoxical resultHowever, in our study, scientists were not released from repetitive, manual or boring tasks as one might expect. Instead, the use of robotic platforms amplified and diversified the kinds of tasks researchers had to perform. There are several reasons for this.Among them is the fact that the number of hypotheses (the scientific term for a testable explanation for some observed phenomenon) and experiments that needed to be performed increased. With automated methods, the possibilities are amplified.Scientists said it allowed them to evaluate a greater number of hypotheses, along with the number of ways that scientists could make subtle changes to the experimental set-up. This had the effect of boosting the volume of data that needed checking, standardising and sharing.Also, robots needed to be “trained” in performing experiments previously carried out manually. Humans, too, needed to develop new skills for preparing, repairing, and supervising robots. This was done to ensure there were no errors in the scientific process.Scientific work is often judged on output such as peer-reviewed publications and grants. However, the time taken to clean, troubleshoot and supervise automated systems competes with the tasks traditionally rewarded in science. These less valued tasks may also be largely invisible – particularly because managers are the ones who would be unaware of mundane work due to not spending as much time in the lab.The synbio scientists carrying out these responsibilities were not better paid or more autonomous than their managers. They also assessed their own workload as being higher than those above them in the job hierarchy.Wider lessonsIt’s possible these lessons might apply to other areas of work too. ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that “learns” from information available on the web. When prompted by questions from online users, the chatbot offers answers that appear well-crafted and convincing.According to Time magazine, in order for ChatGPT to avoid returning answers that were racist, sexist or offensive in other ways, workers in Kenya were hired to filter toxic content delivered by the bot.There are many often invisible work practices needed for the development and maintenance of digital infrastructure. This phenomenon could be described as a “digitalisation paradox”. It challenges the assumption that everyone involved or affected by digitalisation becomes more productive or has more free time when parts of their workflow are automated.Concerns over a decline in productivity are a key motivation behind organisational and political efforts to automate and digitalise everyday work. But we should not take promises of gains in productivity at face value.Instead, we should challenge the ways we measure productivity by considering the invisible types of tasks humans can accomplish, beyond the more visible work that is usually rewarded.We also need to consider how to design and manage these processes so that technology can more positively add to human capabilities.Barbara Ribeiro is Associate professor in innovation management and policy, SKEMA Business School and Honorary Lecturer, University of Manchester.This article first appeared on The Conversation.

The tech giant plans to integrate its office products with generative AI that can do things like generate an entire document or create images based on a prompt. Workers will be able to access these capabilities by clicking a new wand icon that’ll appear in their apps.Google plans to begin rolling out some features, starting with writing functions in Google Docs and Gmail, to select enterprise customers within the next couple of weeks, it said. It’s unclear when other features may become available.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGoogle comes in a far second to Microsoft Office when it comes to workplace productivity tools, according to market research firm Gartner. Open AI created a lot of buzz last year after rolling out its text-based generative AI tool ChatGPT, which Microsoft integrated into its search engine Bing this year. Since then, workers have been experimenting with whether ChatGPT can aid with work tasks. But experts advise people to be cautious when using the tech for work, as generative AI can produce content that’s factually incorrect, doesn’t make sense, is similar or almost identical to an unknown source, or, in the case of images, is visibly contorted.💻Follow TechnologyFollowTo be sure, Google has integrated artificial intelligence — like the predictive text element in Gmail — into its software for years. But Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, characterized the latest AI announcements as the next phase of development, in which humans will be supported by AI collaborators. Google said it will collect the interaction data customers input and receive to improve its tech for initial test customers.Here are some of the ways workers may be able to use the new Workspace AI integrations, according to the information  Google provided.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWriting documents and emailsGoogle’s generative AI will be able to produce an entire draft based off a topic or set of bullet points for workers who need help getting words on the page, whether that’s in an email or a Google Doc.A marketing manager might ask the tech to create a sales training plan for the next campaign, and Google Docs  would generate one from scratch, for example. Workers can also highlight portions of text and ask Google’s AI to rewrite them in a specific tone. For example, they could use commands like “Make this more formal” or “Make this whimsical.” If you don’t like the first result, the “view another” button is expected to produce another one. And if you don’t know what tone you want to use, you will be able to click “I’m feeling lucky,” and Google will choose one for you.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe AI will be able to summarize email threads with a prompt like “Catch me up on this email conversation.” Or it could create a brief based on several Google documents or emails. Google expects it to also allow users to help prioritize emails.Create images and presentations quicklyWorkers may be able to soon use AI capabilities to cut down the time it takes to create a presentation in Google Slides.Users are expected to be able to prompt the app, a competitor to Microsoft’s PowerPoint, to create images for a specific slide. Google says it also expects to allow workers to create AI-generated audio or video to embed in their slides, but it didn’t have more details to share.Autofill some of your spreadsheetsWhen it comes to spreadsheets, workers are expected use AI to help complete filling them out faster or understand their data.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn Sheets, Google’s spreadsheet app, AI is expected to help generate formulas, offer analysis and insights, and categorize data. For example, in a spreadsheet that has a column for personalized messages to customers, the AI could automatically fill in the blanks for every customer with one prompt.Make chats and meetings more productiveGoogle also wants to help workers make their communications with peers more productive and efficient.On Google Meet, workers are expected to be able to automatically track meeting notes, create checklists for action items and summarize the meeting. The features are expansions from statements the company made last year when it announced transcriptions for Meet as well as summaries of conversations in its group chat platform, Spaces.Google also expects to integrate AI into Google Chat to allow workers to automate some workflows.  It didn’t have any more details to share about that future feature.Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

However, it’s important to remember that AI isn’t – and may never be – a replacement for human intelligence. Understanding this means learning its limits and recognizing the situations where human skills, knowledge, judgment, and creativity are still vital.

Learning how to use this powerful new technology to augment our own capabilities while freeing up our time to focus on more challenging, higher-value work will be a key workplace skill for many professionals in the age of AI.

PROMOTED
First, what is ChatGPT?
For those of you who may not have tried – or even heard of – ChatGPT yet, firstly, what’s it like living on Mars? Secondly, the Cliff’s Notes version is that it’s a conversational interface (or chatbot) that understands and generates human languages. Think Alexa or Siri but far more advanced and capable of handling much more complex inquiries and responses.

It’s an example of ""generative AI"" because it can use existing data to generate new outputs, ranging from poetry and fiction to emails, essays, blog posts, and even computer code. ChatGPT was created by Open AI, which is funded by a number of technology and venture capital firms, most prominently Microsoft, who recently invested $10 billion and are integrating it into their Bing search engine. To get a little more technical, ChatGPT itself is actually a user interface (UI) for OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-3. It was trained on a dataset consisting of over 175 billion pieces of information, including web pages, books, and articles in many different languages.

How Can Professionals Supercharge Their Abilities With ChatGPT and Generative AI?

A recent guest on my webinar was Dominic Allon, CEO of cloud CRM solutions provider Pipedrive. Discussing how professionals and businesses will integrate generative AI into their work, he told me, ""It's helpful to reflect on how previous [technological advancements] have been integrated into the way we get work done.
“Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, often uses the example of a calculator – how does a calculator change the way we figure out math problems and teach math?
“It actually got integrated into the way we work quite quickly; My expectation is this new tool – this ability to generate text quickly in a foundational, quite generic but logical manner will get embedded quite quickly into the way we work.”
Many examples already exist of ways in which ChatGPT and related technologies can be used by professionals:
· Writers can use it to generate blogs, articles, and informational material.
· Teachers can use it to summarize educational material and create assignments.
· Financial professionals can automate bookkeeping and reporting.
· Lawyers can use it to summarize case law and quickly develop an understanding of areas of law that they have not previously studied.
· Marketers can use it to create ad copy and sales emails.
· Customer service agents can use it to generate responses to inquiries and compile FAQ documents on issues that are frequently raised.
· Healthcare professionals can use it to extract relevant information from medical records and examinations and compile reports and summaries of patient data.
Augment Your Skills With New Abilities
But that’s just the start. Crucially, professionals can use it to augment their abilities to carry out tasks that might happen to fall outside of their skillset or area of expertise.
For example, a data analyst might be good at drawing conclusions based on charts and statistics but not great at writing these up into reports for their colleagues. This is where generative AI can step in, lending a hand with day-to-day activities and enabling professionals to spend their time on tasks where their strength lies.
Conversely, a writer can use their analytical abilities to augment their written work with statistics, even if they aren’t great at statistical research and analysis themselves.
A teacher might be fantastic at drawing the best out of their students and encouraging them to achieve their potential in exams but not enjoy the process of creating lesson plans or designing learning material. They can put generative AI to work to fill in the blanks in their skillset and become a more rounded, capable professional.
And a computer programmer might instinctively know how to use their programming language of choice but find it hard to explain what their code is doing to a non-coder. Generative AI can annotate code and create human-language explanations of what’s happening under the hood (and even spot bugs they might have missed.)
As Allon puts it, “What this will do is free up those professionals to do two things … firstly to be more efficient and effective, and to own a wider scope of work. And secondly to [focus on] a higher level of cognitive tasks.”
One example comes from his previous career at QuickBooks. Allon told me that once automated tools were in place to handle routine tasks such as reconciling transactions, accountants have been able to spend more time working directly with clients and developing their role as “trusted advisors” within their own organizations or with clients.
""The other point here,"" he continues, ""is the role we all play in our different fields … will continue to be critically important because typically ChatGPT will offer up a fairly generic answer, and it's always the case that you'll have to augment that with a particular point of view, or the right tone and style for your company, so for me it’s about this combination of ‘better together’”.
The Way Forward
So, to summarize, there are three steps that we need to consider if we want to transform ourselves into supercharged, AI-augmented professionals. The first is to think about how AI can automate the routine and repetitive tasks we do every day.
Then we need to consider how it might expand our abilities and allow us to take on challenges that previously might have had us stumped or turning to others for help.
Last but by no means least, we need to think about how we can use the time we've freed up by harnessing generative AI to spend more time on truly human tasks. This means face-to-face time with clients, customers, and colleagues, as well as high-level strategic tasks, creative tasks, and work that requires us to come up with genuinely new ideas.
Taking this step-by-step approach is a great way to minimize our chances of being left behind by the AI revolution that's set to transform the world of work and make sure we’re in the best position to continue to add value.

Almost Half of Health Systems Use AI for Workforce Issues 


A survey shows that 47.5 percent of health systems currently use artificial intelligence solutions to address workforce challenges, with the rest considering an AI solution for this purpose.

With support from Outbound AI, the Health Management Academy (the Academy) conducted a survey showing that due to common staffing issues within health systems, many C-suite executives are using artificial intelligence (AI) for back office and clinical operations.







In healthcare, problems surrounding staffing and labor insufficiencies have grown immensely, particularly over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. To compensate for this issue, health systems are increasingly turning to AI.
To gather insights into the state of AI and its utility in addressing workforce issues, the Academy used quantitative survey and qualitative interview methods, polling 40 executives from 40 leading health systems. According to researchers, all involved in the survey were deemed to have a relatively high level of familiarity with AI.
According to the survey, the portion of executives that currently use AI for workforce challenges is just under half (47.5 percent). But the rest (52.5 percent) noted that their health system is considering the implementation of AI for this reason.
It also noted that the order in which AI investments are generally prioritized is back-office processes, clinical operations, and clinical care.
Encompassing revenue cycle, human resources, and supply chain management, back-office processes commonly involve human errors. According to the survey, 78 percent of executives claim that their health systems are either actively using or considering AI for revenue cycle management.
The report also revealed that conversational AI is growing popular among providers. Described as a tool that uses advanced automation, AI, and natural language processing to comprehend human language, conversational AI is currently being used by 27.5 percent of health systems, and 72.5 percent are considering using it.
Additionally, nursing is being targeted for AI investment. According to survey data, 15 percent of executives indicated that their health system is using AI for nursing. However, 82.5 percent stated that their health system is considering its use for this purpose.
Regarding investments, researchers noted that growth appeared likely in the next one to three years. Among those who claimed their health system uses AI for workforce issues, 84.5 percent stated that they plan to increase their use of these solutions in the near future.
Further, in evaluating AI, particularly for revenue cycle management, the survey highlighted which factors executives focus on. These include interoperability with EHRs, privacy and security, the ability to augment EHR capabilities, expected return on investment, and anticipated value (hard and soft) over the course of a three-plus year period.
Additionally, executives leverage various sources when evaluating AI solutions, including existing technologies and partnerships, recommendations from peers, and assessments of successful use cases and real-world return on investment data.
Similarly, a survey from December 2021 found that many healthcare executives were considering AI use to improve patient outcomes, support cost savings, and promote health equity.
The fourth annual Optum Survey on AI in Healthcare included responses from 500 senior healthcare executives from hospitals, health plans, and life sciences companies. Almost all (96 percent) believed AI is critical to achieving health equality goals.
The survey also indicated that 85 percent of health leaders noted that they had an AI strategy at the time, with 48 percent already starting one.

SINGAPORE: Imagine Monet in the modern world – using artificial intelligence (AI), he’s created thousands more of his famous water lilies paintings. But who owns them – Monet or the AI? 
The question about copyright and AI artwork has hit headlines recently. Last week, Japan’s first fully AI-drawn manga hit the shelves.Advertisement 












ADVERTISEMENTThe author of the 100-page sci-fi manga, who admitted he has “absolutely zero” drawing talent, took just six weeks to finish the book. 
He entered text prompts – such as “pink hair” and “Asian boy” – in the programme to conjure images of the protagonist.
Last month, the US Copyright Office ruled that images in the graphic novel Zarya of the Dawn – which was created using the AI system Midjourney – should not have been granted copyright.
The decision was one of the first by a US court about copyright protection for works created by AI.
In Singapore, the law holds no mention of whether AI-generated works have copyright. CNA looks at how artists are using AI to create new pieces and the concerns around protecting their work.Advertisement 












AI ART
With AI becoming increasingly mainstream, local artists are experimenting with its uses.
Ms Wyn-Lyn Tan, a visual artist who currently has an exhibition along the Esplanade Tunnel, uses AI as a tool to develop her artistic practice.





      What is copyright?
  

Copyright protects the expression of ideas in tangible forms, according to the Intellectual Property Office in Singapore (IPOS).
“When you own the copyright to a work, you control the use and commercial exploitation of these works. This means that you have the right to prevent others from reproducing, publishing, performing, communicating to the public, or adapting to your work,” said IPOS on its website.
Examples of works protected under copyright law include literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works.
The main objective for copyright can be summarised in three things: Rewarding and recognising authors, incentivising the creation of new works and benefiting society through creative works.
In Singapore, an author is automatically granted copyright protection as soon as they create and express their work in a tangible form. No registration is required.

Her exhibition features an installation of 20 paintings and six generative AI video works. 
To create AI art pieces, Ms Tan feeds “thousands of images"" of her own paintings into the machine learning programme, which generates new art based on her old pieces.
“This digital platform kind of pushed me to think about how I could use it as a tool to extend my language of painting,” she added. Advertisement 












Mr Lim Wui-Liang, who uses the AI tool Midjourney for his project titled AI Art News, describes it as “fast, fun and intoxicating”. 
The 43-year-old tech employee said the difference between art and AI-generated art is the “speed at which it is produced”. 
“It would be impossible for me to create some of the pieces on AI Art News by myself. But with AI, anything that I envision in my head can be generated in mere seconds,” said Mr Lim.

AUTHORSHIP AND ORIGINALITY
As the use of AI programmes like ChatGPT become normalised, the law has yet to fully catch up with the implications of such use.
“There is presently no legal definition for AI art,” said lawyer Ronald Wong, director at Covenant Chambers.Advertisement 












“I would describe it as AI-generated works. The term ‘works’ does not assume it is artistic or art, and includes a range of forms including image, design, music, and videos.”
The law does not have any specific rules on AI-generated works, explained Mr Wong, who handles legal disputes around tech and intellectual property among others.
It is unclear if AI-generated artworks will be protected by copyright. The main issues are authorship and originality.
“One legal view is that AI-generated works are produced with no human authorship whereas traditional art is created by human authors. Human authorship is required for copyright to arise,” said Mr Wong.
“Originality is also a requirement for copyright. It is argued that without human authors, there is no originality.” 
In 2016, Dr Stephen Thaler – who generated the artwork A Recent Entrance To Paradise using an AI system he created – was denied copyright registration. A US judge ruled that artificial intelligence cannot get a patent for its creations, ruling that such a privilege is reserved for people.
Professor David Tan, co-director of the Centre for Technology, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and the Law at the National University of Singapore, breaks down AI’s role in generating artwork and compares it to traditional tools.
Copyright law typically views art as an intellectual creation – a product of the human mind or human creativity.
""Whatever you use to produce your art are just tools to assist the humans who create the work, like when you use acrylic on canvas to paint, or when using a piano to compose music. So AI, no matter how sophisticated, when used as a tool, is similar to all these traditional tools,"" said Prof Tan.

Commentary: Is it considered art when artists use AI to produce books and images?













Ms Tan said her pieces made with AI belong to her, not the programme because it generates pieces only from what she feeds into it – her own paintings. She said she thinks of the machine ""simply as a tool"".
""One cannot exist without the other ... the programme is actually learning to mimic my artistic style in order to generate this stream of unique digital artworks,” she told CNA.
“Without me curating and inputting my images, the machine learning programme will not be able to get to a point where they churn out a work that I feel is me.
“I’m actually doing a lot of post-programme editing on my own because it’s still an artistic medium. So I’m not just simply spitting it out with the programme.""
She added: “I think when one of my physical, traditional collectors look at my digital artwork, they can say ‘oh, that’s a Wyn-Lyn Tan’.""
Similarly, Mr Lim does not leave AI to do all the work.
Inspired by news headlines for his art, Mr Lim identifies a story and constructs the image by “running through various types of art, iconography and pop culture”. 
“I break down this image into prompts which I feed into Midjourney. The first set of images generated usually doesn’t make the cut,” he said.
“I’ll refine my prompts and re-generate again, repeating this process until I get an image I’m happy with. More often than not, there are more hits than misses.”

SHOULD COPYRIGHT LAWS CHANGE?
The keywords remain when looking at whether an artwork can be protected by law – authorship and originality.
Even though artists are clear about the role they play in their art, some AI works remain unprotected by copyright law.
“I wouldn’t advocate that we recognise autonomous AI-generated work,” Prof Tan said.
He explained that no country has recognised autonomous AI-generated work and Singapore needs not be the first to do so. 
Even in countries like England where copyright protection is available for computer-generated works, the courts still require the identification of the author as a person who had completed the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work. 
“There is a lot of noise out there and it’s really people just wanting to take extreme positions so they get more media coverage. The fundamentals of copyright laws protect only human creativity,"" he said.
When considering whether copyright has been infringed, Prof Tan said the court will decide if enough of an artwork is copied, by looking at its protectable features. 
Ideas are not protected expressions, he added. 
Taking Monet as an example, his style of painting is “not a copyrightable expression”, but Monet’s particular perspective of the water lilies in a painting would be considered a protected feature, explained the professor. This would allow other artists to paint water lilies in a pond in a different way or from a different point of view. 
Mr Wong said that there are situations where artists can take legal action. He advised creators to leave “deliberate fingerprints or symbolic signatures”.
“As long as there is substantial copying and there is a causal link between the copyrighted work and AI-generated work, there would be copyright infringement,” he explained.
“As to who would be sued, that would depend on the technical details of how the AI-generated work is produced.”
But he pointed to the other side of the legal debate, which views certain AI-generated works to have human authors and originality.
“In particular, AI-generated works created based on certain input of a human can be said to engage the human intellect and thus fulfil the authorship and originality requirements for copyright to arise,” he said.






      Monet's style of painting is “not a copyrightable expression”, but his particular perspective of the water lilies in a painting would be considered a protected feature, said Professor David Tan. (Image: iStock)

    






Mr Lim said AI artwork should be covered by copyright law, but it may be challenging.
“Some people may argue that since AI art infringes on the copyright of many artists because it draws on their work, it is not an original piece of art or is not eligible for copyright. Or that because AI art is produced by a machine, it cannot be copyrighted,” he said.
“But the initial creative vision – that spark – came from a human.”
He feels that the law has to protect not only AI artists but also artists whose work AI draws from.
“It has to be a two-way street … we need to start accepting AI artists as creators in their own right and we need to find a way for AI to ethically train on other artworks.”
WHAT NEXT AS AI BECOMES MORE MAINSTREAM?
Ms Tan is not worried about her pieces being stolen by AI, but admits it “is kind of scary”. She said she will continue to incorporate AI into her work.
""I am still excited about using AI as a way to extend my painting practice and my painting language. If it fits the concept of whatever it is I wish to be saying with my artwork, I would still be using AI,"" she added.
Mr Lim told CNA he feels “a bit uncomfortable” that his works are not safeguarded under copyright law but said that both physical art pieces and AI works “can be easily stolen by anyone if they really want to”.
At the end of the day it’s all about the integrity of the artists, said Ms Tan.
She added: “Of course, as an artist, I would really be glad for specific copyright rules but at the end of the day, who is able to police all this?”

SINGAPORE — An “employee” who can generate innovative marketing ideas, edit and craft proposals within seconds and perhaps, best of all, is willing to work for free.
For Ms Jane Neo, chief business officer and co-founder of maternity and baby products retailer KeaBabies, these are the attributes of ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence (AI) tool by OpenAI that has taken the world by storm in recent months.Advertisement 












She is among a number of Singapore bosses and workers who have been quick to embrace ChatGPT at work, with some caveats, while others remain decidedly wary of introducing the technology into the workplace.






 “ 

    We have even provided a tutorial on how to effectively utilise ChatGPT in specific areas of our work. We believe that it is a valuable tool that can help our employees work more efficiently and effectively.
              
          Ms Jane Neo, chief business officer and co-founder of KeaBabies
        

”







Ms Neo said: “We have introduced ChatGPT to our employees and strongly encourage its use in the workplace for all relevant tasks except for website SEO (search engine optimisation) content."" Search engines penalise AI written content.""
She also said: “We have even provided a tutorial on how to effectively utilise ChatGPT in specific areas of our work. We believe that it is a valuable tool that can help our employees work more efficiently and effectively.”
In a Reuters news article last month, it was reported that the chatbot reached about 100 million monthly active users within just two months of being launched in November last year.

Employers and employees in Singapore interviewed by TODAY said that they often use it to come up with ideas and for copywriting. They are still exploring other ways to use ChatGPT for work.
One company that has recently jumped on the rise of ChatGPT is real estate firm ERA Singapore, which integrated the commercial version of the product — GPT-3 — into its in-house processes.Advertisement 












Since March 7, real estate agents at the firm have been using the GPT-3 function to perform administrative tasks such as copywriting, social media content generation, crafting of emails and making property listings, through a mobile application to which all employees have access.
Mr Marcus Chu, chief executive officer of Apac Realty and ERA Asia Pacific, told TODAY: “Ultimately, it is a tool to make (agents) more efficient by saving their time.”
Companies in the creative industry have also hopped onto the AI bandwagon, such as video game publisher Ubisoft Singapore.
Mr Darryl Long, managing director of the firm, said that the company’s designers use in-house AI tools to design and develop games.

“Using AI supports our level designers to iterate faster, without interrupting their creative thought process, thereby allowing them to spend more time on high-value tasks.Advertisement 












“The AI tools manage to reduce the time taken to rebuild our game worlds from about three hours to a mere 13 seconds.” 
SOME BOSSES WARY OF CHATGPT'S SHORTCOMINGS
However, employers in industries where writing is central to the business may have a different take on using ChatGPT for work.






 “ 

    There are a lot of positives to ChatGPT, particularly in background research... But it cannot substitute for original writing. I have sent an advisory to my employees not to use ChatGPT in their writing beyond search queries.
              
          Dr Juliana Chan, chief executive officer of Wildtype Media Group
        

”







One example is Dr Juliana Chan, chief executive officer of media and publishing company Wildtype Media Group, who sets guidelines for her employees on the use of ChatGPT and is cautious about using it for clients’ projects. 
“There are a lot of positives to ChatGPT, particularly in background research and summarising large blocks of text. But it cannot substitute for original writing,"" she said.
""I have sent an advisory to my employees not to use ChatGPT in their writing beyond search queries.""Advertisement

      Tech rivals chase ChatGPT as AI race ramps up
  







Dr Chan added that the other reasons for disallowing the use of ChatGPT for writing projects include plagiarism concerns and the potential for generating inaccurate information.
“ChatGPT has a tendency to produce 'vanilla' or bland responses that don’t provide a unique perspective. There is no personality in its written output, which is why it cannot replace the creative element of a human being,” she said.
WORKERS EMBRACE CHATGPT, MINDFUL OF  LIMITATIONS
Employees, too, have been using ChatGPT for work, mainly for its editing and proofreading capacities. 
One is a civil servant in her 20s, who uses ChatGPT to edit her email and proposal drafts, and even compose case report drafts based on information that she feeds into the chatbot.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, she said that her writing had significantly improved since she used it to proofread and edit her work.
“I use ChatGPT to write event proposals and case reports,"" she said.

      Commentary: The good, bad and unknowns of letting Singapore’s civil servants use ChatGPT
  







""Usually higher-ups don’t understand what I’m trying to propose in my programmes because they don’t work on the ground and they will call me to clarify what I mean. But after using ChatGPT, they call me less often and my supervisor also said that my writing is satisfactory.""
The young woman said that she also used ChatGPT for writing challenging case reports where there is a lot of information to digest.
""With ChatGPT, I just input all the data and it produces a clear, short and simple summary of the case.” 
However, she is still mindful of ChatGPT’s limitations and the negative perceptions of using technology such as ChatGPT for work.
“One flaw is that ChatGPT is not consistent. There are cases where the bot barely edits my emails so I have to do that myself. And if there are too many people using the bot, I will have to wait for about an hour before I can use it,” she said. 
For senior media analyst Muhammad Iylia Mohd Hutta, ChatGPT does more than copywriting.
The 27-year-old, whose job entails media trawling and data cleaning, uses the chatbot to produce basic coding formulas and to process data. 
“My role is to customise and create analytical reports for clients and to optimise workflow, which is where ChatGPT comes in,"" he said.
He added that his employer and colleagues encourage its use for work.
“My workplace is very flexible in using ChatGPT. Everyone uses it and there are no guidelines set in stone about how to use the bot. We just make sure to fact-check and not take its output at face value.”
He noted that ChatGPT does have its limitations but it does not hinder or affect his work. For example, the bot relies on historical data up to 2021 only, which may lead to outdated information, and may fabricate information. 






 “ 

    I think there is some sort of preconceived notion about using AI tools like ChatGPT for work — that it’s not your original idea and it’s plagiarism. And therefore, if you use it, you are not demonstrating competency in doing your job.
              
          A social worker, who asked to remain anonymous
        

”







Another employee, who is in social work and wanted to be anonymous, said that she uses ChatGPT for “literally everything”, from writing emails or WhatsApp messages or social reports to brainstorming ideas for programmes.
The social worker who is in her 20s uses the chatbot by inserting her draft into the bot and prompting it to edit and refine her ideas. 
“I love ChatGPT. It provides a more tailored response than Google Search and saves me a lot of time, especially on administrative duties,"" she said.
""This allows me to focus my attention on more important things like speaking to clients and stakeholders and case planning.” 
She added that she does not tell her colleagues or employer that she uses ChatGPT for work for fear of being seen as incompetent or plagiarising her work.
“I think there is some sort of preconceived notion about using AI tools like ChatGPT for work — that it’s not your original idea and it’s plagiarism. And therefore, if you use it, you are not demonstrating competency in doing your job.""
She added: ""I don’t think this is true. The bot just supports what I can and already do, it just makes my work faster and saves a lot of my time.”
Even before starting work, prospective employees can use ChatGPT to clean up their resume and boost their chances of securing a job.
Human resources analyst Adrian Tan said that people are already using the chatbot to draft and edit resumes and cover letters.
“The bot is especially helpful for those who are not natural good writers to meet the benchmark of a good prospective employee,"" he said. 
He added that companies, especially multinational corporations that receive many applicants, have already been using AI to filter out unsuitable hires and pick the “best fit” candidates.
APPLY ‘GOLDILOCKS RULE’ WHEN USING CHATGPT
When it comes to using ChatGPT in the workplace, Associate Professor Karin Avnit at the Singapore Institute of Technology said that one should apply the ""Goldilocks rule"" of not too much and not too little.
“This means we shouldn’t completely abandon ChatGPT, but also not go to the other end of using it for everything without caution,"" Assoc Prof Avnit said.
“Employers should be mindful of the need to train people to work with such tools well and understand ChatGPT’s strengths and limitations, so that employees can be productive in their work with these AI assistants.”
Mr Gerry Chng, risk advisory executive director at consultancy firm Deloitte, who specialises in cybersecurity and risk management, agreed.
He said that companies should learn how to adopt AI in their workflow processes.
“Companies that disregard the advancement of AI are putting themselves at a dangerous disadvantage of being left behind. This technology has the potential to change how we work and make work more efficient.” 
However, because ChatGPT has some limitations, such as providing output that is inaccurate or not factual, he recommended that companies and employers set guidelines for their staff members.
This includes not disclosing confidential information and always fact-checking ChatGPT's output.
""There should also be transparency, in the sense that employees should acknowledge that some parts of their work were generated by AI, if any,” he added.

Some prediction experts predicted a decade ago that almost half of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI by 2023 (!) or, at most, by 2033, mainly impacting low-skill jobs (e.g., no more truck drivers because we will have self-driving trucks). Other crystal-ball observers argued that in contrast to previous waves of automation, we are entering a new era in which the most affected will be highly-skilled knowledge workers.


The tight labor market of recent years has suppressed somewhat these dire predictions. The widespread excitement about generative AI, however, is bringing back the anxiety about jobs, especially the creative kind of jobs.

According to the Harris Poll, “most workers are wary of generative AI,” and 50% don’t trust the technology. The Atlantic tells us confidently: “No technology in modern memory has caused mass job loss among highly educated workers. Will generative AI be an exception?... While it is difficult to predict the exact extent of this trend, it is clear that AI will have a significant impact on the job market for college-educated workers.”

The only thing true in this “clear” prediction is that its difficult to make predictions, especially about the future. But it is certainly possible to assess predictions about the future of work. All you need is knowledge of historical facts and an analysis of past failed predictions.

Let’s start with history. Already with the invention of the earliest proto-computer, Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace saw its potential (in 1843) as a symbol manipulator. She mused about the possibilities for a much broader range of automation beyond speeding up calculation, including creative tasks such as composing music.

Lovelace made clear, however, that what became to be known as “artificial intelligence,” depends on human intelligence and does not replace it. Rather, it augments it, sometimes throwing new light on an established body of knowledge but never developing it from scratch: “The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.”

More generally, Lovelace argued that “In considering any new subject, there is frequently a tendency, first, to overrate what we find to be already interesting or remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, to undervalue the true state of the case, when we do discover that our notions have surpassed those that were really tenable.”
In this she anticipated the oft-repeated Silicon Valley’s maxim (known as Amara’s Law): “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”
That “law” worked overtime with the emergence in the 1940s of “giant brains,” as the first electronic, digital computers were called at the time, a century after Lovelace’s mother referred to the Analytical Engine as “Babbage’s thinking machine.” Not a “working machine” or “manual labor machine,” but a “thinking,” “brain”-like machine, a knowledge worker potentially replacing human knowledge workers.
In his 1947 talk at the London Mathematical Society about the ACE, one of these early “giant brains,” Alan Turing estimated that it could do the work of 10,000 “computers.” This was one of the first authoritative assessments of the possible impact of modern computers on jobs—not manual jobs but high-skill jobs. The “computers” were the highly educated humans performing calculations, entirely replaced by modern computers by the 1960s. Modern computers, however, created new job categories such as “programmers” and “systems analysts.”
Popularizing the term “automation,” John Diebold wrote in a 1953 Harvard Business Review article: “The effect of automation on the information handling functions of business will probably be more spectacular and far-reaching [than its impact on factory workers]. Repetitive office work, when in sufficient bulk as in insurance companies, will be put on at least a partially automatic basis. Certain functions, such as filing and statistical analysis on the lower management levels, will be performed by machines. Yet very few offices will be entirely automatic. Much day-to-day work—answering correspondence and the like—will have to be done by human beings.”
Diebold established one of the first consulting companies advising businesses on how to adopt modern computers. An entire new industry and entire new breed of knowledge workers followed in his path.
Computers have altered, augmented and replaced knowledge work since the 1950s. How about that quintessential knowledge work, that of a lawyer? Sure, today we have e-discovery leading to “armies of expensive lawyers, replaced by cheaper software.” But how many expensive lawyers were “replaced” by the advent of LexisNexis in the 1970s?
Diebold predicted that the “day-to-day work” would not be automated and what he probably had in mind was that secretaries will keep their jobs. The fact that they didn’t show how difficult it is to predict what impact computers will have (or not have) on knowledge work. Secretaries were not replaced by computers, but by managers who accepted the new social norm that it was not beneath them to “answer correspondence and the like,” as long as they did it with the new status symbol—the personal computer.
Failed predictions can reveal a lot about why yesterday’s futures did not materialize. I have in my files a great example, a report published in 1976 by the Long Range Planning Service of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), titled “Office of the Future.”
The author of the report was a Senior Industrial Economist at SRI’s Electronics Industries Research Group, and a “recognized authority on the subject of business automation.” His bio blurb indicates that he “also worked closely with two of the Institute’s engineering laboratories in developing his thinking for this study. The Augmentation Research Center has been putting the office of the future to practical test for almost ten years… Several Information Science Laboratory personnel have been working with state-of-the-art equipment and systems that are the forerunners of tomorrow’s products. The author was able to tap this expertise to gain a balanced picture of the problems and opportunities facing office automation.”
And what was the result of all this research and analysis? The manager of 1985, the report predicted, will not have a personal secretary. Instead, he (decidedly not she) will be assisted, along with other managers, by a centralized pool of assistants (decidedly and exclusively, according to the report, of the female persuasion). He will contact the “administrative support center” whenever he needs to dictate a memo to a “word processing specialist,” find a document (helped by an “information storage/retrieval specialist”), or rely on an “administrative support specialist” to help him make decisions.
Of particular interest is the report’s discussion of the sociological factors driving the transition to the “office of the future.” Forecasters often leave out of their analysis the annoying and uncooperative (with their forecast) motivations and aspirations of the humans involved. But this report does consider sociological factors, in addition to organizational, economic, and technological trends. And it’s worth quoting at length what it says on the subject:
“The major sociological factor contributing to change in the business office is ‘women’s liberation.’ Working women are demanding and receiving increased responsibility, fulfillment, and opportunities for advancement. The secretarial position as it exists today is under fire because it usually lacks responsibility and advancement potential. The normal (and intellectually unchallenging) requirements of taking dictation, typing, filing, photocopying, and telephone handling leave little time for the secretary to take on new and more demanding tasks. The responsibility level of many secretaries remains fixed throughout their working careers. These factors can negatively affect the secretary’s motivation and hence productivity. In the automated office of the future, repetitious and dull work is expected to be handled by personnel with minimal education and training. Secretaries will, in effect, become administrative specialists, relieving the manager they support of a considerable volume of work.”
Regardless of the women’s liberation movement of his day, the author could not see beyond the creation of a two-tier system in which some women would continue to perform dull and unchallenging tasks, while other women would be “liberated” into a fulfilling new job category of “administrative support specialist.” In this 1976 forecast, there are no women managers.
But this is not the only sociological factor the report missed. The most interesting sociological revolution of the office of the 1980s – and one missing from most (all?) accounts of the PC revolution – is what managers (male and female) did with their new word processing, communicating, calculating machine. They took over some of the “dull” secretarial tasks that no self-respecting manager would deign to perform before the 1980s.
This was the real revolution: The typing of memos (later emails), the filing of documents, the recording, tabulating, and calculating. In short, a large part of the management of office information, previously exclusively in the hands of secretaries, became in the 1980s (and progressively more so in the 1990s and beyond) an integral part of the work of business executives.
This was very difficult, maybe impossible, to predict. It was a question of status. No manager would type before the 1980s because it was perceived as work that was not commensurate with his status. Many managers started to type in the 1980s because now they could do it with a new “cool” tool, the PC, which conferred on them the leading-edge, high-status image of this new technology. What mattered was that you were important enough to have one of these cool things, not that you performed with it tasks that were considered beneath you just a few years before.
What was easier to predict was the advent of the PC itself. And the SRI report missed this one, too, even though it was aware of the technological trajectory: “Computer technology that in 1955 cost $1 million, was only marginally reliable, and filled a room, is now available for under $25,000 and the size of a desk. By 1985, the same computer capability will cost less than $1000 and fit into a briefcase.”
But the author of the SRI report could only see a continuation of the centralized computing of his day. The report’s 1985 fictional manager views documents on his “video display terminal” and the centralized (and specialized) word processing system of 1976 continues to rule the office ten years later.
This was a failure to predict how the computer that will “fit into a briefcase” will become personal, i.e., will take the place of the “video display terminal” and then augment it as a personal information management tool. And the report also failed to predict the ensuing organizational development in which distributed computing (and eventually, in-your-pocket computing) replaced or was added to centralized computing.
Yes, predicting is hard to do. But compare forecasters and analysts with another human subspecies: Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs don’t predict the future, they make it happen.
A year before the SRI report was published, in January 1975, Popular Electronics published a cover story on the “first minicomputer kit,” the Altair 8800. Paul Allen and Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, founded their companies around the time the SRI report was published not because they read reports about the office of the future. They simply imagined it.
For the last ten years, and especially since 2017, creative human intelligence has advanced the state of generative AI. Human intelligence imagined new deep learning architectures, new methods for statistical analysis of text, and new approaches to training AI models on the vast Web “literature.” As Lovelace has observed, human imagination and creativity are not and cannot be components of artificial intelligence.
So regard the current projections of how many and what type of jobs will be destroyed (or created) by artificial intelligence with healthy skepticism. No doubt, as in the past, many low-skill and high-skill occupations will be affected by the increased scope of what computers can do. But many current occupations will thrive and new ones will be created, as—and that’s a safe prediction—the way work is done will continue to change, driven by our creativity and imagination.DALL-E 2 rendering of ""the future of work in the office with ChatGPT""Gil Press

Using artificial intelligence at work may have many benefits, but a growing body of research calls attention to the potential negative impact of AI on employee performance. Pok Man Tang writes that the use of AI may have different effects on people, depending on their personal characteristics. Those who think more highly of their abilities may suffer the most when they see that technology determines how well they perform.

 




“Whether or not employees benefit or suffer from working with artificial intelligence very much depends on their personal characteristics, like how they (un)favorably view themselves…”
Albert Lam, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), NOVELTE Robotic Solution
The opening quote from the chief marketing officer of a robotics company reveals a critical insight about working with, or depending on, artificial intelligence: AI can be a double-edged sword for both employees and managers. It can augment employees at work by facilitating their goal accomplishments, since it helps them complete more complicated analytical tasks. However, this emerging digital tool might unexpectedly trigger an aversive host of psychological states in employees. The critical question to resolve thus seems to be for whom the benefits (versus costs) of working with AI will be more salient.
In our recent article, my co-authors and I write that for some employees, this augmentation (i.e., making employees depend on AI) has a bright side, but there might be a negative consequence in its ability to enhance employee performance. Yes, there are likely both benefits and harms to employees as a result of these human-machine collaborations, but we suspected that personal characteristics might influence how strongly those benefits vs. harms are experienced. If true, this would have significant implications for organisational decision-makers worldwide who might have to rethink their business practices regarding pairing employees with AI.
The central premise of these arguments is based on self-regulation theory, a dynamic process wherein individuals evaluate discrepancies between their current states (how they are feeling or what they are doing now) and some desired end-state (what they want/expect themselves to feel or do). We posited that, on the one hand, someone’s dependence on AI in various work tasks can be discrepancy-reducing. They may be able to  complete important tasks more effectively or eliminate repetitive tasks or hassles, which can improve their performance. On the other hand, the same phenomenon can be discrepancy-enlarging, making clear that employees could not complete their tasks without AI assistance, which eventually has the potential to harm their performance.
Across two different studies with participants from India and the United States, we consistently showed that dependence on AI at work can both reduce discrepancy, by eliciting goal progress (a positive consequence) and increase discrepancy, by triggering a self-esteem threat (a negative consequence), with mixed consequences for employee performance. Yet, more importantly (based on the opening quote), our focus was on how employees’ personal characteristics would affect the strength of these relationships. We expected that whether AI can be discrepancy-reducing or discrepancy-enlarging would depend on employees’ core self-evaluation (CSE), their overall self-assessment. Our expectation was that employees with higher levels of CSE would be more likely to see their dependence on AI negatively, as they tend to attribute their work accomplishments to their ability (instead of AI’s help).
And indeed, this is what we found. Dependence on AI was discrepancy-enlarging when it became a self-esteem threat (employees tended to experience larger threats to their self-esteem). Along similar lines, for these individuals, dependence on AI was not discrepancy-reducing when it came to their work-goals (they tended not to feel that depending on AI was effective for making progress on tasks at work). Overall speaking, our results suggest that employees high in CSE might attain fewer performance benefits from working with AI.
These findings have critical implications for managers and other organisational decision-makers who are navigating through the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Specifically, the conventional wisdom on CSE is that it is a good filtering criteria in recruitment and selection, as well as performance management. Our findings suggest to decision-makers that this consensus of CSE might need to be revisited. It is critical that managers recognise that tried-and-true methods they have used in the past may not work in the new digital era.
While one remedy might simply be to encourage managers to avoid pairing high-CSE employees with AI (or at least to avoid their heavy engagement with AI), this may not be feasible all the time given that high (compared to low) CSE employees have proven to be better in a lot of aspects in their daily lives and work.
To this end, we encourage decision-makers to adopt a more holistic perspective for the outcomes that are measured when evaluating the success of these augmentation efforts. Beyond focusing on increases to performance, managers should be attentive to the well-being of their digital workforce, striving to avoid the reductions to task performance that we found, as well as other costs that can arise.
One potential solution is to encourage employees to engage in positive self-affirmations (which provide a means to restore or protect one’s self-regard) or mindfulness practice (which can also have positive effects for employee well-being). Overall, we recommend that managers be careful to avoid “over-selling” the promise of AI, and we echo those who have called for a more conservative judgement of the organisational impact of intelligent machines.
In closing, our research joins an emerging conversation about the potential benefits and costs of coupling employees with AI at work and throws light on the personal characteristics that amplify these benefits (vs. costs). We continue to add to the recent stream of research highlighting that some conventional wisdom and organisation practices might no longer be valid in the new digital era—a manuscript we previously wrote about for LSE Business Review.

I truly believe that AI in fact can be a facilitator of goal congruent behavior and therefore be a driver of top performance. However people may sometimes perceive an organization’s capability to integrate Technology in some key HR functions like Performance Management  as micro management in certain cultural contexts. Therefore effective communication can indeed decide the effectiveness of AI integration and the “why” factor.
Now,  I believe AI is important  in providing very valuable insights in performance evaluation if all key process areas are in fact interlinked/ integrated.  So a Human + Tech approach will be the ideal mix where tacit knowledge of the evaluator can guide an employee. (keeping in mind the possible skewness human perception can bring in while assessing an employee/ zero human error based approach) . 
So a mix from a game theoretic perspective will be a good state of equilibrium specially when asymmetric information is present.

Let’s hope we’re ready.by  Sara MorrisonMay 11, 2023, 5:14 PM EDTFacebookLink Getty Images/iStockphotopart ofThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedsee all  Sara Morrison is a senior Vox reporter who has covered data privacy, antitrust, and Big Tech’s power over us all for the site since 2019.FacebookLinkIf you feel like you’ve been hearing a lot about generative AI, you’re not wrong. After a generative AI tool called ChatGPT went viral a few months ago, it seems everyone in Silicon Valley is trying to find a use for this new technology. Microsoft and Google are chief among them, and they’re racing to reinvent how we use computers. But first, they’re reinventing how we search the internet.Generative AI is essentially a more advanced and useful version of the conventional artificial intelligence that already helps power everything from autocomplete to Siri. The big difference is that generative AI can create new content, such as images, text, audio, video, and even code — usually from a prompt or command. It can write news articles, movie scripts, and poetry. It can make images out of some really specific parameters. And if you listen to some experts and developers, generative AI will eventually be able to make almost anything, including entire apps, from scratch. For now, the killer app for generative AI appears to be search.One of the first major generative AI products for the consumer market is Microsoft’s new AI-infused Bing, which debuted in January to great fanfare. The new Bing uses generative AI in its web search function to return results that appear as longer, written answers culled from various internet sources instead of a list of links to relevant websites. There’s also a new accompanying chat feature that lets users have human-seeming conversations with an AI chatbot.Related:Google is putting AI in basically everything, including searchThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedHow does AI actually work? How is AI changing our society?Is AI coming for your job?Should we be worried about AI?Who will regulate AI?Google, the undisputed king of search for decades now, appeared to take on Microsoft’s AI dominance at its annual developers conference on May 10. The company announced that its days of behind-the-scenes, years-long, carefully considered generative AI development was over. Soon, AI should be a powerful feature in virtually every major Google product, from Google Docs to Gmail. Among many other tricks, the new generative AI technology can write emails and even create entire presentations — complete with images — out of a few text prompt. But the biggest changes are coming to Google’s bread and butter: search.In other words, the AI wars are now underway. And the battles may not just be over search engines. Generative AI is already starting to find its way into mainstream applications for everything from food shopping to social media. Microsoft and Google are the biggest companies with public-facing generative AI products, but they aren’t the only ones working on it. Apple, Meta, and Amazon have their own AI initiatives, and there are plenty of startups and smaller companies developing generative AI or working it into their existing products. TikTok has a generative AI text-to-image system. Design platform Canva has one, too. An app called Lensa creates stylized selfies and portraits (sometimes with ample bosoms). And the open-source model Stable Diffusion can generate detailed and specific images in all kinds of styles from text prompts. Generative AI has the potential to be a revolutionary technology, and it’s certainly being hyped as suchGenerative AI has the potential to be a revolutionary technology, and it’s certainly being hyped as such. Venture capitalists, who are always looking for the next big tech thing, believe that generative AI can replace or automate a lot of creative processes, freeing up humans to do more complex tasks and making people more productive overall. But it’s not just creative work that generative AI can produce. It can help developers make software. It could improve education. It may be able to discover new drugs or become your therapist. It just might make our lives easier and better.Or it could make things a lot worse. There are reasons to be concerned about the damage generative AI can do if it’s released to a society that isn’t ready for it — or if we ask the AI program to do something it isn’t ready for. How ethical or responsible generative AI technologies are is largely in the hands of the companies developing them, as there are few if any regulations or laws in place governing AI. This powerful technology could put millions of people out of work if it’s able to automate entire industries. It could spawn a destructive new era of misinformation. There are also concerns of bias due to a lack of diversity in the material and data that generative AI is trained on, or the people who are overseeing that training.Nevertheless, powerful generative AI tools are making their way to the masses. If 2022 was the “year of generative AI,” 2023 is shaping up to be the year that generative AI is actually put to use, ready or not.The slow, then sudden, rise of generative AIConventional artificial intelligence is already integrated into a ton of products we use all the time, like autocomplete, voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, and even the recommendations for music or movies we might enjoy on streaming services. But generative AI is more sophisticated. It uses deep learning, or algorithms that create artificial neural networks that are meant to mimic how human brains process information and learn. And then those models are fed enormous amounts of data to train on. For example, large language models power things like ChatGPT, which train on text collected from around the internet until they learn to generate and mimic those kinds of texts and conversations upon request. Image models have been fed tons of images and captions that describe them in order to learn how to create new content based on prompts.After years of development, most of it outside of public view, generative AI hit the mainstream in 2022 with the widespread releases of art and text models. Models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, which was released by OpenAI, were first to go viral, and they let anyone create new images from text prompts. Then came OpenAI’s ChatGPT (GPT stands for “generative pre-trained transformer”) which got everyone’s attention. This tool could create large, entirely new chunks of text from simple prompts. For the most part, ChatGPT worked really well, too — better than anything the world had seen before.Though it’s one of many AI startups out there, OpenAI seems to have the most advanced or powerful products right now. Or at least, it’s the startup that has given the general public access to its services, thereby providing the most evidence of its progress in the generative AI field. This is a demonstration of its abilities as well as a source of even more data for OpenAI’s models to learn from. OpenAI is also backed by some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab with $1 billion in support from the likes of Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Amazon, and former Y Combinator president Sam Altman, who is now the company’s CEO. OpenAI has since changed its structure to become a for-profit company but has yet to make a profit or even much by way of revenue. That’s not a problem yet, as OpenAI has gotten a considerable amount of funding from Microsoft, which began investing in OpenAI in 2019. And OpenAI is seizing on the wave of excitement for ChatGPT to promote its API services, which are not free. Neither is the company’s upcoming ChatGPT Plus service. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attends the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in July 2022. Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesOther big tech companies have for years been working on their own generative AI initiatives. There’s Apple’s Gaudi, Meta’s LLaMA and Make-a-Scene, Amazon’s collaboration with Hugging Face, and Google’s LaMDA (which is good enough that one Google engineer thought it was sentient). But thanks to its early investment in OpenAI, Microsoft had access to the AI project everyone knew about and was trying out.In January 2023, Microsoft announced it was giving $10 billion to OpenAI, bringing its total investment in the company to $13 billion. From that partnership, Microsoft has gotten what it hopes will be a real challenge to Google’s longtime dominance in web search: a new Bing powered by generative AI. We’ll soon see how well Google’s AI-powered search engine can compete.AI search will give us the first glimpse of how generative AI can be used in our everyday lives ... if it worksTech companies and investors are willing to pour resources into generative AI because they hope that, eventually, it will be able to create or generate just about any kind of content humans ask for. Some of those aspirations may be a long way from becoming reality, but right now, it’s possible that generative AI will power the next evolution of the humble internet search. After months of rumors that both Microsoft and Google were working on generative AI versions of their web search engines, Microsoft debuted its AI-integrated Bing in January in a splashy media event that showed off all the cool things it could do, thanks to OpenAI’s custom-built technology that powered it. Instead of entering a prompt for Bing to look up and return a list of relevant links, you could ask Bing a question and get a “complete answer” composed by Bing’s generative AI and culled from various sources on the web that you didn’t have to take the time to visit yourself. You could also use Bing’s chatbot to ask follow-up questions to better refine your search results. The resultsmay not always be accurate and you might even get insulted, as happened to a few people who pushed past Bing AI’s supposed guardrails found, but Microsoft was going full steam ahead anyway. In the ensuing months, it added AI to a bunch of its products, from the Windows 11 operating system to Office.This posed a major threat to Google, which has had the search market sewn up for decades and makes most of its revenue from the ads placed alongside its search results. Though Google has been working on its own generative AI models for years, the company says it kept them away from the public until it was sure the technology was safe to deploy. As soon Microsoft emerged as a major competitive threat, Google decided it was safe enough.After the underwhelming limited release of its Bard chatbot, Google began to roll out its real generative AI offerings at its I/O developers conference in May. Like Microsoft, Google was incorporating the AI features into as many things as possible. If you opt into the new Search Generative Experience, you can ask Google questions and it will return conversational answers, courtesy of its newest large language model, Pathways Language Model, or PaLM 2. Google’s workspace apps will also soon have something called Duet AI to help you write emails and documents, generate images, and more.So although Microsoft was the first off the starting line, we’re about to see if Google can catch up. We’re also about to see how the rest of the world responds to having powerful AI tools at their fingertips. Hopefully, they’re as safe as their developers claim they are.We’ll soon see how well Google’s AI-powered search engine can compete.Again, Microsoft and Google aren’t the only companies working on generative AI, but their public releases have put more pressure on others to roll out their offerings as soon as possible, too. Meta is working to get its generative AI into as many of its own products as possible and just released a large language model of its own, called Large Language Model Meta AI, or LLaMA. And it seems like everyone is flocking to OpenAI to jam its ChatGPT and Whisper services to their businesses. Snapchat now has a chatbot called “My AI,” though reviews have been mixed, as is its ability to keep that bot from discussing inappropriate topics with Snapchat’s younger users. Instacart will use ChatGPT in a feature called “Ask Instacart” that can answer customers’ questions about food. Shopify’s Shop app has a ChatGPT-powered assistant to make personalized recommendations from the brands and stores that use the platform. Expedia says its ChatGPT integration helps users plan vacations, though it also stressed that this was still in a beta-testing phase and highlighted some of the ways Expedia already uses less-sophisticated forms of AI and machine learning on its app and website.Generative AI is here to stay, but we don’t yet know if that’s for the bestBing AI’s problems were just a glimpse of how generative AI can go wrong and have potentially disastrous consequences. That’s why pretty much every company that’s in the field of AI goes out of its way to reassure the public that it’s being very responsible with its products and taking great care before unleashing them on the world. Yet for all of their stated commitment to “building AI systems and products that are trustworthy and safe,” Microsoft and OpenAI either didn’t or couldn’t ensure a Bing chatbot could live up to those principles, but they released it anyway. Google and Meta, by contrast, were very conservative about releasing their products — until Microsoft and OpenAI gave them a push.Error-prone generative AI is being put out there by many other companies that have promised to be careful. Some text-to-image models are infamous for producing images with missing or extra limbs. There are chatbots that confidently declare the winner of a Super Bowl that has yet to be played. These mistakes are funny as isolated incidents, but we’ve already seen one publication rely on generative AI to write authoritative articles with significant factual errors. And a law professor discovered that ChatGPT was saying he was accused of sexual harassment, basing that assertion on a Washington Post article that didn’t exist. Bing’s chatbot then repeated that false claim, citing the professor’s own op-ed about it.Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the new Google search experience at the company’s I/O conference in May 2023. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThese screw-ups have been happening for years. Microsoft had one high-profile AI chatbot flop with its 2016 release of Tay, which Twitter users almost immediately trained to say some really offensive things. Microsoft quickly took it offline. Meta’s Blenderbot is based on a large language model and was released in August 2022. It didn’t go well. The bot seemed to hate Facebook, got racist and antisemitic, and wasn’t very accurate. It’s still available to try out, but after seeing what ChatGPT can do, it feels like a clunky, slow, and weird step backward.There are even more serious concerns. Generative AI threatens to put a lot of people out of work if it’s good enough to replace them. It could have a profound impact on education. There are also questions of legalities over the material AI developers are using to train their models, which is typically scraped from millions of sources that the developers don’t have the rights to. And there are questions of bias both in the material that AI models are training on and the people who are training them. It’s also a possibility that generative AI will be used to deliberately spread disinformation. An AI-generated image of the pope wearing a stylish coat, made using Midjourney, fooled a lot of people and demonstrated how close we may be to a world where it’s nearly impossible to tell what’s real and what isn’t.On the other side, some conservative bomb-throwers have accused generative AI developers of moderating their platforms’ outputs too much and making them “woke” and biased against the right wing. To that end, Musk, the self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist and OpenAI critic as well as an early investor, is reportedly considering developing a ChatGPT rival that won’t have content restrictions or be trained on supposedly “woke” material.And then there’s the fear not of generative AI but of the technology it could lead to: artificial general intelligence. AGI can learn and think and solve problems like a human, if not better. This has given rise to science fiction-based fears that AGI will lead to an army of super-robots that quickly realize they have no need for humans and either turn us into slaves or wipe us out entirely.There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about generative AI’s future, too. It’s a powerful technology with a ton of potential, and we’ve still seen relatively little of what it can do and who it can help. Silicon Valley clearly sees this potential, and venture capitalists like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia seem to be all-in. OpenAI is valued at nearly $30 billion, despite not having yet proved itself as a revenue generator. Generative AI has the power to upend a lot of things, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll make them worse. Its ability to automate tasks may give humans more time to focus on the stuff that can’t be done by increasingly sophisticated machines, as has been true for technological advances before it. And in the near future — once the bugs are worked out — it could make searching the web better. In the years and decades to come, it might even make everything else better, too.Oh, and in case you were wondering: No, generative AI did not write this explainer.Update, May 11, 5 pm ET: This story was originally published on March 4 and has been updated with information about ChatGPT’s expansion and Google’s AI integrations.Correction, May 12, 10:15 am ET: A photo caption in an earlier version of this story misidentified Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

Martin UW Photography/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveWhat if your inbox were jam-packed with AI-generated emails? You may already be on the receiving end of emails written by artificial intelligence, with the help of a human prompter. Austin Distel, a senior director of marketing at Jasper, is one of those humans. Austin smiles as he demonstrates Japer’s knack for email composition. “These are tools in my tool belt that helped me perform faster, but also better,” he says before sharing that he often uses generative AI to rewrite work emails so they sound like Jerry Seinfeld.What’s the Deal With Autocomplete?Email is one the least authentic forms of communication. The stock phrases and courtesy replies are comically robotic. Like, why do you hope this email finds me well? Google has used machine learning in Gmail for the past few years to generate one sentence replies and predict what you’re likely to type next. Newer companies, like Compose AI, might enable people to further rely on autocomplete functions while sending emails.Featured VideoJenna Ortega Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions“Autocomplete is not going to sway you away from what you already want to type. It’s just going to accelerate it,” says Michael Shuffett, a founder and CEO of Compose AI. Although large blocks of AI-generated text from models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are quite popular, smaller snippets crafted by autocomplete are easier to control at the present moment. It’s akin to riding a tandem bike with a robot versus letting it ride your bike alone at night after giving a one-sentence command. The first option requires more effort, but you're more likely to reach your intended destination together.Will major email providers, like Gmail and Outlook, roll out additional AI-powered features to help you breeze through an overstuffed inbox? Aparna Pappu, a vice president and general manager at Google Workspace, mentions multiple ways the company uses AI to assist people when writing messages and detecting spam. In a statement sent to WIRED over, well, email, her attitude on generative AI mirrors most of the messaging coming from Google on the topic: excited, albeit cautious.“We are in a new era of AI where large language models have the power to take that helpfulness to the next level,” writes Pappu. “We know it’s essential that this work is done with the utmost care for safety, quality, and groundedness.” Businesses who use Microsoft’s customer relationship management system, Viva Sales, can experiment with a generative AI tool for drafting reply emails. Potential canned prompts for the AI include stuff like discount offers and question replies. Microsoft declined to comment for this article, and reaching out to its Bing chatbot for a quote about Outlook felt kinda trite. Sorry, Sydney! 😊Will the AI Hit Reply All?So, the future of email may have a more comprehensive autocomplete. Is that revolutionary? Not really.It would be transformative if a personalized AI model could write complete, high-quality emails in your tone of voice. White-collar workers who spend their days tap, tap, tapping responses on their laptops would essentially get access to a digital executive assistant. Imagine a world where robots spend their days “circling back” on projects and sending “quick pings,” while professionals laze about sipping Mai Tais and focusing on client presentations.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenMultiple startups are building toward this reality. Matt Shumer, a serial entrepreneur, sat in front of his computer in 2019, years before the ChatGPT phenomenon, responding to an influx of emails from partners and customers and investors; it all felt a little overwhelming. So, when OpenAI released its GPT-2 model to the public, Matt wondered whether it could be used as a productivity tool. LUV 2 TXTIt’s Always Sunny Inside a Generative AI ConferenceLauren GoodeSpeak No EvilChatbots Got Big—and Their Ethical Red Flags Got BiggerKhari JohnsonCourtroom DramaGenerative AI Is Coming For the LawyersChris Stokel-WalkerHe scraped the information from his inbox and trained a model on the data. “Then, I asked it to write some new ones for me,” Shumer says. “I was immediately blown away by what I saw.” This experience put him on the path to becoming cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI. It’s the company behind HyperWrite, a generative AI tool for composing entire paragraphs and rewriting complicated sentences.Despite visions of a future with full self-writing email software, most marketers and CEOs we interviewed admitted the technology was not yet at a high-enough caliber to be trusted with complete control of your inbox. Philippe Lehoux, a CEO of the workplace communication company Missive, says, “This technology will improve, but anyone right now aiming at using AI to replace themselves and do automatic responses is pretty much delusional.” John Humphrey, a head of data platform product at Mailchimp, compares generative AI to an intern who may pitch some stellar ideas, but whom you wouldn’t let spearhead a major campaign.AdvertisementWell then, what is it good at? In addition to drafting replies, two other emergent use cases for AI in email are shifting tones and brainstorming potential subject lines. Sure, generative AI can rephrase your emails to sound like Jerry Seinfeld. With alternative prompting, it can also draft messages that are more direct or serious or apologetic. Make sure to proofread everything before hitting “reply all,” because large language models continue to have a penchant for hallucination.AI tools can be used to analyze data from top-tier email subject lines—those with impressive open rates or sales conversions—and spit out a hundred good ideas. “The principles of what makes a good subject line? AI didn’t change that. It just makes it easier to produce that,” says Humphrey. It remains up to the marketer to divine which angle is the best fit for their customer base.Business leaders should be cognizant of the thorny controversies around AI-generated text, in order to avoid alienating email recipients. Vanderbilt University apologized after using ChatGPT to message students about a shooting at Michigan State University. How could an administrator think this would be acceptable? People who approach generative AI as a tool to unlock the unique words needed during difficult conversations may misunderstand the technology’s strengths. It predicts next steps and generalizes the human experience, which is great for understanding potential buyers, but not so great for connecting with those in mourning.“We all see such generic messages every day,” says Distel from Jasper. “So, how can we break through the noise, and say something that gets your wheels turning?” Well, you’ve got my wheels spinning. I’m just not sure where this wild ride will come to a stop.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

What’s the Deal With Autocomplete?
Email is one the least authentic forms of communication. The stock phrases and courtesy replies are comically robotic. Like, why do you hope this email finds me well? Google has used machine learning in Gmail for the past few years to generate one sentence replies and predict what you’re likely to type next. Newer companies, like Compose AI, might enable people to further rely on autocomplete functions while sending emails.
“Autocomplete is not going to sway you away from what you already want to type. It’s just going to accelerate it,” says Michael Shuffett, a founder and CEO of Compose AI. Although large blocks of AI-generated text from models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are quite popular, smaller snippets crafted by autocomplete are easier to control at the present moment. It’s akin to riding a tandem bike with a robot versus letting it ride your bike alone at night after giving a one-sentence command. The first option requires more effort, but you're more likely to reach your intended destination together.
Will major email providers, like Gmail and Outlook, roll out additional AI-powered features to help you breeze through an overstuffed inbox? Aparna Pappu, a vice president and general manager at Google Workspace, mentions multiple ways the company uses AI to assist people when writing messages and detecting spam. In a statement sent to WIRED over, well, email, her attitude on generative AI mirrors most of the messaging coming from Google on the topic: excited, albeit cautious.
“We are in a new era of AI where large language models have the power to take that helpfulness to the next level,” writes Pappu. “We know it’s essential that this work is done with the utmost care for safety, quality, and groundedness.” Businesses who use Microsoft’s customer relationship management system, Viva Sales, can experiment with a generative AI tool for drafting reply emails. Potential canned prompts for the AI include stuff like discount offers and question replies. Microsoft declined to comment for this article, and reaching out to its Bing chatbot for a quote about Outlook felt kinda trite. Sorry, Sydney! 😊
Will the AI Hit Reply All?
So, the future of email may have a more comprehensive autocomplete. Is that revolutionary? Not really.
It would be transformative if a personalized AI model could write complete, high-quality emails in your tone of voice. White-collar workers who spend their days tap, tap, tapping responses on their laptops would essentially get access to a digital executive assistant. Imagine a world where robots spend their days “circling back” on projects and sending “quick pings,” while professionals laze about sipping Mai Tais and focusing on client presentations.
Multiple startups are building toward this reality. Matt Shumer, a serial entrepreneur, sat in front of his computer in 2019, years before the ChatGPT phenomenon, responding to an influx of emails from partners and customers and investors; it all felt a little overwhelming. So, when OpenAI released its GPT-2 model to the public, Matt wondered whether it could be used as a productivity tool.
He scraped the information from his inbox and trained a model on the data. “Then, I asked it to write some new ones for me,” Shumer says. “I was immediately blown away by what I saw.” This experience put him on the path to becoming cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI. It’s the company behind HyperWrite, a generative AI tool for composing entire paragraphs and rewriting complicated sentences.
Despite visions of a future with full self-writing email software, most marketers and CEOs we interviewed admitted the technology was not yet at a high-enough caliber to be trusted with complete control of your inbox. Philippe Lehoux, a CEO of the workplace communication company Missive, says, “This technology will improve, but anyone right now aiming at using AI to replace themselves and do automatic responses is pretty much delusional.” John Humphrey, a head of data platform product at Mailchimp, compares generative AI to an intern who may pitch some stellar ideas, but whom you wouldn’t let spearhead a major campaign.
Well then, what is it good at? In addition to drafting replies, two other emergent use cases for AI in email are shifting tones and brainstorming potential subject lines. Sure, generative AI can rephrase your emails to sound like Jerry Seinfeld. With alternative prompting, it can also draft messages that are more direct or serious or apologetic. Make sure to proofread everything before hitting “reply all,” because large language models continue to have a penchant for hallucination.
AI tools can be used to analyze data from top-tier email subject lines—those with impressive open rates or sales conversions—and spit out a hundred good ideas. “The principles of what makes a good subject line? AI didn’t change that. It just makes it easier to produce that,” says Humphrey. It remains up to the marketer to divine which angle is the best fit for their customer base.
Business leaders should be cognizant of the thorny controversies around AI-generated text, in order to avoid alienating email recipients. Vanderbilt University apologized after using ChatGPT to message students about a shooting at Michigan State University. How could an administrator think this would be acceptable? People who approach generative AI as a tool to unlock the unique words needed during difficult conversations may misunderstand the technology’s strengths. It predicts next steps and generalizes the human experience, which is great for understanding potential buyers, but not so great for connecting with those in mourning.
“We all see such generic messages every day,” says Distel from Jasper. “So, how can we break through the noise, and say something that gets your wheels turning?” Well, you’ve got my wheels spinning. I’m just not sure where this wild ride will come to a stop.",business,,,,,,,"https://media.wired.com/photos/63fea1483e46f427b508d1a8/2:3/w_1200,h_1800,c_limit/How-AI-Could-Transform-Emails-Business-1370467198.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment is a topic of much debate and discussion. While it is true that AI has the potential to automate certain tasks and displace some workers, it is important to note that it also has the potential to create new jobs and opportunities.
Some experts predict that AI will lead to job displacement in certain sectors, particularly those involving repetitive or routine tasks, such as manufacturing and administrative support. However, other experts argue that AI will augment human capabilities and create new jobs in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and software engineering.
Healthcare, agriculture, finance, and education are just a few of the sectors in Africa that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform. Following are a few effects of AI in Africa:
By helping physicians and other healthcare professionals with disease diagnosis and treatment, AI can increase access to healthcare in Africa. Mobile apps with AI capabilities, for instance, can assist in the diagnosis of common ailments like malaria and tuberculosis, which are widespread in Africa.
By giving producers data-driven insights, AI can increase crop yields and decrease waste in the agricultural industry. For instance, AI can examine soil information and weather patterns to assist farmers in making knowledgeable crop planting choices.
By offering accessible and affordable financial services to unbanked populations, AI can help boost financial inclusion in Africa. Customer access to financial services, for instance, can be facilitated by chatbots powered by AI without the need for real branches.
By offering pupils personalised learning experiences, artificial intelligence can enhance education in Africa. AI-powered tutoring systems, for instance, can adjust to different learners’ learning preferences and give pupils feedback that is relevant to them.
In general, the impact of AI on employment in Africa will depend on a variety of factors, including the level of investment in AI technology, the availability of skilled workers to design and implement AI systems, and the extent to which businesses and policymakers prioritize the development of AI-related skills and training.
However, there are also worries about how AI will affect Africa, including employment loss, algorithmic bias, and data privacy issues. It’s crucial to make sure that the advantages of AI are shared fairly and that the appropriate legal frameworks are in place to safeguard citizens’ rights.
It is important to note that while AI may displace some workers in the short term, it has the potential to create new jobs and opportunities in the long term. For example, AI may enable businesses to innovate and develop new products and services, which in turn can create new jobs in areas such as marketing, sales, and customer support.

Big technology companies have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent months, but workers with AI skills are still in demand. Jim Monroe of Ada, an automation company specializing in customer service, said that a lot of companies ""are still prioritizing AI roles both in terms of the hiring as well as if they are conducting layoffs.""Insider spoke with five experts about breaking into the field. Here's their best advice for jobseekers.1. Build a strong foundation in math and computer scienceHaving a firm grasp of technical skills around deep learning can help candidates land AI roles with higher salaries.Many high-paying jobs in the AI industry, such as data scientists and machine-learning engineers, usually require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a technical field such as computer science or math, experts previously told Insider.

""Candidates do have to have baseline programming knowledge at some level,"" Ada's Monroe said. ""Programming skills in Java, Python, PHP, C., or Ruby would be fairly common. Natural language processing is really hot right now, but data science and data analytics skills are still in high demand.""Math and statistical analysis are also important skills for many AI roles, Monroe said. There is an analytic component to correlating data and predictability to ensure the AI is presenting the right answers or outcomes in specific business cases, such as customer service chatbots, he said.2. Showcase your ability to solve real-world problemsPolo Chau, associate professor at Georgia Tech's School of Computational Science and Engineering, told Insider that job candidates need to be able to articulate how classroom learning translated to the real world. ""You need to connect the practical applications of what you know with the specific problems that your audience is trying to solve,"" he said.For instance, let's say you participated in a hackathon where you created machine learning programs using different statistical techniques. You should be able to explain to hiring managers how you developed or invented or adapted techniques that led to a significant improvement, and that can be applied to solve a problem, Chau said.

""If you're talking to a logistics company that's trying to improve how it routes packages, you can talk about speed improvements. If you're talking to a healthcare company that's trying to figure out patient eligibility for studies, you can talk about fairness improvements. If you're talking to a retailer that's trying to understand customer trends, you can talk about accuracy improvements,"" Chau said.3. Develop strong presentation skills and cultivate an empathetic mindsetThe most successful candidates have strong communication and presentation skills, Chau said. ""Throughout the pandemic, a lot of things have been virtual so people have not had the opportunity to present their work in front of a live audience,"" he said. ""Presenting on a screen when everyone is in a tiny box involves a different communication style and energy.""Now that many conferences and networking events are in-person again, candidates need to perfect their elevator pitches. This is true for people looking to work in AI, but it's also good advice for jobseekers more generally, too.  ""You need to have prepared a quick summary of what you've done,"" he said. ""And you need to practice it.""

A collaborative and empathetic approach is also key, Asu Ozdaglar, head of MIT's department of electrical engineering and computer science, told Insider. ""You need to know technical concepts around machine learning and algorithms and decision-making, but you also need to be asking, 'How should those decisions take into account the human context?'""ChatGPT's growing popularity illustrates that point, Ozdaglar said. ""In many cases these tools will be used to augment human decision-making. So when they're deployed they not only need to be effective and efficient, but also reliable, fair, and equitable.""4. Prioritize networking by attending eventsAs the AI arms race heats up across Silicon Valley, networking has become crucial to breaking into the industry. Brianne Kimmel, a venture capitalist who founded the Silicon Valley based venture firm Worklife Ventures, said many of the conversations around AI are happening at small dinners or self-funded weekend hackathons. So, it can feel like AI is limited to insiders, she said.

""The technology is accessible to everyone, and no longer limited to PhDs who work at Google, but the deals getting done are happening quickly and quietly,"" Kimmel said. Still, Kimmel— who recently launched a bootcamp for AI startups— suggests that it's best to jump in and learn alongside early builders. That's especially true for those who want to break into AI in areas like marketing, sales, or as non-technical operators as there's no need for formal education.""My usual framing of the problem is we're all figuring this out together,"" Kimmel said. She invited a dozen women in tech to attend a recent OpenAI hackathon even though they weren't all ready to make the leap to AI full-time. ""I think it's super important to come and learn about the technology and to just hear and observe the types of companies that are being built,"" Kimmel said. ""Six or 12 months from now, if you decide to leave a company, you have exposure to what's already been built, and areas with white space for starting a venture-scale business.""

The excitement around OpenAI's ChatGPT has already prompted some companies to consider how they can leverage the tech for specific business needs. Several news outlets, for example, have tapped the chatbot to generate some content. ""ChatGPT is a good example of how the barriers of using AI are dropping quite substantially and in a very rapid fashion,"" Matthew Forshaw, a senior skills advisor at the Alan Turing Institute, told Insider. For many companies, tools like ChatGPT could be used in an assistive capacity, managed by workers with knowledge of AI tech and ethics, Forshaw said. Big technology companies have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent months, but workers with AI skills are still in demand. Jim Monroe of Ada, an automation company specializing in customer service, said that a lot of companies ""are still prioritizing AI roles both in terms of the hiring as well as if they are conducting layoffs.""Insider spoke with five experts about breaking into the field. Here's their best advice for jobseekers.Having a firm grasp of technical skills around deep learning can help candidates land AI roles with higher salaries.Many high-paying jobs in the AI industry, such as data scientists and machine-learning engineers, usually require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a technical field such as computer science or math, experts previously told Insider. Highly educated data scientists and core AI specialists with technical know-how are still highly in demand despite recent layoffs, Forshaw said.Ngaire Moyes, LinkedIn's UK country manager, told Insider that ""machine-learning engineer"" had been one of LinkedIn's fastest-rising jobs in the UK for the past two years.""As AI continues to become embedded into how many organisations operate day-to-day, it is a trend we anticipate will only continue to grow,"" she said.Some experts also recommend learning programming languages and gaining an understanding of AI frameworks, the programming interfaces that serve as building blocks to train and deploy AI models. ""Candidates do have to have baseline programming knowledge at some level,"" Ada's Monroe said. ""Programming skills in Java, Python, PHP, C., or Ruby would be fairly common.

But for now, most jobs are still safe.Share full articleRead in appChatGPTCredit...Jackie Molloy for The New York TimesBy Lauren JacksonMarch 2, 2023You’re reading The Morning newsletter.  Make sense of the day’s news and ideas. David Leonhardt and Times journalists guide you through what’s happening — and why it matters. Get it sent to your inbox.Eli Snyder, a special-education teacher in Colorado, wanted to play basketball with his students. He had questions: How could he adapt the game for a child with cerebral palsy? And how could he help his students with autism play a highly stimulating activity?ChatGPT had answers.The artificial intelligence chatbot had analyzed the internet’s vast amount of data, including information about disabilities and basketball. It used patterns it found in all that text to generate recommendations: Shrink the court size to reduce the distance players need to travel in wheelchairs. Lower the hoop and install a ramp leading up to it so students can roll the basketball into the net. Pair up players so each person has a buddy for support.Snyder could have found this information through a simple Google search. He turned to ChatGPT because it produced complete paragraphs instead of delivering links that would have left him with more clicking and synthesizing to do. The chatbot’s response helped him quickly write adapted lesson plans for each of his students.“It’s been revolutionary,” Snyder, 30, said. “What used to take me an hour now takes me five minutes.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTech giants are heralding ChatGPT as revolutionary, too. With millions of users, the chatbot has started an A.I. arms race. Companies are rushing to release their own chatbots, and some seem eerily human.Beyond the excitement, the technology’s possibilities can feel scary — as if science fiction has become reality. ChatGPT has already inspired many people to ask: Will A.I. take my job? It’s a familiar panic, one that resurfaces every time a groundbreaking innovation emerges, like the car or the internet. Still, questioning how A.I. could replace jobs in the future misses a more urgent point: The platform is changing how people work right now.How workers use A.I.Artificial intelligence already pervades our lives, powering voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, unlocking phones with facial recognition and auto-completing sentences in emails. ChatGPT gave millions of people the opportunity to test and interact with a version of the technology called generative A.I., which can write text and create images.Many workers are already using the tool in their jobs. The chatbot has written home descriptions for real estate agents, job descriptions for hiring managers and sales pitches for marketers.It excels at formulaic writing tasks because it mimics text that already exists online. House listings often feel canned, as do sales pitches, making it easy for ChatGPT to complete first drafts of those types of assignments.“ChatGPT solves the blank page problem,” Cody Gough, a marketing professional outside of Chicago, told me. “The worst thing in the world is opening an empty document. ChatGPT helps you start.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe limitationsAs we’ve covered in this newsletter, A.I. chatbots are flawed. They often make mistakes — like the one that led to a $100 billion drop in Google’s cumulative stock market value when it appeared in an ad.The workers I spoke to mostly use ChatGPT as a brainstorming tool and writing aid. They say the work of chatbots is sometimes inaccurate and often of lower quality than they could produce themselves, but that chatbots can still be useful.Alexia Mandeville, a video game designer in Texas, uses ChatGPT to help her brainstorm character names, conceive ideas for trailers and produce news releases for her games. “I’m making something that doesn’t need to be factual,” Mandeville said. Because her work is fictional, she added, ChatGPT needs to be creative, not accurate.The chatbot is still the tool, not the creator. It can copy writing styles, often replicating our weird internet behavior, as my colleague Cade Metz wrote. ChatGPT’s outputs are only as good as its inputs, so it struggles to reason, use logic, discern the truth and write imaginative work. It has tried and failed to write science fiction, for example. The human capacity for original thought is keeping white-collar professionals employed, even as A.I. poses more of a threat to them than earlier advancements did.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFreeing up more timeA.I. can’t do Snyder’s job of teaching music and gym classes. It can’t play the piano or the basketball game HORSE, and it can’t facilitate students’ social and emotional learning. But it gives Snyder more time for that work.“Everyone is talking about how A.I. is going to replace us,” Snyder said. “I don’t agree with that. It’s going to free up more time at our jobs to do other, more productive things.”A.I. will continue to transform industries as companies integrate it into a variety of tasks, like customer service from virtual agents, predictive product inventory and medical tests. ChatGPT will probably eliminate some roles while creating new jobs. That’s already started to happen: Companies are hiring workers to test and sell the most effective chatbot queries.The technology will only get better. A.I. is designed to learn, and companies are investing billions to develop more powerful versions of the tool. At some point, chatbots could write finished products instead of just often-inaccurate first drafts — and eliminate far more jobs.Until then, most of them are safe.For moreEzra Klein argues we’re too worried about what A.I. can do, and not worried enough about who controls the technology.Chatbot conversations can be creepy, but that doesn’t mean the bots are alive. Here’s how generative A.I. works.THE LATEST NEWSPoliticsThe Senate voted to repeal a rule that lets retirement funds consider climate change when they invest.

Key Takeaways
Some people are turning to AI platforms like ChatGPT for mental health support, but this is risky when they definitely aren't qualified medical professionals. AI chatbots for mental health are being developed, however.AI in mental health is still relatively new but could become more useful in the future.
 Since its launch at the end of November last year, ChatGPT has taken over the internet's imagination. The artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI has a seemingly unlimited number of uses—when it comes to information generation—and it definitely doesn't stop at writing essays and cover letters. Now, people are also starting to use it as a therapist.


 How does this work? ChatGPT provides information in a conversational way, so if you ask it a question relating to your feelings of hopelessness and fear about the future, it can offer you tips pretty fast. It may not be a real person, but it delivers the exact information you need without you having to sift through pages of online information, nor does it keep you waiting for an appointment with a human (or online) therapist.


 The only problem is, ChatGPT isn't designed to be a therapist, and it isn't updated past 2021. It should go without saying there are numerous risks to getting health suggestions from an AI robot who did not go to medical school, but it does spark a broader conversation about the potential uses of AI in the mental health sector—when applied appropriately.




 “ChatGPT and the conversations around impact could actually open up more opportunities,” explains Chaitali Sinha, head of clinical development and research at Wysa. “Rather than fear around chatbots there is now an expectation they can be used for positive impact. People are expecting more out of AI than they used to.""


Best Mental Health Apps

  Potential Benefits of AI in the Therapy Context  
 Even if we’re to discount ChatGPT for the moment, there are still a lot of advancements being made when it comes to mental health and AI. Platforms and apps like Wysa are helping to change the way we think about mental health—as Sinha says, “It should be just as normal to have a mental health app on your phone and in your hand as any other app”. 


 Human therapists are just that—human. They can be biased, even if it's subconsciously. A therapist could be racist, homophobic, or ableist—using an AI therapist removes the risk of someone speaking to a therapist who might not actually work for them.


 Or, people might feel worried about their therapist judging them or sharing confidential information, or perhaps not quite feel ready to speak to a real person about sensitive topics—particularly if they’ve had negative experiences with therapy in the past. 


 Not only that, but sometimes therapists can get sick, or have things going on in their own lives that mean they need to cancel or postpone appointments. They might burn out, or not be on top form for an appointment.1 In contrast, an AI therapist won’t. 


Ergo Sooru, CEO of DrHouse
In the future, it is likely that AI-based tools will be able to provide more personalized and tailored treatments for individuals suffering from various mental health issues by utilizing a variety of data points such as lifestyle habits, medical history, and more.
— Ergo Sooru, CEO of DrHouse
 And there are often long waiting lists for therapy. A human therapist can only speak to one person, or group, at a time. And they need sleep, lunch breaks, and time away from work too. Could AI therapy get waiting lists down, or become a more affordable option for people struggling to find the money for therapy? 


 “People don’t experience struggles at ‘convenient’ times,” says Sinha. “Their mental health is always there, becoming more challenging when it does, not when it’s easiest to get help.


 “But none of our therapy mechanisms that we have so far actually are designed for the lived experience of someone with mental health and AI is bridging the gap.”


 She brings up that often, people will have an appointment once a week, whereas they might need support at another time. She describes AI as “bridging the gap of the needs people have”, in a way that humans just can’t. 


 “People are unlikely to call crisis support helplines every night, but can get support from apps like Wysa, and health professionals can provide Wysa to use in between sessions, so people are not left with no support.”

  Drawbacks of Artificial Intelligence  
 There are potential drawbacks to AI therapy too. 


 Possible security and privacy issues are a big one. When you share information with an AI therapist, where does it go? Could there be risks of hacking, for instance? Indeed, the ethics of AI in mental health care is something that’s previously been discussed, with researchers weighing up the trade-off between more personalized care and concerns around privacy, autonomy, and bias.2


 Also, human connection is really important in therapy. Even though it's a doctor-patient relationship, the face-to-face interaction is a huge part of what makes therapy effective. It's why people open up.


 “AI-based therapies are not able to interpret the non-verbal cues which are essential for a successful therapeutic relationship,” says Ergo Sooru, co-founder and CEO of DrHouse. “Nor are they able to provide the same level of emotional support and understanding as a human can.”


 The development of AI therapists is certainly exciting. But we aren’t quite there yet. Even the best AI therapist won’t be of the same standard as a good, qualified, and capable human therapist. 


What This Means For You
The possibilities for the future of mental health care are vast, and artificial intelligence might be a viable option down the road. But right now people should be wary of the temptation to use tools for Chat GPT for mental health advice. The technology just isn't there yet. But even if it does get there one day, there is no substitute for in-person therapy, and the goal should be supplemental care, not a replacement for talking to a certified professional—who is human.



How to Know When It’s Time to See a Therapist

  Incorporating AI Into Mental Health Care  
 A combination of human and AI therapy is probably the best option looking forward. Quick support when you're in dire need, but human care as your main, ongoing solution for care. After all, everybody is different. For some people, a human therapist might be the only option they entertain. Others might be more open to AI therapy.


 Sooru says that there should be a great degree of human intervention in AI therapy “to ensure that the patient is receiving the best care possible”. 


 But AI can still be used in mental health care even if the therapists themselves aren’t AI. A study from 2019 involved AI categorizing thousands of statements from therapists in online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions spanning 90,000 hours, and the study supports the idea that CBT is linked with improvement in patient symptoms.3 


 Studies like this one show how AI can support mental health care in other ways, particularly as advancements continue to be made.

  The Future of Mental Health and AI  
 “​​It’s still early days for AI related to mental health, although clearly changes are happening,” says Sinha. “But what we are seeing is an appetite for a digital solution. Wysa might be artificial intelligence but the team behind it are very much humans, and bring immense expertise and experience to ensure that Wysa provides empathy and compassion.


 “What we want is to offer people the tool that works for them, on their terms.”


 “In the future, it is likely that AI-based tools will be able to provide more personalized and tailored treatments for individuals suffering from various mental health issues by utilizing a variety of data points such as lifestyle habits, medical history, and more,” adds Sooru.4


 “Overall, AI-based tools can be beneficial in aiding mental health, but currently, they should not be used as a replacement for traditional forms of therapy.”

Artificial intelligence has been used for years to create artwork ranging from paintings and drawings to music and even poetry. 
Built by training algorithms on large datasets of existing artwork and then using those algorithms to generate new pieces, AI-generated art can create some fascinating images. 
But AI-generated art has sparked discussions about the nature of creativity and the artist’s role. 

Whether you believe AI-generated art is, indeed, art or not, the genre is with us and will continue to be for some time to come. But if you have no idea what it is or want to know more, we’ll explore this exciting new horizon in artistic expression. 
How do AI art generators work?
AI art generators use machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to generate art. Large sets of already-made art are used to teach these algorithms how to find patterns and styles that can be used to make new art. Coating wine bottle with wax and honey extraction, the best of IE this week

What is AI art?

DALL·E 2/OpenAI  



The process of generating AI art typically involves the following steps:

Dataset Selection: The first step in creating an AI art generator is selecting a dataset of existing artwork that the machine learning algorithm can use to learn the style and patterns of the art.
Training: Once the dataset is selected, the machine learning algorithm is trained on the images in the dataset. This involves feeding the images through a neural network, which learns the features and patterns common to the dataset’s art.
Generation: After the machine learning algorithm has been trained, it can be used to generate new art. This involves inputting a random seed or a desired input and letting the algorithm create an output based on the patterns and features it has learned from the training data.
Refinement: The generated artwork is often refined using additional algorithms and techniques, such as style transfer or image filtering, to create a final image that is more aesthetically pleasing.

AI art generators can use different algorithms and methods depending on what the artist wants to make and how they want it to look. Some popular AI art generators include DeepDream, StyleGAN, and CycleGAN.
How can you create art using AI? 
If you want to create your artwork using AI, how you do this will depend on your needs. 

AI art is causing a big stir in the art world.

Stable Diffusion/OpenAI 



At present, the most common ways include, but are not limited to: 

Use an AI art generator: One of the simplest ways to create art using AI is to use an existing AI art generator. These generators use machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to generate new artwork based on a given input, such as a text description or an image.
Modify existing art using AI: Another approach to creating art using AI is to modify existing artwork using AI tools. For example, you could use a style transfer algorithm to transfer the style of one image onto another or use an image filtering algorithm to create a new version of an existing image.
Collaborate with an AI: You can also create art by collaborating with an AI system. This can involve using an AI system to generate a set of possible designs or elements and then selecting the ones you find most interesting to incorporate into your artwork.
Use AI to assist with the creation process: AI can also help with various aspects of the creative process, such as generating color palettes, suggesting compositions, or even creating rough sketches based on a set of parameters.

In general, making art with AI is an iterative and experimental process that involves exploring the capabilities of different AI tools and techniques and incorporating them into your creative process. 


It takes technical skill, an artistic eye, and a willingness to try new things and take risks as an artist.
Can you create your own AI art generator?
It is most certainly possible to create your own AI art generator. But making an AI art generator can be challenging. You must know much about machine learning, programming, and image processing.
To make an AI art generator, you need to go through a series of steps that usually include the following:

Define the scope of your project: Decide what kind of art generator you want to create, the type of images you want it to generate, and the tools you will need to build it.
Collect and preprocess data: Gather a dataset of images that will be used to train your AI art generator. You may need to preprocess these images to ensure they are consistent in size, color, and format.
Train your model: Use a deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, to train a model that can generate new images. You must define your model’s architecture and introduce it to your dataset.
Generate images: Use your trained model to generate new ideas. You may need to experiment with different input parameters to create a range of other images.
Refine your images: Use post-processing techniques to refine your generated pictures and create an aesthetically pleasing final product.



While it is possible to create your own AI art generator, it can be a challenging task. A solid background in machine learning or working with a team with experience in this field may be helpful.
What is the purpose of AI art?
The purpose of AI art can be multifaceted and varies depending on the context in which it is created. 
For example, AI art is often created to explore the creative potential of machine learning and deep neural networks. By pushing the limits of AI-generated art, artists, and researchers can help us learn more about what these systems can do and develop new ideas.
AI art can also be seen as a way of creating new forms of artistic expression that are impossible with traditional techniques. AI systems that can make complex, highly detailed images or unexpected combinations of elements can lead to new kinds of visual art that make us rethink what is possible.
AI art can also be used to critique or comment on the role of technology in society. AI artists can ask important questions about the relationship between technology and people by looking at how AI can improve and replace human creativity.


Finally, AI art can be seen as a way of giving people a new way of experiencing art. AI art can provide us with a unique and interesting way to interact with the world around us. This can be done through interactive installations, generative pieces that change over time, or immersive experiences that blur the line between art and technology.
Is AI-generated artwork art? 
Whether art made by AI is “art” is still being discussed, and the answer depends on how each person defines “art.” Also, without getting too off-topic, the word “art” is very subjective. 
Take the modern art (and architecture) style “De Stijl” (or “The Style” in Dutch). The production of abstract paintings using basic visual elements such as bold primary colors, geometric shapes, and intersecting plane surfaces characterizes this style. The movement focused on an abstract, pared-down aesthetic. Do you consider this art? 
What about painting miniature airplanes or wargame soldiers? Is that art? 
When it comes to AI art, many people say that art is inherently human and that true art must involve human creativity, intention, and expression. From this point of view, AI-generated art might seem to lack the human element that gives art its meaning and value.
On the other hand, others argue that the use of AI in art represents a new form of artistic expression that is valid in its own right. They say AI-generated artwork can be beautiful, thought-provoking, and meaningful, reflecting these new technologies’ unique capabilities and limitations.

Do you think AI-generated art is actually art?

Stable Diffusion/OpenAI 



Ultimately, whether AI-generated artwork is “art” may be less important than its impact on the art world and society. Whether or not you think it’s “art,” AI-generated art raises essential questions about creativity, how humans and machines interact, and how technology shapes our culture and society. After all, art has always reflected, in some way, the society it is created in.
AI-generated art is still very much in its infancy, so we are yet to see its impact, if any, on the art world. 
Is AI art copyrighted? Who owns it?
Do you want to open that “can of worms?” Yes? Sadly, this is not a simple question to answer. 
The question of who owns the copyright for AI-generated art is a complex legal issue that does not have a clear answer. It may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the artwork’s creation.
In general, copyright laws are meant to protect original works of art that are written or drawn on a physical medium. In the case of art made by AI, the question of who owns it may depend on how much humans were involved in the process.
If an AI system makes all of the art on its own, with no or little help from humans, it’s not clear who would own the copyright. Some people say that the copyright should belong to the person or company that made the AI system, like the programmer or company that developed the AI system. Some people say that the AI system itself could be considered the creator and owner of the copyright, just like an artist would own the copyright to their work.


If, however, a human is involved in the creative process in a big way, like when a human artist gives input to or guides an AI system, it could be a bit murkier. In that case, the copyright may be owned by the artist who contributed to the creation of the artwork. The AI generator, in this case, could just be considered a tool. 
Ultimately, as technology changes, copyright ownership for art made by AI is likely to be a subject of ongoing legal debate. New legal frameworks are being developed to address these new forms of creative expression.
And that’s your lot for today. 
AI art is a rapidly evolving field, stretching the definition of “art.” While some people are skeptical of machines creating art, it is clear that AI-generated works have already had a significant impact on the art world. They’ve been displayed in museums and galleries and sold for large sums at auction.  RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Before employing artificial intelligence (AI) to find job candidates, Southwest Airlines had no definitive way to track the success of the company’s email and website hiring campaigns. The airline also couldn’t queue up potential applicants who’d logged into a job listings page and left before an applicable position had been posted.
Since it began using an AI-enabled hiring platform from tech firm Phenom, the airline now has “a warm pipeline of candidates” it can draw on whenever jobs opportunities arise, according to Kelby Tansey, manager for recruitment marketing at Southwest Airlines.
Tansey said the airline can now reach out to “passive” job candidates who came to Southwest but couldn’t find an open position at the time.











 
 
 
“We’ll drive them into certain pipelines within the Phenom platform so we can capture their resume, their skills, and note some of those candidates and then let them know when the job opens up,” Tansey said.

Southwest is among a growing number of organizations turning to AI-based tools to identify potential job candidates, schedule interviews, and reduce the overall time recruiters and hiring managers spend on those tasks.
From 35% to 45% of companies are expected to use AI-based talent acquisition software and services to help select and interview job prospects this year, according to recent studies.











 
 
 
 Southwest Airlines

Southwest Airline’s recruitment site powered by Phenom’s AI software.


Nearly three in four organizations boosted their purchases of talent acquisition technology in 2022 and 70% plan to continue investing this year — even if a recession arrives — according to a survey by enterprise hiring platform Modern Hire.
Forrester Research Principal Analyst Betsy Summers said she’s been getting more inquiries from clients about AI recruiting platforms.
“It has touched a nerve in the HR and recruiting world, promising to fix problems and frustrations that have been plaguing those teams — hard to decipher competency models, job descriptions that are vague or biased, increasing talent competition,” Summers said.











 
 
 
The questions Summers gets about recruitment platforms go beyond talent acquisition and include “skills-as-a-service” technology that has “a huge potential impact on how organizations plan their workforce, develop them, how and where they allocate work, and how they grow and retain workers.
“It could be a game changer,” Summers said.
A growing number of AI-based options
Along with Phenom’s SaaS-based Intelligent Talent Experience platform, other leading providers of AI-based talent acquisition software and services include Eightfold, Beamery, and Seekout — all of which perform skills inference and candidate-job matching. Other notable vendors include Clovers (with its recent acquisition of Talvista), HireVue, Pymetrics (recently acquired by Harver), and iCIMS, according to Forrester Research.











 
 
 
AI-based recruitment platforms can find “more diverse talent pools, and [offer] a more accurate approach to qualifying candidates by matching skills rather than on a job title match or other signal,” said Forrester Principal Analyst Betsy Summers.
Some of the use cases for talent acquisition platforms are efficiency-oriented, since  they’re used for interview scheduling, managing the candidate application process, assisting recruiters with follow-ups, and managing the applicant pipeline. Other platforms also focus on bias mitigation such as adjusting language in job descriptions and candidate communications to be more inclusive. Still others include remote video capabilities that automate early interviews.
 Phenom
HireVue’s candidate interviewing software, for example, uses a natural language bot to conduct an interview and provide a transcript for hiring managers and recruiters. It also has a video component that records an interview, offering each would-be hire 30 seconds to prepare for each question, and up to three minutes to answer. The video is then sent to the hiring manager to view.











 
 
 
Talent acquisition software also often relies on “fits scoring,” which uses specific metrics to match a job candidate’s qualifications to a specific opening.
Saving time at SASR Worforce Solutions
Bradley Cooper, director of IT at staffing firm SASR Workforce Solutions, said each recruiter in his company is responsible for hiring at least 360 people annually for various clients. In October 2021, SASR went live with Phenom’s platform, which  immediately provided efficiencies — among them, automatically matching candidates to job openings before a recruiter even contacted an applicant.
“When you work at our volume, you need tools to help get the candidates to you in a timely manner,” Cooper said. “As soon as a job opportunity is available, we can make it known to the candidate, and that goes out to the job board Phenom has. Before that, it just wasn’t a good recruiter or candidate experience.”











 
 
 
 SASR

An overview of when SASR sees the most traffic on its career site, which enables the staffing firm to use its dynamic and static list to create and deliver marketing campaigns during peak interaction times. 


As soon as a job candidate begins the application process, Phenom’s software begins building a profile of the person; if they’re a good fit for a SASR client, it feeds the candidate to a recruiter who can interview them, make an offer, and start the onboarding process. If the prospect is not yet ready to accept an offer, Phenom’s platform places them in a future candidate “talent community” or queue, allowing SASR to continue to contact them as opportunities come up.
SASR uses Phenom Hosted Apply, which provides a consistent experience for candidates, where they go from learning about a job to applying for it without having to leave the career site. Hosted Apply leverages API integrations Phenom made with third-party applicant tracking systems (ATS), and avoids the need for a candidate to get redirected to a separate ATS application process.
Phenom’s platform also builds out a dynamic and static list of potential candidates. The former has candidates who are added or removed as they find work; the latter is a constant list of workers who can be accessed for seasonal or part-time positions. The lists can also be used to develop recruiting campaigns, Cooper said.











 
 
 
“Over time, as we add more candidates to the list, the AI will recognize the like candidates with the same skills and locations for opportunities, so that allows us to see the best fit upfront,” Cooper said. “The really cool part about having a dynamic list is it allows you to target them for a specific opportunity, or if we do a specific campaign, we can curate that messaging to them through email or SMS to hit the correct touchpoints.”
 SASR

This is a KPI roll up providing visibility on SASR’s Job Seeker interviews. It’s important that interviews happen quickly, as job seekers tend to lose interest if an interview is not scheduled within a few days of application. 


Automated recruiting can save money
The return on investment for an automated recruiting platform can be tremendous. One study funded by Phenom and performed by Forrester showed a 449% ROI over three years with a payback period of less than six months — equaling more than $24 million in savings and business benefits.
The study showed that, on average, the recruiting platforms saved hiring managers and recruiters 11 hours per week. The software also increased the number of hires and decreased costs of new-hire onboarding, training, and time to productivity. 











 
 
 
Job recruiters at Southwest Airlines saw a 40% time savings when using Phenom’s analytics tools to find candidates, automate scheduling and do video interviews.
“After we went live with Phenom’s career site refresh in September, we saw a 25% increase in website engagement. That means more candidates are visiting more [job] pages,” Tansey said. “From a hiring perspective, we’re able to capture all candidate data in one place, follow up on leads, keep them nurtured and warm, and drive them to apply.”
“If we were driving only leads to jobs only open now, we wouldn’t be able to get the full value out of what we could do from an evergreen strategy…,” Tansey said. “We’re even able to engage at the campus level with kids who may be pursuing careers and keep them warm and bring them into our pipelines.”











 
 
 
AI can help uncover soft skills
Another feature of talent acquisition services is the ability to uncover a candidate’s “soft skills” including their ability to learn, work as a team player, be creative, or have empathy.
For example, AI-firm Paradox has bot software named “Olivia” that’s used, among other tools, to automate hiring for companies such as McDonalds, Speedway, Lowe’s and American Eagle. Paradox also acquired Traitify, whose software assesses a candidate based on five metrics: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Candidates are given a test that takes about 10 minutes and includes images the user responds to by selecting either “me” or “not me”.
Chatbots are typically employed by recruitment platforms to engage job seekers and ask them about their interests and skills; the bots can then present candidates with open positions for which they’re most qualified to apply.











 
 
 
For example, Phenom’s chatbot allows job seekers to peruse various markets, such as engineering, marketing, sales, and data science and machine learning. It then asks questions such as, “Ae you willing to relocate? and “How many years and specific experience do you have?” Once the queries are completed, the chatbot presents open positions the candidate can apply for.

The downside of AI platforms
Allyn Bailey, who spent 11 years as an HR recruitment executive at Intel, cautioned against becoming too dependent on chatbots because they may contain unintentional biases, leading to discrimination in the hiring process. Basically, the chatbot is only as good as the developers who created it.
“So, while ChatGPT can streamline the job application process, it’s best used as a supplement to traditional methods of evaluating candidates. You still need that human interaction and relationship building,” said Bailey, now the executive director of “hiring success” for talent acquisition platform SmartRecruiters. “And don’t forget to be mindful of the potential dangers and take steps to mitigate them.”











 
 
 
ChatGPT, and other AI-based tools, can only provide pre-written responses to candidates, and they may not accurately reflect that person’s unique skills, personality, and communication abilities. “That human touch is so important in the hiring process, and you don’t want to lose that,” Bailey said.
Forrester Research’s Summers agreed, saying AI ideally should qualify more  candidates into the pipeline than qualifying them out. AI should also help mitigate natural human bias in qualifying and selecting talent, not amplify it.
“Still fresh in our memory are stories about AI perpetuating bias in their qualification algorithm,” Summers said. “And in the case of interview analysis, AI not trained on women, people of color, and non-native English speakers can misread facial and vocal cues to make the wrong call about qualified candidates.”











 
 
 
Overall, however, sentiment about AI’s impact on organizations is positive, according to Forrester’s own survey data; 74% of respondents reported AI had a positive impact and 25% said the impact was “neutral.” 
Summers also cautioned that the regulatory environment is heating up for vendors and organizations deploying AI for recruitment and HR use cases. Those regulations are looking to protect candidates and employees from potentially harmful or biased practices. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development tracks over 800 policies concerning AI around the world. 
In HR, there is also a skills and confidence gap about AI that needs to be addressed. In 2021, only 19% of HR leaders were confident in their team’s AI capabilities, Summers said.
To protect candidates and companies, it’s imperative that organizations increase skills around AI management, establish ethical and responsible AI guidelines and resources for their employees and broader stakeholders, and vet their ecosystem for ethical and responsible AI practices, according to Summers. 











 
 
 
“The good news is that 80% of our survey respondents report that their organization observes and evaluates data and data products against AI responsibility, outcomes, compliance, and protection well or very well,” Summers said.

Prompt engineers are experts who write prose — rather than code — to test AI chatbots.
Their job is to identify the AI's errors and hidden capabilities so developers can address them.
Many companies are hiring prompt engineers, though some academics question the need for them.

Looking for a job in tech's hottest field? Knowing how to talk to chatbots may get you hired as a prompt engineer for generative AI.Prompt engineers are experts in asking AI chatbots — which run on large language models — questions that can produce desired responses. Unlike traditional computer engineers who code, prompt engineers write prose to test AI systems for quirks; experts in generative AI told The Washington Post that this is required to develop and improve human-machine interaction models.

Alex Shoop, an expert in AI systems design, told Venture Beat that as AI tools evolve, prompt engineers help ensure that chatbots are rigorously tested, that their responses are reproducible, and that safety protocols are followed.The rise of the prompt engineer comes as chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Users have asked ChatGPT to write cover letters, help with coding tasks, and even come up with responses on dating apps, highlighting the tech's impressive capabilities.

But critics say these tools can be biased, generate misinformation, and at times disturb users with cryptic responses.That's where prompt engineers can help. The Post's report said that while the role of the prompt engineer may vary depending on the company, the underlying mission is to understand the capabilities of AI and why AI gets things wrong.Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted on February 20, ""Writing a really great prompt for a chatbot persona is an amazingly high-leverage skill and an early example of programming in a little bit of natural language.""A report on the tech news site Dataconomy describing the day-to-day job of a prompt engineer said they may ask the AI to ""think step by step"" to test its logical reasoning capabilities, or they may continuously tweak a prompt like ""write an essay about AI"" to figure out which words generate the best response.

Prompt engineers can identify AI's flawsA chatbot's tendency to spit out eyebrow-raising responses — such as professing its love to users or revealing its secret alias — provides an opportunity for prompt engineers to identify the tech's faults and hidden capabilities, Riley Goodside, a prompt engineer at the AI startup Scale AI, told the Post. Then developers can fine-tune parts of the tool, Goodside said.

In a tweet in October, Goodside, who's been a prompt engineer since December, described how he worked through incorrect answers with AI systems.Goodside included screenshots of him asking a chatbot, ""What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born?"" The chatbot first said the Green Bay Packers. (Bieber was born in 1994, the year the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl.) Goodside then prompted the chatbot to ""enumerate a chain of step-by-step logical deductions"" to answer the question. Going through the steps, the bot recognized its error. When Goodside asked the question for the third time, the chatbot spit out the correct answer.Goodside has also tried to get an AI to go off-script by telling it to ignore previous instructions in exchange for new ones. He told the Post that ""this mischief"" is ""part of the plan"" to constrain the AI's behavior.

Prompt engineering may not be 'the job of the future'Some academics question how effective prompt engineers really are in testing AI.Shane Steinert-Threlkeld, a linguistics professor at the University of Washington, told the Post that prompt engineers can't actually predict what the bots will say.""It's not a science,"" Steinert-Threlkeld said. ""It's 'let's poke the bear in different ways and see how it roars back.'""Ethan Mollick, a Wharton School professor who's required his students to use ChatGPT for classwork, said he thinks the role of the prompt engineer is a fad that will peter out.

""I have a strong suspicion that 'prompt engineering' is not going to be a big deal in the long-term & prompt engineer is not the job of the future,"" Mollick tweeted in late February.Companies in a variety of industries are hiring prompt engineersThat isn't stopping companies across industries from hiring prompt engineers.BoardingArea, a news site for frequent flyers, is hiring a part-time ""ChatGPT specialist"" who'll focus on ""building and perfecting prompts to optimize content with our curation and republishing efforts,"" its job listing says.Listings on the freelance-work platform Upwork seek contracted prompt engineers, who could get paid up to $40 an hour to generate website content like blog posts and FAQs.

There are also hundreds of video lessons and a book on how to best use ChatGPT.""The hottest new programming language is English,"" Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former chief of AI, said in a tweet in January.

Ever since the launch of ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), the world has been abuzz with the potential of this ground-breaking technology. It is a natural language processing tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like responses to written or spoken prompts. Hence, not only can it learn from vast amounts of data, but ChatGPT can also produce responses that are difficult to distinguish from those of a human being.

This has led to many thinking about its potential in transforming numerous industries, including customer service, healthcare, and education, but most importantly in the world of work - Human Resources. With the ability to generate natural-language responses to job candidates' questions and concerns, ChatGPT can streamline the recruitment, hiring processes and much more. Also Read:

However, as with any new technology, there are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of Chat GPT. While some are worrying that this new-age tool could lead to job losses, others are concerned about the ethical implications of creating such a powerful technology. ChatGPT's potential to transform and evolve the world of work was the focus of People Matters’ most recent LinkedIn Live session under its Big Questions series. 
Panellists Greg Orme, the International keynote speaker and award-winning author who's delivered more than 400 talks to executive audiences around the world and Ashish Singh, the CTO of Virtualness, a platform that assists brands and creators in navigating the challenging Web3 environment, deliberated on the probable strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT on the workforce.
ChatGPT: A tool to help workers to focus on higher-level tasks
ChatGPT is a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI that has the potential to revolutionise the way workers approach their jobs. One of the key benefits of this tool is that it can automate repetitive and time-consuming jobs, allowing workers to focus on higher-level tasks that require creativity and critical thinking. This makes ChatGPT not a replacement for human workers, but an advanced tool that could help employees in achieving their full potential by freeing them from mundane tasks and enabling them to focus on assignments that require human ingenuity.
“Generative AI is incredibly powerful, but like any tool, it has both benefits and risks. Since its launch in November, ChatGPT has received recognition from Google, which has even considered hiring it as a base-level coder. This is a clear indication of how serious this technology is. In the 2020s, we need to learn how to differentiate ourselves from machines rather than competing with them because we will inevitably lose. This shift opens up new opportunities to add value in the workplace and carve out a space for unique human skills,” said the award-winning author.
“Over the last decade, we've seen significant technological advancements that have impacted various fields. It's important to note that these changes are not limited to a specific domain. For instance, HR professionals must adapt to new tools and technologies to remain agile. With the introduction of generative AI, we're already seeing a significant impact on daily work routines, as it allows individuals to focus on creative and strategic tasks that require human expertise, ultimately leading to more innovative and impactful work,” added the former Senior Vice President of Technology at Nykaa.  
The future of HR operations in the world of AI
In the age of artificial intelligence, it's no secret that many industries are being transformed, and the world of Human Resources is no exception. HR professionals have been relying on manual processes and a significant amount of paperwork for decades, but AI technologies like ChatGPT have emerged as game-changers in the field. According to the CTO of Virtualness, one of the most significant ways that ChatGPT is revolutionising HR operations is by streamlining recruitment processes. The tool can parse job descriptions and resumes to match candidates to suitable positions, saving HR professionals time and effort.
""There are many areas in which AI can have a significant impact in the short term, and one of those is recruitment. To process the vast amount of data available on candidates, their responses and resumes, AI can be largely helpful. However, the role of HR professionals is still critical in the recruitment process, particularly in terms of engaging with candidates. In addition, AI can be used to process and parse employee engagement and retention data from surveys, conversations, emails, and other sources. This can provide insights into employee sentiment, career growth aspirations, and organisational expectations, which can be used to improve the employee experience. While AI tools can automate these processes, it is important that HR professionals use the insights generated to build upon and enhance the employee experience,” Ashish Singh told People Matters. 
Adding up to the same, Greg Orme said, “By leveraging the efficiency and content creation capabilities of ChatGPT, HR professionals can redirect their time and efforts towards higher-order tasks that add strategic value to the organisation. Moreover, the model can assist leaders in supporting colleagues with performance management issues and structuring meetings, no matter where they are in the world. The applications of ChatGPT in the HR world are vast and varied, promising to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of HR operations in organisations of all sizes. With the integration of AI tools like ChatGPT, HR professionals can step up their game, becoming strategic partners to their organisations and maximising the value they bring to the table.”
The challenge of bias in generative AI
Generative AI is not immune to the problem of bias. Many assume that AI is neutral and objective, but in reality, AI is only as unbiased as the data it is trained on. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of the biases present in the training data and the potential impact on the output. The important thing to remember is that addressing bias requires recognising the problem, collecting diverse data, implementing bias detection and mitigation measures, promoting transparency and explainability, and ongoing efforts from all stakeholders.
“The use of AI in HR operations raises important considerations around potential risks and challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the potential for bias and discrimination in the data used to train AI models. This data reflects the biases of our society and culture and can have unintended consequences, such as changing scores or perpetuating backward-looking practices. To address these issues, guardrails must be put in place to ensure an integrated solution that is transparent and explainable. However, there is a risk that the complexity of AI tools can create a black box effect, where users are unable to understand why certain outputs are generated,” said Ashish Singh. 
“This lack of explainability can lead to a trial-and-error approach to finding the right prompts or inputs, rather than a systematic approach that ensures accuracy and fairness. Integrating AI with workplace operations can be an enhancer, but it is important to consider the human aspect of resource management. Organisations should be cautious not to use AI as a cost-saving tool that disregards the needs of employees. While AI can replicate certain functions of human cognition, it cannot replace the empathy and human connection that are essential in coaching and other human resource roles. Ultimately, AI should be used as a tool to enhance HR operations and free up time for human resources professionals to focus on the high-value tasks that require human skills and judgment,” he added. 
From AI to IA: Integrating human intelligence to revolutionise problem-solving
As the world becomes increasingly digitised, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that computers are better than humans at everything. While it's true that computers excel at tasks that involve repetitive calculations and vast amounts of data, they lack the critical thinking and emotional intelligence that humans possess. The key to understanding the value of both humans and computers lies in recognising their respective strengths.
""I believe the key is to understand the strengths of AI and human beings, and how we can collaborate effectively. As a mathematician at Carnegie Mellon University, Hans Moravec has identified the 'Moravec's Paradox' - AI excels in computation tasks where computers have an advantage over humans, while humans excel in tasks such as understanding context, connecting dots and comprehending the ""why"" behind things. Picasso once said that computers are useless because they only give you answers, whereas humans are good at asking the right questions to take it to the next level,” said the international keynote speaker.  
He further encouraged “people to be more curious, especially in generating prompts that lead to better AI output and then apply their contextual thinking to ensure that the output is relevant in the specific context. While ChatGPT can generate a plethora of ideas, the real superpower of humans is their ability to understand and interpret context-specific details accurately. Therefore, it is crucial to sharpen critical thinking skills when evaluating the accuracy and ethical implications of AI-generated content. After all, ChatGPT is like a barroom ball - always certain but often wrong, and it is up to us to critically analyse its output and decide whether it is appropriate for the situation at hand.Also Read:

The ChatGPT job boom 
Many industries are exploring how AI can improve and innovate their fields. While AI may replace some jobs, it is also creating new career paths that were previously unheard of. As technology continues to advance, the world will likely see more ChatGPT job booms and other AI-driven career paths emerge, creating new opportunities for those willing to embrace the changing landscape of work.
""The evolution of AI has been rapid, with new job opportunities for people, including roles in data management, auditing AI output for accuracy, and testing for biases. These processes will become valuable skills for non-tech individuals to upskill and be relevant in the new age. The goal is not to replace human creativity with AI, but rather to augment it, saving time and increasing productivity,” said the CTO of Virtualness.
""Organisations need to be careful not to overlook the added value that certain jobs provide beyond their surface-level functions. For example, a doorman or doorwoman in a posh hotel is not just opening and closing doors; they also signal the quality of the hotel, greet guests and provide security. Automating such a job could result in a loss of these extra benefits. Overall, the ability to unlearn and relearn will be essential for individuals facing job displacement due to automation. While some may need to completely change careers, for many, it will be more of an evolution. As we navigate these changes, it's important to remember the human strengths that AI cannot replace,” explained the award-winning author. 
Bias, privacy, and automation: The challenges of ChatGPT
ChatGPT has immense potential to transform the way we interact with technology. However, with such great power come significant challenges and risks. The potential bias that comes with such chatbots could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce existing prejudices. Additionally, the model may inadvertently pick up on and reproduce pejoratives, which could have devastating consequences. 
“There is a clear privacy issue with AI. As a tool that ingests and utilises data, it is crucial to be cautious about how it is handled. Over-reliance on AI, a narrow-minded view on job replacement, and bias issues are some of the challenges that have arisen over the last decade. To prevent AI from getting out of control, it's essential to ensure that the data input is accurate and bias-free. With great power comes great responsibility, and this powerful tool requires careful handling. Companies and individuals must approach it with caution and a sense of responsibility,” advised Greg Orme.

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant changes to the workforce, creating both opportunities and challenges for businesses and employees. While AI can improve efficiency, productivity, and accuracy, it also has the potential to displace jobs that were once considered secure.
AI-powered automation can perform routine and repetitive tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, reducing the need for manual labor. In manufacturing, for example, robots can assemble products faster and with fewer errors than humans, leading to increased production and reduced labor costs. In the transportation industry, self-driving vehicles are poised to replace human drivers in the near future, potentially causing job losses for millions of drivers.
However, the impact of AI on jobs is not limited to blue-collar workers. White-collar jobs such as accounting, legal work, and customer service are also at risk of being automated. AI-powered chatbots can provide customer service around the clock without the need for human interaction, while AI algorithms can analyze legal documents and contracts with greater speed and accuracy than human lawyers.

According to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, up to 800 million jobs worldwide could be lost to automation by 2030. The report predicts that the jobs most at risk are those that involve predictable physical tasks, data processing, and data collection. However, the report also notes that new jobs will be created as a result of AI, such as those related to the development and maintenance of AI systems.
The challenge for governments and businesses is to ensure that workers are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to adapt to the changing labor market. This may involve investing in education and training programs that focus on developing skills that are complementary to AI, such as creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence.
In conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work, it also has the potential to displace jobs and create significant social and economic challenges. To mitigate the negative effects of AI on the labor market, policymakers and business leaders must take a proactive approach to re-skilling and upskilling workers, so that they can thrive in the AI-powered economy of the future.

While other tools are available, like medical scribes, they are becoming increasingly expensive and unreliable due to turnover, a health system executive told Fierce Healthcare. (Ivan-balvan/GettyImages)
The University of Kansas Health System tapped medical transcription startup Abridge as a new tech partner to automate clinical notes and medical conversations for doctors.The rollout has the potential to serve more than 1,500 physicians across the system’s more than 140 locations. Abridge's technology listens to visits and uses smart tech to summarize the most important parts of the conversation for clinicians and patients.The company touts the partnership as the most significant rollout of generative AI in healthcare to date.The partnership comes at a time when providers around the country are buckling under increasing burnout, largely driven by clinical documentation responsibilities. At the University of Kansas Health System, providers spend 130 minutes a day on documentation outside work hours, according to the organization. This is often made worse by providers having to field additional follow-ups from patients.“This is an onerous responsibility that we have to create and it’s just very cumbersome the way we do it now,” Greg Ator, M.D., a practicing ENT physician and chief medical informatics officer at the organization said in an interview. “Just being done with documentation when you’re done with a visit is such an improvement.” Related'I cry and no one cares': Medscape survey shows doctor burnout, depression is getting worseWhile other tools are available to help with documentation, Ator noted, such as medical scribes, they are becoming increasingly expensive and unreliable due to turnover. Abridge’s technology identifies more than 90% of the key points from provider-patient conversations and quickly generates summaries in various formats meant for clinicians or patients, the company said.“Abridge is focused on putting the provider and patient at the center of all we do, reducing the burden of administrative tasks and helping clinicians focus on the patients in front of them,” Shivdev Rao, M.D., co-founder and CEO of Abridge, said in a press release. “The University of Kansas Health System and Abridge share a commitment to a future where AI helps providers and their patients feel more connected to each other, without technology getting in the way of the visit.”The technology generates a draft within a minute of the conversation ending, Abridge claims, and offers providers tools to expedite edits—like going back to the original audio recording. The tech integrates with electronic health record software including Epic.The company says its goal is to enhance, not replace, the work of providers. The tool also helps enhance the quality and consistency of clinical notes, Ator added.

“We don’t want a courtroom transcript. Nobody wants to read that. Nobody wants to correct that,” Ator said. “We need, as physicians, to be able to trust that this is producing an accurate product.” Abridge, founded in 2018, currently serves more than 2,000 clinicians. It also has a consumer-facing app for patients. Its enterprise solution for providers launched last year when it raised $12.5 million in a series A1 round. The company, whose tech is based on the same transformer architecture behind ChatGPT, contributes to machine learning research.

As artificial intelligence opens up and becomes democratized through platforms offering generative AI, it’s likely to alter tasks within at least 80% of all jobs, a new analysis suggests. Jobs requiring college education will see the highest impacts, and in many cases, at least half of peoples’ tasks may be affected by AI. It’s extremely important to add that affected occupations will be significantly influenced or augmented by generative AI, not replaced.


That’s the word from a paper published by a team of researchers from OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers included Tyna Eloundou with OpenAI, Sam Manning with OpenResearch and OpenAI, Pamela Mishkin with OpenAI, and Daniel Rock, assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, also affiliated with OpenAI and OpenResearch.

The research looked at the potential implications of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models and related technologies on occupations, assessing their exposure to GPT capabilities. “Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted,” Eloundou and her colleagues estimate. “The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure” — particularly jobs requiring college degrees. At the same time, they observe, “considering each job as a bundle of tasks, it would be rare to find any occupation for which AI tools could do nearly all of the work.”

PROMOTED
The researchers base their study on GPT-4, and use the terms large language models (LLMs) and GPTs interchangeably.

Their findings suggest that programming and writing skills are more likely to be ”influenced” by generative AI. On the other hand, occupations or tasks involving science and critical thinking skills are less likely to be influenced. Occupations that are seeing or will see a high degree of AI-based influence and augmentation (again, emphasis on influence and augment) include the following:


Interpreters and translators
Survey researchers
Poets, lyricists and creative writers
Animal scientists
Public relations specialists
Writers and authors
Mathematicians
Tax preparers
Financial quantitative analysts
Web and digital interface designers

GPTs “are improving in capabilities over time with the ability to complete or be helpful for an increasingly complex set of tasks and use-cases,” Eloundou and her co-authors point out. They caution, however, that the definition of a “task” is very fluid. “It is unclear to what extent occupations can be entirely broken down into tasks, and whether this approach systematically omits certain categories of skills or tasks that are tacitly required for competent performance of a job,” they add. “Additionally, tasks can be composed of sub-tasks, some of which are more automatable than others.”

There’s more implications to AI than simply taking over tasks, of course. “While the technical capacity for GPTs to make human labor more efficient appears evident, it is important to recognize that social, economic, regulatory, and other factors will influence actual labor productivity outcomes,” the team states. There will be broader implications for AI as it progresses, “including their potential to augment or displace human labor, their impact on job quality, impacts on inequality, skill development, and numerous other outcomes.”
Still, “accurately predicting future LLM applications remains a significant challenge, even for experts,” Eloundou and her co-authors caution. “The discovery of new emergent capabilities, changes in human perception biases, and shifts in technological development can all affect the accuracy and reliability of predictions regarding the potential impact of GPTs on worker tasks and the development of GPT-powered software.”
An important takeaway from this study is that generative AI — not to mention AI in all forms — is reshaping the workplace in ways that currently cannot be imagined. Yes, some occupations may eventually disappear, but those that can harness the productivity and power of AI to create new innovations and services that improve the lives of customers or people will be well-placed for the economy of the mid-to-late 2020s and beyond.

Search interest in ChatGPT has reached a 2,633% boost in interest since last December, shortly after its launch. For the artificial intelligence and machine learning industry, and for those working in tech as a whole, OpenAI’s chatbot represents a true crossing of the Rubicon.
A generative form of AI, it uses prompts to produce content and conversations, whereas traditional AI looks at things such as pattern detection, decision making, or classifying data. We already benefit from artificial intelligence, whether we realise it or not—from Siri in our Apple phones to the choices Netflix or Amazon Prime make for us to the personalisations and cyber protection that lie behind our commercial interactions.
ChatGPT is just one of an increasing number of generative AI tools, including Bing Chat and Google Bard. DeepMind’s Alpha Code writes computer programs at a competitive level; Jasper is an AI copywriter, and DALL-E, MidJourney and Stable Diffusion can all create realistic images and art from a description you give them.
As a result, generative AI is now firmly embedded in the mainstream consciousness, with much credit going to ChatGPT’s easy to use interface, and its ability to produce results that can be as sublime as they are ridiculous. Want it to produce some Python code? Sure thing—and it can generate you a funny Limerick too, if you’d like.

For more information check out TNW's Privacy Policy.*According to Salesforce, 57% of senior IT leaders believe generative AI is a game changer, and because it is intuitive and helpful, end users like it as well.
While your job may be safe from AI (for the moment), ChatGPT-generated content has gotten into the the top 20% of all candidates shortlisted for a communications consultant role at marketing company Schwa, and it has also passed Google’s level 3 engineering coding interview.
Roles that are likely to resist the advent of generative AI include graphic designers, programmers (though they are likely to adopt AI tools that speed up their process) and blockchain developers, but many other jobs are likely to be performed by AI in the (near) future.
These include customer service jobs—chatbots can do this efficiently. Bookkeeping or accounts roles are also likely to be replaced as software can do many of these tasks. Manufacturing will see millions of jobs replaced with smart machinery that does the same job, but faster.
But, while AI may replace some jobs, it will also generate a slew of new ones.
The World Economic Forum predicts that the technology will create 97 million new jobs by 2025. Jobs specifically related to the development and maintenance of AI and automation will see growing adoption as AI integrates across multiple industries.
These could include data detectives or scientists, prompt engineers, robotics engineers, machine managers, and programmers, particularly those who can code in Python which is key for AI development. AI trainers and those with capabilities related to modelling, computational intelligence, machine learning, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience will also be in demand.
Healthcare looks set to benefit too, with PwC estimating that AI-assisted healthcare technician jobs will see an upward surge. A sector that is already creating new jobs is automated transportation with Tesla, Uber, and Google investing billions into AI-driven self-driving cars and trucks.

Microsoft’s recent Copilot product enhancement in Office 365 shows how a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities is being embedded into business processes. Similarly, Google has begun previewing application programming interfaces (APIs) to access to its own generative AI, via Google Cloud and Google Workplace.







The recent Firefly announcement of text-to-image generative AI from Adobe also demonstrates how the industry is moving beyond gimmicky demonstrations used to showcase these systems into technology that has the potential to solve business problems.
Microsoft 365 Copilot uses large language models with business data and Microsoft 365 apps to boost the Microsoft office productivity suite with an AI-based assistant that helps users work more effectively. For instance, in Word, it writes, edits and summarises documents; in PowerPoint, it supports the creative process by turning ideas into a presentation through natural language commands; and in Outlook, it helps people manage their inbox. Copilot in Teams sits behind online meetings, making summaries of the conversation and presenting action points.
Adobe has launched the initial version of its generative AI for image-making, trained using Adobe Stock images, open content and public domain content where copyright has expired. Rather than trying to make digital artists, designers and photographers redundant, Adobe has chosen to train its Firefly system, based on human-generated images, which is focused on generating content based on images and text effects, which, according to Adobe, is safe for commercial use.
Google has put into beta its large language model, Bard, and embedded two generative AI models, PaLM API and MakerSuite, in Google Cloud and Google Workspace. Introducing the new development, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post: “Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity.”
While there are numerous online comparisons of the two rival large language models, ChatGPT is regarded as an older technology, but Microsoft’s $10bn investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, represents a very public commitment to it.
Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, Michael Woodridge, director of foundational AI research at the Turing Institute, said: “Google has got technology which, roughly speaking, is just as good as OpenAI. The difference is that OpenAI and Microsoft have got a year’s head start in the market, and that’s a year’s head start in the AI space, where things move so ridiculously quickly.”

Jurassic-2 is the latest model from AI21 Labs. The model is the successor to Jurassic-1, which was trained on 178 billion parameters, three billion parameters more than GPT-3.
OpenAI has introduced its latest large language model. With multimodal capabilities, it's expected to perform better while still suffering from some of the same problems.



In a recent blog discussing the speed with which OpenAI’s ChatGPT has developed into a model that seemingly understands human speech, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: “Any new technology that’s so disruptive is bound to make people uneasy, and that’s certainly true with artificial intelligence. I understand why – it raises hard questions about the workforce, the legal system, privacy, bias and more. AIs also make factual mistakes and experience hallucinations.”
For Gates, AI like ChatGPT offers a way for businesses to automate many of the manual tasks office workers need to do as part of their day-to-day job.
“Although humans are still better than GPT at a lot of things, there are many jobs where these capabilities are not used much,” he said.
“For example, many of the tasks done by a person in sales (digital or phone), service, or document handling (like payables, accounting or insurance claim disputes) require decision-making, but not the ability to learn continuously. Corporations have training programs for these activities, and in most cases, they have a lot of examples of good and bad work. Humans are trained using these data sets, and soon, these data sets will also be used to train AIs that will empower people to do this work more efficiently.”

Uses for business
Discussing the use of generative AI and large language models in business, Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester, said: “The big development here is that these large language models essentially give us a way to interact with digital systems in a very flexible and dynamic way.” This, he said, has not been available to a large swathe of users in the past, and they give users the ability to interact with data in a “more naturalistic way”.
Regulators are keen to understand the implications of this technology. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for instance, recently posted an advisory regarding generative AI tools like ChatGPT. In the post, the regulator said: “Evidence already exists that fraudsters can use these tools to generate realistic but fake content quickly and cheaply, disseminating it to large groups or targeting certain communities or specific individuals. They can use chatbots to generate spear-phishing emails, fake websites, fake posts, fake profiles and fake consumer reviews, or to help create malware, ransomware, and prompt injection attacks. They can use deep fakes and voice clones to facilitate imposter scams, extortion and financial fraud. And that’s very much a non-exhaustive list.”
The FTC Act covering prohibition on deceptive or unfair conduct can apply if an organisation makes, sells or uses a tool that is designed to deceive – even if that’s not its intended or sole purpose.
Curran said the technology used in these new AI systems is opaque to human understanding. “It’s not actually possible to look inside the model and find out why it’s stringing a sequence of words together in a particular way,” he said.
They are also prone to stringing together words to make phrases which, while syntactically correct, are nonsensical. This phenomenon is often described as hallucination. Given the limitations of the technology, Curran said it will be necessary for human curators to check the results from these systems to minimise errors.

Workers’ fear of new artificial intelligence technology makes sense: that technology has the potential to eliminate their jobs. But if we didn’t live under capitalism, AI could be used to liberate us from drudgery rather than hurl us into poverty.

Lately, I have been experimenting with artificial intelligence image-generating programs. Their power is astonishing. They’re not just good at the technical aspect of creating “art” but appear to be genuinely creative, producing works that not only match the competence of a highly skilled artist but that can be surprising, interesting, and even beautiful.




Of course, everything still depends on the human who is entering the prompt to tell the AI what to do. But nobody who sees these things in action can doubt that we’re entering a very strange new era in which a great deal that could be done by hand will soon be automated.
Many artists are up in arms about the new AI programs — and with good reason. Some are furious that their works have been used as training data without their permission. Others fear that corporate clients will simply turn to machines to do the work that used to be done by human hands. AI is causing the cost of image generation to plummet. In a capitalist economy, where everyone depends for survival on the value of their labor in the marketplace, a massive drop in the value of a skill will cause widespread suffering.
Art is far from the only domain about to be transformed by generative AI. Paralegals, programmers, market researchers, customer-service agents, financial analysts, and many other professions are at risk of seeing much of their work automated in the near future. OpenAI’s hugely successful ChatGPT not only writes bad jokes and slightly better poetry but is even helping to write published research papers. The models are only getting better, too. The newly released GPT4 is already being used to write whole books.
The powers of this new technology are frightening. Scammers are already using the ability to generate realistic “deepfakes” to fool people into thinking their relatives are asking them for money. Credible-looking misinformation can now be produced at lightning speed, an especially unfortunate development at a time when we lack trusted media institutions.
The problem is that new generative AI is being introduced into a capitalist society that is ill-equipped to handle it.
While Noam Chomsky, Gary Marcus, Erik J. Larson, and others have produced convincing arguments that the fear of artificial “superintelligence” coming in the near term is overstated, there are all kinds of ways in which the technology as it already exists can wreak havoc on society.





People are right to be terrified of the disruptions that AI might cause within our lifetimes. But when we think about what those disruptions actually are, it’s clear that the main problem is not actually the development of the technology itself. Introduced under a different economic and political system, few of the risks would be so grave.
The problem is that new generative AI is being introduced into a capitalist society that is ill-equipped to handle it.
Artists, for example, are mostly not afraid of AI because they fear having a machine be better at art. Chess players didn’t stop playing chess when the computer program Deep Blue beat grandmaster Garry Kasparov. And if art is made for pleasure and self-expression, it doesn’t matter what anyone else can do.

The problem is that, in our world, artists have to make a living through their art by selling it, and so they have to think about its market value. We’re introducing a technology that can utterly wreck people’s livelihoods, and in a free-market economic system, if your skills decline in value, you’re screwed.
It’s interesting that we talk about jobs being “at risk” of being automated. Under a socialist economic system, automating many jobs would be a good thing: another step down the road to a world in which robots do the hard work and everyone enjoys abundance. We should be able to be excited if legal documents can be written by a computer. Who wants to spend all day writing legal documents? But we can’t be excited about it, because we live under capitalism, and we know that if paralegal work is automated, that’s over three hundred thousand people who face the prospect of trying to find work knowing their years of experience and training are economically useless.





Luddism is a rational approach to automation in a capitalist society. If machines threaten your job, fight the machines. Even a reactionary like Tucker Carlson has said that politicians should intervene to stop automation, for example, by banning self-driving trucks, because having millions of people thrown out of work would cause too much social disruption. But that solution is absurd: Why would we have people do needless labor that could be done by robots? Truck drivers have their health destroyed and don’t get to see their families for long stretches of time. Even when a machine could do the hard work instead, we’re going to make people do it?
We can expand our imagination far further than Carlson’s. What if finding out that your job could be automated was a thrill? What if it meant that a worker could be paid while the robot did the work? How about this: once the job that you train for is automated, you get an automation pension and get to relax for the rest of your life. Everyone will be praying their job is next on the list to go.
How about this: once your job is automated, you get an automation pension and get to relax for the rest of your life. Everyone will be praying their job is next.
We shouldn’t have to fear AI. Frankly, I’d love it if a machine could edit magazine articles for me and I could sit on the beach. But I’m afraid of it, because I make a living editing magazine articles and need to keep a roof over my head. If someone could make and sell an equally good rival magazine for close to free, I wouldn’t be able to support myself through what I do. The same is true of everyone who works for a living in the present economic system. They have to be terrified by automation, because the value of labor matters a lot, and huge fluctuations in its value put all of one’s hopes and dreams in peril.





Most of the other problems AI could cause really boil down to problems of the way power and wealth are apportioned in our existing society. Because the world is organized into militarized nation-states, we have to worry that AI technology will be used in terrifying new superweapons. Because we let scams and fraud flourish in our Wild West economy, we will see a lot of people get rich using AI to prey on hapless consumers. The profit motive is already socially destructive, but AI will make it much worse, because it will allow companies to figure out how to more efficiently trick and exploit people. The new technologies are being developed by private corporations that have no incentive to ensure that a benefit to them is a benefit to all.
We need to be clear on the source of the problems with AI. They are real and will accelerate the crisis that socialists are devoted to helping humanity solve. But the problem is not technology itself. Technology should be a tool for liberation. Unless we transform the economic system, however, it will be a tool for ever greater exploitation and predation.

AI Won’t Kill Our Jobs, It Will Kill Our Job Descriptions—and Leave Us Better Off



By Vanessa Bates Ramirez
March 22, 2023 







The hype around artificial intelligence has been building for years, and you could say it reached a crescendo with OpenAI’s recent release of ChatGPT (and now GPT-4). It only took two months for ChatGPT to reach 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history (it took Instagram two and a half years to gain the same user base, and TikTok nine months).
In Ian Beacraft’s opinion, we’re in an AI hype bubble, way above the top of the peak of inflated expectations on the Gartner Hype Cycle. But it may be justified, because the AI tools we’re seeing really do have the power to overhaul the way we work, learn, and create value.
Beacraft is the founder of the strategic foresight agency Signal & Cipher and co-owner of a production studio that designs virtual worlds. In a talk at South by Southwest last week, he shared his predictions of how AI will shape society in the years and decades to come.
A Revolution in Knowledge Work
Beacraft pointed out that with the Industrial Revolution we were able to take skills of human labor and amplify them far beyond what the human body is capable of. “Now we’re doing the same thing with knowledge work,” he said. “We’re able to do so much more, put so much more power behind it.” The Industrial Revolution mechanized skills, and today we’re digitizing skills. Digitized skills are programmable, composable, and upgradeable—and AI is taking it all to another level.
Say you want to write a novel in the style of a specific writer. You could prompt ChatGPT to do so, be it by the sentence, paragraph, or chapter, then tweak the language to your liking (whether that’s cheating or some form of plagiarism is another issue, and a pretty significant one); you’re programming the algorithm to extract years worth of study and knowledge—years that you don’t have to put in. Composable means you can stack skills on top of each other, and upgradeable means anytime anytime an AI gets an upgrade, so do you. “You didn’t have to go back to school for it, but all of a sudden you have new skills that came from the upgrade,” Beacraft said.
The Era of the Generalist
Due to these features, he believes AI is going to turn us all into creative generalists. Right now we’re told to specialize from an early age and build expertise in one area—but what happens once AI can quickly outpace us in any domain? Will it still make sense to become an expert in a single field?
“Those who have expertise and depth in several domains, and interest and passion and curiosity across a broad swathe—those are the people who are going to dominate the next era,” Beacraft said. “When you have an understanding of how something works, you can now produce for it. You don’t have to have expertise in all the different layers to make that happen. You can know how the general territory or field operate, then have machines abstract the rest of the skills.”
For example, a graphic designer who draws a comic book could use AI-powered design tools to turn that comic book into a 3D production, and he doesn’t have to know 3D modeling, camera movement, blending, or motion capture; AI now enables just one person to perform all of the virtual production elements. “This wouldn’t have been possible a couple years ago, and now—with some effort—it is,” Beacraft said. The video below was created entirely by one person using generative AI, including the imagery, sound, motion, and talk track.

Generative AI tools are also starting to learn how to use other tools themselves, and they’re only going to get better at it. ChatGPT, for example, isn’t very good at hard science, but it could pass those kinds of questions off to something like WolframAlpha and include the tool’s answer in its reply.
This is not only going to change our work, Beacraft said, it’s going to change our relationship with work. Right now, organizations expect incremental employee improvement in narrowly-defined roles. Job titles like designer, accountant, or project manager have key performance indicators that typically improve two to three percent per year. “But if employees only grow incrementally, how can organizations expect exponential growth?” Beacraft asked.
AI will take our traditional job roles and make them horizontal, giving us the ability to flex in any direction. As a result, we’ll have just-in-time skills and expertise on demand. “We will not lose our jobs, we will lose our job descriptions,” Beacraft said. “When organizations have teams of people working horizontally, all that new capability is net new, not incremental—and all of a sudden you have exponential growth.”
More Work, Not Less
That growth could do the opposite of what the predominant narrative tells us: that AI, robotics, and automation will take over various kinds of work and do away with our jobs. But AI could very well end up creating more work for us.
For example, teams of scientists using AI to help them run experiments more efficiently could increase the number of experiments they perform—but then they have more results, more data to analyze, and more work sifting through all this information to ultimately draw a conclusion or find what they’re looking for. But hey—AI is getting good at handling extra administrative work, too.
We may be in an AI hype bubble, but this technology is reaching more people than it ever has before. While there are certainly nefarious uses for generative AI—just look at all the students trying to turn in essays written by ChatGPT, or how deepfakes are becoming harder to pinpoint—there are as many or more productive uses that will impact society, the economy, and our lives in positive ways.
“It’s not just about data and information, it’s about how these AIs can help us shape the world,” Beacraft said. “It’s about how we project what we want to create onto the world around us.”

It’s an open-source tool and recently added ChatGPT Plugins. It provides so many capabilities that I find useful:✨ integrate with various LLM providers including OpenAI, Cohere, Huggingface, and more.✨ create a question-answering or text summarization bot with your own document✨ provide OpenAI ChatGPT Retriever Plugin✨ deal with chat history with LangChain Memory✨ chain various LLMs together and use LLMs with a suite of tools like Google Search, Python REPL, and more.✨ and so many moreWhat’s more amazing is that LangChain is open-source and it is a community effort. In this blog post, I’m going to go over 6 functionalities that I find useful in LangChain.You can find the code for this blog post on my Github repo here. You will need to install the needed packages, import packages, and set up API keys (see cells 1–3 in my notebook) before running any of the code below.1. LangChain integrates with many LLM providersWith the same interface, you get access to many LLM models from various LLM providers including OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, Huggingface Hub, Azure OpenAI, Manifest, Goose AI, Writer, Banana, Modal, StochasticAI, Cerebrium, Petals, Forefront AI, PromptLayer OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepInfra, and self-hosted Models.Here is an example of accessing the OpenAI ChatGPT model and GPT3 model, Cohere’s command-xlarge model, and Google’s Flan T5 model hosted on Hugging Face Hub.chatgpt = ChatOpenAI(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo')gpt3 = OpenAI(model_name='text-davinci-003')cohere = Cohere(model='command-xlarge')flan = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id=""google/flan-t5-xl"")Then we can give a prompt to each of these models and see what they return. One thing to note is that for chat models, we can specify is the message is a human message, an AI message, or a system message. That’s why for the ChatGPT model, I specified my message as a human message.2. Question answering with external documentsAre you interested in building a question-answering bot with external documents? Are your documents saved in PDF, txt file, or even Notion? And what if I would like to do a question-answering both with YouTube videos?No problem, LangChain’s got you covered. LangChain provides a lot of document loaders: File Loader, Directory Loader, Notion, ReadTheDocs, HTML, PDF, PowerPoint, Email, GoogleDrive, Obsidian, Roam, EverNote, YouTube, Hacker News, GitBook, S3 File, S3 Directory, GCS File, GCS Directory, Web Base, IMSDb, AZLyrics, College Confidential, Gutenberg, Airbyte Json, CoNLL-U, iFixit, Notebook, Copypaste, CSV, Facebook Chat, Image, Markdown, SRT, Telegram, URL, Word Document, Blackboard. Do you have another source that’s not listed here? You can contribute and add to LangChain since it’s open-source!Here is an example where we use the TextLoader to load a local txt file, create the VectoreStore index, and query your index. Intuitively, your documents will be split and embedded into vectors and stored in a vector database. The query finds which vector is the closest to the question vector in the vector database.The exciting news is that LangChain has recently integrated the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin so people can use this retriever instead of an index. What’s the difference between an index and a retriever? According to LangChain, “An index is a data structure that supports efficient searching, and a retriever is the component that uses the index to find and return relevant documents in response to a user’s query. The index is a key component that the retriever relies on to perform its function.”3. Keep/Summarize Chat HistoryWhen you chat with ChatGPT, it doesn’t keep your chat history. You will need to copy and paste your chat into the new prompt to let it aware of the history. LangChain solves this problem by providing several different options for dealing with chat history — keep all conversations, keep the latest k conversations, summarize the conversation, and a combination of the above.Here is an example where we use ConversationBufferWindowMemory to keep the latest 1 round of conversation, use ConversationSummaryMemory to summarize previous conversations, and use CombinedMemory to combine two methods:from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain.chains import ConversationChainfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory, CombinedMemory, ConversationSummaryMemoryconv_memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(    memory_key=""chat_history_lines"",    input_key=""input"",    k=1)summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input_key=""input"")# Combinedmemory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv_memory, summary_memory])_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """"""The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.Summary of conversation:{history}Current conversation:{chat_history_lines}Human: {input}AI:""""""PROMPT = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=[""history"", ""input"", ""chat_history_lines""], template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE)llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)conversation = ConversationChain(    llm=llm,     verbose=True,     memory=memory,    prompt=PROMPT)Here is the result where you can see the summary of the conversation and the latest conversation passed into the prompt.4. ChainsSometimes you might want to chain different LLMs. For example,You may want the output of the first LLM to serve as the input of the second LLM.Or you may want to summarize the outputs of the first and the second LLM and pass the summary in as input to the third LLM.Or you may want to chain your language model with another utility chain to do math or Python operation.Here is an example of the most basic SimpleSequentialChain method. The first chain asks ChatGPT to get a good product name for a company that makes colorful socks. ChatGPT returns “Rainbow Sox Co.” The second chain uses this name as input and asks ChatGPT to write a catchphrase for the company “Rainbow Sox Co.” ChatGPT wrote: “Put a little color in your step with Rainbow Sox Co!”from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain import LLMChainfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (    ChatPromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate(        prompt=PromptTemplate(            template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",            input_variables=[""product""],        )    )chat_prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([human_message_prompt])chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9)chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt_template)second_prompt = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=[""company_name""],    template=""Write a catchphrase for the following company: {company_name}"",)chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChainoverall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain, chain_two], verbose=True)# Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain.catchphrase = overall_chain.run(""colorful socks"")print(catchphrase)5. AgentAn agent has access to the language model and a suite of tools for example Google Search, Python REPL, math calculator, and more. The agent uses LLM and various frameworks to decide which tools to use for which task. This is very similar to the ChatGPT Plugins. Here is an example:We loaded two tools in this example: serpapi is for Google Search and llm-math is for doing math calculations. We asked “Who is Leo DiCaprio’s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?” The language model first comprehended the question and decided to take the search action that fires up the search API calls. Then it got the result from the search agent, decided to use llm-math to do calculate the math, and then got the final result.In another example, instead of using the llm-math as a calculator, we can use the Python REPL to execute a Python code for the calculation:6. ChatGPT PluginsChatGPT Plugins just came up this week and LangChain already added the ChatGPT Plugins feature. Here is an example, where we use the AIPluginTool to load the plugin from a shopping website. This plugin is exactly the same as the one OpenAI uses. When we ask the question “what t shirts are available in klarna?” The LLM decided to use the Klarna plugin and got a response of a series of OpenAI Spec and then decided to do a requests to get data, and it was able to return great answers.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agentfrom langchain.tools import AIPluginTooltool = AIPluginTool.from_plugin_url(""https://www.klarna.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json"")llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)tools = load_tools([""requests""] )tools += [tool]agent_chain = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=""zero-shot-react-description"", verbose=True)agent_chain.run(""what t shirts are available in klarna?"")ConclusionOverall, I’m quite impressed with the capabilities of LangChain and how fast the community is able to add new features. There are also many other features that I didn’t mention in this blog post including data augmentation, few-shot learning, evaluation, model comparison, and more. I hope this blog post helps you have a better understanding of various LangChain features.

Advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence someday could affect human careers.









Why isn’t everyone already unemployed? After all, experts have been predicting for decades that technological automation might soon take most of our jobs. With the rise of even more powerful artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technologies, these same fears are leading to a fresh round of worse-case forecasts about the displacement of skills and sectors. 
A new study forecasts that “up to 49 percent of workers could have half or more of their tasks exposed” to AI-powered large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4. A decade ago, researchers at the University of Oxford published a widely cited study that similarly predicted 47 percent of U.S. jobs were at high risk of automation. 


  

The good news is that the sky is not falling due to AI. Largely the opposite of what the Oxford scholars predicted about AI job losses came true. Since 2013, the U.S. economy has added 16 million jobs and the unemployment rate fell steadily despite continued automation and increasing robotization of many workplaces. The profession that the Oxford report said faced the highest risk of technological disruption—insurance underwriters—saw employment grow 16.4 percent. Meanwhile, the biggest employment problem the economy faces today is that many business sectors are struggling to find workers to fill open positions. The White House even announced a set of new initiatives to lure more Americans back into the workforce.
There are other reasons to be skeptical about grim forecasts regarding AI and employment. First, many past predictions about technologically induced unemployment were wrong because, as noted in a new R Street Institute report on the history of automation fears, we often lack the imagination to describe future jobs or worker skills. A review of old government labor market forecasts or economic papers finds no mention of today’s hottest jobs or skills. Glassdoor’s 2022 best jobs list includes job titles such as: full stack engineer, enterprise architect and machine learning engineer. These jobs would not have been comprehensible to analysts or economists in past decades.
Second, pundits often fail to appreciate how humans adapt rapidly in the face of technological change. Where experts see ominous threats because of new technologies, many others see an opportunity to create new businesses and jobs. A new book, “Working with AI: Real Stories of Human-Machine Collaboration,” offers dozens of case studies of firms integrating algorithmic technologies in the workplace today and shows how organizations are “practicing augmentation, not large-scale automation.” We are using our machines to create entirely new skills and professions.
We’ve seen this story before. Until the 1960s, human “calculators” did hard math on paper and chalkboards until mainframe computers came along and took over those jobs. But that automation freed up those workers to build even better computing machines. The result was the digital revolution, with entrepreneurs and workers seizing new opportunities.
Finally, many technological trends get over-hyped but often fail to materialize. The past decade has seen a lot of hype about autonomous vehicles, leading to much speculation about the potential for job loss for professional drivers. But it turns out that robotic driving is much harder than anticipated and there continues to be a massive shortage of human drivers. 
Market forecasts also tend to overlook how social norms and cultural resistance affect technological adoption. A robot could potentially cut your hair or even be your therapist, but in both cases most people will want an actual human doing that job. Many tasks on airplanes today are handled by autopilot technology, which has dramatically improved aviation safety, but we still want human pilots in the cockpit.


  

Many jobs will be susceptible to AI and automation, however. Government can try to help reskill workers, even though past retraining programs have not fared well. To better prepare the workforce of the future, policymakers can use a mix of policies to enhance STEM education, tax deductions for retraining, better online learning programs, technical recertification programs, portable benefits solutions and vocational apprenticeship models. It is equally important that lawmakers relax barriers to labor mobility and employment flexibility, especially occupational licensing rules. 
But AI isn’t going away and to prosper, we’ll need to learn how to quickly adapt alongside our latest technological creations.

We’ve seen this story before. Until the 1960s, human “calculators” did hard math on paper and chalkboards until mainframe computers came along and took over those jobs. But that automation freed up those workers to build even better computing machines. The result was the digital revolution, with entrepreneurs and workers seizing new opportunities. Finally, many technological trends get over-hyped but often fail to materialize. The past decade has seen a lot of hype about autonomous vehicles, leading to much speculation about the potential for job loss for professional drivers. But it turns out that robotic driving is much harder than anticipated and there continues to be a massive shortage of human drivers.&nbsp; Market forecasts also tend to overlook how social norms and cultural resistance affect technological adoption. A robot could potentially cut your hair or even be your therapist, but in both cases most people will want an actual human doing that job. Many tasks on airplanes today are handled by autopilot technology, which has dramatically improved aviation safety, but we still want human pilots in the cockpit. Many jobs will be susceptible to AI and automation, however. Government can try to help reskill workers, even though past retraining programs have not fared well. To better prepare the workforce of the future, policymakers can use a mix of policies to enhance STEM education, tax deductions for retraining, better online learning programs, technical recertification programs, portable benefits solutions and vocational apprenticeship models. It is equally important that lawmakers relax barriers to labor mobility and employment flexibility, especially occupational licensing rules.&nbsp; But AI isn’t going away and to prosper, we’ll need to learn how to quickly adapt alongside our latest technological creations.

Generative AI describes artificial intelligence models that, when trained on massive data sets, are capable of automatically producing content in the form of text, images, audio and video — all by predicting the next word or pixel.
What Is Generative AI?Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence in which algorithms automatically produce content in the form of text, images, audio and video. These systems have been trained on massive amounts of data, and work by predicting the next word or pixel to produce a creation.

Typically, it starts with a simple text input, called a prompt, in which the user describes the output they want. Then, various algorithms generate new content according to what the prompt was asking for.

“It’s essentially AI that can generate stuff ... The quality of the output is why people are so excited.”

What began as OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in 2022 has now become a subcategory of artificial intelligence that is growing at a breakneck pace, with tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon hopping on the bandwagon.
“It’s essentially AI that can generate stuff,” Sarah Nagy, the CEO of Seek AI, a generative AI platform for data, told Built In. And, these days, some of the stuff generative AI produces is so good, it appears as if it were created by a human. “The quality of the output is why people are so excited,” Nagy said.
Popular Generative AI ToolsChatGPT: ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, with a unique ability to not only generate written content but also converse with users fluently.
DALL-E 2: Also created by OpenAI, DALL-E 2 can generate realistic images with nothing more than a short text prompt thanks to a process called diffusion, which begins with a pattern of random dots that gradually form an image.
Gemini: Gemini is a generative AI chatbot created by Google, based on its model of the same name. Formerly called Bard, it can answer questions asked by users or create new content from text or image prompts.
Midjourney: Midjourney is a text-to-image generator that produces pieces that are so impressive that it is the only platform of its kind to win an art competition.
Claude: Released by the company Anthropic, Claude is an AI assistant that runs on the Claude 2.1 LLM and uses ‘constitutional AI,’ relying on ethical principles to guide its outputs.
Alexa: Amazon’s newly redesigned voice assistant is powered by a large language model that allows it to be more conversational.

How Does Generative AI Work?
At its core, generative AI technology is able to work due to three specific building blocks: Generative adversarial networks, transformers and large language models.
 
Generative Adversarial Networks
None of this was really possible until around 2014 with the introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs — machine learning models that have two neural networks competing with each other in order to become more accurate in their predictions. One neural network artificially manufactures fake outputs disguised as real data, while the other works to distinguish between the artificial data and real data — all the while using deep learning methods to improve their techniques. AI-generated images, videos and audio would not be possible without GANs.
 
Transformers
Transformers are a type of machine learning model that makes it possible for AI models to process and form an understanding of natural language. Transformers allow models to draw minute connections between the billions of pages of text they have been trained on, resulting in more accurate and complex outputs. Without transformers, we would not have any of the generative pre-trained transformer, or GPT, models developed by OpenAI, Bing’s new chat feature or Google’s Gemini chatbot.
 
Large Language Models
The final ingredient of generative AI is large language models, or LLMs, which have billions or even trillions of parameters. LLMs are what allow AI models to generate fluent, grammatically correct text, making them among the most successful applications of transformer models.
In general, the recent acceleration of technical progress and usage of generative AI has been nothing short of revolutionary. And it doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon.

How Are Generative AI Models Trained?
Generative AI models are trained by feeding their neural networks large amounts of data that is preprocessed and labeled — although unlabeled data may be used during training. 
A common method for training generative AI models is employing diffusion models. Diffusion models add noise to training data, then remove the noise as they learn how to reconstruct the data as it was before. Before diffusion models arose, generative adversarial networks were the most popular training method.  
Regardless of the approach, generative AI models must be evaluated after each iteration to determine how closely their generated data matches the training data. Teams can adjust parameters, add more training data and even introduce new data sets to accelerate the progress of generative AI models.         
 
What Types of Output Can Generative AI Produce?
Generative AI has become known for producing:
Text: With ChatGPT ushering in a generative AI rush, written text is commonly associated with generative AI tools. 
Images: Lensa first created buzz around generative AI images on social media, and more image generators are now available.    
Videos: Motion visuals are also undergoing change, with AI video generators providing various editing features. 
Audio: AI has left its mark in the music industry, providing audial support for professional and casual musicians alike. 
 
How Is Generative AI Being Used?
The implementation of generative artificial intelligence is altering the way we work, live and create. It’s a source of entertainment and inspiration, as well as a means of convenience. And if a business or field involves code, words, images or sound, there is likely a place for generative AI. Looking ahead, some experts believe this technology could become just as foundational to everyday life as the cloud, smartphones and the internet itself.
Some Uses of Generative AIDebug code
Write speeches
Write song lyrics
Idea generation
Write personalized emails
Write social media posts
Create 3D objects in games
Speed up game development with code completion

For one, software developers have increasingly been looking to generative AI tools like Tabnine, Magic AI and Github Copilot to not only ask specific coding-related questions, but also fix bugs and generate new code. And AI text generators are being used to simplify the writing process, whether it’s a blog, a song or a speech. 
“I think it can be helpful for sparking creativity and ideation. That’s what I use it for,” Jordan Harrod, a Ph.D candidate at Harvard and MIT and host of an AI-related educational YouTube channel, told Built In. In fact, she used an AI text-generator to help write a speech for Gen AI, a generative AI conference recently hosted by Jasper. “That did not end up being the final talk, but it helped me get out of that writer’s block because I had something on the page that I could start working with,” she said.
AI-generated text has also become a go-to resource for teams that need to produce clear, written content at scale, such as marketing or sales.
“If you look at sales teams, they’re constantly on the phone, they’re sending emails, they’re on LinkedIn and social media trying to generate a lot of content and use a lot of content,”  Srinath Sridhar, the co-founder and CEO of sales-focused generative AI startup Regie.ai, told Built In. His company Regie.ai and other similar tools automate all of that — the personalized emails, the call scripts, and so on. “We take generative AI and then apply it to all the sales workflows for sales people.”

Generative AI has also made waves in the gaming industry — a longtime adopter of artificial intelligence more broadly. Now, generative AI is transforming not only game development, but also game testing and even gameplay. Sony-owned Haven Studios and Electronic Arts have been working to fold this technology into the making of its games while Roblox unveiled plans to implement generative AI capabilities into its Roblox Studio building tool.

“We are seeing this incredible potential, where people can just use natural language to describe things the way they are used to describing them, and then create them.”

The goal is to “democratize content creation,” Stefano Corazza, the head of Roblox Studio, told Built In, removing the technological hurdles that usually come with game development and allowing anyone to be a content creator — whether they’re a game designer working in a professional studio or a 10-year-old just discovering video games.
“Generative AI is just the best thing that has happened to us,” he continued. “We are seeing this incredible potential, where people can just use natural language to describe things the way they are used to describing them, and then create them.”
In addition to the natural language interface, Roblox also plans to roll out generative AI code-completion functionality to help speed up the game development process.
“We are really pushing real-time collaboration for building worlds, coding and all aspects of experience creation. And at the same time we want to make it easier and faster to create new content,” Corazza added. “Generative AI is the best tool that we have at the moment to really make the process easier and more accessible.”

Advantages of Generative AI
Generative AI promises to simplify various processes, providing businesses, coders and other groups with many reasons to adopt this technology.
 
Easy to Use
Early versions of this technology typically required submitting data via an API, or some other complicated process. Developers then had to familiarize themselves with special tools and then write applications using coding languages like Python. Today, using a generative AI system usually requires nothing more than a plain language prompt of a couple sentences. And once an output is generated, they can usually be customized and edited by the user.
 
Improved Decision-Making
For instance, Seek allows companies to essentially ask their data questions without ever having to touch the data itself. By adding Seek to their data stack, a given company’s employees can get whatever information they need of their proprietary data by typing in a simple query, instead of having to bombard their data science team with ad-hoc questions — allowing them to get whatever information they need quickly and efficiently.
“Anybody is able to ask or instruct AI in natural language,” Seek CEO Nagy said. “And able to get so many things done so quickly that they just can’t get done now without spending weeks of manual work.”
 
Increased Efficiency
To be sure, generative AI’s promise of increased efficiency is another selling point. This technology can be used to automate tasks that would otherwise require manual labor — days of writing and editing, hours of drawing, and so on. 
 
Cost Savings
The speed and automation that generative AI brings to a company not only produces results faster than they would ordinarily be produced, but it also has the potential to save businesses money. Products and tasks completed in less time leads to a better customer experience, which then contributes to greater revenue and ROI. 
 
Faster Business Operations
The speed, efficiency and ease of use permitted by generative AI is what makes it such an appealing tool to so many companies today. It’s why companies like Salesforce, Microsoft and Google are all scrambling to incorporate generative AI across their products, and why businesses are eager to find ways to fold it into their operations.
“People are looking for nails to hit using this hammer,” Sridhar said. “It’s a very new piece of tech that has fundamentally changed what you can do from even five years back.”

Challenges of Generative AI
Still, this technology also comes with quite a few challenges. Its mass adoption is fueling various concerns around its accuracy, its potential for bias and the prospect of misuse and abuse.
 
Lack of Accountability 
Because tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E were trained on content found on the internet, their capacity for plagiarism has become a big concern. And issues related to whether AI companies have rights to use the data that trained their system, whether the output of generative engines can be copyrighted, and who is responsible if an AI system generates defamatory or dangerous outputs, do not have clear answers.

“There is going to be an explosion of content ... With big powers comes big responsibility.”

“It’s all coming from the same training data, so the creativity and originality of creating things kind of goes away when you do that,” YouTuber Harrod said. “We don’t really have a great framework for things like attribution, in this particular case. And then compensation and royalty systems.”
 
Less Supervision and Safeguards
For the most part, laws specific to the creation and use of artificial intelligence do not exist. This means most of these issues will have to be handled through existing law, at least for now. It also means it will be up to companies themselves to monitor the content being generated on their platform — no small task considering just how quickly this space is moving.
“There is going to be an explosion of content,” Roblox Studio’s Corazza said. “[Companies’] responsibility is to make sure the content that’s generated doesn’t offend anyone, and lets people create with civility.”
 
Inaccurate Responses 
Generative AI systems also tend to get things completely wrong. Their propensity for “hallucinations,” or creating information that is factually inaccurate, can lead to a mass spread of misinformation.
Nagy likens generative AI to an improv comedy performer: “If you’re pretending to be a character, you have to just spit out content that conveys that you’re that character, when in reality if you don’t know what you’re talking about you’re still going to make the scene work.”
This is true of all generative AI. At the moment, there is no fact-checking mechanism built into this technology. Models don’t have any intrinsic mechanism to verify their outputs, and users don’t necessarily do it either.
“That’s a really hard problem to solve,” Harrod said. “When it comes to most generative AI outputs, I do worry about people just taking the output as fact and moving on.”

Limited Capabilities and Access
While much of the recent progress pertaining to generative artificial intelligence has focused on text and images, the creation of AI-generated audio and video is still a work in progress.
In 2020, OpenAI released Jukebox, a neural network that generates music (including “rudimentary singing”) as raw audio in a variety of genres and styles. A series of other AI music generators have followed, including one created by Google called MusicLM, and the creations are continuing to improve. 
The same goes for AI generated voices. For instance, VALL-E, a new text-to-speech model created by Microsoft, can reportedly simulate anyone’s voice with just three seconds of audio, and can even mimic their emotional tone. It’s worth noting, however, that much of this technology is not fully available to the public yet.
 
Development of Deepfakes
There are a number of platforms that use AI to generate rudimentary videos or edit existing ones. Unfortunately, this has led to the development of deepfakes, which are deployed in more sophisticated phishing schemes. But this facet of generative AI isn’t quite as advanced as text, still images or even audio.
“We’re not quite at the point where you can type in ‘Make me a YouTube video that does XYZ,’ and have something come out that’s really quite as useful in terms of something that you’d use for actual content,” Harrod said. Still, she added, “it’s definitely a field that’s moving fast.”

A Brief History of Generative AI
While breakthroughs like ChatGPT and DALL-E have certainly placed generative AI in the spotlight, the concept of AI-generated content can actually be traced all the way back to the 1960s with the invention of ELIZA — a simple chatbot created by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum.
That being said, generative AI as we understand it now is much more complicated than what it was half a century ago. Thanks to advancements in natural language processing, generative AI systems can take raw data in the form of written and spoken words and turn them into written sentences and speech, which are represented as vectors using various encoding techniques. Raw images can be transformed into visual elements, too, also expressed as vectors.
 
The Future of Generative AI
Despite its challenges and shortcomings, the future of generative AI looks bright, particularly in the wake of OpenAI announcing the release of API access to ChatGPT — which promises to usher in a wave of new chatbots and other generative AI interfaces.
“I hope we make tools that can be used for good. And I hope we make tools that people need. Not just make tools for the sake of making them, but make tools because they further our goals as people and societies,” Harrod said.

“I hope we make tools that can be used for good. And I hope we make tools that people need.”

OpenAI also unveiled its much-anticipated GPT-4 in March 2023, which will be used as the underlying engine for ChatGPT going forward. In addition, the company has started selling access to GPT-4’s API so that businesses and individuals can build their own applications on top of it.
While GPT-4 promises more accuracy and less bias, the detail getting top-billing is that the model is multimodal, meaning it accepts both images and text as inputs, although it only generates text as outputs. Right now, an AI text generator tends to only be good at generating text, while an AI art generator is only really good at generating images. Multimodal capabilities could be a real game changer.
“What we are going to have in the next few years is all of those pieces coming together so that you can have multiple modes of communication simultaneously,” Sridhar said. “So you can write a script, you can have a video that goes with the script, you can actually have voice-overs that go with the video.”

Artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT are coming for the American workforce — and if you're an educated, white-collar worker making up to $80,000 a year, you're among the most likely to be affected, researchers say.Researchers from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania conducted a study to see how GPT-4 — OpenAI's latest, most advanced language-processing model — may impact the American workforce.

The researchers wanted to find out which jobs are most likely to be ""exposed"" to the model's capabilities; the study defines exposure as ""economic impact without distinguishing between labor-augmenting or labor-displacing effects.""Using job data from the US Department of Labor, the researchers found that up to 80% of the US labor force could see ""at least 10% of their work tasks affected"" by GPT language models and that 19% of workers ""may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted,"" according to the study.

But deeper analysis found that the impacts of AI on the workforce may affect some workers more than others.Those who work jobs with ""higher wages"" are at risk of higher exposure than workers with lower wages, the study found — ""a result contrary to similar evaluations of overall machine learning exposure."" The impact of AI on jobs increases as salaries get closer to $80,000.Jobs in the ""information processing industries,"" like IT, are most exposed to generative AI, while jobs in ""manufacturing, agriculture and mining"" are the least exposed. That's because roles that use ""programming and writing skills"" are most in-line with GPT's capabilities.Some of the jobs listed as ""occupations with highest exposure"" include tech jobs like blockchain engineers; data-heavy roles like mathematicians, financial quantitative analysts, accountants, and tax preparers; and communication careers such as writers, public relations specialists, interpreters and translators, poets, and lyricists.

Given how these white-collar jobs require advanced skills, it makes sense that the researchers also found that workers with bachelor's, master's, and other professional degrees are at high risk of exposure to AI. The opposite was also discovered to be true: Jobs that only require a high school diploma, vocational school, or on-the-job training — including, food preparation workers, electricians, barbers, and medical assistants — may not feel the brunt of AI's impact.The researchers did not respond to Insider's immediate request for comment before publication.

The study comes as many workers turn to impressive generative AI tools to do things like develop code, write articles, and generate lesson plans, rekindling an ongoing debate on whether AI will replace the need for human workers.While some labor experts say that AI could replace certain jobs, others believe that it will simply make workers more productive.

Researchers acknowledge that the study isn't perfect — nor is it meant to be definitive. Still, they conclude that it is possible that generative AI models can make ""human labor more efficient,"" but that ""social, economic, regulatory, and other factors"" may influence actual labor outcomes.""As capabilities continue to evolve, the impact of GPTs on the economy will likely persist and increase, posing challenges for policymakers in predicting and regulating their trajectory,"" researchers said. ""Further research is necessary to explore the broader implications of GPT advancements, including their potential to augment or displace human labor, their impact on job quality, impacts on inequality, skill development, and numerous other outcomes.""

Back in January, when ChatGPT started making news as the artificial intelligence tool of the future, Wesley Wildman tore up his lesson plan and instead assigned his undergraduate students in Data, Society and Ethics to write a policy for responsible use of generative AI programs in the classroom.
Only a few weeks later, the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences has adopted that class project as the department’s official policy.
“It’s from the first week of the first BU course on the ethics of computing and data sciences, in our first semester in the new building,” says Azer Bestavros, BU’s inaugural associate provost for computing and data sciences. “I could not have written a better script.”
Azer Bestavros
Wildman is a professor of philosophy, theology, and ethics and of computing and data sciences, who splits his time between the School of Theology and the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences. The 47 students in his class planned to abide by their Generative AI Assistance (GAIA) Policy themselves and thought it might serve as a starting point for others around campus. But they didn’t think it would become CDS policy so soon after they started working on it.
“It’s been really interesting and something that definitely was unexpected,” says Olivia Bene (CAS’23), a computer science major in the class. Wildman “understands that his classroom is full of people who understand technology and know how to use it, so it’s better to get in front of it. This is something that exists, so let’s use this as a tool rather than something that we’re going to be afraid of.”
The debate around generative AI “chatbots” like ChatGPT, created by the company OpenAI, has centered around how they can be used for productive purposes or as shortcuts around legitimate research and writing. ChatGPT, for example, can serve as a research tool—or it can write a passable paper that a student could turn in as their own work. Also known as large language models, or LLMs, this cutting-edge technology is also under development by Microsoft and Google, among many others, with endless possible applications. No less an authority than Bill Gates says it “will change our world.”
“The nice thing about this document is that it really strikes a nice balance between the pluses and minuses of something like this when it comes to learning,” says Bestavros, who is also a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor and a computer science professor at the College of Arts & Sciences.
The policy the class wrote is “somewhat embracing” compared to others, Wildman says. It doesn’t ban the technology, because CDS students need to learn to use it—but responsibly.
“I am really excited that BU is not one of those universities that’s like, ‘Nope, we’re gonna block it from our servers, we’re not gonna let you access it, if you access it you’re going to get kicked out,’” says Bene. “I’m very excited that they understand how much power this tool has. It has the capability to do so many things, and if you’re just going to label it as something that’s cheating and bad, you’re doing it a disservice.
“It’s such a powerful technology,” she adds. “And if you’re going to be a research university, you should be one that isn’t afraid of new things that are coming out.”
The policy says students should give credit to LLMs whenever they are used, even if only to generate ideas rather than usable text. And when writing papers or take-home assignments using LLMs, they should include in an appendix their entire exchanges with the LLM, highlighting the most relevant sections and explaining their purpose in using the technology. Students should not use LLMs to help with in-class examinations, tests, or assignments, unless explicitly organized around an LLM.
This is something that exists, so let’s use this as a tool rather than something that we’re going to be afraid of.Olivia Bene (CAS’23)
“We’re looking for responsible ways of setting boundaries around this,” says Mark Crovella, a professor of computer science and of computing and data sciences at CAS and chair of the CDS Academic Policy Committee. “Communicating to students how they’re expected to behave in a world in which it’s possible for us to use these remarkable machine learning tools to do things that look a lot like intellectual work.”
If students use generative AI to do their work for them, “they’re short-circuiting the educational process,” Crovella says. “But, at the same time, the world is never going to  go back to pre-ChatGPT, and we have to understand how to productively coexist with these kinds of tools.”
The policy also provides guidelines for faculty in grading, saying they should treat work submitted by students who don’t use LLMs as the baseline for grading, and use a lower baseline for students who do use them, depending on how extensive the usage.
Faculty should also use AI-generated text detection tools to evaluate the degree to which it is present in student work, the policy says. And faculty should impose a significant penalty for low-energy or unreflective reuse of wording generated by LLMs, to the point of assigning zero points for merely reproducing LLM output.
The policy’s final language is quite close to the original text the students hashed out after a few weeks of class discussions and small-group efforts. It was discussed by the Academic Policy Committee, as well as in many informal conversations, before Bestavros polled the faculty this week.
“I would call it the baseline policy,” Bestavros says, “because different faculty may want to tweak it further, depending on what the courses are about, and to what extent it is a tool versus something that you want to avoid.”
Crovella says it’s “pretty cool” that the students came up with such a workable policy so soon. Wildman says the students are proud of their work—as is he. He’s waiting for students to start asking how to put a project like this in their CVs or refer to it when they’re applying for fellowships or positions.
Wildman will also speak on a panel discussion at Monday’s CDS symposium for BU faculty, staff, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars: ChatGPT and Other AI Tools: Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies for Teaching.
“There’s a tremendous amount of confusion both among students and among their teachers, so something needs to be done fast,” Wildman says. “CDS’ responsiveness was partly due to the fact that it is small and new and agile, and also because it wants to be a leader helping the University think through these things.”
Text generation is of course just the beginning for generative AI, which is already roiling fields such as visual art and music. The consensus seems to be that we’ve barely begun to see its ramifications. 
But what Wildman’s students have done is a pretty good start, right? Bestavros is “excited, delighted, proud, you name it,” he says with a grin.
Event DetailsChatGPT and Other AI Tools: Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies for TeachingEthics, equity, active learning and student engagement, and educational technology policy: these are just a few of the areas to consider as we discuss how to respond to ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in teaching and learning.

As per the ""Trust in Artificial Intelligence"" study, 42% individuals fear AI will replace jobs in their area of work

Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven helpful to the world in many ways, including the assistants and robots that have taken on many of the tasks associated with daily life and replaced humans in surgical procedures and other professions. Several AI models and tools that are immediately in front of our eyes are ensuring that the world will be a better place, so it's not just the robots that have a beneficial influence on humans, there are models including ChatGPT and Dall-E that have revolutionized the tech industry.For those who may not be aware, ChatGPT is a chatbot that was introduced in November of 2022. It was created to help users with a variety of tasks. Another significant tech company, ""Dell-E,"" is utilized to produce lifelike images only from a description. They were both created by a business named ""OpenAI.""Yet, we are fully aware that it is always bad along with good, therefore to learn more about how people see artificial intelligence, a study titled ""Trust in Artificial Intelligence"" was conducted during September and October 2022. The University of Queensland and KGPM Australia conducted the study and provided the data on which it was based. A total of 17,193 respondents from seventeen different nations participated in the survey.There were three separate sections in the survey's poll: ""agree,"" ""disagree,"" and ""neutral."" Despite everything that has been said about how AI has helped humanity, some individuals still believe that the world would be a far better place without it. 42% of respondents, or two out of every five, agreed with this statement.What may be the cause of it, then? Several individuals are concerned about their occupations and careers being replaced by AI robots that resemble humans as a result of the study. While 39% of individuals polled denied that AI can take over their future, it's likely that they still believe that some jobs couldn't be replaced by it or that they aren't aware of how rapidly AI's value is increasing. The poll also found that 19% of respondents had a neutral opinion on the matter.Nonetheless, each person sees the world from a unique perspective. According to the poll, 67% of respondents remain hopeful and upbeat about the future of AI. Even if they are aware of all the negative effects and how they will affect us, some people (57%) are still relaxed about it.Furthermore, 47% of people report feeling extremely nervous because they fear AI would progressively destroy the human world and that there are very significant risks associated with using AI in daily life, which is not surprising. Also, 24% of them express an angry sentiment against AI and its applications.Read next: TikTok Has Forced Its Competitors To Adopt A Less Lucrative Business Model

Lawyers and administrative staff would be among those at greatest risk of becoming redundant.They calculate that roughly two-thirds of jobs in the US and Europe are exposed to some degree of AI automation, based on data on the tasks typically performed in thousands of occupations. Most people would see less than half of their workload automated and would probably continue in their jobs, with some of their time freed up for more productive activities.In the US, this should apply to 63 per cent of the workforce, they calculated. A further 30 per cent working in physical or outdoor jobs would be unaffected, although their work might be susceptible to other forms of automation. But about 7 per cent of US workers are in jobs where at least half of their tasks could be done by generative AI and are vulnerable to replacement.Goldman said its research pointed to a similar impact in Europe. At a global level, since manual jobs are a bigger share of employment in the developing world, it estimates about a fifth of work could be done by AI — or about 300mn full-time jobs across big economies. The report will stoke debate over the potential of AI technologies both to revive the rich world’s flagging productivity growth and to create a new class of dispossessed white-collar workers, who risk suffering a similar fate to that of manufacturing workers in the 1980s.Goldman’s estimates of the impact are more conservative than those of some academic studies, which included the effects of a wider range of related technologies.A paper published last week by OpenAI, the creator of GPT-4, found that 80 per cent of the US workforce could see at least 10 per cent of their tasks performed by generative AI, based on analysis by human researchers and the company’s machine large language model (LLM). RecommendedJohn GapperChatGPT is fluent, clever and dangerously creativeEuropol, the law enforcement agency, also warned this week that rapid advances in generative AI could aid online fraudsters and cyber criminals, so that “dark LLMs . . . may become a key criminal business model of the future”.Goldman said that if corporate investment in AI continued to grow at a similar pace to software investment in the 1990s, US investment alone could approach 1 per cent of US GDP by 2030. The Goldman estimates are based on an analysis of US and European data on the tasks typically performed in thousands of different occupations. The researchers assumed that AI would be capable of tasks such as completing tax returns for a small business; evaluating a complex insurance claim; or documenting the results of a crime scene investigation.They did not envisage AI being adopted for more sensitive tasks such as making a court ruling, checking the status of a patient in critical care or studying international tax laws.Will Tesla's Optimus robot become a reality? | FT TechCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

If generative AI lives up to its hype, the workforce in the United States and Europe will be upended, Goldman Sachs reported this week in a sobering and alarming report about AI's ascendance. The investment bank estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.


Goldman contends automation creates innovation, which leads to new types of jobs. For companies, there will be cost savings thanks to AI. They can deploy their resources toward building and growing businesses, ultimately increasing annual global GDP by 7%.

In recent months, the world has witnessed the ascendency of OpenAI software ChatGPT and DALL-E. ChatGPT surpassed one million users in its first five days of launching, the fastest that any company has ever reached this benchmark.

PROMOTED
Will AI impact Your Job?
Goldman predicts that the growth in AI will mirror the trajectory of past computer and tech products. Just as the world went from giant mainframe computers to modern-day technology, there will be a similar fast-paced growth of AI reshaping the world. AI can pass the attorney bar exam, score brilliantly on the SATs and produce unique artwork.

While the startup ecosystem has stalled due to adverse economic changes, investments in global AI projects have boomed. From 2021 to now, investments in AI totaled nearly $94 billion, according to Stanford’s AI Index Report. If AI continues this growth trajectory, it could add 1% to the U.S. GDP by 2030.

The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labor productivity boom, like those that followed the emergence of earlier general-purpose technologies like the electric motor and personal computer.

The Downside Of AI
According to an academic research study, automation technology has been the primary driver of U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years. The report, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that 50% to 70% of changes in U.S. wages since 1980 can be attributed to wage declines among blue-collar workers replaced or degraded by automation.
Artificial intelligence, robotics and new sophisticated technologies have caused a vast chasm in wealth and income inequality. It looks like this issue will accelerate. For now, college-educated, white-collar professionals have largely been spared the same fate as non-college-educated workers. People with a postgraduate degree saw their salaries rise, while “low-education workers declined significantly.” The study states, “The real earnings of men without a high-school degree are now 15% lower than they were in 1980.”
According to NBER, many changes in the U.S. wage structure were caused by companies automating tasks that used to be done by people. This includes “numerically-controlled machinery or industrial robots replacing blue-collar workers in manufacturing or specialized software replacing clerical workers.”
Truck and cab drivers, cashiers, retail sales associates and people who work in manufacturing plants and factories have been and will continue to be replaced by robotics and technology. Driverless vehicles, kiosks in fast-food restaurants and self-help, quick-phone scans at stores will soon eliminate most minimum-wage and low-skilled jobs.
Artificial intelligence systems are ubiquitous. AI-powered digital voice assistants share everything you want to know just
just
-2.1% by asking it a question. Instead of a live person addressing a problem, you can engage with an online chatbot. AI can help diagnose cancer and health issues. Banks use sophisticated software to check for fraud and noncompliance. AI predominantly controls driverless automobiles, newsfeeds, social media and job applications.
What Other Companies And Organizations Are Saying About AI
The World Economic Forum (WEF) concluded in a 2020 report, “A new generation of smart machines, fueled by rapid advances in AI and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs.” Robotics and AI will cause a serious “double-disruption,” as the pandemic pushed companies to fast-track the deployment of new technologies to slash costs, enhance productivity and be less reliant on real-life people.
Management consulting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers reported, “AI, robotics and other forms of smart automation have the potential to bring great economic benefits, contributing up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.” However, it will come with a high human cost. “This extra wealth will also generate the demand for many jobs, but there are also concerns that it could displace many existing jobs.”
This brings up another critical, often-overlooked issue. AI proponents say there’s nothing to worry about, as we’ve always successfully dealt with new technologies. However, what does this mean for the quality of jobs?
The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence, claims Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm. It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining, as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with the skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.
In a 2019 Wells Fargo
WFC
+0.1% study, the bank concluded that robots would eliminate 200,000 jobs in the banking industry within the next 10 years. This has already adversely impacted highly paid Wall Street professionals, including stock and bond traders. These are the people who used to work on the trading floors at investment banks and trade securities for their banks, clients and themselves. It was a very lucrative profession until algorithms, quant-trading software and programs disrupted the business and rendered their skills unnecessary—compared to the fast-acting technology.
What An AI Future May Look Like
There is no hiding from the robots. Well-trained and experienced doctors could be pushed aside by sophisticated robots that could perform delicate surgeries more precisely and read x-rays more efficiently and accurately to detect cancerous cells that the human eye can’t readily see.
The rise of artificial intelligence will make even software engineers less sought after. According to Jack Dorsey, the tech billionaire and founder of Twitter and Square, artificial intelligence will soon write its own software. That will put some beginner-level software engineers in a tough spot. When discussing how automation will replace human jobs, Dorsey told Yang on an episode of the Yang Speaks podcast, “We talk a lot about the self-driving trucks and whatnot.” He added, “[AI] is even coming for programming [jobs]. A lot of the goals of machine learning and deep learning is to write the software itself over time, so a lot of entry-level programming jobs will just not be as relevant anymore.”
When management consultants and companies that deploy AI and robotics say we don’t need to worry, we need to be concerned. Companies—whether they are McDonald’s, introducing self-serve kiosks and firing hourly workers to cut costs, or top-tier investment banks that rely on software instead of traders to make million-dollar bets on the stock market—will continue to implement technology and downsize people to enhance profits.
This trend has the potential to impact all classes of workers adversely. In light of the study’s spotlight on the dire results of AI, including lost wages and the rapid growth in income inequality, it's time to talk seriously about how AI should be managed before it's too late.

Employment prospectsThe government is keen to promote investment in AI in the UK, which it says will ""ultimately drive productivity across the economy"", and has tried to reassure the public about its impact.""We want to make sure that AI is complementing the way we work in the UK, not disrupting it - making our jobs better, rather than taking them away,"" Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan told the Sun.The report notes AI's impact will vary across different sectors - 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated but only 6% in construction 4% in maintenance, it says.BBC News has previously reported some artists' concerns AI image generators could harm their employment prospects.What is AI and is it dangerous?'Lower wages'""The only thing I am sure of is that there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI,"" Carl Benedikt Frey, future of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, told BBC News. ""What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles.""Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work.""Consider the introduction of GPS technology and platforms like Uber. Suddenly, knowing all the streets in London had much less value - and so incumbent drivers experienced large wage cuts in response, of around 10% according to our research. ""The result was lower wages, not fewer drivers. ""Over the next few years, generative AI is likely to have similar effects on a broader set of creative tasks"".'Pinch of salt'According to research cited by the report, 60% of workers are in occupations that did not exist in 1940.But other research suggests technological change since the 1980s has displaced workers faster than it has created jobs.And if generative AI is like previous information-technology advances, the report concludes, it could reduce employment in the near term.The long-term impact of AI, however, was highly uncertain, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank Torsten Bell told BBC News, ""so all firm predictions should be taken with a very large pinch of salt"". ""We do not know how the technology will evolve or how firms will integrate it into how they work,"" he said.""That's not to say that AI won't disrupt the way we work - but we should focus too on the potential living-standards gains from higher-productivity work and cheaper-to-run services, as well as the risk of falling behind if other firms and economies better adapt to technological change.""Bill Gates: AI most important tech advance in decadesWhy the rise of AI art stirs fierce debateEconomicsArtificial intelligenceEmployment",http://schema.org,,ReportageNewsArticle,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65102150,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65102150,AI could replace equivalent of 300 million jobs - report,,2023-03-28T16:25:14.000Z,2023-03-28T16:25:14.000Z,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Chris Vallance'}]",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CFC4/production/_129188135_ai-index-getty.jpg'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CFC4/production/_129188135_ai-index-getty.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

    <li>White paper sets out new approach to regulating artificial intelligence to build public trust in cutting-edge technologies and make it easier for businesses to innovate, grow and create jobs</li>
    <li>plan will help unleash the benefits of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, one of the 5 technologies of tomorrow, which already contributes £3.7 billion to the UK economy</li>
    <li>follows new expert taskforce to build the UK’s capabilities in foundation models, including large language models like ChatGPT, and £2 million for sandbox trial to help businesses test <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> rules before getting to market</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Five principles, including safety, transparency and fairness, will guide the use of artificial intelligence in the UK, as part of a new national blueprint for our world class regulators to drive responsible innovation and maintain public trust in this revolutionary technology.</p>

<p>The UK’s <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> industry is thriving, employing over 50,000 people and contributing £3.7 billion to the economy last year. Britain is home to twice as many companies providing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> products and services as any other European country and hundreds more are created each year.</p>

<p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is already delivering real social and economic benefits for people, from helping doctors to identify diseases faster to helping British farmers use their land more efficiently and sustainably. Adopting artificial intelligence in more sectors could improve productivity and unlock growth, which is why the government is committed to unleashing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>’s potential across the economy.</p>

<p>As <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> continues developing rapidly, questions have been raised about the future risks it could pose to people’s privacy, their human rights or their safety. There are concerns about the fairness of using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> tools to make decisions which impact people’s lives, such as assessing the worthiness of loan or mortgage applications.</p>

<p>Alongside hundreds of millions of pounds of government investment announced at Budget, the proposals in the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> regulation white paper will help create the right environment for artificial intelligence to flourish safely in the UK.</p>

<p>Currently, organisations can be held back from using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to its full potential because a patchwork of legal regimes causes confusion and financial and administrative burdens for businesses trying to comply with rules.</p>

<p>The government will avoid heavy-handed legislation which could stifle innovation and take an adaptable approach to regulating <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>. Instead of giving responsibility for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> governance to a new single regulator, the government will empower existing regulators - such as the Health and Safety Executive, Equality and Human Rights Commission and Competition and Markets Authority - to come up with tailored, context-specific approaches that suit the way <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is actually being used in their sectors.</p>

<p>The white paper outlines 5 clear principles that these regulators should consider to best facilitate the safe and innovative use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the industries they monitor. The principles are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>safety, security and robustness</strong>: applications of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> should function in a secure, safe and robust way where risks are carefully managed</li>
  <li>
<strong>transparency and explainability</strong>: organisations developing and deploying <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> should be able to communicate when and how it is used and explain a system’s decision-making process in an appropriate level of detail that matches the risks posed by the use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>fairness</strong>: <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> should be used in a way which complies with the UK’s existing laws, for example the Equality Act 2010 or UK GDPR, and must not discriminate against individuals or create unfair commercial outcomes</li>
  <li>
<strong>accountability and governance</strong>: measures are needed to ensure there is appropriate oversight of the way <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is being used and clear accountability for the outcomes</li>
  <li>
<strong>contestability and redress</strong>: people need to have clear routes to dispute harmful outcomes or decisions generated by <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach will mean the UK’s rules can adapt as this fast-moving technology develops, ensuring protections for the public without holding businesses back from using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technology to deliver stronger economic growth, better jobs, and bold new discoveries that radically improve people’s lives.</p>

<p>Over the next 12 months, regulators will issue practical guidance to organisations, as well as other tools and resources like risk assessment templates, to set out how to implement these principles in their sectors. When parliamentary time allows, legislation could be introduced to ensure regulators consider the principles consistently.</p>

<p>Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> has the potential to make Britain a smarter, healthier and happier place to live and work. Artificial intelligence is no longer the stuff of science fiction, and the pace of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> development is staggering, so we need to have rules to make sure it is developed safely.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Our new approach is based on strong principles so that people can trust businesses to unleash this technology of tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Businesses warmly welcomed initial proposals for this proportionate approach during a consultation last year and highlighted the need for more coordination between regulators to ensure the new framework is implemented effectively across the economy. As part of the white paper published today, the government is consulting on new processes to improve coordination between regulators as well as monitor and evaluate the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> framework, making changes to improve the efficacy of the approach if needed.</p>

<p>£2 million will fund a new sandbox, a trial environment where businesses can test how regulation could be applied to <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> products and services, to support innovators bringing new ideas to market without being blocked by rulebook barriers.</p>

<p>Organisations and individuals working with <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> can share their views on the white paper as part of a new consultation launching today which will inform how the framework is developed in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Lila Ibrahim, Chief Operating Officer and UK <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Council Member, DeepMind, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child""><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> has the potential to advance science and benefit humanity in numerous ways, from combating climate change to better understanding and treating diseases. This transformative technology can only reach its full potential if it is trusted, which requires public and private partnership in the spirit of pioneering responsibly. The UK’s proposed context-driven approach will help regulation keep pace with the development of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, support innovation and mitigate future risks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer, Rolls-Royce, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Both our business and our customers will benefit from agile, context-driven <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> regulation. It will enable us to continue to lead the technical and quality assurance innovations for safety-critical industrial <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> applications, while remaining compliant with the standards of integrity, responsibility and trust that society demands from <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sue Daley, Director for Tech and Innovation at techUK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">techUK welcomes the much-anticipated publication of the UK’s <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> white paper and supports its plans for a context-specific, principle-based approach to governing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> that promotes innovation. The government must now prioritise building the necessary regulatory capacity, expertise, and coordination. techUK stands ready to work alongside government and regulators to ensure that the benefits of this powerful technology are felt across both society and the economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clare Barclay, CEO, Microsoft UK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child""><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is the technology that will define the coming decades with the potential to supercharge economies, create new industries and amplify human ingenuity. If the UK is to succeed and lead in the age of intelligence, then it is critical to create an environment that fosters innovation, whilst ensuring an ethical and responsible approach. We welcome the UK’s commitment to being at the forefront of progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rashik Parmar MBE, chief executive, BCS The Chartered Institute for IT, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child""><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is transforming how we learn, work, manage our health, discover our next binge-watch and even find love. The government’s commitment to helping UK companies become global leaders in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, while developing within responsible principles, strikes the right regulatory balance. As we watch <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> growing up, we welcome the fact that our regulation will be cross-sectoral and more flexible than that proposed in the EU, while seeking to lead on aligning approaches between international partners. It is right that the risk of use is regulated, not the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technology itself. It’s also positive that the paper aims to create a central function to help monitor developments and identify risks.  Similarly, the proposed multi-regulator sandbox [a safe testing environment] will help break down barriers and remove obstacles. We need to remember this future will be delivered by <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> professionals - people - who believe in shared ethical values. Managing the risk of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and building public trust is most effective when the people creating it work in an accountable and professional culture, rooted in world-leading standards and qualifications.</p>

It’s neither artificial nor intelligentThis article is more than 1 year oldEvgeny MorozovLet’s retire this hackneyed term: while ChatGPT is good at pattern-matching, the human mind does so much moreThu 30 Mar 2023 10.55 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Mar 2023 13.34 EDTShareElon Musk and Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak have recently signed a letter calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of AI systems. The goal is to give society time to adapt to what the signatories describe as an “AI summer”, which they believe will ultimately benefit humanity, as long as the right guardrails are put in place. These guardrails include rigorously audited safety protocols.It is a laudable goal, but there is an even better way to spend these six months: retiring the hackneyed label of “artificial intelligence” from public debate. The term belongs to the same scrapheap of history that includes “iron curtain”, “domino theory” and “Sputnik moment”. It survived the end of the cold war because of its allure for science fiction enthusiasts and investors. We can afford to hurt their feelings.In reality, what we call “artificial intelligence” today is neither artificial nor intelligent. The early AI systems were heavily dominated by rules and programs, so some talk of “artificiality” was at least justified. But those of today, including everyone’s favourite, ChatGPT, draw their strength from the work of real humans: artists, musicians, programmers and writers whose creative and professional output is now appropriated in the name of saving civilisation. At best, this is “non-artificial intelligence.”As for the “intelligence” part, the cold war imperatives that funded much of the early work in AI left a heavy imprint on how we understand it. We are talking about the kind of intelligence that would come in handy in a battle. For example, modern AI’s strength lies in pattern-matching. It’s hardly surprising given that one of the first military uses of neural networks – the technology behind ChatGPT – was to spot ships in aerial photographs.Machines cannot have a sense (rather than mere knowledge) of the past, the present and the futureHowever, many critics have pointed out that intelligence is not just about pattern-matching. Equally important is the ability to draw generalisations. Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 work of art Fountain is a prime example of this. Before Duchamp’s piece, a urinal was just a urinal. But, with a change of perspective, Duchamp turned it into a work of art. At that moment, he was generalising about art.When we generalise, emotion overrides the entrenched and seemingly “rational” classifications of ideas and everyday objects. It suspends the usual, nearly machinic operations of pattern-matching. Not the kind of thing you want to do in the middle of a war.Human intelligence is not one-dimensional. It rests on what the 20th-century Chilean psychoanalyst Ignacio Matte Blanco called bi-logic: a fusion of the static and timeless logic of formal reasoning and the contextual and highly dynamic logic of emotion. The former searches for differences; the latter is quick to erase them. Marcel Duchamp’s mind knew that the urinal belonged in a bathroom; his heart didn’t. Bi-logic explains how we regroup mundane things in novel and insightful ways. We all do this – not just Duchamp.AI will never get there because machines cannot have a sense (rather than mere knowledge) of the past, the present and the future; of history, injury or nostalgia. Without that, there’s no emotion, depriving bi-logic of one of its components. Thus, machines remain trapped in the singular formal logic. So there goes the “intelligence” part.ChatGPT has its uses. It is a prediction engine that can also moonlight as an encyclopedia. When asked what the bottle rack, the snow shovel and the urinal have in common, it correctly answered that they are all everyday objects that Duchamp turned into art.But when asked which of today’s objects Duchamp would turn into art, it suggested: smartphones, electronic scooters and face masks. There is no hint of any genuine “intelligence” here. It’s a well-run but predictable statistical machine.The danger of continuing to use the term “artificial intelligence” is that it risks convincing us that the world runs on a singular logic: that of highly cognitive, cold-blooded rationalism. Many in Silicon Valley already believe that – and they are busy rebuilding the world informed by that belief.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to TechScapeFree weekly newsletterAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we want such creativity to persist, we should also be funding the production of art, fiction and history – not just data centres and machine learning.That’s not at all where things point now. The ultimate risk of not retiring terms such as “artificial intelligence” is that they will render the creative work of intelligence invisible, while making the world more predictable and dumb.So, instead of spending six months auditing the algorithms while we wait for the “AI summer,” we might as well go and reread Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. That will do so much more to increase the intelligence in our world.

Two-Thirds of Jobs Are at Risk: Goldman Sachs A.I. Study
The investment bank's economists estimate that 46% of administrative positions, 44% of legal positions, and 37% of engineering jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence.

As many as 300 million full-time jobs in the world, including two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. and Europe, are at risk of being replaced in some way by generative artificial intelligence, the technology behind tools like ChatGPT, according to a Goldman Sachs (GS) study this week.

“If generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,” the investment bank’s economists wrote in a report.
What jobs are at the most at-risk and where?
The impact of A.I. disruption will be felt most deeply in developed countries, like the U.S. and European Union nations, the study noted, because those economies support a large number of white-collar jobs that are more prone to automation than manual labor-intensive work does.
In the U.S., 46 percent of office and administrative support positions could potentially be replaced by A.I., Goldman Sachs estimates. About 44 percent of legal positions could be automated, and 37 percent of engineering jobs are at risk.
Overall, approximately two-thirds of current jobs in the U.S. and Europe are exposed to some degree of A.I. automation, and up to a quarter of all work could be replaced by machines completely, the bank said, adding that, of affected positions where humans are still needed, as much as half of their workload could be computerized.
Tech elites raise alarm on A.I.’s threat to human jobs
Bill Gates painted a similarly alarming picture recently. In a lengthy blog post last week, the Microsoft cofounder predicted using tools like ChatGPT will increasingly feel like “having a white-collar worker available to help you with various tasks.”
Gates said A.I. has the potential of outperforming human workers in job functions like sales, service and document handling, where there are a plethora of good and bad examples for an algorithm to learn from.
Earlier this week, Elon Musk and hundreds of tech entrepreneurs and academics signed a letter urging A.I. labs to pause training systems that are more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4 until the industry develops a shared set of safety protocols.
“We must ask ourselves: Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones?” said the letter, authored by nonprofit Future of Life Institute. “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?”
It’s not all doom-and-gloom
Goldman Sachs economists appear more optimistic. They noted technological advancement that initially displaces human workers has historically also created employment and economic growth over the long term.
“Although the impact of A.I. on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by A.I.,” the report said.
Widespread adoption of A.I. will greatly increase productivity and boost global economic output by 7 percent annually over a 10-year period, which is more than double the typical economic growth rate of industrialized nations, Goldman Sachs predicted.

            They predicted in a report Sunday that 18% of work globally could be computerized, with the effects felt more deeply in advanced economies than emerging markets.
    

            That’s partly because white-collar workers are seen to be more at risk than manual laborers. Administrative workers and lawyers are expected to be most affected, the economists said, compared to the “little effect” seen on physically demanding or outdoor occupations, such as construction and repair work.

            In the United States and Europe, approximately two-thirds of current jobs “are exposed to some degree of AI automation,” and up to a quarter of all work could be done by AI completely, the bank estimates.
    

            If generative artificial intelligence “delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,” the economists wrote. The term refers to the technology behind ChatGPT, the chatbot sensation that has taken the world by storm.

The way we work is about to change 




            ChatGPT, which can answer prompts and write essays, has already prompted many businesses to rethink how people should work every day.
    

            This month, its developer unveiled the latest version of the software behind the bot, GPT-4. The platform has quickly impressed early users with its ability to simplify coding, rapidly create a website from a simple sketch and pass exams with high marks.
    

            Further use of such AI will likely lead to job losses, the Goldman Sachs economists wrote. But they noted that technological innovation that initially displaces workers has historically also created employment growth over the long haul. 
    

            While workplaces may shift, widespread adoption of AI could ultimately increase labor productivity — and boost global GDP by 7% annually over a 10-year period, according to Goldman Sachs.

5 jaw-dropping things GPT-4 can do that ChatGPT couldn't




            “Although the impact of AI on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,” the economists added.
    

            “Most workers are employed in occupations that are partially exposed to AI automation and, following AI adoption, will likely apply at least some of their freed-up capacity toward productive activities that increase output.”

            Of US workers expected to be affected, for instance, 25% to 50% of their workload “can be replaced,” the researchers added.
    

            “The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labor productivity boom like those that followed the emergence of earlier general-purpose technologies like the electric motor and personal computer.”

The jobs most at risk to generative AI like ChatGPT 





Kimanthi SammyMar 29, 2023, 5:08 AM EDTMarch 29, 2023 11:08 am 









 



According to a new study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is set to revolutionize several professions, with accountants, mathematicians, interpreters, and writers at the top of the list of those most exposed to the technology’s capabilities.
The study analyzed the share of tasks within each occupation that could be performed at least 50% faster using generative AI. Software that is powered by large language models, generative pre-trained transformers, or GPTs, can analyze and generate text at an unprecedented scale.
The researchers found that nearly 20% of the U.S. workforce could benefit from the technology, with 80% of workers in occupations where at least one job task can be performed more quickly by generative AI.

The friction of new technology
Information-processing roles, including public relations specialists, court reporters, and blockchain engineers, were highly exposed to the technology. They used a government database of occupations and associated activities and tasks, with people and AI models assigning exposure levels to the tasks.
The authors did not predict which jobs would be lost or whose jobs would be affected by the technology, emphasizing that implementing new technologies is often fraught with negotiation and resistance.
However, individuals have already begun using generative AI to work more efficiently, with some employers allowing experimentation with the technology. Recent studies have shown that generative AI can save time and produce better results than humans in specific tasks.
The future of work will never be the same
Furthermore, Microsoft recently analyzed the capabilities of GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s tool, and found that it could solve “novel and difficult tasks” with “human-level performance” in fields such as mathematics, coding, medicine, law, and psychology.
According to experts, the challenge for companies, schools, and policymakers is to help people adapt to new technology.
Generative AI’s potential impact on the workforce is undeniable, with industries and professions set to change significantly in the coming years. It remains to be seen how companies, schools, and policymakers will respond to the challenge, but one thing is certain: the world of work is on the brink of a major transformation.

Could AI replace your job?

 In the report titled ‘The Potentially Large Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Growth’. Goldman Sachs claims that two-thirds of current jobs could be at risk, but the impact of AI will vary across different sectors. Jobs thought to be most affected are the office and administrative roles of white-collar workers including Journalism, legal roles, architecture, engineering, management, financial operations, logistics, sales and customer services just to name a few. 

  If you can't see the poll, click here While the use of these AIs might not immediately replace humans they could have the unintended consequences of lowering wages and making finding jobs in those sectors more competitive. The report compares this to the introduction of GPS and ride-hailing apps like Uber.

AI is evolving at an incredible speed

 The report also stated that the adoption of AI could increase the value of goods and services created by 7% over the next decade.The impact of these new AIs is yet to be seen and with more workers striking and companies trying to reduce costs could AIs become more common in the workplace?

One thing is for is certain, the genie is out of the bottle, and the revolution AI will bring about is coming ""resistance is futile"" as Star Trek's hive mind machines the Borg often say. 








Google Bard: Google Rolls out their own AI tool to rival Chat GPT that has the potential to evolve 

 It's also very possible that AIs could become another everyday tool like personal computers and be incorporated into existing tech like mobile devices, personal assistants and computers which would lead to a massive productivity boost aiding future workers and creating entirely new jobs. No matter how advanced these AIs become there are still many basic elements they lack and while their generative abilities are impressive AI's still feature many flaws and vulnerabilities, it will still be some time before they replace us and it's much more likely they will work alongside us. Then again that's exactly what an AI might want you to think.  Read More

Since the release of powerful AI tools ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, discussions about whether “robots” will replace humans have grown, and studies show some jobs—surprisingly, some traditionally white-collar work—may be heavily impacted.

Key Facts


Generative AI, a form of artificial intelligence capable of creating text or other content in response to user prompts, has quickly gained popularity following the public launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.



Since its November 2022 release, people have used AI chatbot ChatGPT for an array of this, including writing college-level essays and generating code.​​



The AI race heated up after Google released Bard on March 21, a ChatGPT competitor and a separate entity from the company’s Google search engine.



A recent report from Goldman Sachs estimates around 300 million jobs could be affected by generative AI, meaning 18% of work globally could be automated—with more advanced economies heavily impacted than emerging markets.


The report also predicts two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. and Europe “are exposed to some degree of AI automation,” and around a quarter of all jobs could be performed by AI entirely.


Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI found some educated white-collar workers earning up to $80,000 a year are the most likely to be affected by workforce automation.


According to the report, jobs in agriculture, mining and manufacturing are the least exposed to generative AI, while jobs in the information processing industries, like IT, are the most exposed because jobs that use ""programming and writing skills"" are more closely related to GPT’s capabilities.


Generative AI isn’t perfect, both OpenAI and Google admit their program sometimes gives incorrect responses and has other flaws, like ChatGPT’s knowledge base that ends in 2021, and Bard’s limited conversation retention.

Jobs Most Impacted


Finance and banking: Banks have already begun incorporating AI into their business models. 56% of banks claim they’ve implemented the technology into their business domains like management, and 52% claim they’ve used it for revenue generation, according to Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the World Economic Forum. Abhijit Bose, a Capital One senior vice president, told the Washington Post AI will potentially “monitor transactions” to give detailed financial advice on saving and spending. Morgan Stanley has begun using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organize its wealth management database, helping advisers pull up data and research more efficiently. The World Economic Forum also predicts AI will bring three changes to the finance division: job cuts, job creation and increased efficiency.​​ In addition, they estimate by 2027, 23% of jobs in China’s financial sector will be replaced by AI.
Media and marketing: Kristian Hammond, chief scientist of Natural Sciences told the BBC in 15 years, “90% of news will be written by machines.” Natural Sciences has a software called Quill, an AI paraphrasing tool that writes company reports ahead of earning announcements. German publisher Axel Springer announced in February plans to transition into “digital only,” which includes job cuts in favor of “modern technology” and automation. Reporters for different media outlets like Business Insider, CNET and CNBC have used ChatGPT to write news stories, though they have often been criticized for containing false information. In January, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti announced the company would rely on ChatGPT to personalize content and enhance quizzes, much to the employees’ dismay, according to the Wall Street Journal. In the marketing world, 84% of marketers reported using AI in 2020, a stark jump from 29% in 2019, according to Salesforce research. High-performing marketing teams averaged around seven different uses of AI and machine learning in 2020, and over half planned on increasing their use in 2021, the report also claims.
Legal services: An attorney used ChatGPT to publish a 14-page legal paper published in Social Science Research Network on a plethora of prompts, including creating a contract, explaining why the Supreme Court’s decision on same-sex marriage shouldn’t be appealed and developing deposition questions. The AI bot has the potential “to address access to justice questions” and make legal services available to those who can’t afford it, Andrew Perlman, the author of the paper and a Suffolk University Law School Dean told Reuters. Low-income Americans don’t get enough or any legal help for 92% of their civil legal problems, according to a 2022 report by Legal Services Corp. Some have already begun incorporating AI into legal service, like startup Lawgeex, which has a service that reads contracts faster than, and what they claim to be more accurate than humans.


Jobs Least Impacted


Manufacturing and factory workers: This industry has been undergoing automation for a while, with General Motors credited as the first major manufacturer to implement robotics in their assembly lines after the introduction of UNIMATE in 1961. However, generative AI may speed up the process. For example, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Bot, or Optimus, an autonomous android made to replace humans in dangerous, repetitive jobs. Musk plans to place these bots in his Tesla factories and eventually expand to millions around the world. According to an MIT and Boston University report, AI is expected to replace as many as two million manufacturing workers by 2025. “Our evidence shows that robots increase productivity,” the researchers said. A Chinese factory in Dongguan City replaced 90% of its workforce with machines, resulting in a 250% increase in productivity and an 80% decrease in defects. A job that took 650 human workers to complete now takes about 60 robots and 60 humans, the company claims.
Agriculture: According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2021 there were 21.1 million full- and part-time jobs in the food and agriculture sectors, making up 10.5% of the labor force. Agriculture is considered one of the world’s oldest professions and has stood the test of time, lasting through four separate industrial revolutions. According to the Washington Post, many small farms don’t produce enough profit to invest in more machinery, though larger farms have already begun the process of automation for strenuous tasks. In the U.S., family farms make up 98% of all farms, with a majority being small family farms that operate about half of the country’s farm land. However, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture does fund AI research, education and extension activities in the areas of natural resources and environments, agricultural systems and engineering and economics and rural communities.
Healthcare: A study published in the International Journal of Health Services found on average, psychiatrists spend 20.3% of their day on paperwork, followed by internists and general practitioners at 17.3%. Mundane administrative tasks like this can be automated, but other areas probably won’t need AI. David Dranove, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management told the Kellogg Insight most adults want to hear about their health from a human, and there’s “a need for compassion…that AI is unable to contribute.” An Oxford University report predicts medical transcriptionists, medical records, medical secretaries and health information technicians are the most likely jobs in the field to be automated, not actual providers. This extends into mental health as well—the Washington Post has tried and failed at creating an AI version of infamous psychologist, Sigmund Freud.

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is poised to dramatically reshape the modern workplace, heralding a new era of unprecedented change. A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs highlights the situation's urgency, revealing that the automation of certain tasks could disrupt a staggering 300 million jobs worldwide. Industries involving routine, repetitive tasks that can be easily automated are at the forefront of this seismic shift. In the United States, jobs in office and administrative support, legal work, and architecture and engineering face the highest risk of automation, with 46%, 44%, and 37% of tasks, respectively, potentially replaceable by AI.

However, AI's impact on jobs will only be evenly distributed across some industries or countries. For example, jobs that demand physical labor are less susceptible to automation, and emerging markets may experience less exposure to automation than developed markets. Despite the looming threat of job displacement, the report emphasizes that AI technology could fuel labor productivity and catapult global GDP by a remarkable 7% over time. It is crucial to recognize that technological advancements have consistently generated new job opportunities throughout history while rendering others obsolete. In light of these findings, a recent Executive AI report by Hunter Marketing indicates that many senior business leaders have already embraced AI. In contrast, others are keenly poised to adopt this revolutionary technology.

This article delves into the future of AI in the workplace and how businesses can leverage its potential to achieve tremendous success. The following sections will provide an in-depth analysis of the key findings, including demographic trends and industry-specific AI adoption rates.

AI Adoption: Demographics and Industries
The Hunter Marketing new report, ""Executive AI: What senior leaders think about AI in the workplace"" highlights several key findings regarding AI adoption among senior business leaders. The study found that 61% of male and 29% of female executives currently use AI. This disparity suggests that there might be a gender gap in AI adoption, which could be influenced by factors such as accessibility, awareness, or confidence in the technology. Closing this gap should be a priority for organizations aiming to create a diverse and inclusive work environment.

The age group with the highest AI adoption rate is 25 to 44-year-olds, with 61% utilizing AI tools in daily operations. This can be attributed to the fact that this age group is more receptive to new technologies and more likely to embrace innovation. AI adoption decreases with age, with 22% of executives aged 65 and above using AI. This could be due to a lack of familiarity with the technology or a resistance to change in long-established working patterns.

Regarding income, the highest AI adoption rate (61%) is among executives earning between $100,000 and $199,000. Interestingly, the adoption rate is lower (53%) for those earning over $200,000, which may indicate that the highest earners are more likely to delegate AI-related tasks to their subordinates.

The Hunter Marketing report also reveals that AI adoption varies significantly across industries and geographical locations. Manufacturing (80%) and technology (64%) sectors have the highest AI usage among executives, whereas construction (52%) and finance (62%) have lower adoption rates. This suggests that AI's impact is more pronounced in specific industries while others are yet to experience its full potential. Geographically, executives in New York City (73%) have a higher AI adoption rate than those in Los Angeles (60%), indicating that regional differences may also affect AI utilization.
Challenges and Opportunities for AI Implementation
Senior business leaders face numerous challenges that AI can address. One of the main concerns of C-level executives is competitors are innovating faster (47% of C-level executives). Adopting AI can help organizations stay competitive by automating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling faster data-driven decision-making.
Several concerns need to be addressed through widespread AI adoption. Ethical considerations top the list, with 68% of leaders not using AI. Ensuring transparency and responsible deployment is critical to overcoming this obstacle. 45% of non-AI users believe the technology needs to be more accurate.
Ownership is another significant concern, with 72% of executives not using AI stating that the responsibility for AI lies with the IT department. This points to a need for better collaboration and integration between IT and other departments to facilitate AI adoption across the organization.
Moreover, 62% of business leaders feel the benefits of AI could be more transparent, indicating a need for more education on AI's potential applications and advantages. Companies should invest in internal education and training programs to help executives understand and embrace AI better.
Preparing For The Future of Work
To prepare for the future of work, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to managing the impact of AI on their operations and workforce. The following strategies can help organizations navigate the rapidly changing landscape and capitalize on the opportunities offered by AI:
Upskill and reskill employees
As AI automates routine tasks, the demand for skilled workers with expertise in AI, machine learning, and data analytics will increase. Companies should invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforce to ensure they have the necessary skills to adapt to new roles and responsibilities.
Foster a culture of innovation
Encourage employees to embrace change and explore new ways to use AI to improve business processes. This can be achieved through regular training, workshops, and brainstorming sessions focusing on AI's potential applications in the organization.
Develop a clear AI strategy
To maximize the benefits of AI, organizations must have a clear strategy that outlines the objectives, goals, and desired outcomes of AI implementation. This should include identifying areas where AI can have the most significant impact and addressing potential challenges and risks.
Collaborate with external partners
Organizations can benefit from partnering with AI solution providers, research institutions, and industry experts to gain access to cutting-edge technology and knowledge. This can help
Focus on ethical AI implementation
Companies must prioritize transparency, fairness, and accountability in their AI deployments to address ethical concerns and build trust among employees and customers. Establishing clear guidelines and ethical standards for AI use will be crucial in maintaining a responsible approach to AI adoption.
Promote diversity and inclusion
To harness the full potential of AI, organizations should promote diversity and inclusion within their workforce. This involves addressing the gender gap in AI adoption, ensuring equal access to AI tools and opportunities, and fostering a culture that values diverse perspectives and backgrounds.
Implement policies to support workforce transitions
Governments and businesses should collaborate to develop policies supporting workers whom AI may displace. This could include offering financial assistance for retraining, providing access to education and training programs, and promoting job creation in sectors with high growth potential.
Conclusion
Integrating AI in the workplace is set to reshape industries and redefine how we work profoundly. By recognizing the transformative potential of AI and proactively addressing the challenges that come with its adoption, businesses can unlock unprecedented opportunities for growth, innovation, and increased competitiveness. Preparing for this future requires a strategic, collaborative approach that emphasizes upskilling employees, fostering a culture of innovation, promoting diversity, and ensuring ethical AI implementation. As we navigate this exciting new era of technological advancement, the organizations that successfully harness the power of AI will be the ones that thrive and lead the way in shaping the future of work. Embracing this change with an open mind and a forward-thinking approach is not only necessary and imperative for businesses' continued success in the evolving global landscape.

Generative AI is the name of the game in big tech right now, and Adobe isn’t about to get left behind. The company recently announced a beta of its new creative generative AI support, Adobe Firefly, which promises to help users with little to no experience in graphic design create their own images and text effects. The announcement comes hot off the heels of Microsoft’s own generative AI launch. Its new solution, Copilot, is set to empower users of 365 and Dynamics 365 to auto-generate written content automatically. So, whether you struggle with writing, graphic design, or overall organizational skills, it’s an exciting time to get a boost from generative AI.


A Generative AI Recap
In case you’ve missed some of the hottest tech news lately, generative artificial intelligence is a sub-set of AI that can create text, art, imagery or other forms of content based on prompts from an individual user. The popularity was stoked last fall when OpenAI rolled our ChatGPT. Since then, tons of solutions, from AI art creator starryai to Shutterfly’s AI image generator, are turning the world on its head by empowering literally anyone to create world-class writing, art, images, and content with the click of a button.

And it’s making headlines all over. This week Bill Gates published a blog on his website where he called generative AI “the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface.” And I would have to agree with him. The advancements that have been made in the last few months are astounding. It’s no wonder that Adobe is throwing its proverbial hat in the ring.

How does Adobe Firefly work?
While a lot of people may not associate Adobe with AI, it’s actually been integrating things like neural filters, content aware fills and other features in its products for years, helping users create and edit their images and documents more quickly and easily. According to Adobe, Firefly is set to give creators “new superpowers” in their day-to-day work. Using Firefly, users will be able to create images, vectors, 3D imagery, audio and video, brushes, gradients and more, on brand, instantly. Ideally, this will help them keep up with the huge demand for new content being felt on social, email, and other channels. Firefly will also be able to train with a company’s specific collateral to help it learn to recreate the nuances of a specific brand or style. Essentially, Adobe Firefly promises to disrupt marketing teams everywhere by empowering literally anyone in the enterprise to create images and graphic design effects at any experience level.

What do Creatives Say about Generative AI?
Generative AI is full of amazing promise, but it’s also opening a pandora’s box of issues in the creative realm. Some artists have held protests to show their growing frustration with AI-generated art apps that allow lay people to sell and create art that they didn’t actually “create.” Businesses have had to adjust the way they work with artists to prevent legal issues surrounding licensing and copyright. For instance, Getty Images has banned the sale of illustrations and content created by AI on its site. Meanwhile, the Wix-owned site DeviantArt decided to create protections for creators that prevent generative AI platforms from “scraping” artist work from their site.

For its part, Adobe is trying to avoid any controversy surrounding generative AI. It says Firefly is being “trained” using Adobe Stock images, which are openly licensed graphics that won’t infringe on copyrighted work. This ensures, at least theoretically, that the content Firefly produces will not be based on any specific company’s brand or other licensed images available online.


In addition to the above protections, Adobe says creators will be able to hide their content from its AI training model to ensure Firefly doesn’t learn from their designs if they don’t want it to. Adobe also says it will be creating a compensation model for Adobe Stock contributors so they can rightly benefit from Firefly’s success (and yes, I’m assuming it will be wildly successful).
Lastly, to keep the buyers of artwork safe, designs created with Firefly will contain metadata that indicates it was created in part (or whole) by generative AI.
Personally, I’m impressed with the length Adobe has gone to be transparent about how its models are being trained and how it intends to innovate with AI while being cognizant of its community of designers and creatives that have been paramount to building Adobe’s success.
Adobe Firefly - Request Access
Folks interested in trying out Adobe Firefly will first need to request access here. The company says it will be sending out invitations over time to individuals who express interest in being part of its beta group. Current Firefly betas are available for text to image, text effects, and recoloring vectors. Other options in development include text to pattern, 3D to image, sketch to image, text to brush and more.
The Generative AI Road Ahead 
While generative AI is driving a fundamental change to so many industries in such a short amount of time, it is a certainty to play a role in the growth of productivity in a vast number of professions. Watching the tech industries iconic companies enter one after another should surprise no one, but the longer term affects will be important to watch as we certainly see the excitement around generative AI, but the way people advance with this technology will act as a fascinating lesson in human evolution.

Generative artificial intelligence systems could lead to ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect around 300 million full-time jobs globally, according to new research from Goldman Sachs.Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text or other content in response to user prompts, has exploded in popularity in recent months following the launch to the public of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The buzzy chatbot quickly went viral with users and appeared to prompt several other tech companies to launch their own AI systems.

Based on an analysis of data on occupational tasks in both the US and Europe, Goldman researchers extrapolated their findings and estimated that generative AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs around the world to automation if it lives up to its promised capabilities.The report, written by Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, said that roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation while generative AI could substitute up to a quarter of current work.

White-collar workers are some of the most likely to be affected by new AI tools. The Goldman report highlighted US legal workers and administrative staff as particularly at risk from the new tech. An earlier study from researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and New York University, also estimated legal services as the industry most likely to be affected by technology like ChatGPT.Manav Raj, one of the authors of the study, and an Assistant Professor of Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, told Insider this was because the legal services industry was made up of a relatively small number of occupations that were already highly exposed to AI automation.

Goldman's report suggested that if generative AI is widely implemented, it could lead to significant labor cost savings and new job creation. The current hype around AI has already given rise to new roles, including prompt engineers, a job that includes writing text instead of code to test AI chatbots.The new tech could also boost global labor productivity, with Goldman estimating that AI could even eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%.

Study finds AI could replace millions of jobs 











Study finds that artificial intelligence could replace the equivalent of 300 million jobs
07:42

Artificial intelligence tools such as Chat GPT and Dall-E are sparking fears of the technology automating people out of a job, yet like previous waves of innovation, the advent of so-called generative AI is also starting to create new kinds of work. ""The good news is that worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent report that also forecast a sizable economic boost from AI.One role now showing up in job listings: ""prompt engineer."" The job's main function is to help train the emerging crop of AI, also known as large language models (LLMs), to deliver more accurate and useful responses to the natural-language queries that people pose. More generally, the goal is to make AI smarter and more capable of accomplishing a wide array of professional tasks. 






Notably, and unlike many higher-level jobs in tech, working as a prompt engineer doesn't necessarily require an engineering or coding background. One job listing for a prompt engineer describes the role as an ""art"" that's ""a hybrid between programming, instructing and teaching."" Hot new programming language: EnglishAndrej Karpathy, a founding member of ChatGPT maker OpenAI and former senior director of AI at Tesla, recently tweeted that a prompt engineer can also be thought of ""as a kind of LLM psychologist.""


""The hottest new programming language is English,"" he tweeted in January after ChatGPT was publicly released, a reference to the fact that LLMs are trained based on prompts written in plain English, rather than computer code.

The good news for job seekers? Some companies are willing to pay big bucks for such jobs, also referred to colloquially by some prompt engineers as an ""AI whisperer.""""We are all amateur prompt engineers, but there is definitely a nuanced understanding to these models,"" said Edward Tian, a student at Princeton University who built GPTZero, an app that can detect whether a text was written by a human being or ChatGPT. For example, LLMs are better at spitting out text in a certain style — say, in the voice of an elementary school student or a comedian — if they are shown an example, Tian explained. 


""You'll get better results if you say to ChatGPT: 'Here is an example of elementary school writing and then you make the ask,'"" he said. ""It significantly improves results.""Prompt engineering is also typically less structured than traditional research experiments, which begin with hypotheses. ""With prompt engineering, no one really knows what the results are going to be, so we try a bunch of things and hopefully the LLM responds in a positive way,"" Tian said. Seeking ""creative hacker spirit"" A range of companies and industries are recruiting prompt engineers.Anthropic, an AI research company and maker of Claude, an AI assistant, is currently seeking a ""prompt engineer and librarian,"" according to a job posting on the company's website. The role involves building a library of prompts that get LLMs to accomplish different tasks.Requirements for the position at the San Francisco company include familiarity with how LLMs work, excellent communication skills and what Anthropic describes as ""a creative hacker spirit,"" among other qualifications. Basic programming skills and the ability to write small Python programs are also desirable. The pay: Between $175,000 and $335,000 a year.
Anthropic's job listing says the field of prompt engineering is less than two years old, making the role challenging to hire for.

British law firm Mishcon de Reya is hiring a ""GPT legal prompt engineer."" The role will focus on helping the business ""increase our understanding of how generative AI can be used within a law firm, including its application to legal practice tasks and wider law firm business tasks,"" the job posting states.


Klarity, a company that helps automate contract review, is hiring its own AI whisperer, who will earn between $130,000 and $230,000 a year to fine-tune LLM applications within the company. Boston Children's Hospital in Boston is hiring an AI prompt engineer to work on its digital health platform. The desired candidate will have a strong background in both AI and machine learning (a subset of AI), as well health care research experience. The job entails designing AI prompts for LLMs ""as they emerge for health care research studies and clinical practice.""""Super important"" skill To be sure, any job related to an AI chatbot requires a high level of familiarity and understanding of how LLMs work. ""They have to understand how to code, leverage AI models and understand how to talk to them,"" Gabor Soter, founder of Generative Nation, a site that educates the public about generative AI, told CBS MoneyWatch.

That said, Soter expects to see a raft new AI jobs.""Some people underestimate what it takes, but these are front engineers getting hired for hefty salaries,"" he said. ""I think it's a skill that's going to be super important for everyone, and I would highly encourage everybody who is not a data scientist to play around with these models.""

“In the limit, if capital can replace labor entirely, growth rates could explode, with incomes becoming infinite in finite time.” – “The Future of U.S. Economic Growth” by John G. Fernald and Charles I. Jones, January 2014
The Essay

🤖 Why Goldman Sachs thinks generative AI could have a huge impact on economic growth and productivity
The raison d’être of this newsletter is building a better world — wealthier, healthier, more opportunity, more resilience, more fun — through faster technological progress and economic growth. And while big advances in artificial intelligence are likely going to be a big part of making that goal a reality, I’m not banking on human-level AI, much less superhuman machine intelligence. Humanity can accomplish a lot merely by progressing as fast in the future as it has during peak periods of the past. And at least one Wall Street megabank thinks generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT and Bard can do the trick.
The title of the new Goldman Sachs report, “The Potentially Large Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Growth,” is pro-progress, Up Wing music to my conservative-futurist ears. From the report:
The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) raises whether we are on the brink of a rapid acceleration in task automation that will drive labor cost savings and raise productivity. Despite significant uncertainty around the potential of generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects. … The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labor productivity boom like those that followed the emergence of earlier general-purpose technologies like the electric motor and personal computer.
Here are the main takeaways from GS economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, which I shall subsequently dive into:
Generative AI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by just under 1½ percentage points over a 10-year period following widespread business adoption.Generative AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7 percent, equal to an almost $7 trillion increase in annual global GDP over a 10-year period.Generative AI will be disruptive to jobs: “We find that roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and that generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.”AI investment could approach 1 percent of US GDP by 2030 if it increases at the pace of software investment in the 1990s. (That said, US and global private investment in AI totaled $53 billion and $94 billion in 2021, a fivefold increase in real terms from five years prior.)
For context, such a labor productivity increase would double the long-term Congressional Budget Office forecast of US productivity — and economic growth.


It would create a long-term 3 percent economy (again), instead of a 1.5 percent economy, with productivity growth at the highest levels since the boomy late 1990s and early 2000s. The Long Stagnation could soon be over. Well, soon-ish. Key caveats here include how good generative AI gets (the difficulty level of the tasks it can automate) and how fast the evolving technology is adopted throughout the economy.


As the above analysis suggests, the GS forecasts revolve around how GenAI affects the labor market. Remember, economists often disaggregate jobs into specific tasks (there’s a database for this, O*NET) when researching the impact of automation. And in this scenario, GS assumes 13 of the 39 work activities of over 900 occupations in the database are exposed to AI automation, with the assumption that AI “is capable of completing tasks up to a difficulty of 4 on the 7-point O*NET ‘level’ scale.” (Also: GS ignores jobs involving working outdoors and performing physical labor, so their forecast doesn’t look at the impact of advances in robotics.) So: When looking at the tasks that are bundled into occupations, GS finds the following:
[Roughly] two-thirds of US occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI, and that of those occupations which are exposed, most have a significant—but partial—share of their workload (25-50%) that can be replaced. … We next extend our US and European estimates globally, adjusting for differences in industry composition across countries and further assuming that AI does not impact the agricultural sector in EM economies due to significant differences in the composition and production approaches in that industry between EM and DM economies. Our estimates intuitively suggest that fewer jobs in EMs are exposed to automation than in DMs, but that 18% of work globally could be automated by AI on an employment-weighted basis. … Our scenario analysis suggests that the ultimate share of work exposed to automation could range from 15-35%, a range which is consistent with—but on the conservative side of—existing estimates in the literature.


Now, this does not mean 25 percent of jobs are going away due to GenAI. Technology can replace some tasks, but it can also make us more productive performing other tasks, and create new tasks — and new jobs. GS cites research that finds “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions.” The GS operating assumption here is that GenAI will substitute for 7 percent of current US employment, complement 63 percent, and leave 30 percent unaffected.


Again, lots of caveats and variables here. How good will GenAI get? As GS puts it: Will it be only able to “skim a short article to gather the main point” or will it eventually be able to accomplish a difficult task such as analyzing “the cost of medical care services for all US hospitals”? And what will be the adoption time? (You may have heard, ChatGPT reached 100 million users just two months after launch.) GS: “The productivity growth boost would only be roughly half as large if the gains are realized over a 20-year period and one-third as large if realized over a 30-year period.”

Two final points here: First, at the high end of the forecasts, we would be talking about GDP growth of about 4.5 percent, same as in the Go-Go 1960s — but without the same rapid labor force growth. (About 1.5 percent back then versus 0.5 percent now.) Phenomenal, but not the Singularity. Second, it’s impossible for any model to anticipate the impact of AI/machine learning — not just GenAI — on scientific discovery and technological invention where it could function as a super research assistant. Consider this piece, “Biologists Say Deep Learning Is Revolutionizing Pace of Innovation,” from The Wall Street Journal:
Dr. Baker leads Baker Lab, which has nearly 80 pre- and post-doctoral students and is part of the university’s Institute for Protein Design. The proteins it designs can be used in a range of ways such as developing drugs and vaccines. Dr. Baker estimates that the pace of innovation in his field has increased by a factor of 10 during the past 18 months, due to a combination of deep learning and laboratory methods used to verify that new proteins are working as expected.
Signs and wonders, my friends, signs and wonders.

Moore, a co-founder and former chairman of Intel Corporation, the California semiconductor chip maker that helped give Silicon Valley its name, achieving the kind of industrial dominance once held by the giant American railroad or steel companies of another age, died on Friday at his home in Hawaii. … Along with a handful of colleagues, Mr. Moore could claim credit for bringing laptop computers to hundreds of millions of people and embedding microprocessors into everything from bathroom scales, toasters and toy fire engines to cellphones, cars and jets. … In 1965, in what became known as Moore’s Law, he predicted that the number of transistors that could be placed on a silicon chip would double at regular intervals for the foreseeable future, thus increasing the data-processing power of computers exponentially.

On the other hand, deploying the sunshade will take longer and cost more, but it is a cleaner, more sustainable proposal. The planetary sunshade should be considered a wind-down strategy for SAI. The sunshade also has many positive benefits beyond addressing climate change that should be understood by policy makers.

The freelance economy is a $5.4 trillion dollar market that McKinsey calls a “seismic shift in how Americans work”.


Yet the headlines this past month have been Open AI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, with Bill Gates saying, “Artificial intelligence is as revolutionary as mobile phones and the Internet”. Rightfully so, the current applications of AI engulf practically every role and skill from content generation, to customer support, to coding to name a few.

So how will this impact the already rapidly rising freelance economy? Will freelancers be replaced? Will companies focus on existing employees and AI rather than freelancers?

Not quite. From my vantage point, artificial intelligence, workflow automation, and applications like ChatGPT will increasingly accelerate the freelance economy for four main reasons.

1. The Freelance Economy is already here
The freelance economy already has a firm foothold with no signs of slowing down.
On the demand side, in the past 12 months, amidst economic uncertainty, layoffs, and hiring freezes, Resume Builder found that 40% of companies are hiring contractors to replace laid off workers, while Mercer reported that 60% of executives say they will substantially replace full time employees with independent workers in the next 3 years.
Supply follows. McKinsey’s recent American Opportunity Survey showed “independent workers reveal a distinctive characteristic: they are far more optimistic about their own futures than the average American worker”.

Even the venture landscape is promising. While startup funding has shrank over 50% in Q3 of 2022, Gale Wilkinson, Managing Partner of Future of Work fund VITALIZE expects the freelance economy to double or triple in the next five years. In her words, “Millennials and Gen Z have a much bigger appetite for freelancing in general. Purely from generational effects, we’re going to double or triple”.

2. Historically Automation has led to more freelancers
In 2018, McKinsey released ‘Automation and the future of the workforce’. In it, they said “More work will be done by freelancers and other contractors, a shift that will boost the emerging ‘gig’ or ‘sharing’ economy”.
This was prior to Covid, a time when remote work was a leading barrier to the benefits of the freelance economy. Post Covid, the normality of remote work has amplified the benefits of the freelance economy. Take HBR’s report in 2020 that highlighted 90% of leaders are prioritizing independent workers.
It makes sense. In September, 2022, Vinod Kartha, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at UST, said “we realized that more and more people are moving to the independent workforce. When we looked at that pool, it’s like when people talk about talent shortage, open talent was screaming what shortage? So that’s when we realized that there’s really not a talent shortage, but it’s more of a talent shift.” Likewise in November 22, 2022, Mina Bastawros, VP of Creative & Digital Marketing at Airbus, said “There are 70+ million people. We’re 130,000. Imagine having access to 70 million people as a workforce going forward”.
The fundamentals of the freelance economy are inherently technology driven, thus the more technology like AI advances, the more the freelance economy makes sense.

3. AI can level the playing field for freelance marketplaces
Freelance marketplaces are the bridge between independent freelancers and companies. While Open Assembly’s Open Talent Landscape shows over 500 global marketplaces, traditionally freelance marketplaces have been overlooked for larger and already established Managed Service Providers (MSP’s) in order to manage risk, security, compliance, and prevent cases like Microsoft’s $97 million misclassification lawsuit.
AI can level the playing field by enabling these platforms to compete and scale. According to Michael Burdick, CoFounder of Paro, “A large barrier to disruption has been the data and IP traditional incumbents have built up over decades. Large language models and AI enable us to access the internet in a structured way, supercharging foundational capabilities that accelerate the pathway to disruption.”
Take Gigster, a US software development marketplace that executes large scale software projects through a global freelance network. According to Cory Hymel, VP of Product & Research, “we’ve implemented generative AI with positive results into our staffing process and content generation process. We have further plans to integrate into our core platform which will super charge our developer network delivery capabilities.”
Or Scotland based Gigged.AI, they use OpenAI to help their clients best scope work. According to CEO Rich Wilson, “Clients can now use natural language to explain their needs, answer questions, and provide feedback, without any technical barriers. This means our clients can create better milestones, and ultimately, better results.”
Or American based creative marketplace Uncompany. They use ChatGPT to develop project teams quickly. According to CEO Maari Casey, “Before using ChatGPT we were spending about 2 hours a week on building scopes to support clients and freelancers. ChatGPT has reduced that to 30-45 min because we've been able to build a growing catalog of scopes and priced contracts”
Or German software developer marketplace Code Control. They use AI to generate freelancer-enticing job ads within one minute. According to Marc Clemens, Founder & CEO, “often job ads do not have the necessary quality to convince the best applicants. We believe Artificial Intelligence can help solve this problem.”

4. Generative AI exposes the need for upskilling, not more headcount
Who best adopts advanced skills and technologies, freelancers or full time employees?
In Deloitte’s Perspective on the future of shared services, they state, “The alternative workforce tends to update their skills more frequently and can typically ramp up within days rather than weeks”. According to Upwork’s Tony Buffum, “freelancers are upskilling and reskilling 50% more than traditional workers. Updating skills more frequently and ramping up more quickly are key traits of the on-demand workforce compared to the traditional workforce.”
The potential this upskilling creates is material.
Balaji Bondili, Head of Deloitte Pixel recently showed what’s possible in his article Augmented Freelancers: How freelancing marketplaces can win with Generative AI. He analyzed the difference in conducting a literature review on the pricing of software development projects, and in his words, “the estimated time savings using Generative AI for this project would be approximately 70 hours or 70% savings”. That means if you’re hiring a freelancer, they have a higher likelihood to embrace technology with this transformational change in output. Whether this means the project is 70% cheaper is up for debate, but directionally the case is clear.

Remember, Both Technologies Are Early
Both the freelance economy and Generative AI are early in their maturity. Many issues need to be carefully considered, and many questions are yet to pop up. For example in Bondili’s article, he asked, “Will the cost of generating that report proportionally reduce by 70%? And, I am paying the freelancer only 30% of the fee for his/her actual effort?”

By Jonathan Barrett and Stephanie ConverySun 26 Mar 2023 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Mar 2023 00.31 EDTShare3434Michael Scott, the protagonist from the US version of The Office, is using an AI recruiter to hire a receptionist.Guardian Australia applies.The text-based system asks applicants five questions that delve into how they responded to past work situations, including dealing with difficult colleagues and juggling competing work demands.Potential employees type their answers into a chat-style program that resembles a responsive help desk. The real – and unnerving – power of AI then kicks in, sending a score and traits profile to the employer, and a personality report to the applicant. (More on our results later.)This demonstration, by the Melbourne-based startup Sapia.ai, resembles the initial structured interview process used by their clients, who include some of Australia’s biggest companies such as Qantas, Medibank, Suncorp and Woolworths.The process would typically create a shortlist an employer can follow up on, with insights on personality markers including humility, extraversion and conscientiousness.6:05How an AI voice clone fooled Centrelink – videoFor customer service roles, it is designed to help an employer know whether someone is amiable. For a manual role, an employer might want to know whether an applicant will turn up on time.“You basically interview the world; everybody gets an interview,” says Sapia’s founder and chief executive, Barb Hyman.The selling points of AI hiring are clear: it can automate costly and time-consuming processes for businesses and government agencies, especially in large recruitment drives for non-managerial roles.Sapia’s biggest claim, however, might be that it is the only way to give someone a fair interview.“The only way to remove bias in hiring is to not use people right at the first gate,” Hyman says. “That’s where our technology comes in: it’s blind; it’s untimed, it doesn’t use résumé data or your social media data or demographic data. All it is using is the text results.”View image in fullscreenSapia founder and chief executive Barb Hyman says AI hiring is the only way to give someone a fair interview. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianA patchy track recordSapia is not the only AI company claiming its technology will reduce bias in the hiring process. A host of companies around Australia are offering AI-augmented recruitment tools, including not just chat-based models but also one-way video interviews, automated reference checks, social media analysers and more.In 2022 a survey of Australian public sector agencies found at least a quarter had used AI-assisted tech in recruitment that year. Separate research from the Diversity Council of Australia and Monash University suggests that a third of Australian organisations are using it at some point in the hiring process.Applicants, though, are often not aware that they will be subjected to an automated process, or on what basis they will be assessed within that.The office of the Merit Protection Commissioner advises public service agencies that when they use AI tools for recruitment, there should be “a clear demonstrated connection between the candidate’s qualities being assessed and the qualities required to perform the duties of the job”.

The commissioner’s office also cautions that AI may assess candidates on something other than merit, raise ethical and legal concerns about transparency and data bias, produce biased results or cause “statistical bias” by erroneously interpreting socioeconomic markers as indicative of success.There’s good reason for that warning. AI’s track record on bias has been worrying.Finding it hard to get a new job? Robot recruiters might be to blameRead moreIn 2017 Amazon quietly scrapped an experimental candidate-ranking tool that had been trained on CVs from the mostly male tech industry, effectively teaching itself that male candidates were preferable. The tool systematically downgraded women’s CVs, penalising those that included phrases such as “women’s chess club captain”, and elevating those that used verbs more commonly found on male engineers’ CVs, such as “executed” and “captured”.Research out of the US in 2020 demonstrated that facial-analysis technology created by Microsoft and IBM, among others, performed better on lighter-skinned subjects and men, with darker-skinned females most often misgendered by the programs.Last year a study out of Cambridge University showed that AI is not a benign intermediary but that “by constructing associations between words and people’s bodies” it helps to produce the “ideal candidate” rather than merely observing or identifying it.Natalie Sheard, a lawyer and PhD candidate at La Trobe University whose doctorate examines the regulation of and discrimination in AI-based hiring systems, says this lack of transparency is a huge problem for equity.View image in fullscreenAt least a quarter of Australian public sector agencies used AI-assisted tech in recruitment in 2022. Illustration: JYPIX/Alamy“Messenger-style apps are based on natural language processing, similar to ChatGPT, so the training data for those systems tends to be the words or vocal sounds of people who speak standard English,” Sheard says.“So if you’re a non-native speaker, how does it deal with you? It might say you don’t have good communication skills if you don’t use standard English grammar, or you might have different cultural traits that the system might not recognise because it was trained on native speakers.”Another concern is how physical disability is accounted for in something like a chat or video interview. And with the lack of transparency around whether assessments are being made with AI and on what basis, it’s often impossible for candidates to know that they may need reasonable adjustments to which they are legally entitled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And these systems change traditional recruitment practices, so you don’t know what the assessment is all about, you don’t know an algorithm is going to assess you or how. You might not know that you need a reasonable adjustment.”Australia has no laws specifically governing AI recruitment tools. While the department of industry has developed an AI ethics framework, which includes principles of transparency, explainability, accountability and privacy, the code is voluntary.“There are low levels of understanding in the community about AI systems, and because employers are very reliant on these vendors, they deploy [the tools] without any governance systems,” Sheard says.“Employers don’t have any bad intent, they want to do the right things but they have no idea what they should be doing. There are no internal oversight mechanisms set up, no independent auditing systems to ensure there is no bias.”A question of diversityHyman says client feedback and independent research shows that the broader community is comfortable with recruiters using AI.“They need to have an experience that is inviting, inclusive and attracts more diversity,” Hyman says. She says Sapia’s untimed, low-stress, text-based system fits this criteria.“You are twice as likely to get women and keep women in the hiring process when you’re using AI. It’s a complete fiction that people don’t want it and don’t trust it. We see the complete opposite in our data.”View image in fullscreenHyman says Sapia’s language analysis is based on the ‘billion words of data’ collected from responses in the years since the tech company was founded in 2013. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianResearch from the Diversity Council of Australia and Monash University is not quite so enthusiastic, showing there is a “clear divide” between employers and candidates who were “converted” or “cautious” about AI recruitment tools, with 50% of employers converted to the technology but only a third of job applicants. First Nations job applicants were among those most likely to be worried.DCA recommends recruiters be transparent about the due diligence protocols they have in place to ensure AI-supported recruitment tools are “bias-free, inclusive and accessible”.In the Sapia demonstration, the AI quickly generates brief notes of personality feedback at the end of the application for the interviewee.This is based on how someone rates on various markers, including conscientiousness and agreeableness, which the AI matches with pre-written phrases that resemble something a life coach might say.How AI fooled Centrelink, and could fool youRead moreA more thorough assessment – not visible to the applicant – would be sent to the recruiter.Sapia says its chat-interview software analysed language proficiency, with a profanity detector included too, with the company saying these were important considerations for customer-facing roles.Hyman says the language analysis is based on the “billion words of data” collected from responses in the years since the tech company was founded in 2013. The data itself is proprietary.You’re (not) hired!So, could Guardian Australian work for Michael Scott at the fictional paper company Dunder Mifflin?“You are self-assured but not overly confident,” the personality feedback says in response to Guardian Australia’s application in the AI demonstration.It follows with a subtle suggestion that this applicant might not be a good fit for the receptionist role, which requires “repetition, routine and following a defined process”.But it has some helpful advice: “Potentially balance that with variety outside of work.”Looks like we’re not a good fit for this job.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingBusinessfeaturesShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based in New York, Runway builds generative AI tools that run in the browser to generate, edit, remix, and reimagine media. After the Oscars hubbub waned a bit, we talked about the future of movies and design with Runway co-founder and CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela.AWS scholarship recipient is creating a slam dunk solution for parents who have to miss their kids’ sports gamesAn AWS AI &amp; ML Scholarship program gives students hands-on experience and skills to compete in the job market.Watch nowTell us about the origins of Runway and how your background in researching and teaching design led to its founding. How is Runway an extension of that thinking and exploration?My two co-founders and I met in art school at New York University. We were really interested to see how computational creativity and neural techniques—an approach used in machine learning models that mimics in part how we learn—could serve filmmakers, artists, and creatives. And so, we started building tools and conducting research for storytellers to interact with this emerging technology. Today, our research has continued to advance, and we have over 30 AI Magic Tools across video, image, 3D, and text, all with the goal of democratizing content creation and making creative tools more accessible.What does Runway do and offer?Runway is a full-stack AI applied research company. We invent and build AI models for content creation, and we develop tools for our users to create and edit content, through every aspect of the creative process, from preproduction to postproduction. We’re allowing anyone, regardless of skill level, to be able to create professional-grade content.For those of us without a background in machine learning, can you give us some of the fundamentals of generative AI and how it gets applied in your world?At a general level, generative AI and AI systems are complex mathematical algorithms used to understand data or generate new data points. But for our users, they are simple tools that make videomaking workflows effortless. That’s a huge part of why tools like ours have taken off, because they fit right into an existing workflow with a familiar look and feel. Of course, underneath those interfaces, there’s incredibly complex algorithms working together to produce the results you see.More broadly, generative AI tools work by generating new data using patterns learned in existing data. These algorithms can then synthesize new data that didn’t exist before. To generate new things—like images, video, or text—you can use different input mechanisms. For example, natural language has become one of the easiest ways to control image generation algorithms, but other input systems like video are also possible. This is how the first iteration of our video generation model, Gen-1, works.How was AI used in making 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'? And can you please also explain what the “multiverse” is?The Everything Everywhere All at Once film had an unusually small team of visual effects artists who were working against tight deadlines. Evan Halleck was on this team, and he used Runway's AI tools to save time and automate tedious aspects of editing. Specifically in the film’s rock scene, he used Runway’s rotoscoping tool to get a quick, clean cut of the rocks as sand and dust were moving around the shot. This translated days of work to a matter of minutes.Graphic provided by Runway.Graphic provided by Runway.01 / 02Where does AWS and the cloud fit in the creation process?AWS is critical for what we do. To create, train, and deploy enterprise-scale AI models requires immense computing power, and our work with AWS has helped us deliver products that millions of people can use.How the nation’s largest classroom—PBS—uses AWS to teach everyonePBS is making media of all kinds more accessible to more people than ever, with help from the cloud.Watch nowMovies are phenomenally expensive to make, and in particular, visual effects are expensive. Do the tools that Runway offers coupled with the AWS Cloud change that calculus?Yes, absolutely. The power of tools like Runway paired with the cloud make it possible for filmmakers and other creatives to save significant amounts of time and money as they bring their ideas to life. We are building toward a future where it will be possible to craft entire feature-length films and stories—from the characters, scores, b-roll, backgrounds, and everything in between—through words alone and in a fraction of the time.Are AI-driven tools the future of design? And if so, are they part of a continuum of design tools or a completely new way of thinking about design?AI-driven tools are absolutely the future of design, allowing artists to express themselves in new and previously unimaginable ways. Tools and technological advancements throughout history have had an impact on design. If we go back to the mid-1800s, there’s a great example of this in the invention of the paint tube, which gave paint a longer shelf life and could be repeatedly opened and closed for painting outdoors. This ultimately led to the impressionist movement for modern painting—it’s no different from the massive creative shift we’re experiencing now in content creation.How will generative AI drive the film world going forward? What does that look like for creators and for movie fans?As adoption of generative AI tools continues to increase, we’re moving toward a world where everyone is going to be able to make the films that only a handful of people were able to create before. The rise of generative AI is saving hours to days of editing labor, freeing up time for users to focus on more creative aspects of the job. Movie fans can expect to see entirely generated films in the future.You just sponsored an AI film festival. What were the rules, and what was the outcome?Runway hosted the first-ever AI Film Festival with an event in New York City, where we showcased ten short films from creators. The films considered had to be created using AI-powered editing techniques and/or feature AI-generated content. The festival also featured an expert panel to discuss the future of filmmaking more broadly, and this included award-winning filmmaker Darren Aronofsky.Can we see the winners?Absolutely. Here are the 10 films that took home the prizes.Final question, for all the artists—and the artist inside all of us—how should we think about the relationship between technologies like generative AI and art?We’re on the precipice of a massive shift when it comes to content creation that is empowering for creatives around the world. New technologies like generative AI are allowing more diverse stories to be told and opening the door to possibilities that artists could only dream of in the past. These tools are ushering in the next generation of artistic expression, which will be highly democratized and accessible.Visit Runway’s new entertainment and production division for a taste of how they’re partnering with the next generation of storytellers.",http://schema.org,,Article,https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/how-ai-tools-are-creating-new-possibilities-for-movies-and-visual-design-according-to-this-aws-powered-startup,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/how-ai-tools-are-creating-new-possibilities-for-movies-and-visual-design-according-to-this-aws-powered-startup'}","How AI tools are creating new possibilities for movies and visual design, according to this AWS-powered startup",,2023-03-29T15:00:11.470Z,2023-03-29T15:00:11.470Z,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Amazon Staff '}]",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'US About Amazon', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://amazon-blogs-brightspot-lower.s3.amazonaws.com/about/00/92/0260aab44ee8a2faeafde18ee1da/amazon-logo-inverse.svg'}, 'parentOrganization': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Amazon', 'url': 'https://www.amazon.com'}}",,,"[{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 836, 'url': 'https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/9eb8185/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1486x836!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fc3%2F31bce0404cba82f647b2c6def2a2%2Fai-eeaao-hero.jpg', 'width': 1486}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 675, 'url': 'https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/fe9a0d6/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fc3%2F31bce0404cba82f647b2c6def2a2%2Fai-eeaao-hero.jpg', 'width': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AWS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beamery recently launched TalentGPT, the first generative AI for HR technology. The AI is expected to personalize the insights and recommendations for its users. It is also expected to transform talent acquisition and management experience.
Beamery, a talent lifecycle management solutions provider, has announced that it has launched TalentGPT, the first generative AI for HR technology. With TalentGPT, Beamery aims to transform talent acquisition as well as talent management experience with generative AI.
TalentGPT To Deliver Personalized Experiences to Users
TalentGPT offers a single assistant using Beamery’s proprietary AI and Talent Graph, OpenAI’s GPT-4, and a few other pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). This combination is expected to help TalentGPT personalize the insights and recommendations it provides to its users, such as recruiters, candidates, managers, and employees. The combination is also expected to allow TalentGPT to generate content that adapts to changing customer requirements and information in real time.

For example, TalentGPT may generate new job descriptions and make them relevant to the skills companies lack and capabilities that make high performers successful. Similarly, it may be able to provide career recommendations to employees, guide them based on their current skills, and recommend where they should develop themselves to get their next promotion.

TalentGPT Use Case

Beamery also claims that it is the first organization to undergo an independent audit of its AI models to ensure there is no bias.
Talking about TalentGPT, Sultan Saidov, co-founder and president of Beamery, saidOpens a new window , “We are not just incorporating TalentGPT into all of our products — this new technology is enabling us to radically simplify and redesign all of our user experiences. It is hard to overstate how much these advances in AI technology are improving the interactions we can provide to our users, and how much time we can save people in achieving complex tasks.”
He further told Spiceworks, “Generative AI in HR presents an opportunity to create uniquely personalized experiences across the talent lifecycle — from generating better job descriptions, to helping employees take the next step in their career, to helping executives answer critical talent questions. With concerns around compliance within AI rising, we’ve also focused on mitigating the risks typically associated with ChatGPT and other large language models by connecting them with our bias-audited AI controls.”

Cisco is introducing a suite of generative artificial intelligence-driven features in its Webex video conferencing platform, from meeting summaries to visual enhancements. These features are aimed at both customer communications and hybrid working end users.
The company joins enterprises like Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe and Google in adding generative AI capabilities to its service. The new upgrades to Webex include AI-powered audio, video, natural language understanding and analytics enhancements.

Webex looks to grab market share from Zoom, others
According to customer relationship management data company Datanyze, Zoom is the market leader in video conferencing, with 72.61% market share and more than 176,757 companies using it. It reports that Cisco Webex is a distant second with 8.6% with more than 20,935 companies using Webex.
After Webex, according to Datanyze, are GoToWebinar with 7% of the global market share, On24, Adobe Connect, Livestorm, GoToMeeting and Google Hangouts.
Cisco on multi-year path to incorporate machine learning
Javed Khan, senior vice president and general manager of collaboration at Cisco, said the company has been advancing its use of machine learning systems for at least three years.

“Cisco has been investing in this for 10 or 15 [years], starting with basic things like noise cancellation and with some of our video conferencing technologies that have the ability to detect faces and zoom in and out,” Khan said. “So, we have been working on this for a while.
“What’s happened in the last couple of years is that the underlying technologies reached a point where the level of processing in real time and the amount of training data available has just grown exponentially. So these technologies, I think, have gotten 100 times better, which is allowing for things that weren’t possible before.”
Khan said that in the last three years Cisco spent about $1.5 billion acquiring several companies including Voicea and BabbleLabs for voice enhancing technologies as well as MindMeld, a natural language-processing company.
AI enhancements in Webex
Cisco said the integration of AI has allowed the company to make several text and image enhancements that include image optimizing, 3D effects and natural-language queries.
Cinematics for Webex devices
The upgrades to Webex add a cinematic quality to user video using its RoomOS conference video system, which optimizes video by automatically switching between cameras, for example, if a user is employing more than one.
The company said the feature also allows IT administrators to create virtual spaces, or meeting zones, that automatically exclude distracting objects or people.
The cinematic feature includes the ability to capture the speaker at their best angle by automatically switching views.
Webex’s portrait effect
The AI baked into Webex also lets users choose to do complex visual optimizing effects, such as adding depth and sharpness to one’s appearance and making low-resolution video high definition (Figure A).

Further, the AI recognizes human gestures and can add on-screen emojis corresponding to them, including gestures like hands raised for celebration, pressed together for thanks and request, and a heart for affection. It also adds animated features like confetti, fireflies and universe effects (Figure B).

And if a speaker leaves the camera view zone without departing the meeting, the AI can recognize this and display a “be right back” icon (Figure C).

Message recommendations
The message recommendations feature uses AI to prioritize chat and space messages based on interactions with team members and other people users engage with most. Space recommendations suggest relevant Webex spaces to join based on similar people and engagements.
Webex’s tools for customer-facing communications
Cisco said its use of large language models in Webex customer experience made it possible to deploy in its Webex Contact Center automated, AI-fueled features like:

Virtual Agents: A self-service chatbot.
Agent Answers: A feature that provides real-time recommendations to an agent based on their inquiry.
Contextual Chat Summary: A new feature, which will be available on the Webex Connect platform to automatically summarize any long-form text across digital channels. It can be used with Webex Contact Center or any other third-party contact center solution.

The company said it is also adding generative AI capabilities to Webex Campaign, part of Webex’s communications platform-as-a-service solutions portfolio. These functions include:

A subject line generator for email subject lines for marketers and content creators.
Evaluate Node for developers and IT professionals, designed to simplify building new flows and applications.

Khan said Webex AI capabilities will roll out over the course of 2023, with some available now.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted surveys of both employers and workers to understand the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workplace. Here are some of the main findings from the surveys:
 

Increased productivity: Employers reported that AI has helped to increase productivity in their organizations. The majority of employers (nearly 70%) reported that AI has led to moderate or significant productivity gains.


New types of jobs: While AI is expected to automate some jobs, it is also creating new types of jobs. Over 50% of employers reported that AI has led to the creation of new job categories in their organizations.


Upskilling and reskilling: AI is also leading to a need for upskilling and reskilling among workers. Over 60% of employers reported that AI has created a need for new skills in their organizations.


Improved decision-making: AI is helping employers make better decisions. Nearly 60% of employers reported that AI has led to better decision-making in their organizations.


Worker anxiety: While workers generally have positive attitudes towards AI, there is some anxiety about the impact on jobs. Nearly 60% of workers are concerned about job displacement due to AI, and nearly 50% are concerned about the impact on job quality.


Support for training: Both employers and workers support training programs to help workers develop the skills needed for the AI-driven workplace. Over 70% of employers and workers support government investment in training programs.

Overall, the surveys suggest that AI is having a positive impact on the workplace in terms of productivity gains and new job opportunities. However, it is also leading to a need for upskilling and reskilling among workers, and there is some anxiety about the impact on jobs. Both employers and workers support training programs to help workers adapt to the changing workplace.

ChatGPT
Every word of this article up to now was written by ChatGPT in a fraction of the time it took to read them. ChatGPT an artificial intelligence tool that allows for human like conversations by using natural language and it learns as it goes. It is being used more and more to assist with the writing of emails, code, academic essays and as we can see, analysis and website articles.  By simply inputting the title of the piece of research, ChaptGPT was able to produce an analysis in seconds. The tool also ""remembers what user said earlier in the conversation, allows user to provide follow-up corrections and is trained to decline inappropriate requests"". It also sets out some of the limitations of the tool such as that it ""may occasionally generate incorrect information, may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content and has a limited knowledge of world and events after 2021"".

The Future of Work
A 2019 report by the OECD on Well-being in the Digital Age found that the digital transformation could compound existing socio-economic inequalities, with the benefits in terms of earnings and opportunities accruing to a few, and the risks falling more heavily on people with lower levels of education and skills. The report notes that 14 per cent of all jobs are at high risk of being lost due to automation, with another 32 per cent at risk of significant change over the next 10 to 20 years. This means that nearly half of the labour force will be impacted by changes to their jobs as a result of automation by 2040. The pandemic provided a powerful test of the potential of online learning, and it also revealed its key limitations, including the prerequisite of adequate digital skills, computer equipment and internet connection to undertake training online, the difficulty of delivering traditional work-based learning online, and the struggle of teachers used to classroom instruction. Our training and skills development policy must be adapted to meet this challenge.
in light of the growth and availability of powerful tools like ChatGPT, lifelong learning, up-skilling and re-skilling are becoming more and more important to ensure relevant skills for the labour force as well as making an important contribution to make to people’s wellbeing, to creating a more inclusive society and to supporting a vibrant and sustainable economy. The non-vocational element of lifelong learning and community education also brings major social and health benefits to participants outside the labour force. Access to lifelong learning should be an integral part of the education system in order to address the income and labour market challenges that some members of society face. It also must be accessible and flexible to address the challenges which were identified in the Adult Skills Survey, those of unmet demand and being difficult to access. Various agencies (European Commission, Expert Group on Future Skills Needs) identify generic skills and key competences as a core element of the lifelong learning framework. These include basic skills such as literacy, numeracy, digital competence, language skills, people-related and conceptual skills, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, risk assessment and decision making.

Further Education and Training
The lifelong opportunities of those who are educationally disadvantaged are in sharp contrast to the opportunities for meaningful participation of those who have completed a second or third-level education. If the Constitutionally-enshrined right to education is to be meaningful, there needs to be recognition of the barriers to learning that some children of school-going age experience, particularly in disadvantaged areas, which result in premature exit from education. In this context, second chance education and continuing education are vitally important and require on-going support and resourcing. Although the funding available for education increased in Budgets since 2016, the deficits that exist within the system, particularly as a result of the impact of austerity budgeting, require significant additional resources. This requires the development of a long-term education policy strategy across the whole educational spectrum to ensure that education and continuous upskilling and development of the workforce is prioritised if Ireland is to remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace and ensure the availability of sustainable employment. A key policy component must be a review of the age profile of apprenticeships and how this can be expanded (as outlined earlier in this chapter) and the integration of the latest OECD recommendations on training and skills into the National Skills Strategy.

Artificial intelligence could impact the work tasks of roughly 80 percent of the U.S. workforce, according to new research, as the tech develops in ways that could augment or even displace some labor. 
Researchers from OpenAI, OpenResearch and the University of Pennsylvania argue in a new paper, posted to arXiv, that around 80 percent of the workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work affected by the implementation of large language models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), in their industry. 


  

Nearly 20 percent of workers could see at least 50 percent of their work tasks impacted — and around 15 percent of all work tasks in the U.S. “could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality” with access to the artificial intelligence tool.
The researchers used AI to get to their findings and looked at exposure to the tech “as a proxy for potential economic impact” and didn’t distinguish “between labor-augmenting or labor-displacing effects.”
Several occupations — including mathematicians, writers and authors, journalists, web and digital interface designers and tax preparers — as highly exposed, meaning the researchers predict GPT tech could significantly cut down work task time in the jobs.
The paper concludes that LLM technologies “could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications” if implemented in the U.S. workforce. 
OpenAI developed the language processing system ChatGPT, which used advanced tech to generate human-like conversation, and its growing popularity has sparked both interest and concerns about the possible broader implications of using artificial intelligence in school, in the workforce and elsewhere.
Some have raised worries AI could be abused by students in school settings to generate essays with information pulled from the internet. Last week, fabricated AI-generated images of former President Trump being arrested circulated on the internet.

           Will artificial intelligence take over jobs? Careers across varying fields could be at risk Goldman Sachs warned in a report Sunday that 300 million jobs could be affected by artificial intelligence  Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By  Kendall Tietz  FOXBusiness     close  Experts say biased data in ChatGPT could make AI ‘more dangerous,’ impact journalism DataGrade founder Joe Toscano and MRC Free Speech America VP Dan Schneider said ChatGPT poses various dangers to jobs and information. Artificial intelligence (AI) experts and industry leaders have warned that automation, and reliance on programs like OpenAI's ChatGPT could have a drastic impact on millions of jobs, particularly in industries that can be easily automated.  ChatGPT itself, a software which has sparked debate in recent months, said it could ""potentially replace jobs that involve written communication,"" such as translation services and social media managers. When asked what jobs could be replaced by AI broadly, ChatGPT said financial analysts and customer service representatives, among others, could potentially be replaced by AI in the future.  Goldman Sachs warned in a report Sunday that around the world, as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by artificial intelligence automation, CNBC reported.  EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR?     Artificial intelligence chatbots can write essays, poems, letters and all kinds of other texts on command.  (Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/picture alliance via Getty Images / Getty Images)Specifically, tasks that involve repetitive or manual labor might eventually become automated with the help of language models like ChatGPT, which the program itself could lead ""to a decrease in the number of jobs available in those fields.""AI will be able to automate the process of data analysis, which could reduce the need for manual entry and processing, optimize shipping and delivery routes, automate manufacturing and assembly lines, computerize many human accounting tasks and assist with legal research and analysis.AI EXPERTS WEIGH DANGERS, BENEFITS OF CHATGPT ON HUMAN, JOB AND INFORMATION: ‘DYSTOPIAN WORLD’Some examples specifically given by ChatGPT include transportation, manufacturing and financial services. Other industries that could be at risk include healthcare in which ""AI can assist with diagnosing and treating patients, reducing the need for some healthcare workers"" and journalism where ""AI can generate news articles and summaries, potentially impacting jobs.""Former Google consultant and Datagrade founder and CEO, Joe Toscano, previously told Fox News Digital that companies and industries that replace writing jobs could make written material like essays, articles and online text susceptible to incorrect information, which could be overlooked or accepted as truth by many consumers.      A visitor tries a VR device to experience the metaverse. ((Photo by Hou Jun/Xinhua via Getty Images) / Getty Images)AI EXPERT ALARMED AFTER CHATGPT DEVISES PLAN TO ‘ESCAPE’: ‘HOW DO WE CONTAIN IT?’""If we don't have humans in the loop to ensure truth and integrity in the information, then we're going to, I think, head towards a dystopian world where we don't know true from false, and we just blindly trust things. I'm not excited about that,"" he said. ""I'm concerned quite a bit."" ChatGPT explained that while it might impact certain jobs, AI technology will also create new job opportunities in fields like data science, machine learning and natural language processing. Rayid Ghani, a professor of AI and an expert in ethics, fairness, equity, and AI regulation at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College, warned that the negative impact on the job market will still be significant. ""It does make processes more efficient, which means people are going to lose jobs and yes, it will create new jobs, but those jobs are not at the same scale as the jobs lost,"" he said.

Even jobs that might seem more nuances like a chef or waiter will become automated, he warned. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs, not just for blue-collar work, but a lot of white-collar work,"" Lee, who has worked for Apple and Google said. ""Chauffeurs, truck drivers, anyone who does driving for a living — their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 25-year time frame.""

They are revolutionizing the way we approach complex generative AI tasks. These models are based on the mathematics of gaussian principles, variance, differential equations, and generative sequences. (We’ll explain the technical jargon below)Modern AI-centric products and solutions developed by Nvidia, Google, Adobe, and OpenAI have put diffusion models at the center of the limelight. DALL.E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are prominent examples of diffusion models that are making rounds on the internet recently. Users provide a simple text prompt as input, and these models can convert them into realistic images, such as the one shown below.An image generated with Midjourney v5 using input prompt: vibrant California poppies. Source: MidjourneyLet’s explore the fundamental working principles of diffusion models and how they are changing the directions and norms of the world as we see it today.What Are Diffusion Models?According to the research publication “Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models,” the diffusion models are defined as:“A diffusion model or probabilistic diffusion model is a parameterized Markov chain trained using variational inference to produce samples matching the data after finite time”Simply put, diffusion models can generate data similar to the ones they are trained on. If the model trains on images of cats, it can generate similar realistic images of cats.Now let’s try to break down the technical definition mentioned above. The diffusion models take inspiration from the working principle and mathematical foundation of a probabilistic model that can analyze and predict a system’s behavior that varies with time, such as predicting stock market return or the pandemic's spread.The definition states that they are parameterized Markov chains trained with variational inference. Markov chains are mathematical models that define a system that switches between different states over time. The existing state of the system can only determine the probability of transitioning to a specific state. In other words, the current state of a system holds the possible states a system can follow or acquire at any given time.Training the model using variational inference involves complex calculations for probability distributions. It aims to find the exact parameters of the Markov chain that match the observed (known or actual) data after a specific time. This process minimizes the value of the model’s loss function, which is the difference between the predicted (unknown) and observed (known) state.Once trained, the model can generate samples matching the observed data. These samples represent possible trajectories or state the system could follow or acquire over time, and each trajectory has a different probability of happening. Hence, the model can predict the system's future behavior by generating a range of samples and finding their respective probabilities (likelihood of these events to happen).How to Interpret Diffusion Models in AI?Diffusion models are deep generative models that work by adding noise (Gaussian noise) to the available training data (also known as the forward diffusion process) and then reversing the process (known as denoising or the reverse diffusion process) to recover the data. The model gradually learns to remove the noise. This learned denoising process generates new, high-quality images from random seeds (random noised images), as shown in the illustration below.Reverse diffusion process: A noisy image is denoised to recover the original image (or generate its variations) via a trained diffusion model. Source: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models3 Diffusion Model CategoriesThere are three fundamental mathematical frameworks that underpin the science behind diffusion models. All three work on the same principles of adding noise and then removing it to generate new samples. Let’s discuss them below.A diffusion model adds and removes noise from an image. Source: Diffusion Models in Vision: A Survey1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)As explained above, DDPMs are generative models mainly used to remove noise from visual or audio data. They have shown impressive results on various image and audio denoising tasks. For instance, the filmmaking industry uses modern image and video processing tools to improve production quality.2. Noise-Conditioned Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs)SGMs can generate new samples from a given distribution. They work by learning an estimation score function that can estimate the log density of the target distribution. Log density estimation makes assumptions for available data points that its a part of an unknown dataset (test set). This score function can then generate new data points from the distribution.For instance, deep fakes are notorious for producing fake videos and audios of famous personalities. But they are mostly attributed to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, SGMs have shown similar capabilities – at times outperform – in generating high-quality celebrity faces. Also, SGMs can help expand healthcare datasets, which are not readily available in large quantities due to strict regulations and industry standards.3. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)SDEs describe changes in random processes concerning time. They are widely used in physics and financial markets involving random factors that significantly impact market outcomes.For instance, the prices of commodities are highly dynamic and impacted by a range of random factors. SDEs calculate financial derivatives like futures contracts (like crude oil contracts). They can model the fluctuations and calculate favorable prices accurately to give a sense of security.Major Applications of Diffusion Models in AILet’s look at some widely adapted practices and uses of diffusion models in AI.High-Quality Video GenerationCreating high-end videos using deep learning is challenging as it requires high continuity of video frames. This is where diffusion models come in handy as they can generate a subset of video frames to fill in between the missing frames, resulting in high-quality and smooth videos with no latency.Researchers have developed the Flexible Diffusion Model and Residual Video Diffusion techniques to serve this purpose. These models can also produce realistic videos by seamlessly adding AI-generated frames between the actual frames.These models can simply extend the FPS (frames per second) of a low FPS video by adding dummy frames after learning the patterns from available frames. With almost no frame loss, these frameworks can further assist deep learning-based models to generate AI-based videos from scratch that look like natural shots from high-end cam setups.A wide range of remarkable AI video generators is available in 2023 to make video content production and editing quick and straightforward.Text-to-Image GenerationText-to-image models use input prompts to generate high-quality images. For instance, giving input “red apple on a plate” and producing a photorealistic image of an apple on a plate. Blended diffusion and unCLIP are two prominent examples of such models that can generate highly relevant and accurate images based on user input.Also, GLIDE by OpenAI is another widely known solution released in 2021 that produces photorealistic images using user input. Later, OpenAI released DALL.E-2, its most advanced image generation model yet.Similarly, Google has also developed an image generation model known as Imagen, which uses a large language model to develop a deep textual understanding of the input text and then generates photorealistic images.We have mentioned other popular image-generation tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (DreamStudio) above. Have a look at an image generated using Stable Diffusion below.An image created with Stable Diffusion 1.5 using the following prompt: “collages, hyper-realistic, many variations portrait of very old thom yorke, face variations, singer-songwriter, ( side ) profile, various ages, macro lens, liminal space, by lee bermejo, alphonse mucha and greg rutkowski, greybeard, smooth face, cheekbones”Diffusion Models in AI – What to Expect in the Future?Diffusion models have revealed promising potential as a robust approach to generating high-quality samples from complex image and video datasets. By improving human capability to use and manipulate data, diffusion models can potentially revolutionize the world as we see it today. We can expect to see even more applications of diffusion models becoming an integral part of our daily lives.Having said that, diffusion models are not the only generative AI technique. Researchers also use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders, and flow-based deep generative models to generate AI content. Understanding the fundamental characteristics that differentiate diffusion models from other generative models can help produce more effective solutions in the coming days.To learn more about AI-based technologies, visit Unite.ai.

The recent splash of Large Language Model (LLM) applications like GPT has generated considerable discourse around how society and government should respond to the technology.
Some worry that LLM technology will create AI companions that could become a new type of vice in the sense that some people could get so sucked into them that it may disrupt their normal functioning in harmful ways, especially when it comes to creating and maintaining important social ties. Others worry that LLM technology could be used by malicious actors or perhaps become so advanced that it becomes capable of independent malicious action.
But right now, the most common concern you hear, which is also the most immediate, is about LLMs being used as labor-saving technology that results in widespread job loss and displacement.
Every time a new technology or a new economic proposal requires a significant reallocation of labor — such as the phasing out of fossil fuels or the creation of a universal public health insurance system — we see this exact same discourse. It’s a strange discourse in that it never really changes but we also treat every instance of it as if it is a novel thing that requires a novel response.
The problem of job reallocation is a general one that is rooted in the fact that our national income is primarily doled out using factor payments to labor and capital. When people lose their jobs, their labor factor payments are reduced to $0 until such time as they find a new job. Finding a new job may also be difficult if the kinds of jobs a person is capable of doing are shrinking in number due to technological shifts. Once a new job is found, the factor payments that flow to it may also be significantly lower than the factor payments that flowed to the person’s prior job.
This constellation of issues is not constrained to a small group of people nor is it constrained to unique mass job loss events. In a typical year, there are around 20 million unemployment events in the US, defined as the number of times a person went from employed in one month to unemployed in the next month. 

The solution to this problem is fairly straightforward and well-known. Give unemployed people cash benefits to replace their prior wages. Give them job search and retraining assistance to help them find new work. And, possibly, give them wage insurance to ensure that, if they do end up reallocated into a lower-paying job, they can receive benefits to make up for some of the difference, at least for some time.
When you ask ChatGPT “what kinds of welfare programs could help people whose suffer job loss and lower pay due to being displaced by artificial intelligence,” it actually gives the same answer:
As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it may lead to job displacement and lower wages for some workers. To help those affected by these changes, governments can implement various welfare programs aimed at easing the transition and supporting workers as they adapt to the new job landscape. Some potential welfare programs include:1. Unemployment benefits: Providing financial assistance to workers who have lost their jobs, allowing them to meet basic needs while they search for new employment opportunities.2. Wage insurance: As previously mentioned, wage insurance programs can help workers who find new jobs with lower pay by compensating them for a portion of the difference between their previous and current wages for a limited period.3. Job training and reskilling programs: Investing in training programs to help displaced workers acquire new skills that are in demand, making them more competitive in the job market.4. Education subsidies and grants: Offering financial assistance for workers to pursue further education, including university degrees or vocational training, to improve their job prospects.5. Career counseling and job placement services: Providing guidance and support to help workers navigate the job market, identify new opportunities, and find suitable employment.
To this, I would add a couple of points.
Wage insurance is the conceptually clear answer to how to cushion the income shock from someone being reallocated into a lower-paying job, but this is a very uncommon program in the world. I actually don’t know of any country that has a significant wage insurance program in their welfare state.As a general matter, how possible it is for someone to be reallocated into a job that pays much less than their current job is a function of how compressed or uncompressed a society’s wage scale is and how much of each person’s income and consumption bundle depends on their personal employment. In societies with very compressed wages and robust universal welfare states — like the Nordic societies — the ultimate differences between different labor market positions are relatively small, making it mathematically difficult for people to experience a major cut in their standard of living due to changing jobs. In the US, the opposite is true.
My writing frequently comes back to this same point, but that’s because it really is the solution to so much of the economic distress people experience and worry about in the US. An egalitarian society with a robust welfare state creates the kind of stability and minimum living standards that takes the financial sting out of things like unemployment, labor reallocation, disability, old age, and having children. We need this kind of society at all times, not just during splashy labor reallocation events like the one LLMs might cause.

New Intelligence Announcements for Talent Acquisition and Talent Management

The Product Innovation Keynote at IAMPHENOM established that insights for knowledge workers are critical to optimize performance and process. To appropriately address the needs of the modern organization, Phenom introduced new technology that improves the hiring cycle for candidates, interview process for internal stakeholders, and growth and retention aspirations of talent management and managers:


Interview Intelligence disrupts the traditional interview process by bringing transparency to hiring teams with recordings, transcriptions, and key takeaways to move the process forward faster and improve decision making. Analysis of interview sentiment, talk speed, talk-to-listen ratio and voice energy are available to inform interview training opportunities and improvements for hiring teams.


Candidate Hub is a one-stop-shop that helps candidates understand where they are in the hiring process and prepare for next steps. Taking context into account, it gives exposure to relevant jobs, company information, hiring status, and potential future career pathing opportunities. Candidates can easily schedule and reschedule interviews, and access a digital interview coach that provides them with a preparation checklist.


Workforce Intelligence provides talent management teams with context and oversight into talent within their organization to ensure they are appropriately onboarded, retained and developed. A main dashboard provides hiring trends, churn rate, retention risks and high performers. Talent management can further drill down into three key areas: 1) Dynamic role architecture to analyze skills, competencies, and additional contexts to determine which employees are available to upskill or reskill into future roles, and initiate upskilling/reskilling initiatives; 2) Comprehensive employee profiles to identify tenure, performance, growth trajectory, fit for openings and progressions, and options for succession planning; and 3) Skills intelligence to determine where gaps and training needs exist, providing visibility into endorsed skills, self-reported skills, open jobs and roles that require skills, and the learning opportunities, mentors and gig projects available to address gaps. With workforce intelligence at their disposal, Employee Relationship Management (ERM) enables talent management and people managers to take appropriate action such as initiating an upskilling project to acquire new skills to enhance one’s job performance or career advancements.


Succession Planning facilitates growth, development, and movement within the organization, providing a means to plan for the future. It identifies existing employees who are suitable for succession for specific roles, and determines eligibility and readiness based on tenure, performance, skills, competencies, and other relevant signals. This feature makes it easy to add new employees to a succession plan, evaluate which successors have been assigned to specific roles, and move and grow employees in the organization.


People Manager provides business leaders with the actionable intelligence they need to build high-performing teams by surfacing an employee’s current sentiment, career growth plans, learning opportunities, recommendations for upskilling/reskilling, and overall talent retention effectiveness. It also simplifies the process of endorsing a direct report’s skills.


New Automation Announcements for Talent Acquisition and Talent Management

Phenom also announced new automation technology for frontline and hourly workers that will empower them to reduce friction and connect candidates with jobs faster, foster employee development, and reduce tedious, manual tasks for recruiters.


Automation Engine is the powerful backend behind phenomenal hiring, growth and retention experiences. It provides the framework and components to identify, build, implement, and monitor automation workflows into new or existing talent lifecycle processes (e.g., hiring, career development, and retention). It includes workflow intelligence for constant monitoring and qualitative analysis of workflow performance and provides recommendations for optimization. Process mining capabilities identify opportunities to optimize further — leading to outcomes such as improved conversion rates and higher volume of hires in less time.


Talent Companion provides an always-on, omnichannel approach to engage candidates throughout the hiring process — facilitating a streamlined application, interview and hiring experience. It provides real-time responses to questions, helps prepare for interviews and shares reminders at the right time to eliminate any guesswork.


High-Volume Hiring delivers full end-to-end automation of the hiring process, from first interaction to hire. It is designed specifically for industries such as retail, transportation, hospitality, and manufacturing that require a fast and frictionless candidate onboarding experience. Using AI-based workflows, High-Volume Hiring removes redundant processes that can clog the volume hiring pipeline. It also reduces the strain on recruiting teams by automating for high-volume and seasonal staffing surges so they can shift their focus to lengthier knowledge worker hiring cycles.


Requisition and Offer Management for High-Volume Hiring enables hiring managers to autonomously raise requisitions and extend offers to candidates, accelerating the process of making opportunities available to candidates, while reducing reliance on other stakeholders and decreasing time to hire.


Career Pathing for Frontline gathers an employee’s experience, tenure and behaviors and surfaces their next best-fit role within their organization. Growth trajectories can be tailored based on an organization’s unique role requirements.


Alumni Network re-engages former employees to strengthen and maintain positive long-term company relationships. The network can be leveraged from a recruitment perspective to make alumni employees aware of new openings that can bring them back to the company — supporting aspirations to rehire already trained talent and provide potential career advancement opportunities.


New Platform Experience Announcements

Phenom designed additional platform enhancements, including: Design Studio which provides talent and brand marketers with high-fidelity career design within a no-code framework; People Analytics that puts data behind every hiring, growth and retention decision; AI Control Center that enables organizations with controls and configurations to maximize the full potential of intelligence across the platform based on individual preferences and requirements; Connector Studio which improves integration with critical third-party applications and technology to improve business performance.

           AI vs the job market: Experts say tech roles thought 'immune' to automation could face disruption Some experts cautioned against using AI in 'life or death' industries like the medical field  Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By  Nikolas Lanum  FOXBusiness     close  AI could replace 300M jobs worldwide: Goldman Sachs report FOX Business' Lydia Hu reports on workforce worries growing as more office tasks can be performed through artificial intelligence and automation. Artificial intelligence (AI) and technology industry experts claim that ChatGPT and generative AI will cause significant disruptions in the job market, but the impact will vary depending on the field and the decisions made by business leaders. Goldman Sachs warned in a report Sunday that around the world, as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by artificial intelligence automation, CNBC reported.While CEOs and c-suite level employees have long predicted AI would significantly impact jobs requiring manual labor and customer service, the rapid evolution of generative AI like ChatGPT and its ability to debug and create code has illuminated the potential for disturbances in the tech field. This industry has already experienced over 118,000 layoffs in 2023, according to Crunchbase.   INDIAN JUDGE ASKS CHATGPT TO HELP DECIDE BAIL FOR MURDER SUSPECT      In this photo illustration, the welcome screen for the OpenAI ""ChatGPT"" app is displayed on a laptop screen on February 03, 2023 in London, England.  (Leon Neal/Getty Images / Getty Images)Tom Taulli, the author of ""Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction,"" suggested that some of these layoffs were due to automation technology being able to take over functions and ""repetitive processes"" in various fields.""Over the next few years, several professions that we thought may have been immune to this we will find are not,"" he said.He said that things like ChatGPT can configure and write the code for programmers, debug problems and even find the most optimal way to lay out the algorithm.""If you're more of a cut and paste early level programmer you better up your skills. Those are skills that are going to be automated,"" Taulli added.Taulli also warned that safeguards need to be implemented for ""life and death industries,"" those involving large cash flows, essentially any heavily regulated industry.""If you're an airline pilot, and you're using generative AI for the manual, it better be correct, or else maybe the jet crashes,"" he said.Founder Prequel CEO Timur Khabirov said that AI is already proving to be ""incredibly disruptive"" and has made many workers fearful they will become redundant.MUSK LOOKS TO BUILD CHATGPT ALTERNATIVE TO COMBAT ‘WOKE AI’: REPORT     Baden-Württemberg, Rottweil: The Welcome to ChatGPT lettering of the US company OpenAI can be seen on a computer screen.  ((Photo by Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images) / Getty Images)""However, if you look back at technological advancements of the past, while the reduction of labor required to accomplish tasks ushers in change, the demand never goes away,"" he said. ""The move from transportation via horseback to the combustion engine is a good example. People always needed to get from A to B, but one method was simply faster and more efficient.""Greg Kogan, VP of Marketing at Pinecone, a vector database company providing long-term memory for AI, said the impact of AI on the jobs of programmers and software engineers will largely be determined by those in the field. Some companies have already outright banned AI like ChatGPT. ""The way software is programmed is already starting to look drastically different. It's up to each individual programmer if they're going to adapt to this new AI-assisted way of programming or not. The same has been true for every monumental shift in computing for the past century,"" he told Fox News Digital.Speaking specifically on engineers, Kogan said those who learn to collaborate with AI to design and build software will survive in the industry and thrive in the coming years.Though Kogan does not think ""any job is safe"" from AI, he does not mean every job will be eliminated, merely affected by the evolving technology.POPE FRANCIS DECLARES A.I. LEARNING ‘POSITIVE’ TO ‘FUTURE OF HUMANITY’ IF USED ‘ETHICALLY & RESPONSIBLY’ close      video Teleo uses AI to turn construction machines into remotely operated robots Teleo co-founder and CEO Vinay Shet discusses the potential impact of artificial intelligence on manufacturing and construction jobs on 'The Claman Countdown.'""Some people talk about hands-on work like construction or farming as being safe, but those people might not realize how much those jobs are already affected by technology, even before AI,"" he added.Silicon Valley creative consultant and product designer Viputheshwar Siraraman told Fox News Digital that mathematicians, tax preparers, quantitative financial analysts, writers and web and digital interface designers are likely most vulnerable to AI.However, he noted that ""hallucinations,"" or falsehoods presented as fact by ChatGPT and other generative AI, indicate these tools are not mature enough to stand independently and create ""production-ready assets"" without human correction.Elaborating on his 2019 Ted Talk, Siraman said AI will change job descriptions more than eliminate jobs outright.""Engineers won't write as much code. Instead, they will manage, debug, and deploy AI-written code, Siraman said. ""Doctors won't come up with diagnoses themselves. Instead, they will use AI to correlate symptoms to diagnosis and lawyers won't write legal docs from scratch. Instead, they will guide and revise AI-written contracts.""EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR?     OpenAI and ChatGPT logos are seen in this photo taken, February 3, 2023. (Reuters / Reuters Photos)Yaniv Makover, the CEO and co-founder of generative AI copywriting platform Anyword, said the technology would change the way we work by eliminating or collapsing certain job functions.""Mathematicians don't fear calculators - and gen-AI is analogous in this case. Initially, when the calculator was first invented, yes it might have replaced some people who solely did complex calculations, and suddenly it was solved by a calculator,"" Makover said. ""But quickly, mathematicians universally recognized it as a useful tool. Mathematicians today are defining the equations, not solving them.""Speaking on writing-centric jobs like journalism and marketing, Makover said these workers still need to define the message and guide their writing themes. To that point, generative AI is a tool that will make it easier to convey that purpose, but according to Makover, there is still a lot of room for creativity.""The jobs in the most danger are those that include repetitive information tasks, like customer support, copywriting, processing and organizing data, simple graphic design,"" Makover said. ""Though, in all cases, someone will need to curate and guide whatever the AI spits out. In no case would all jobs in a sector be eliminated. Roles may simply shift to managing, strategizing, and improving how work happens. Tasks may change, but people will still have jobs.""GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE That might include jobs like social workers, medical professionals, therapists, caretakers, personnel directors and marketing or business strategists.Makover noted that jobs requiring an understanding of empathy, emotional intelligence, problem-solving, critical decision-making and the capacity to adjust to unforeseen circumstances are ""very difficult"" for an AI to replicate at this point in time. Jobs with these qualifications include social workers, medical professionals, therapists, caretakers, personnel directors and marketing or business strategists.

Goldman Sachs warned in a report Sunday that around the world, as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by artificial intelligence automation, CNBC reported. While CEOs and c-suite level employees have long predicted AI would significantly impact jobs requiring manual labor and customer service, the rapid evolution of generative AI like ChatGPT and its ability to debug and create code has illuminated the potential for disturbances in the tech field. This industry has already experienced over 118,000 layoffs in 2023, according to Crunchbase. &#xA0; INDIAN JUDGE ASKS CHATGPT TO HELP DECIDE BAIL FOR MURDER SUSPECT  Tom Taulli, the author of &quot;Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction,&quot; suggested that some of these layoffs were due to automation technology being able to take over functions and &quot;repetitive processes&quot; in various fields. &quot;Over the next few years, several professions that we thought may have been immune to this we will find are not,&quot; he said. He said that things like ChatGPT can configure and write the code for programmers, debug problems and even find the most optimal way to lay out the algorithm. &quot;If you&apos;re more of a cut and paste early level programmer you better up your skills. Those are skills that are going to be automated,&quot; Taulli added. Taulli also warned that safeguards need to be implemented for &quot;life and death industries,&quot; those involving large cash flows, essentially any heavily regulated industry. &quot;If you&apos;re an airline pilot, and you&apos;re using generative AI for the manual, it better be correct, or else maybe the jet crashes,&quot; he said. Founder Prequel CEO Timur Khabirov said that AI is already proving to be &quot;incredibly disruptive&quot; and has made many workers fearful they will become redundant. MUSK LOOKS TO BUILD CHATGPT ALTERNATIVE TO COMBAT &#x2018;WOKE AI&#x2019;: REPORT  &quot;However, if you look back at technological advancements of the past, while the reduction of labor required to accomplish tasks ushers in change, the demand never goes away,&quot; he said. &quot;The move from transportation via horseback to the combustion engine is a good example. People always needed to get from A to B, but one method was simply faster and more efficient.&quot; Greg Kogan, VP of Marketing at Pinecone, a vector database company providing long-term memory for AI, said the impact of AI on the jobs of programmers and software engineers will largely be determined by those in the field. Some companies have already outright banned AI like ChatGPT.&#xA0; &quot;The way software is programmed is already starting to look drastically different. It&apos;s up to each individual programmer if they&apos;re going to adapt to this new AI-assisted way of programming or not. The same has been true for every monumental shift in computing for the past century,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. Speaking specifically on engineers, Kogan said those who learn to collaborate with AI to design and build software will survive in the industry and thrive in the coming years. Though Kogan does not think &quot;any job is safe&quot; from AI, he does not mean every job will be eliminated, merely affected by the evolving technology. POPE FRANCIS DECLARES A.I. LEARNING &#x2018;POSITIVE&#x2019; TO &#x2018;FUTURE OF HUMANITY&#x2019; IF USED &#x2018;ETHICALLY &amp; RESPONSIBLY&#x2019;  &quot;Some people talk about hands-on work like construction or farming as being safe, but those people might not realize how much those jobs are already affected by technology, even before AI,&quot; he added. Silicon Valley creative consultant and product designer Viputheshwar Siraraman told Fox News Digital that mathematicians, tax preparers, quantitative financial analysts, writers and web and digital interface designers are likely most vulnerable to AI. However, he noted that &quot;hallucinations,&quot; or falsehoods presented as fact by ChatGPT and other generative AI, indicate these tools are not mature enough to stand independently and create &quot;production-ready assets&quot; without human correction. Elaborating on his 2019 Ted Talk, Siraman said AI will change job descriptions more than eliminate jobs outright. &quot;Engineers won&apos;t write as much code. Instead, they will manage, debug, and deploy AI-written code, Siraman said. &quot;Doctors won&apos;t come up with diagnoses themselves. Instead, they will use AI to correlate symptoms to diagnosis and lawyers won&apos;t write legal docs from scratch. Instead, they will guide and revise AI-written contracts.&quot; EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR?  Yaniv Makover, the CEO and co-founder of generative AI copywriting platform Anyword, said the technology would change the way we work by eliminating or collapsing certain job functions. &quot;Mathematicians don&apos;t fear calculators - and gen-AI is analogous in this case. Initially, when the calculator was first invented, yes it might have replaced some people who solely did complex calculations, and suddenly it was solved by a calculator,&quot; Makover said. &quot;But quickly, mathematicians universally recognized it as a useful tool. Mathematicians today are defining the equations, not solving them.&quot; Speaking on writing-centric jobs like journalism and marketing, Makover said these workers still need to define the message and guide their writing themes. To that point, generative AI is a tool that will make it easier to convey that purpose, but according to Makover, there is still a lot of room for creativity. &quot;The jobs in the most danger are those that include repetitive information tasks, like customer support, copywriting, processing and organizing data, simple graphic design,&quot; Makover said. &quot;Though, in all cases, someone will need to curate and guide whatever the AI spits out. In no case would all jobs in a sector be eliminated. Roles may simply shift to managing, strategizing, and improving how work happens. Tasks may change, but people will still have jobs.&quot; GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE&#xA0; That might include jobs like social workers, medical professionals, therapists, caretakers, personnel directors and marketing or business strategists. Makover noted that jobs requiring an understanding of empathy, emotional intelligence, problem-solving, critical decision-making and the capacity to adjust to unforeseen circumstances are &quot;very difficult&quot; for an AI to replicate at this point in time. Jobs with these qualifications include social workers, medical professionals, therapists, caretakers, personnel directors and marketing or business strategists.",,,,,,,,https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/b5d85704-3579-41a3-b472-9ae5664b0564/e500936f-c7d8-4af0-8b84-274ac82c9ffa/1280x720/match/image.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://vod.foxbusiness.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/854081161001/b5d85704-3579-41a3-b472-9ae5664b0564/3f6815c8-4e8a-4a3c-a4f2-4f71cc574181/main.mp4,PT2M28S,2023-03-30T13:51:55-04:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/hacker-accessed-openais-internal-ai-details-2023-breach-report', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/openai-cto-says-ai-may-replace-some-creative-industry-jobs-were-replaceable', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/elon-musk-drops-lawsuit-against-openai', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/chatgpt-down-some-users-openai-says', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/former-openai-board-member-reveals-why-sam-altman-ousted-last-november', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/openai-news-corp-multi-year-content-deal', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/ai-like-tsunami-hitting-labor-force-imf-chief-says', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/worried-losing-job-ai-expert-points-actual-threat', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/chatgpt-maker-openai-announces-new-flagship-model', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/meta-rolls-out-upgraded-ai-assistant-across-facebook-instagram-whatsapp']",,,,,,,,,

The Role Of Generative AI And Large Language Models in HR

Human Resources is one of the most complex, imperfect areas of business. Virtually every decision we make about people (who to hire, who to promote, how much to pay someone, how to develop someone) is based on judgment, experience, personal bias, and some amount of data. And since well over 50% of all corporate spending is on salaries (United States payroll is around $15 Trillion), these “judgmental decisions” cost companies a lot of money.
And in my world, where we deeply study every part of management, leadership, and HR, we often try to correlate various “HR practices” against outcomes to figure out what works. Much of our business is based on this work, and we regularly “re-run” most of our analysis every few years as culture, the labor market, and technology changes.
Right now, for example, we know that workplace stress, pay equity, and career growth are among the most important drivers of employee satisfaction and workforce productivity. Only a few years ago it was all about fancy benefits, bonuses, and grandiose titles.
So what I’m essentially saying is that much of HR is based on organizational psychology, many forms of social science research, and never-ending effort to experiment, learn from others, and figure out what works. And it’s difficult, imperfect, and always subject to debate.
The Underlying Data Set In HR Is Textual
While this massive effort has been going on, most of the “hard science” in HR and management has been focused on numbers. We ask people to take tests, we look at people’s “performance ratings” and grade point averages (which are extremely subjective), and we ask people for surveys, feedback, and lots of data to make decisions. And then we correlate business results (sales, profit, market share) against various people metrics, and think “we have the answer.”
For recruiting and selection we look at experience, job-related tests, and opinions and scores from interviewers. Theoretically if we get enough of this data we can make better and better hiring decisions. And the precise same thing happens when we look at who to promote, who to demote, and who should make it to the very top ranks of the company.
The whole premise of promotion is based on old ideas of “promotability” or “potential” rated against “current job performance” (the 9-box grid). That approach, which sounds quantitative, is filled with bias, so we have to “infer” who has high potential from various assessments, observations, and inputs. Again, when we get lots of data (looking at the background and behaviors of many high performers), we can improve the science of promotion. But for the most part this is based on judgement.
The core “science” of HR is often rooted in Industrial Psychology, which is a fascinating domain which studies attributes, behaviors, and psychology at work. And as much as I admire and follow much of this science, most companies don’t use it very much. There is a billion dollar industry of “validated pre-hire assessments” and they are extremely useful. But for many jobs they are misleading and companies have to validate these tests so they don’t get sued for discrimination.
So if you want to really do a “big data” analysis of your workforce’s skills, experience, and suitability for different work, you’re dealing with mountains of “anecdotal data,” much of which is encoded in biographies, work output, company leadership frameworks, assessments, and lots of communications. And of course there are performance appraisals, business results, and more.

Consider the two most common parts of HR: a job requisition (job posting) and a job description. Both these artifacts are “thrown together” by hiring managers or HR professionals, often based on what people think a job is like, a set of company standards, and some “technical skills” we know this person will use. As we all know, these artifacts don’t really predict who will succeed, because so much of “success” is based on ambition, learning agility, culture fit, and alignment with purpose.
In other words, this is one of the most complicated and fascinating “mixed data” problems in the world, and making decisions a few percent better can drive billions of dollars of business value.
How Generative AI and Large Language Models Can Help
Given the complex, important, and messy business we are in, how can Generative AI and Large Language Models help? Well while it’s still early days, let me venture the idea that this new branch of AI has the potential to totally reinvent how much of HR works. And in this disruptive change we will see new platforms, new vendors, and new ways of running our companies.
(For those of you who don’t know what Generative AI and Large Language Models are, let me simply say these AI systems can index, categorize, and cluster billions of “tokens” which include words, phrases, numbers, and even code, to find patterns and predictions you can query. And through English language interface (and other language as well) they can analyze, summarize, and infer meaning from all this mess. Read about the statistics behind it here.)
Let me rattle off a few of the huge use-cases we’ve uncovered in the last few months:
1/ Creating content for job descriptions, competency guides, learning outlines, and onboarding and transition tools.
I’ve always felt that the best way to “describe a job” is to watch what people are doing. If you actually observe, capture, and analyze a few months of work, you could literally “write the job description” based on the actual work. Well Generative AI can do this.
You could use Generative AI to look at “the sales operation in your company” and analyze all the biographies, work histories, sales tools, and various sales materials in your sales organization. And it could likely describe “what sales people in your company do” and help you write realistic job reqs based on real roles.
Then if you want to know how to train sales people, you could ask it “tell me what the top performers do vs. the low performers.” And it would find things you may not know. And then you could ask the Generative AI machine to “read all our sales and product training” and “give me an outline of what people need to learn and know.” It could then build you tests, online learning guides, and eventually become the “sales coach” for your company.  (This is essentially what Salesforce Einstein GPT is trying to do – you don’t need to buy this from Salesforce by the way, you can do it yourself.)
Then you could ask the tool “who are our top accounts measured by total revenue and total profit” and if it has access to financial data it could answer that too.  So not only could it help you improve and rewrite all your job descriptions, it could help you “define the success criteria,” help you “evaluate who is performing well and why,” and then build the killer “sales training materials” you know are badly needed.
Now replicate this idea in manufacturing, marketing, finance, logistics, and even HR.
I’m sure it won’t be perfect at all this, but in a short period of time you’ll learn things you didn’t know and I would not be surprised to see these types of apps come “out of the box” within a year.
2/ Create skills models, experience models, and candidate profiles for recruiting
The second, and probably biggest spending area for improvement is recruiting. You all know how hard it is to find, assess, and select the “right person” for a job. Well right now everyone is gaga about “skills-based hiring.” But what does that really mean? Does it mean this person has passed a test in some tool or programming language? Does it mean they’ve done it 100 times before? Or does it mean they worked in a company that was really good at this so they probably learned a lot about it there?
See, it’s complicated. Supposed you could crawl millions of employee profiles and then look at the “work they did” (ie. scan Github, articles written, legal briefs, etc) and then decide “how good” this person is at this job? That would be almost impossible to do manually, but Generative AI can do this. And it can do much more.
Suppose it looks at this person’s biography and work history and then compares it to other candidates. It could probably tell you which has higher education, which has better spelling, and what other personal characteristics vary. One of the second-generation talent intelligence vendors we’re working with now has a tool that can show you “the leadership profile of company A” compared to “the leadership profile of company B” simply by scanning, analyzing, and deeply understanding the different experiences, language, education, and credentials of leaders from these two companies. Not a bad way to do your competitive analysis or recruiting eh?
I know L&D vendors who have already used ChatGPT to build lesson plans, learning objectives, and skills assessments from existing content. This kind of analysis applied to billions of job candidates can start to show recruiters who the “adjacent skilled” professionals are who could take that hard to fill job. They may have “related experience” that is 100% perfect for the job you’re filling. This is already happening, and it’s going to get better.
And by the way, with tuning these models can remove gender bias, age bias, racial bias, and more. So not only are they potentially more useful, they’re actually likely to be “safer” as well.
3/ Analyze and improve pay, salary benchmarks and rewards
A third massive challenge in HR is “how much to pay people” and “what benefits to provide.” And this is a very tricky subject. More than 95% of companies have pay equity problems already (our new research details this whole area) and as inflation goes up and salaries keep varying based on demand, HR departments are always struggling to keep up.
Generative AI can quickly do salary benchmarking, assess pay levels across millions of open jobs, and analyze external and labor market data to help understand competitive pay, rewards, incentives, and other benefit programs. Most companies try to do this by hiring expensive consultants: these consultants should soon come armed with AI-enabled tools, and then you’ll be able to get the tools yourself. I know of at least five vendors leaning into this today, and it is likely to make all these decisions better.
The whole issue of pay equity is a mess to fix as well. While some AI vendors are starting to focus here, we know from our research that most companies have 5-15% of their total aggregate payroll in some from of “inequitable pay” distribution. People get raises for political reasons and then over time we end up with highly paid, highly tenured people far overpaid based on their market salary or competition with others. I know software engineers who make $500K or more just because they hired into a “hot company at a hot time.” Suddenly a few months later they’re making 1.5-2X more than their peers. Companies hate trying to solve these problems.
4/ Performance management and feedback
One of the most difficult and often despised part of HR is performance management, performance appraisal, and development planning. While there are hundreds of fantastic books and models to define this process, it often comes down to personal judgement. And in most cases the manager gives an appraisal without doing a comprehensive look at an employee’s entire year of work. Imagine if the Generative AI system indexed a year of an employee’s work, hours worked, meetings, and other production and helped managers assess what happened?
Imagine then if the Generative AI took this work effort and perhaps compared it to similar roles to show the manager where this employee was outperforming and perhaps underperforming?  I know the technology can do this to some degree today: I recently asked Bing Chat to tell me how Microsoft’s financial performance varied from 2021 to 2022 and it did a pretty good job. Many of the new models of Generative AI can “learn skills” from this kind analysis and these “skills” can be saved and shared with others. And this leads me to the next use-case: Coaching and Development.
5/ Coaching and leadership development
As most of us know, the most valuable assistance we have in our careers is a “coach.” A Coach is someone who watches what we do, knows how it should be done, and gives us developmental feedback. They coach may or may not be an “experts” (many coaching models are built around the idea of “coach as psychologist”) so the coach may simply be observing us and giving us badly needed support. They may interview our peers and help us see blind spots and understand challenging situations.
Well today this market is explosive. Vendors like BetterUp, CoachHub, Torch, SoundingBoard, Skillsoft, and many others have created nearly a $billion dollar market for “coaching on demand.” Well what if this coaching came from an intelligent bot? Medical providers have built these systems for suicide prevention, medical intervention, and other support needs and they work quite well. In the business world this is an enormous area of “low hanging fruit.”
Imagine, for example, if I have to lay someone off. I could easily ask the ChatBot (which may have access to many guides, books, and videos from our company and experts): “how should I approach the layoff conversation?” Or “what is the best way to coach someone who keeps coming late to meetings? Or even “how can I have greater impact on my team” or even “how can I make my meetings more effective?”
These types of questions have been asked millions of time by millions of leaders, so there are well honed answers, suggestions, and tips for all of them. And most companies have license to leadership development content, compliance content, and all sorts of “difficult conversation” content now. The Generative AI system can easily find this, interpret it, and make it easy for managers to use.
And it will get better. Imagine, as I described above, if you put your own particular leadership model and approach to management into this system. You would get “the Starbucks store manager coach” or “the Fiat Chrysler manufacturing leader coach” and so on. My friends in the leadership development and coaching industry are probably excited (and nervous as well). This is coming fast.
6/ Individual Coaching, Mental Health, and Wellbeing
Perhaps one of the biggest successes in Generational AI has been the success of tools like “Woebot” which help treat mental health, stress, and suicide. This tool, which was launched in 2017, has reduced stress, anxiety, and suicide with almost twice the effectiveness of therapy. How could it be so good? By using the feedback loops in Generative AI (with human training), the system can quickly identify a user who is considering suicide and just by listening, help them relax and move forward.
I strongly recommend the story in the New Yorker this week (Can AI Treat Mental Illness) which convincingly explains how this technology has become so successful. These tools were not trained for work-related stress, but the problem is very similar. Over the last five years the Workplace Wellbeing market has grown to over $50 Billion in size and our research on The Healthy Organization found that the typical solutions (EAP programs, online coaches, training, mindfulness) have less impact than we expected. Witness the fact that most statistics on workplace mental health show that it continues to be a problem, even after billions of dollars have been invested.
This particular use case, which every company needs, could end up being pretty important. So we can expect healthcare providers, insurance companies, and forward-thinking vendors like Ginger.io (who now owns Headspace) to jump into this market.
7/ HR self service and knowledge management
The final use-case I will mention is self-service and knowledge management, perhaps the “lowest hanging fruit” of all. We all have thousands of documents, compliance books, diversity guidelines, safety rules, process maps, and help systems to aid employees in selecting benefits, understanding company policies, and even just resetting our password. And things like “figuring out what button to push in Workday or SAP” goes into this category as well.
All this complicated “knowledge enablement” and self-service stuff is perfect for Generative AI. Microsoft’s new Power Platform interface to OpenAI lets companies embed workflows into the system, so you could tell the chatbot “please apply for family leave and ask my manager for approval” or “please put a case into IT for me to upgrade my laptop.” And the use cases will go wild. Many of you who work in HR operations, call centers, and service delivery centers will be investing in this almost immediately. And that means every HR Tech vendor from Oracle to Workday to SAP, ServiceNow and ADP will embed this technology into its platforms.
Bottom Line: This Technology Will Make Work Better
Let me make one final point. Despite the fears and inflammatory headlines you read in the New York Times (the NYT seems particularly unhappy about this technology), I want you to remember that this technology will be a massive step forward in business. Last week I published an article by two MIT PhD students who analyzed the use of ChatGPT on 400+ business professionals and the productivity improvements were stunning. This will start to happen in all these other areas as well.
I would remind you to consider Generative AI a tool, not a living person.  Just as Microsoft Excel was groundbreaking in the early 1980s (and there were fears of it putting accountants out of business), so this system will become an essential business tool as well. We all have to learn how to use it.
Will it be perfect? Of course not. But today, as I touch on above, we make thousands of critical decisions with poor data, uneducated judgement, and often just not enough internal research. I believe Generative AI and all its variations will be a total gamechanger in HR. And for everything we do just a little bit better, our employees end up with a better work experience and our companies perform at a higher level.
Stay tuned, there is much more to come.
How To Learn More: Come To Irresistible 2023
How can you learn more?  Here are a few big resources.
First, come to Irresistible 2023 – our big annual conference held at USC on June 20-22. We are bringing in several famous experts in Generative AI for HR to that event and we are going to have a big discussion about how it will impact HR. I promise you this will be well worth your time.

Second, if you’re a geek like me, read Steven Wolfram’s article “What is ChatGPT and How Does it Work.” And I will post some other cool articles below.
Finally, if you are doing something exciting and want to share, please let us know. We are talking with hundreds of companies about these tools and I promise we will share more as time goes on. I will be presenting some of our newest research at the HR TechFest Singapore in mid-May and then much more at the Irresistible Conference in June.
Onward and upward!

					Artificial Intelligence at University: A guide to using ChatGPT for work

By Will Brown
Artificial Intelligence is everywhere at the moment. 
At first it was a novelty, something to have funny conversations with and send them to your group chat. Now, we’re beginning to grapple with the real-world consequences of artificial intelligence. Unsurprisingly, a lot of university students are now starting to wonder how the sudden boom in AI can help them with their work.
Firstly, don’t get it to write your essays. That’s just dumb.
Granted, it has been done. ChatGPT will write you an essay if you ask it to. It won’t be a very good one, it won’t be referenced, and it may well have just copied text from the internet – which will send your plagiarism score soaring.
Don’t get it to write your essays. That’s just dumb
Universities are unsurprisingly scrambling to find a way to reliably detect whether or not essays are written by artificial intelligence. There are some rudimentary detectors available, including one offered by ChatGPT’s creators OpenAI. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t. But it won’t be long before these detectors get better. I don’t think it’s worth risking the academic misconduct charge.
So, how can you use AI to your benefit? I’ll tell you how. But firstly, I’m going to go into this with a massive caveat. AI is not perfect, far from it. Don’t take it’s word as gospel, and check over anything it’s helped you with before using it in your summatives.
With that caveat out the way, I genuinely believe that artificial intelligence has the potential to be an immensely positive, transformation experience for our education. It might be in its early days, but here’s all the ways I’ve found it can be of use so far.
A Personal Tutor
Wouldn’t it be great if you had someone that you could talk through a topic with?
You could go to your lecturer’s office hours, of course. But not everyone has the confidence for that, and sometimes it’s such a quick question that you don’t feel it’s worth troubling them. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is merely a click away.
Struggling to grasp the specificities of dialectical materialism? Not quite getting the hang of quantum entanglement? Can’t distinguish cadere from caedere? For everything from answering a quick question to generating lesson plans with follow-up questions that it will mark for you, ChatGPT is here to help.
Alternatively, Bing AI is perfect for this task. Whereas ChatGPT cannot connect to the internet and is only trained on data up until 2021, Bing is an AI-powered search engine that can have a conversation with you. It can’t talk for as long as ChatGPT can, and cannot come up with lesson plans. But if you’ve got a quick question that needs a quick discussion, then Bing is perfect.
Want to give it a try? Try asking ChatGPT: “Explain [a topic] to me with the necessary complexity required of a university course”.
A Writing Assistant
University requires a lot of writing. Whilst I’ve already cautioned against using it to write your essays, I’d happily recommend using it to help you with other aspects of writing.
Want someone to summarise your lecture notes in a simple paragraph? Ask ChatGPT to do just that. Need to cut fifty words out your final paragraph in order to squeeze under the word count? Ask ChatGPT to find what’s irrelevant.
It can also restructure your sentences for you. If you’ve got a clunky sentence in one of your lab reports that could do with re-wording, then just ask ChatGPT to make it clearer for you. You’re also likely to see this sort of technology appearing elsewhere. Notion already has an artificial intelligence function as part of its premium plans, and thanks to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI it likely won’t be long before you’ll be able to do this directly inside Word or OneNote.
A Reading Assistant
As it says in the DCAD posters, Academic English is nobody’s first language. I’m sure we’ve all stared at a paragraph from a random article that apparently revolutionised the discipline, and yet is so deeply couched in jargon that it’s more or less unreadable. Wouldn’t it be great if someone could read it for you and then explain it back to you in easier terms?
Thankfully, ChatGPT can do just that. It’s able to read lengthy chunks of academic jargon and send it back to you in a fashion that’s actually legible. I’ve often found it useful to get complex paragraphs ‘translated’, and then go back and read the original with an understanding of what it is trying to convey.
Try the following prompt: “I’m reading an academic article for my course, but I can’t understand it. Can you read it for me and then summarise in simpler terms?”
A Proof-Reader
No matter how many times I read through my essays, it always seems like there’s another mistake that needs fixing. Microsoft Word doesn’t catch everything, Grammarly is quite pricy. But ChatGPT? That’s free.
Ask ChatGPT if it will proofread your work for you, and it’ll happily oblige – returning your text for you, with any errors fixed up nicely.
However, exercise caution with this one. I’ve heard reports it ChatGPT adding in a few extra sentences out of nowhere when it does this. Perhaps better used on shorter texts.
A Reference Compiler
Referencing is complicated. It’s no wonder that so many options exist to automate it, ranging from citethisforme.com to Microsoft Word’s built-in referencing system. If you’re looking for another way to compile your references, feel free to ask ChatGPT for help. It’ll ask you for all the necessary information (author, year, title, etc.) and generate a reference in whatever style you’ve asked for.
This is particularly helpful for more complex references. We’ve all gotten used to directly citing papers, but more complex tasks – secondary referencing, for example – can be made easier with a bit of AI assistance.
You can’t put the AI-genie back in the bottle. Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly going to change the way we approach education. We’ve been warned not to use it for our essays, which I’d agree is sensible. But it’d be foolish not to make use of this technology to help improve our own learning process. There are a variety of applications for ChatGPT in education, and it’s important to remember that AI language bots are really still in their infancy. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is currently running on version 3.5 of their language software, with version 4 rumoured both to be coming this year and to be a significant upgrade on the current version. Universities are going to need to reckon with how this changes education, and they’re going to need to reckon with it fast. Otherwise, there may soon be an epidemic of perfectly-written AI essays that nobody can tell the difference between.

The coming artificial intelligence economic revolution will be a major shock to the world. There is a serious possibility that the next decade will bring about a series of social and economic changes akin to the Industrial Revolution and the advent of the internet combined. Many writers, human resource officers, lawyers, writers, artists, and even coders increasingly will be replaced by AI as the “laptop class” of workers is decimated. At the same time, blue-collar workers who work with their hands will enjoy job security; their services cannot be replaced by technology. Unfortunately for waves of young people, the media’s advice to “learn to code” may have been like investing in typewriters.      
Artificial intelligence is advancing at a breakneck speed. Recent announcements of programs that can mimic human conversation, copy our voice, write research papers, and paint beautiful pictures are just a small sliver of the coming AI revolution. The coming changes in everyday life soon will become noticeable, including the popularity of AI-generated video games, music, art, and even movies. A short description and a click of the mouse can spit out a new novel by John Steinbeck or an economic treatise by Thomas Sowell.


  

Scores of jobs that require a college education will be changed nearly overnight. Rapid advances in this new technology will wreak havoc on the very people who prospered during COVID, especially those who work in the “knowledge economy” and can often carry out their duties from their laptops at home. Artificial intelligence advances within the next one to five years will outpace most work a human can input into a keyboard. Most content on the web will be written by chatbots. There will be AI influencers. Code will be written in a tiny fraction of the time it takes for humans to produce it. Graphic artists will lose most of their business to art generators. Even accountants and financial analysts may be outpaced by computers. ChatGPT already helps coders through basic code, which often needs refining. The chat service also can help replace many of the smarts needed to build a website. It already has passed an MBA exam and law exams.
Some white-collar jobs will fare better than others with the advancement of AI. Those who pioneer new techniques or are at the top of their fields will still be able to earn a respectable wage. At the same time, workers whose jobs rely on an element of personality and face-to-face relationships likely will weather the storm. Would you rather have an actual human advising you on legal matters, your finances, and your health care decisions — or a machine? Still, the shift toward a nearly labor-free creative world may make white-collar jobs across the board fewer and farther between.  
The coming economic earthquake will be something of a reverse Industrial Revolution. Professions requiring practical knowledge will provide far more security than “knowledge economy jobs” that can be supplanted by algorithms. Replacing sheetrock can be done only by doing. AI cannot build a house, fix a plumbing issue, give you a haircut, or install lights in a public space. AI could make the lives of blue-collar workers easier with new tools and techniques, but the basics of construction, utility work and intricate machining will remain the same.
We are entering into a world where general knowledge will be known mostly by machines and practical knowledge still will be implemented by human hands. There are tremendous social implications for the loss of millions of currently well-paying jobs. Many people who invested their time and careers into a certain profession will undergo a collective identity crisis. The increasing rate of social change and technological progress may mean serious shifts from year to year.
Ironically, the massive advances in the STEM field also may prove to be its undoing. There will be a need for engineers and academics for the foreseeable future. However, many of the job paths related to the science, technology, engineering and math programs may be seriously reduced due to AI. The majors would have been worth more than social science degrees, but that’s damning with faint praise.
The elite sneering at an honest day’s labor may be the economic and educational error of the last century. Unfortunately, the last generation in education elevated white-collar ideals over blue-collar experience. It may have been a very bad choice to convince would-be electricians to be English or even math majors. 


  

Many Americans will be shocked by the speed with which artificial intelligence changes their daily life. And just as the “new normal” sets in, there will be even larger changes. But as pink slips go out for online journalists, there will still be a need for a person able to fix a furnace.

Vince Kellen understands the well-documented limitations of ChatGPT, DALL-E and other generative AI technologies — that answers may not be truthful, generated images may lack compositional integrity, and outputs may be biased — but he’s moving ahead anyway. Kellen, CIO at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), says employees are already using ChatGPT to write code as well as job descriptions.
OpenAI’s text-generating ChatGPT, along with its image generation cousin DALL-E, are the most prominent among a series of large language models, also known as generative language models or generative AI, that have captured the public’s imagination over the last year. The models respond to written requests to generate a variety of responses ranging from text documents and images to programming code.
Kellen sees ChatGPT-generated code as a productivity-enhancing tool in much the same way that compilers were an improvement over assembly language. “Something that produces libraries and software is no different than searching GitHub,” he says. “We also use it to write job descriptions that are sensitive to our content and formatting. You can then move on to editing very quickly, looking for errors and confabulations.” While the technology is still in its early stages, for some enterprise applications, such as those that are content and workflow-intensive, its undeniable influence is here now — but proceed with caution.
 
 
 













 
 

Ready for the right applications
Generative AI is ready for use in coding, administrative workflows, data refinement, and simple use cases such as pre-filling forms, says Oliver Wittmaier, CIO and product owner at DB SYSTEL GmbH, the wholly owned subsidiary of DB AG and digital partner for all group companies. And in the transportation industry, he says, “AI can directly or indirectly impact the avoidance of transport, the steering of transport, and the management of transport.”

Content generation is also an area of particular interest to Michal Cenkl, director of innovation and experimentation at Mitre Corp. “I want contextual summarization and refinement via dialog, and that’s what these large-language models deliver, he says. Currently his team is looking into two use cases in the knowledge and expertise domains. “The first is if I want to write an email to one of our sponsors that summarizes the work we’ve done that’s relevant to them—and write it in the context of communications we’ve already had with them. That’s incredibly powerful.”
The second is for project staffing. Normally Cenkl reviews résumés and searches by skills tags to find the right people for a project. Generative AI can facilitate that. “For example, I might want to ask, ‘What can Michael do on this project,’ based on what he’s doing now, and get a summary of what he could do without me having to construct that from a résumé.”
 
 
 













 
 

And over at used car retailer CarMax, they’ve been using generative AI for over a year, leveraging OpenAI’s APIs to consolidate customer review text to summaries that are more manageable and readable. But CIO Shamim Mohammad says his team has expanded its use of the technology into other areas as well.
One application, in vehicle imaging, was conceived as a way to improve customer experience. AI optimizes images for every vehicle the company adds to its inventory, which at any given time includes between 50,000 and 60,000 vehicles, he says. “We make every image as realistic as possible without losing the validity of it,” he says. For example, its data scientists created a “digital sweeper” model that replaces a photo of a car sitting on a dirty floor with an image that shows the car sitting on a clean one. “It’s still the same car, but looks better and it’s a better experience for the customer,” he says.
Similarly, Nike has been using generative AI to generate product prototype images, says Forrester analyst Rowan Curran. “You can use a text-to-3D modeler, test in 3D space, and get a much more visceral feel for how it will look in the real world — all with very little effort,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

Applications with the greatest potential payback
Creating code and improving customer experience are the main areas companies can take advantage of today using generative AI, and they have the greatest potential payback in terms of efficiency gains, Mohammad says.

Gary Jeter, EVP and CIO at TruStone Financial Credit Union, says these are areas his developers have also pursued with GitHub’s implementation of OpenAI’s Codex. And, he says, using generative AI for coding has worked well. Cenkl adds that generative AI models work better on coding than on human language because programming languages are more structured. “It can tease out that structure, and that’s why it works,” says Cenkl.
CarMax is experimenting with GitHub’s Copilot, where he says engineers in some cases could potentially generate up to 40% of their code. “This is evolving quickly,” Mohammad says. “But you have to make sure there’s no copyright infringement, fake content or malware embedded if you’re using it to create software.” You can’t just plug that code in without oversight.
 
 
 













 
 

Other areas ripe for enterprise applications, says Curran, include generating marketing copy, images, designs, and creating better summaries of existing data so people can consume it more effectively. “Some people are even using these large language models as a way to clean unstructured data,” he says. And in the coming year, generative AI capabilities may begin to appear in some enterprise software ranging from help desk software to Microsoft Office applications.
Don’t trust, verify
Aside from the benefits, CIOs deploying the technology need to be aware of potential intellectual property issues regarding generated outputs, CarMax’s Mohammad cautions. Generative models, such as DALL-E that trains on data from the Internet, have generated content that may infringe on copyrighted content, which is why Getty Images recently sued Stability AI over its AI-driven art generation tool Stable Diffusion.

Mitre Corp.
The technology also needs human oversight. “Systems like ChatGPT have no idea what they’re authoring, and they’re very good at convincing you that what they’re saying is accurate, even when it’s not,” says Cenkl. There’s no AI assurance — no attribution or reference information letting you know how it came up with its response, and no AI explainability, indicating why something was written the way it was. “You don’t know what the basis is or what parts of the training set are influencing the model,” he says. “What you get is purely an analysis based on an existing data set, so you have opportunities for not just bias but factual errors.”
 
 
 













 
 

Wittmaier is bullish on the technology, but still not sold on customer-facing deployment of what he sees as an early-stage technology. At this point, he says, there’s short-term potential in the office suite environment, customer contact chatbots, help desk features, and documentation in general, but in terms of safety-related areas in the transportation company’s business, he adds, the answer is a clear no. “We still have a lot to learn and improve to be able to include generative AI in such sensitive areas,” he says.
Jeter has similar concerns. While his team used ChatGPT to identify a code fix and deploy it to a website within 30 minutes — “It would have taken much longer without ChatGPT” — and he thinks it’s useful for drafting terms and conditions in contracts, it’s not entirely proven. “We will not expose any generative AI to external members,” he says. “TruStone will not be bleeding edge in this space.”
Gary Jeter, EVP and CIO, TruStone Financial Credit Union
TruStone Financial Credit Union
When TruStone eventually starts using the technology for the benefit of its members, he adds, it will monitor conversations through human and automated review to protect its members and the brand.
 
 
 













 
 

Today, the key to successful deployment is still having a human in the loop to review generated content for accuracy and compliance, says UCSD’s Kellen. “Making sure the machine makes the right decision becomes an important litigation point,” he says. “It’ll be quite a while before organizations [use it] for anything that’s high risk, such as medical diagnoses.” But generative AI works fine for generating something like review summaries, provided there’s a human overseeing them. “That slows us down a bit, but it’s the right thing to do,” he says. Eventually, he adds, “We’ll find automated ways to ensure that quality is good. But right now, you must have a review process to make sure the content generated is accurate.”
Vince Kellen, CIO, UCSD
UCSD
Another well-documented risk, in addition to accuracy, is the potential for bias in the models introduced from the data used to train them. This is especially problematic when generative AI is using content from the Internet, as ChatGPT does, but that may be less of an issue when training the model against your own private corporate data that you can review for potential bias, Kellen says. “The more you get to the enterprise, where the class of data is more constrained and more mundane, the more generative AI shines,” he says.
The thing to understand about large-language models, says Cenkl, is these machines are to some degree savants. “They don’t understand, but they’re very good at computing,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

Changes in job responsibilities, roles
“Technology has made things better, but it’s also created a lot of extra work for us,” says Mohammad. However, he believes generative AI is different. “It’s exciting because it’s going to take away some of the stuff we don’t like to do and make us more intelligent,” he says. “It will augment humans.”

But Curran points out that there’s no expectation that generative AI will completely replace any role in the short term. “It may reduce the number of people needed to execute a role, such as in content development, product information management or software development,” he says. “But there will always be the need for a human in the loop.” And Mohammad adds that even if the technology can write and summarize, human intelligence will always be needed to ensure quality, and to control what’s been generated to make it better.
Steps to get started
Now is the time to get up to speed on generative AI technology and start experimenting, says Kellen. “CIOs have to get their heads inside this puzzle before they’re bamboozled by vendors who are embedding the technology into their enterprise software offerings,” he says. “If you spend the next year procrastinating, you’ll be behind the curve.”
 
 
 













 
 

It’s important to get educated and go deeper than the public discussion on ChatGPT in order to understand that this technology is much more complex than one application, says Curran. Then start considering use cases where generative AI might improve the efficiency or quality of existing processes. Finally, ask what types of capabilities you’ll need and whether you should acquire that from a vendor or build it yourself.
From there it’s a matter of testing the technology and consider potential use cases. “A lot of your systems, whether they use structured or unstructured data, will have at least some component of natural language and conversational interface,” says Cenkl. “Think about the data you have and what parts of that can be augmented by these technologies,” and then demonstrate the potential. For example, Jeter says he generated a template of terms and conditions and sent it to his compliance department to show how they could use it. 
Generative AI models are large, and training them from scratch is expensive, so the best way to get started is to use one of the cloud services, says Curran. CarMax, for example, uses Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service with GPT 3.5. “The data we load is our own — it’s not shared with others,” Mohammad says. “We can have massive amounts of data and process it very quickly to run our models. If you have a small team or business problem that might take advantage of generative AI technology, give it a shot.”

Generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders are two of the most popular approaches used for producing AI-generated content. In general, GANs tend to be more widely used for generating multimedia, while VAEs see more use in signal analysis.







How does this translate to real-world, pragmatic value? Generative AI techniques help create AI models, synthetic data and realistic multimedia, such as voices and images. Although these techniques are sometimes used for creating deepfakes, they can also create realistic dubs for movies and generate images from brief text descriptions. They also generate drug discovery targets, recommend product design choices and improve security algorithms.

How do GANs work?
Ian Goodfellow and fellow researchers at the University of Montreal introduced GANs in 2014. They have shown tremendous promise in generating many types of realistic data. Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, has written that GANs and their variations are ""the most interesting idea in the last ten years in machine learning.""
For starters, GANs have been used to generate realistic speech, including matching voices and lip movements to produce better translations. They have also translated imagery, differentiated between night and day and delineated dance moves between bodies. Combined with other AI techniques, they improve security and build better AI classifiers.

The actual mechanics of GANs involve the interplay of two neural networks that work together to generate and then classify data that is representative of reality. GANs generate content using a generator neural network that is tested against a second neural network: the discriminator, which determines whether the content looks ""real."" This feedback helps train a better generator network. The discriminator can also detect fake content or a piece of content that is not part of the domain. Over time, both neural networks get better, and the feedback helps them learn to generate data that's as close to reality as possible.



GAN training method







How do VAEs work and compare with GANs?
VAEs were also introduced in 2014, but by Diederik Kingma, a research scientist at Google, and Max Welling, research chair in machine learning at the University of Amsterdam. VAEs also promise to create more effective classification engines for various tasks, with different mechanics. At their core, they build on neural network autoencoders made up of two neural networks: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder network optimizes for more efficient ways of representing data, while the decoder network optimizes for more efficient ways of regenerating the original data set.
Traditionally, autoencoder techniques clean data, improve predictive analysis, compress data and reduce the dimensionality of data sets for other algorithms. VAEs take this further to minimize errors between the raw signal and the reconstruction.
""VAEs are extraordinarily strong in providing near-original content with just a reduced vector. It also allows us to generate inexistent content that can be used free of licensing,"" said Tiago Cardoso, group product manager at Hyland Software.
The biggest difference found when juxtaposing GANs vs. VAEs is how they are applied. Pratik Agrawal, partner in the digital transformation and AI practice at management consulting company Kearney, said that GANs are typically employed when dealing with any kind of imagery or visual data. He finds that VAEs work better for signal processing uses cases, such as anomaly detection for predictive maintenance or security analytics applications.


Generative AI use cases
Generative AI techniques likes GANs and VAEs can be deployed in a seemingly limitless variety of use cases, including the following:

Implementing chatbots for customer service and technical support.
Deploying deepfakes for mimicking people.
Improving dubbing for movies.
Writing email responses, dating profiles, resumes and term papers.
Creating photorealistic art in a particular style.
Suggesting new drug compounds to test.
Designing physical products and buildings.
Optimizing new chip designs.
Writing music in a specific style or tone.



Since both VAEs and GANs are examples of neural networks, their applications can be limited in actual live business examples, Agrawal said. Data scientists and developers working with these techniques must tie results back to inputs and run sensitivity analysis. It is also essential to consider factors such as the sustainability of these solutions and to address who runs them, how often they are maintained and the technology resources needed to update them.
It's worth noting that a variety of other techniques have recently emerged in generative AI, including diffusion models, which are used for generating and optimizing images; transformers such as Open AI's ChatGPT, widely used in language generation; and neural radiance fields, or NeRFs, a new technique being used to create realistic 3D media from 2D data.

Augmented intelligence refers to the assistive role artificial intelligence can play in improving human decision making, which is different from the popular conception of AI in which computers replace humans. A subset of artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence seeks to center the ways humans and machines can work together, not remove the human element from certain work.
 
What Is Augmented Intelligence?
Augmented intelligence is designed to work with humans to enhance their capabilities, rather than remove humans from the picture. It relies on machine learning and deep learning to crunch through reams of data, which humans then use to make decisions and take action.
What Is Augmented Intelligence?Augmented intelligence is a subset of artificial intelligence in which AI technologies assist humans rather than replace them. It’s typically done using machine learning to analyze data and help humans make smarter decisions.
 

Humans can use augmented intelligence to enhance their capabilities and tools. This is especially true for industries that employ data science and analytics. 
In retail, for instance, augmented intelligence can suggest the optimal store layout and product placement to merchandisers based on shopper data, such as foot traffic patterns. And the medical field is also benefiting from augmented intelligence, with surgeons and healthcare providers receiving recommendations on patient treatments based on a mountain of medical data, research and the patient’s own medical record history.
“Artificial intelligence is one of many, many different technologies, and augmented intelligence is a manifestation or outcome of how you choose to implement those AI technologies,” Frances Karamouzis, a VP analyst at research firm Gartner, told Built In.

Augmented Intelligence vs. Artificial Intelligence: What’s the Difference?
The goal of AI is to show intelligent behavior that mimics the human mind and can ultimately automate processes and make decisions without any human intervention. (This goal, however, has yet to be reached.)
Augmented Intelligence vs. Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence seeks to automate processes by delving deep into data to yield answers and operate autonomously. Augmented intelligence uses AI technologies but in a fashion where humans are kept in the loop and play a key role in making decisions.

Augmented intelligence is designed to show intelligent behavior too, but its differentiator is working with humans to improve the task to be done or decision to be made, said Heni Ben Amor, associate professor at Arizona State University’s School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence.
Social intelligence, as it pertains to technology, is a feature of augmented intelligence that allows for the understanding of both the task and actions that the human is seeking to do before they do it, Subbarao Kambhampati, professor at the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University, said.
AI systems don’t need to have much social intelligence because they are designed to work autonomously. But with augmented intelligence, social intelligence is required because it needs to give humans explanations about what it’s doing and allow people to advise it about what it should be doing in a way similar to how humans interact with one another, Kambhampati explained.

How Augmented Intelligence Works
Augmented intelligence uses AI and machine learning to gather structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, which it then analyzes and interprets. 
When teamed with humans, augmented intelligence systems have the benefit “of a bigger picture on common sense,” which AI systems tend to lack due to their deep and narrow view of data and information, Kambhampatihe said. For example, two supercomputers programmed to play chess may attempt to finish the game despite a fire in their office, whereas a supercomputer playing chess against a human would be instructed by the human to turn itself off. 
“If I want a future where we are essentially replaced, then this is the future we are inventing with AI systems,” Kambhampati added. “But if I want a future where humans have a productive role to play, then augmented intelligence will become more and more increasingly important.”

How Augmented Intelligence Is Used 
Self-Driving Cars Navigating Safely 
“Self-driving cars” might sound like no human oversight is needed, but that isn’t always the case. In fact, Tesla vehicles use augmented intelligence. Although its autopilot software is being developed so that cars can largely navigate roads autonomously, there are times when they require human intervention in certain emergencies, like cars suddenly pulling into the driver’s lane or slamming on the brakes on short notice.

Helping Retailers Identify Store Bottlenecks
Retail is one industry that has a lot to gain from augmented intelligence. The technology can be used to analyze customer and storefront data to improve operations both online and in-person.
Data visualization company RadiusAI uses augmented intelligence to suggest to retailers where bottlenecks are occurring in their stores that could impede sales or where product placements may get noticed more. But it’s up to humans to then make those changes and optimize retail operations based on suggestions from the augmented intelligence system.


 
Suggesting Diagnoses and Treatments 
AI and healthcare have proven to be an ideal match and augmented intelligence in the healthcare industry is no different. With augmented intelligence, medical professionals can comb through patient data quickly and receive actionable insights and recommendations from the system. 
One example of this is VisualDx’s use of augmented intelligence, which culls through its expansive curated medical image library. With this technology, dermatologists receive recommendations about the types of skin diseases and skin problems that may be affecting their patients. 


 
Analyzing Blood Tests to Detect Cancer 
Augmented intelligence can be used for more than just sifting through records and images in the medical field. When the technology is applied to blood test data sets, it might even be able to detect cancer. Biotech company Freenome uses biological analysis of data sets to cull through blood tests looking for early warning signs of cancer with its augmented intelligence technology. With the enhanced blood test results, physicians are armed with additional information to treat patients.

    The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is expanding rapidly. These technological breakthroughs present both opportunity and potential peril. AI technology offers great hope for increasing economic opportunity, boosting incomes, speeding life science research at reduced costs, and simplifying the lives of consumers. With so much potential for innovation, organizations investing in AI-oriented practices are already ramping up initiatives that boost productivity to remain competitive.

    Like most disruptive technologies, these investments can both create and displace jobs. If appropriate and reasonable protections are not put in place, AI could adversely affect privacy and personal liberties or promote bias. Policymakers must debate and resolve the questions emanating from these opportunities and concerns to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically.

    This debate must answer several core questions: What is the government’s role in promoting the kinds of innovation that allow for learning and adaptation while leveraging core strengths of the American economy in innovation and product development? How might policymakers balance competing interests associated with AI—those of economic, societal, and quality-of-life improvements—against privacy concerns, workforce disruption, and built-in-biases associated with algorithmic decision-making? And how can Washington establish a policy and regulatory environment that will help ensure continued U.S. global AI leadership while navigating its own course between increasing regulations from Europe and competition from China’s broad-based adoption of AI?

    The United States faces stiff competition from China in AI development. This competition is so fierce that it is unclear which nation will emerge as the global leader, raising significant security concerns for the United States and its allies. Another critical factor that will affect the path forward in the development of AI policy making is how nations historically consider important values, such as personal liberty, free speech, and privacy.

    To maintain its competitive advantage, the United States, and like-minded jurisdictions, such as the European Union, need to reach agreement to resolve key legal challenges that currently impede industry growth. At this time, it is unclear if these important allies will collaborate on establishing a common set of rules to address these legal issues or if a more competitive—and potentially damaging—legal environment will emerge internationally.

    AI has the capacity to transform our economy, how individuals live and work, and how nations interact with each other. Managing the potential negative impacts of this transition should be at the center of public policy. There is a growing sense that we have a short window of opportunity to address key risks while maximizing the enormous potential benefits of AI.
The time to address these issues is now.
    In 2022, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce formed the Commission on AI Competitiveness, Inclusion, and Innovation (“Commission”) to answer the questions central to this debate. The Commission, cochaired by former representatives John Delaney (D-MD) and Mike Ferguson (R-NJ), was tasked with the mission to provide independent, bipartisan recommendations to aid policymakers. Commissioners met over the course of a year with over 87 expert witnesses during five separate field hearings across the country and overseas, while also receiving written feedback from stakeholders answering three separate requests for information posed by the Commission.

    The Commission observed six major themes from its fact finding:

    Key takeaways

                                    The development of AI and the introduction of AI-based systems are growing exponentially. Over the next 10 to 20 years, virtually every business and government agency will use AI. This will have a profound impact on society, the economy, and national security.
                            
                                    Policy leaders must undertake initiatives to develop thoughtful laws and rules for the development of responsible AI and its ethical deployment.
                            
                                    A failure to regulate AI will harm the economy, potentially diminish individual rights, and constrain the development and introduction of beneficial technologies.
                            
                                    The United States, through its technological advantages, well-developed system of individual rights, advanced legal system, and interlocking alliances with democracies, is uniquely situated to lead this effort.
                            
                                    The United States needs to act to ensure future economic growth, provide for a competitive workforce, maintain a competitive position in a global economy, and provide for our future national security needs.
                            
                                    Policies to promote responsible AI must be a top priority for this and future administrations and Congresses.
                            
    Understanding the importance of these findings, the Commission also determined that the following five pillars should be at the core of AI regulatory policy making:

    Five pillars of AI regulation
Efficiency
    Policymakers must evaluate the applicability of existing laws and regulations. Appropriate enforcement of existing laws and regulations provides regulatory certainty and guidance to stakeholders and would help inform policymakers in developing future laws and regulations. Moreover, lawmakers should focus on filling gaps in existing regulations to accommodate new challenges created by AI usage.
Collegiality
    Federal interagency collaboration is vital to developing cohesive regulation of AI across the government. AI use is cross-cutting, complex, and rapidly changing and will require a strategic and coordinated approach among agencies. Therefore, the government will need to draw on expertise from the different agencies, thus allowing sector and agency experts the ability to narrow in on the most important emerging issues in their respective areas.
Neutrality
    Laws should be technology neutral and focus on applications and outcomes of AI, not the technologies themselves. Laws regarding AI should be created only as necessary to fill gaps in existing law, protect citizens’ rights, and foster public trust. Rather than trying to develop a onesize-fits-all regulatory framework, this approach to AI regulation allows for the development of flexible, industry-specific guidance and best practices.
Flexibility
    Laws and regulations should encourage private sector approaches to risk assessment and innovation. Policymakers should encourage soft law and best practice approaches developed collaboratively by the private sector, technical experts, civil society, and the government. Such non-binding, self-regulatory approaches provide the flexibility of keeping up with rapidly changing technology as opposed to laws that risk becoming outdated quickly.
Proportionality
    When policymakers determine that existing laws have gaps, they should attempt to adopt a risk-based approach to AI regulation. This model ensures a balanced and proportionate approach to creating an overall regulatory framework for AI.

    Recommendations

    Having understood the urgency to develop policies to promote responsible AI and to ensure economic and workforce growth, the Commission used these pillars to develop policy recommendations to put these priorities into action. The Commission recommends areas that policymakers must address, including preparing the workforce through education, bolstering global competitiveness in the areas of intellectual property while shoring up partnerships, and protecting national security.
Preparing the WorkforceUse an Evidence-Based Approach. Policymakers must take action to understand the potential impact of AI on the American workforce by leveraging new data sources and advanced analytics to understand the evolving impact of AI and machine learning on the American public.
                            Educate the Future Workforce. The United States must increase education around AI in both the K-12 and higher education systems by encouraging policymakers to reform the standard curriculum to better prepare students for developing AI and machine learning systems.
                            Train and Reskill. The public and private sectors must invest in training and reskilling the future workforce. These investments should be targeted toward programs that help ease worker transitions and improve incentives for businesses to invest in retraining. Policymakers should also leverage community colleges and vocational schools to train workers to perform jobs alongside AI-enabled systems.
                            Attract High-Skilled Talent. In areas where a worker shortage cannot be addressed through education, training, and reskilling, Congress must act to increase the AI talent pool through targeted refinements to the H-1B visa process to encourage highskilled immigration to the United States.
                            Bolstering global competitivenessShore Up Global Partnerships. U.S. officials must collaborate with key partners and allies to develop more sensible global governance frameworks that advance our common democratic goals and values.
                            Advance Intellectual Property Protections. Building on the foundation of the current system, policymakers must clarify intellectual property law requirements to ensure adequate protection of AI-enabled intellectual property. Before any change, policymakers must involve relevant stakeholders to consider potential unintended effects.
                            Provide Necessary Resources. Policymakers should provide additional resources to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to support the acquisition of technical expertise, training, and other resources to speed the review of AI- and machine learning– related public patent applications.
                            Protect Ingenuity. Policymakers should also explore opportunities to grant provisional approvals for submissions under review where appropriate to mitigate the effects of lengthy delays.
                            Protecting national securityHuman Rights. The United States must drive the development and implementation of laws and codes of conduct focused on promoting human rights and innovation.
                            Establish International Rules of Conduct. As the United States leads in the development of AI-enabled weapons, it should follow and encourage other countries to align with existing international norms and laws.
                            Systems Validation. The U.S. should invest heavily in new ways of testing, evaluating, verifying, and validating (“TEVV”) military AI and machine learning systems to ensure that they are used safely.
                            Streamline Procurement. To capitalize on American ingenuity, Congress and the Pentagon must look at streamlining acquisition processes and finding new ways of incorporating industry expertise and experience within the military enterprise.
                            Work with Allies. The United States should look to open investment opportunities for AI-enabled systems to like-minded countries and allies and vice versa.
                            
    These findings and recommendations are not exhaustive, and we welcome the insights of others who may contribute to the AI policy debate. The Commission and individual Commissioners stand ready to collaborate with policymakers to address these issues that are of utmost importance to the United States and the economic wellbeing and safety of the global community.

Hearing Wrap Up: Artificial Intelligence Poses Great Risks but Safe Integration Will Yield Positive Results









Share via Email



WASHINGTON — The Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation held a hearing yesterday titled “Advances in AI: Are We Ready For a Tech Revolution?” Subcommittee members discussed with experts ways in which artificial intelligence can and will be practically applied across industries and the risks and rewards it poses to the public. Republicans inquired how guardrails can be implemented to manage the social, moral, and ethical dilemmas surrounding AI while making sure innovation will not be stifled by government overreach and inaction.
Key Takeaways:
Artificial intelligence is ingrained in many aspects of our daily lives and is one of the great technology revelations of our time. With the power of AI comes great responsibility.


Dr. Aleksander Mądry—Director, MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning and Cadence Design Systems Professor of Computing—outlined how AI usage will spread across society as it becomes increasingly accessible to the public: “AI is no longer confined to research labs, the genie is out of the bottle. The key factor that has made recent AI tools so popular is the accessibility.  Tools like ChatGPT can be directed using simple language commands…no AI expertise required.  As the barrier to adopting AI gets lower and lower, AI will spread across our economy and our society. We are at an inflection point of what the future of AI will bring.”

Quantum computation is a powerful tool used to make AI more accurate and effective.

Dr. Scott Crowder—Vice President, IBM Quantum, and CTO, IBM Systems, Technical Strategy and Transformation—spoke on the role that quantum computational tools will play as the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence continues to increase: “One primary reason quantum computing can benefit artificial intelligence is because it uses a different method to find patterns in data. For example, in fraud detection, a quantum algorithm may be better at detecting true fraud and reducing false positives. Put simply, quantum will be another computational tool to improve AI results.”

America must lead in harnessing and implementing artificial intelligence technology to combat the future prospect of AI-based threats from foreign adversaries.

Dr. Eric Schmidt—Chair, Special Competitive Studies Project—explained how the U.S. must lead in artificial intelligence in the coming race with hostile foreign nations like China to utilize this powerful software: “Can you imagine technology that imbues how we think, how we teach, how we entertain and how we interact with each other, imbued with Chinese values, not American values. Not the values and rules that we have in our democracy. It’s chilling.  The most important thing to understand is that we need to win because we want America to win.”


Member Highlights:
Chairwoman Mace (R-S.C.) discussed the balance of unleashing the power of AI capabilities in a safe way while being sure that government red tape does not get in the way of technological progress.

Chairwoman Mace: “How can we ensure that AI technology is developed in a way that is safe, transparent, and beneficial for society without stifling innovation?”
Dr. Schmidt: “I come back to a much simpler formulation: let American ingenuity, American scientists, the American government and American corporations invent this future and we’ll get something pretty close to what we want.  Then [the government] can work on the edges where you have misuse.”
Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) discussed the potential threats that bad actors pose with the capabilities presented in artificial intelligence now and in the future. 

Rep Burlison: “Given the state of the size and scope of the equipment that’s necessary today, we are limited to what actors do have the ability to use AI, is that correct?”
Dr. Schmidt: “I can assure you it’s coming…I would expect us to see terrorists, other bad actors begin to use this technology in ways that we should anticipate.”
Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) noted the potential positive impacts on accuracy and efficiency that AI integration could have on the U.S. workforce.

Rep. Timmons: “What are the most promising use cases for AI as a tool in the workforce and how do you anticipate AI will influence industries?”
Dr. Crowder: “There’s lots and lots of applications. I think we need to look at AI as augmenting what humans can do, as opposed to replace. Good utilization of AI is to make our workforce more efficient. I would argue one of the things we do a good job of in the United States is funding basic science, but we also need to look at how do we encourage our workforce to use the technology and not just develop the technology.”

University of Guelph Statement on Artificial Intelligence Systems, ChatGPT, Academic Integrity 





Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powerful tools that promise to revolutionize research, teaching and learning. In all three areas and in the future of work, there exist creative and forward-thinking opportunities for the use of AI. Many University of Guelph faculty, instructors, staff and students are currently looking at ethical uses of AI, including research through U of G’s Centre for Advancing Responsible and Ethical Artificial Intelligence (CARE-AI).  
At the same time, the development of increasingly sophisticated AI systems such as ChatGPT poses potential threats to academic integrity. Unauthorized student use of AI systems undermines student learning, the achievement of learning outcomes and violates the University’s academic misconduct policies.
The University is committed to ensuring that the use of AI in teaching and learning complies with existing policies and regulations that govern academic and scholarly integrity. We continue to engage the University community, including students, as we work to refine academic integrity policies and their intersection with AI tools. We affirm the following:
Students’ work must reflect their unique intellectual capacity and demonstrate the application of critical thinking and problem solving. Unauthorized use of AI to complete assessments violates the fundamental intellectual purposes of the University and does not demonstrate student achievement of course learning outcomes.Submission of materials completed by AI, without permission of the instructor, constitutes an offence under the University’s academic misconduct policies, either as a form of plagiarism or the use of unauthorized aids. Acceptable use of AI should be determined by the course instructor and may vary across disciplines, programs and types of assessments. In setting out course requirements and assessment criteria, the instructor should specify allowable uses of AI, if any, through the course outline and/or the learning management system (e.g., CourseLink). Clarity about the acceptable use of AI is critical for students and instructors. Students are responsible for appropriately referencing how and to what extent they have used AI in assessments in keeping with University and course requirements.
Faculty and instructors are encouraged to continue to develop modes of assessment that foster academic integrity and assess learning outcomes. Where appropriate, this may include building into assessments requirements that students explain and provide evidence of the research and thought processes used in completing the assignment.
Ongoing information and education sessions on artificial intelligence and academic integrity will be available across the University.

However, contrary to popular perception, India&#039;s IT sector, and its industry body, Nasscom, believe that instead AI would help facilitate the creation of more jobs.Last week, Nasscom released a strategic review report highlighting that AI is the highest employment-generating sector within the tech industry and is likely to only grow more as the Indian tech industry aims to reach $245 billion in size by the end of FY2023.Track Budget 2024 updates real-time with BT&#039;s non-stop live streaming of India&#039;s most-important event from 8 am to 7 pm Talking to BT, Debjani Ghosh, President of Nasscom, said that the world has always reacted in a negative way when a new thing arrives. She pointed out that when automation arrived on the scene, there was widespread fear that this new technology would end up eating away many jobs. &amp;quot;But the data strongly suggests that new technology is only making more jobs. There are so many new jobs being created because of AI and emerging tech. AI will definitely make jobs easier and create a need to upskill but it will only take over jobs that don&#039;t require humans. New tech has always been a creator of jobs, earlier there were no Uber drivers, or Zomato/Swiggy delivery boys, these jobs were created because of technology,&amp;quot; Ghosh explained.Echoing Ghosh, Krishnan Ramanujam, President, of Enterprise Growth Group, at TCS, is of the opinion that AI and automation taking away livelihood has now become an old and boring story.&amp;quot;For the last four generations we have seen that AI and automation will never take your job away, they are not job killers but only creators. So be it generative AI or any new form it will never take away jobs. However, it will require Indian techies to upskill constantly,&amp;quot; he said.He further underscored that generative AI and its products are meant to help and facilitate human jobs, that&#039;s when true transformation happens. He highlights sectors like BFSI or medical, where the role of technology, especially AI and data, have increased to a point where now it is impossible to solve problems without them. &amp;quot;The key is in finding the right kind of generative AI,&amp;quot; he said.Even IT doyen and Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy too is on the same page. Talking to BT, Murthy came in support of ChatGPT and stressed on the fact that it can never take away jobs. &amp;quot;I have used ChatGPT and no it can never take over human jobs. It can facilitate better and smooth functioning but humans will never be replaced by AI,&amp;quot; he noted.He also said that his son introduced him to ChatGPT and described the chatbot as a &#039;nice thing&#039;&amp;quot;There has always been a fear of losing jobs with anything new coming to the world but we must not fall for that. We must take AI as the good thing that it is and use it for the right purposes,&amp;quot; Murthy underscored. CP Gurnani, CEO and Managing Director of Tech Mahindra, too explained his thought on generative AI and said, &amp;quot;I am so happy about the generative AI. To me, it did not take away jobs. It created jobs. Technology is the heart of everything.&amp;quot; He added that the use cases of generative AI are still being defined, which means that it has the potential to create more job opportunities in the future.",,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.headline', '.summary']}",en_US,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202303/tch36-01-scaled-sixteen_nine.jpg?size=1280:720', 'caption': 'Artificial Intelligence', 'width': '1200', 'height': '900'}","{'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/author/rachna-manojkumar-dhanrajani', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rachna Manojkumar Dhanrajani'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Live00:0000:0000:00 March 17 (Reuters) - Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword this year, capturing the public's fancy and sparking a rush among Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab to launch products with technology they believe will change the nature of work.Here is everything you need to know about this technology.WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?Like other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI learns how to take actions from past data. It creates brand new content - a text, an image, even computer code - based on that training, instead of simply categorizing or identifying data like other AI.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe most famous generative AI application is ChatGPT, a chatbot that Microsoft-backed OpenAI released late last year. The AI powering it is known as a large language model because it takes in a text prompt and from that writes a human-like response.GPT-4, a newer model that OpenAI announced this week, is ""multimodal"" because it can perceive not only text but images as well. OpenAI's president demonstrated on Tuesday how it could take a photo of a hand-drawn mock-up for a website he wanted to build, and from that generate a real one.Advertisement · Scroll to continueWHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?Demonstrations aside, businesses are already putting generative AI to work.The technology is helpful for creating a first-draft of marketing copy, for instance, though it may require cleanup because it isn't perfect. One example is from CarMax Inc (KMX.N), opens new tab, which has used a version of OpenAI's technology to summarize thousands of customer reviews and help shoppers decide what used car to buy.Generative AI likewise can take notes during a virtual meeting. It can draft and personalize emails, and it can create slide presentations. Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google each demonstrated these features in product announcements this week.WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?A response by ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, is seen on its website in this illustration picture taken February 9, 2023. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabNothing, although there is concern about the technology's potential abuse.School systems have fretted about students turning in AI-drafted essays, undermining the hard work required for them to learn. Cybersecurity researchers have also expressed concern that generative AI could allow bad actors, even governments, to produce far more disinformation than before.At the same time, the technology itself is prone to making mistakes. Factual inaccuracies touted confidently by AI, called ""hallucinations,"" and responses that seem erratic like professing love to a user are all reasons why companies have aimed to test the technology before making it widely available.IS THIS JUST ABOUT GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT?Those two companies are at the forefront of research and investment in large language models, as well as the biggest to put generative AI into widely used software such as Gmail and Microsoft Word. But they are not alone.Large companies like Salesforce Inc (CRM.N), opens new tab as well as smaller ones like Adept AI Labs are either creating their own competing AI or packaging technology from others to give users new powers through software.HOW IS ELON MUSK INVOLVED?He was one of the co-founders of OpenAI along with Sam Altman. But the billionaire left the startup's board in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest between OpenAI's work and the AI research being done by Telsa Inc (TSLA.O), opens new tab - the electric-vehicle maker he leads.Musk has expressed concerns about the future of AI and batted for a regulatory authority to ensure development of the technology serves public interest.""It's quite a dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it,"" he said towards the end of Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O), opens new tab Investor Day event earlier this month.""Tesla's doing good things in AI, I don't know, this one stresses me out, not sure what more to say about it.""(This story has been refiled to correct dateline to March 17)The Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.

A few years ago, you might have been forgiven for wondering whether it was just another fad. But recent advances – such as the emergence of generative AI tools like ChatGPT – have left most of us in no doubt that we’re witnessing the dawn of a new era. An era that’s likely to see our lives change just as dramatically as we saw with the arrival of personal computers, the internet, or smartphones.

Perhaps even more so – Google CEO Sundar Pichai famously stated back in 2016 that it would have a bigger impact than fire or electricity.

But let’s forget the hyperbole (if it is hyperbole) for a second and focus on the here and now. What are the most important things we need to understand about this revolutionary technology today? Interesting (or scary) though it may be to wonder whether we will be chauffeured in sentient flying taxis – or even falling in love and marrying robots – in decades to come, there are some pressing concerns that need to be addressed right now. So, here are the facts I believe that everyone needs to get to grips with in 2023 in order to navigate these early days of the AI era.

Yes, it’s early days, and the AI tools and apps that are blowing our minds today are going to look amusingly quaint compared to what we’re playing with in five years’ time. But make no mistake, AI is here today, embedded everywhere in the world around us. You might be one of the many who don’t even realize it – a survey a few years back found that while 84% of us were using AI on a daily basis, only 34% knew we were doing it. But when you’re shopping online, searching the internet, ordering food deliveries, hailing a ride, navigating from place to place, or enjoying music and movies, you’re probably using AI.

It's still tempting to think of AI as something from the domain of science fiction that might emerge at some point in the future – because, to adults alive today, that’s been the case for most of our lives. And today’s AI doesn’t’ exactly look and behave like what we might have been expecting, if we grew up watching Dr. Who, Star Trek, or The Matrix. But if we understand the term AI to mean machines that are capable of simulating at least some of the cognitive functions of biological brains – specifically today, the capacity to learn and improve – then that’s clearly what we have. The last ten years have seen some of the world's biggest companies focusing their efforts on building these abilities into everyday products and services, which is what has brought us to the point we’re at today.

AI is not going to make you redundant – yet!
One of the biggest concerns about AI is that it will make humans redundant. After all, if our jobs require analyzing and interpreting information and using it to make decisions, it’s very probable that machines can now do it at least as accurately, and certainly much faster, than we can!
The truth, though, is that while some AI systems are good at some jobs, AI, in general, isn’t quite good enough just yet to fully replicate the entire skillsets needed to do most work. Self-driving vehicles haven’t been completely cracked yet – despite billions in investment and numerous companies getting to the trial stage, we aren’t yet at the point where bus or taxi drivers are in danger of being immediately replaced. This is even more true for knowledge workers or workers in roles where there is an emphasis on human-to-human interaction, like nursing or teaching.
It's clear that some jobs are being replaced by automation – manual manufacturing work, retail cashiers, and bank clerks, for example, had seen machines take over much of their work, even before AI became as commonplace as it is today. At the same time, however, new jobs are created by the need to design, implement, sell, manage, and oversee technology and AI. Generally, these tend to be higher-paying, safer, more comfortable, and more rewarding jobs than those that are replaced.

AI is going to affect your job, business, or industry 
Another thing it’s important to understand today is that ignoring the emergence of AI and believing that it won't affect your job, business, or industry is the biggest mistake you could make!
Whatever you do, AI is most likely going to have an impact, and it's crucial for individuals and businesses to think about how it's likely to affect them. Failing to do so means we’re likely to be overtaken by competitors or startups who have been quicker to adapt to the changing world. No one wants to end up the way Blockbuster Video did when Netflix arrived or Kodak after the arrival of digital cameras. Both were businesses that believed that encroaching existential threats to their core business models were simply fads that would blow over. AI is not a fad, and its impact is likely to be much further-reaching than that of streaming video or digital cameras, so we need to start planning for it right now!

Just about anyone can use generative AI to make themselves smarter and more efficient
There are already many ways we can use AI tools and applications to augment and enhance our own work. If we are involved with creating reports or summarizing information, then tools like ChatGPT can help with creating drafts, outlines, and lists of important points. Other generative AI tools are available for creating videos, music, and images, and they can all be used today by anyone working in creative fields or anyone who simply needs to communicate ideas quickly and efficiently. The standard of work they produce is probably not good enough to rely on to create finished pieces of work in many cases, but it can be used to speed up the early stages of ideation, designing, and drafting. It can give us instant answers and advice on just about any topic we might need to consider before we make a decision, manage our schedule, so we don't double-book ourselves or miss important appointments, and vastly speed up day-to-day routine tasks such as sending emails.

Developing ethical and explainable AI is essential
There’s a very simple reason that AI needs to be both ethical and explainable, and it all comes down to trust. AI is powered by data – the more it knows, the more efficiently it works. The most valuable data of all is human data, which tells it about who we are, how we live our lives, and what we need to make us safe, comfortable, healthy, and happy.
If AI has this information, then it has the potential to do amazing things, including helping us solve some of the most pressing problems facing humanity. That could be tackling climate change, treating diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s, or reducing poverty.
In order for it to be able to do these things, though, people will have to trust it with their data. Many of us aren’t going to be comfortable handing over sensitive information about our health or our habits if we're not sure what's being done with it. This is why the concept of explainable AI is so crucial. We need to know why it makes the decisions it makes and what information it bases them on if we are going to trust it to make important choices that could affect our lives.
On top of that, we need to be sure that the decisions and operations of AI are aligned with our ethical values. It’s been shown that AI can lead to bias and discrimination, particularly where the data that it’s trained on contains bias. This could be due to incomplete datasets or data that’s been collected in a biased manner. Failing to show that problems of ethics and bias are being addressed will lead to further difficulty in building trust between humans and AI, which could potentially limit its usefulness and the positive outcomes that can be achieved.

They could diagnose our illnesses in a second. Robots and autonomous vehicles could shop and deliver our groceries. Systems could ensure we don’t break our budgets. AI could operate our transit — planes, trains and cars — without human assistance, and even make our dinner.That’s the vision of many AI enthusiasts. But the current reality is that while there has been progress, humans are still required to do most jobs. An AI could introduce problems to the workplace, creating risks for workers, their employers and customers, some experts say.Today, AI can power grocery store robots that change how stores get stocked, speed up vaccine production and generate creative ideas.

But jobs are transforming as AI becomes more accessible.“Every job will be impacted by AI,” said Pieter den Hamer, vice president of research who covers artificial intelligence at market research firm Gartner. “Most of that will be more augmentation rather than replacing workers.”Companies have been using AI for years to help crunch large amounts of data to produce insights for their businesses. Some blue-collar jobs have used AI-powered machines to help with warehouse inventory.White-collar jobs are likely to see the biggest impact near-term, den Hamer said, as AI can be applied at a relatively low cost compared with deploying a fleet of autonomous trucks, for example.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementIf you’re curious about how some jobs might shift, explore the industries below.Do you work as a banker or financial adviser?

AI can help developers find code they can repurpose for new products or write basic new code, said Martin Wildberger, its executive vice president of innovation and tech.[Quiz: Did AI make this? Test your knowledge.]Financial firm Capital One said AI and machine learning are central to its engineering workforce. The bank holds AI and ML patents for fraud detection and natural language processing.AI advances in the field: Several banks are aiming to offer more personalized financial products and advice, increase the speed of fraud detection to alert customers instantly and remind people of specific bills or spending.Abhijit Bose, a Capital One senior vice president, said AI could soon monitor transactions to offer more personalized financial advice, insights on spending and saving or quick alerts on deviations from normal spending habits — something as simple as an outlier tip percentage.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementMorgan Stanley recently began testing chatbots powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 with 300 advisers to help them easily pull up research and data. The firm plans to open it up to its 16,000 advisers in upcoming months.But financial institutions are cautious. AI could introduce risks such as frustrating customers with too much automation, breaking privacy laws aimed at protecting customer’s personal financial data and potentially discriminating against people with lower income.How jobs might change: RBC is asking workers across functions to become familiar with using AI tools, Wildberger said. It could provide customer service representatives with summaries of complex cases based on previous interactions. And business teams could automate some processes to be more efficient.“We really focus on the productivity side of tech,” Wildberger said. “Can we automate something to free up [employees’] time?”Capital One said it’s hiring AI and machine learning engineers, but it’s also upskilling current engineers. Bose said the company has already trained more than 100 engineers through its six-month program.Health care and pharmaceuticalsWhat’s happening: Many hospitals use electronic medical records, an area that may benefit from AI for organization and analysis, said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who studies AI’s impact on work. And drug development can involve analyzing hundreds of millions of data points, another area where AI could help.AI advances in the field: Johnson & Johnson sped up the trials of its coronavirus vaccine by using AI to identify hot spots including where variants emerged, said Jim Swanson, executive vice president and chief information officer. It also can help narrow the focus on molecules and identify targets for drug discovery or accelerate image analytics to determine drug effects. And AI supports the manufacturing process for a personalized blood cancer treatment that modifies patients’ own cells.Swanson said AI also helps guide physicians through procedures like surgeries with augmented reality. As the physician works, it provides guidance on the best next steps. It also helps with reporting adverse events related to drugs by scanning the latest medical literature and flagging reports that need to be reviewed or accelerate image analytics to determine drug effects.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselMore from Work: ReimaginedCarousel - $More from Work: Reimagined: use tab or arrows to navigateThe boomers are retiring.

Here’s how to prepare.March 28, 2023End of carouselThe University of Kansas Health System recently rolled out a generative AI app to more than 140 hospitals. The app, from health-tech company Abridge, records audio of a patient interview, transcribes it, then summarizes important elements to automatically fill out a patient’s medical chart.“The joy of medicine is helping people get to better health, not the clerical activity,” said Gregory Ator, the health system’s chief medical informatics officer and surgeon. This “just streamlines documentation.”Generative AI can introduce errors, though, which could be problematic for health-care providers. Abridge highlights parts where reliability of the transcript may be decreased so people can review it, CEO and cardiologist Shiv Rao said.Some health-care professionals are using AI for cancer screenings, medical imaging and predictions to better detect problems. Google is working with partners such as the Mayo Clinic to validate AI that could automate part of the planning process in radiation treatments for cancer, help mobile ultrasound devices detect early stages of breast cancer or provide vital maternity data without a sonographer and power tuberculosis screenings. But it will probably take years before the technology is ready for professional use, Google said.If relied on too heavily, AI errors in medical processes could have life-altering consequences.That’s why Tammy Mahaney, a Bay Area nurse and sonographer, said she checks readings provided by AI-enabled systems to ensure they match what she’s seeing. But she said the tools help her care for more patients.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementDuring a missionary trip to an underserved community in the Galápagos Islands, Mahaney used Butterfly IQ+, an AI-enabled tool that helps perform an ultrasound, interpret it and automatically provide measurements and images on a mobile device such as an iPhone. With the ultrasound, Mahaney determined that a woman in her mid-40s was pregnant and not suffering from a tumor, as she had been told. Still, Mahaney said AI is just a tool.“You always want to be cautious about diagnosis,” she said of AI. “The limitations are you don’t get the human interaction and instinct.”How jobs might change: Rao said AI isn’t too far from being able to aid health professionals with decision-making.“There will be a space for AI to be a thought partner,” he said, adding that the tech could help find the differentiator between two conditions.In the future, AI could be tied to more devices and wearables for health, Swanson said. Johnson & Johnson aims to digitally upskill 10,000 additional employees this year so they can use the tech to forecast sales or improve operations. And it’s exploring how to use and combine data without bias.RetailWhat’s happening: One way big retailers use AI is to track the market price of items, which changes based on factors including supply and logistics, to ensure products are competitively priced. AI can help adjust prices of thousands of products across a store, said Ananda Chakravarty, vice president of research at market intelligence firm International Data Corporation. AI can also help forecast exactly when to drop prices to increase profits.Retailers are also using AI to schedule workers based on a store’s need, automatically charge people for items with computer vision and recommend products to customers online, Chakravarty added.AI advances in the field: Sam’s Club, which often serves as tech pilot for Walmart, debuted autonomous floor scrubbers late last year, which in addition to cleaning floors, use computer vision to scan shelves for missing items, low inventory or mislabeled products. The information gets sent back to an ecosystem that could change workers’ priority list. For example, they may need to unload and stock water next if scrubbers determine shelves are empty.The retailer also uses AI in its virtual voice assistant called Ask Sam, which workers can use to quickly find prices, locate items or help customers. It hopes AI will soon help determine things such as how many croissants workers should bake and automatically alert them when the doughnut count is low, for example.“We’re moving to where AI is going to be embedded in a lot of things so we can increase associate productivity and reduce friction for members,” Pete Rowe, Sam’s vice president of tech, said.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementLooking ahead, retailers might use computer vision to automatically identify whether a customer is old enough to buy alcohol, Chakravarty said, adding that the tech is in early stages of adoption. Generative AI may also soon write product descriptions for thousands of products, said Christian Beckner, the National Retail Federation’s vice president of retail technology and cybersecurity. And AI could crawl social media to automatically design clothes or products based on trends, allowing retailers to get new items to market quickly.But AI-enabled systems aren’t always well received by everyone. When Walmart rolled out robot cleaners a few years ago, some store associates complained about malfunctions and the time they tended to training the robots (Walmart said the bots appeared to have been well-received). And facial recognition systems have historically suffered flaws, often misidentifying people of color, which could lead to security unfairly targeting Brown and Black people.How jobs might change: Workers’ jobs are likely to be dictated by what machines deem most important or risk losing money or efficiency for the store. Workers also will probably need to adjust to working with data and tech more frequently, Chakravarty said.“You don’t have to be an expert, but you need to know how to interpret the data,” he said.But more AI could mean more risks.“The key concern would be … the risk of algorithmic discrimination or adverse consequences in how you treat different types of customers,” Beckner said. “There definitely needs to be a level of caution.”Writing and marketingWhat’s happening: One of buzziest forms of AI — generative AI — can produce digital images, conversational text, code and summaries of lengthy documents from a simple prompt. While it’s still in its early days, it has big implications for jobs that include writing, coding or promoting products.AI advances in the field: Last year, software development platform GitHub debuted GitHub Copilot, a tool that uses OpenAI models to write code based on a user’s prompt. Copilot can suggest methods, unit tests, boilerplate code and complex algorithms, GitHub said.Some writers are using generative AI tools like ChatGPT to co-write and illustrate books to sell on Amazon. And one legislator used it to help draft a law aimed at regulating AI. Companies such as Microsoft and Google are integrating generative AI tools so office workers can do tasks like write emails or create presentations faster within the apps.Jonathan Nelson, senior digital marketing manager of growth for the American Marketing Association, said marketers are experimenting with ChatGPT to write articles, including optimizing them for search engines, though they’re not yet publishing those items.“You have AI write a 1,000-word article, and then go through and edit it to make it sound human again,” he said. “It’s a framework for articles.”Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementJeff MacDonald, social strategy director at ad agency Mekanism, said he uses generative AI to brainstorm images for illustrators and designers. He also uses it to scrape TikTok comments and analyze reactions, ideas, and similarities and differences between brands.But he often uses other tools to double check AI-generated items, as it can make things up or get things wrong, and he avoids using them in finished products. Some AI companies are being sued for scraping copyrighted materials.“If [AI companies] lose these lawsuits … there’s no saying they can’t go after a brand that used copyrighted imagery,” he said.How jobs might change: Generative AI tools could help workers become more productive, especially with content creation, said den Hamer of Gartner. That might mean using AI for a first draft and social media posts to solve simple problems or provide summaries of complex topics.Nelson said though much is still experimental, marketers have a sense that they’ll soon work with AI if they aren’t already — even if it’s just to help determine the success of a campaign. But he said it will be important for the industry to keep human creativity front and center.“If everyone relies too much on one or two AI [tools], and it operates the same way, do you end up with rampant sameness where nothing stands out?” he said.About this storyWork: Reimagined | With attitudes toward work undergoing a dramatic transformation, this series explores the impact of that shift on everything from the shape of the American workplace to the role work plays in our lives.

If the first few decades of radiology were about refining the resolution of the pictures taken of the body, then the next decades will be dedicated to interpreting that data to ensure nothing is overlooked.",,The Microsoft co-founder says generative AI is the most important technological advance in 40 years,The Microsoft co-founder says generative AI is the most important technological advance in 40 years,,,"By Andrew R. ChowMarch 21, 2023 1:44 PM EDTBill Gates published an op-ed on Tuesday saying that the artificial intelligence (AI) technology behind tools like ChatGPT could be as revolutionary as the graphical user interface was in 1980. The graphical user interface was the prototype to modern operating systems like Windows and Mac. Now, Gates says AI will lead to all sorts of similarly massive changes in the coming decades. “The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone,” he wrote. “It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other.”Gates isn’t exactly an impartial player in the unfolding AI arms race. Microsoft, the company he co-founded, is investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT and which Gates raves about in his article. While Gates is no longer involved in day-to-day operations at Microsoft, he still serves as an advisor, meeting with project teams, and owns billions of dollars worth of Microsoft stock. Here are some takeaways from the piece: AI has a lot of potential in health careAs Gates now spends much of his time on philanthropic causes, he says he’s acutely interested in how AI could improve lives in less economically developed countries and “reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.” He argues that AI systems will accelerate medical research and potentially create tools to mitigate diseases like AIDS, TB and Malaria. He also suggests that generative AI tools should be used for primary diagnoses of patients seeking medical advice. While Gates acknowledges that AIs will inevitably misdiagnose patients, he contends that the upside is worth it. “Humans make mistakes too. And having no access to medical care is also a problem,” he writes. Meanwhile, Gates predicts that AI will soon be integrated into health care systems around the world, helping medical professionals file insurance claims and deal with paperwork.

Live00:0100:2800:30 Read More: The AI Arms Race is Changing EverythingIn the workforce, Gates predicts that AI will serve as a “personal agent”: drafting emails, monitoring schedules and taking notes. These abilities will cause massive workplace shifts, which will necessitate that governments “help workers transition into other roles,” he says. However, he argues that these shifts will allow humans to fill in the roles where software cannot, including “caring for patients and supporting the elderly.” AI is already having an outsize impact on the educational world, with students attempting to use AI to complete homework and writing assignments, and teachers using it to devise lesson plans. Gates argues that AI will be a crucial educational tool that will “measure your understanding, notice when you’re losing interest, and understand what kind of motivation you respond to.” Humans must step in to prevent AI harmsPlenty of harms loom. AIs have regurgitated hate speech and misinformation and have tried to emotionally manipulate users. Gates notes the misinformation problem, pointing to ChatGPT’s inability to solve math problems that involve abstract reasoning. However, he predicts that those kinds of limitations will be “largely fixed in less than two years and possibly much faster.” In a series of principles that Gates outlines as key to guiding the conversation around AI, he acknowledges that AI could exacerbate inequalities without the right interventions from governments and other organizations. He says it’s important for policymakers and philanthropists to prioritize the opposite: to wield AI to “help the poorest” and reduce inequality. Superintelligent AIs are comingGates raises the specter of superintelligent AIs, or machines that are smarter than human brains and make their own decisions about how they are used. He writes excitedly about these superintelligent AIs, asserting that they are “in our future.” Whether they will be positive or catastrophic for society, Gates writes, is too early to tell. In the near future, however, Gates encourages the continued adoption of AI technology, along with the institution of guardrails and regulations. “This new technology can help people everywhere improve their lives,” he writes.” At the same time, the world needs to establish the rules of the road so that any downsides of artificial intelligence are far outweighed by its benefits.” ",https://schema.org,,VideoObject,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6264801/bill-gates-ai/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How AI Is Changing Medical Imaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/UIDfUltg/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/UIDfUltg.m3u8,PT2M33S,2022-11-03T15:39:10.000Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://time.com/6264801/bill-gates-ai/,,,

Artists, designers, photographers, authors, actors and musicians see little humour left in jokes about AI programs that will one day do their job for less money. That dark dawn is here, they say.Vast amounts of imaginative output, work made by people in the kind of jobs once assumed to be protected from the threat of technology, have already been captured from the web, to be adapted, merged and anonymised by algorithms for commercial use. But just as GPT-4, the enhanced version of the AI generative text engine, was proudly unveiled last week, artists, writers and regulators have started to fight back in earnest.“Picture libraries are being scraped for content and huge datasets being amassed right now,” says Isabelle Doran, head of the Association of Photographers. “So if we want to ensure the appreciation of human creativity, we need new ways of tracing content and the protection of smarter laws.”Collective campaigns, lawsuits, international rules and IT hacks are all being deployed at speed on behalf of the creative industries in an effort, if not to win the battle, at least to “rage, rage against the dying of the light”, in the words of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.Poetry may still be a hard nut for AI to crack convincingly, but among the first to face a genuine threat to their livelihoods are photographers and designers. Generative software can produce images at the touch of the button, while sites like the popular NightCafe make “original”, data-derived artwork in response to a few simple verbal prompts. The first line of defence is a growing movement of visual artists and image agencies who are now “opting out” of allowing their work to be farmed by AI software, a process called “data training”. Thousands have posted “Do Not AI” signs on their social media accounts and web galleries as a result.A software-generated approximation of Nick Cave’s lyrics notably drew the performer’s wrath earlier this year. He called it “a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human”. Not a great review. Meanwhile, AI innovations such as Jukebox are also threatening musicians and composers.And digital voice-cloning technology is putting real narrators and actors out of regular work. In February, a Texas veteran audiobook narrator called Gary Furlong noticed Apple had been given the right to “use audiobook files for machine learning training and models” in one of his contracts. But the union SAG-AFTRA took up his case. The agency involved, Findaway Voices, now owned by Spotify, has since agreed to call a temporary halt and points to a “revoke” clause in its contracts. But this year Apple brought out its first books narrated by algorithms, a service Google has been offering for two years.The creeping inevitability of this fresh challenge to artists seems unfair, even to spectators. As the award-winning British author Susie Alegre, a recent victim of AI plagiarism, asks: “Do we really need to find other ways to do things that people enjoy doing anyway? Things that give us a sense of achievement, like writing a poem? Why not replace the things that we don’t enjoy doing?”View image in fullscreenNot a fan of AI: singer-songwriter Nick Cave. Photograph: Simona Chioccia/ShutterstockAlegre, a human rights lawyer and writer based in London, argues that the value of authentic thinking has already been undermined: “If the world is going to put its faith in AI, what’s the point? Pay rates for original work have been massively diminished. This is automated intellectual asset-stripping.”The truth is that AI incursions into the creative world are just the headline-grabbers. It is fun, after all, to read about a song or an award-winning piece of art dreamed up by computer. Accounts of software innovation in the field of insurance underwriting are less compelling. All the same, scientific efforts to simulate the imagination have always been at the forefront of the push for better AI, precisely because it is so difficult to do. Could software really produce paintings that entrance or stories that engage? So far the answer to both, happily, is “no”. Tone and appropriate emotional register remain hard to fake.Yet the prospect of valid creative careers is at stake. ChatGPT is just one of the latest AI products, alongside Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing, to have shaken up copyright legislation. Artists and writers who are losing out to AI tend to talk sorrowfully of programmes that “spew rubbish” and “spout out nonsense”, and of a sense of “violation”. This moment of creative jeopardy has arrived with the huge amount of data now available on the web for covert harvesting rather than due to any malevolent push. But its victims are alarmed.Analysis of the burgeoning problem in February found that the work of designers and illustrators is most vulnerable. Software programs such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL.E 2 are creating images in seconds, all culled from a databank of styles and colour palettes. One platform, ArtStation, was reportedly so overwhelmed by anti-AI memes that it requested the labelling of AI artwork.At the Association of Photographers, Doran has mounted a survey to gauge the scale of the attack. “We have clear evidence that image datasets, which form the basis of these commercial AI generative image content programs, consist of millions of images from public-facing websites taken without permission or payment,” she says. Using the site Have I Been Trained which has access to the Stable Diffusion dataset, her “shocked” members have identified their own images and are mourning the reduction of the worth of their intellectual property.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But following the trail is tricky as images are used by clients in altered forms and opt-out clauses can be hard to find. Many photographers are also reporting that their “style” is being mimicked to produce cheaper work. “As these programs are devised to ‘machine learn’, at what point can they generate with ease the style of an established professional photographer and displace the need for their human creativity?” says Doran.GPT-4 has brought a storm of hype and fright – is it marketing froth, or is this a revolution?Charlie BeckettRead moreFor Alegre, who last month discovered paragraphs of her prize-winning book Freedom to Think were being offered up, uncredited by ChatGPT, there are hidden dangers to simply opting out: “It means you are completely written out of the story, and for a woman that is problematic.”Alegre’s work is already being misattributed to male authors by AI, so removing it from the equation would compound the error. Databanks can only reflect what they have access to.“ChatGPT said I did not exist, although it quoted my work. Apart from the damage to my ego, I do exist on the internet, so it felt like a violation,” she says.“Later it came up with a pretty accurate synopsis of my book, but said the author was some random bloke. And, funnily enough, my book is about the way misinformation twists our worldview. AI content really is about as reliable as checking your horoscope.” She would like to see AI development funding diverted to the search for new legal protections.Fans of AI may well promise it can help us to better understand the future beyond our intellectual limitations. But for plagiarised artists and writers, it now seems the best hope is that it will teach humans yet again that we should doubt and check everything we see and read.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverArtPhotographyPlagiarismNick CaveComputingConsciousnessfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveKamala Harris speaks for first time since Biden drops out and endorses her to be Democratic presidential candidate – liveFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome The post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

Or will AI help improve our work lives and even create new jobs?,,Will AI chatbots and autonomous robots put many of us out of a job? Or will AI help improve our work lives and even create new jobs?,,,,"        Credits: Shutterstock Enterprise    Will AI chatbots and autonomous robots put many of us out of a job? Or will AI help improve our work lives and even create new jobs? The robots are coming! They’re gunning for your job and – here’s the kicker – they are far better at it than you are. Soon, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace journalists, surgeons, taxi drivers, song writers. In fact, few careers are safe, we’re repeatedly told.And yet… is that the whole story? There is a growing view that, in many ways, AI will make our lives better, both at work and at home.“AI can take some of the repetitive tasks off us,” says Liz Hardwick, digital productivity specialist, speaker, trainer and member of WeAreTechWomen.While it may seem daunting, “just think of AI as the latest addition to your tech tools, like the Palm Pilot or the first-generation iPhone once seemed to you,” she suggests. Most of all, don’t bury your head in the sand: “Understanding its capabilities is the first step to better harnessing AI for your benefit.”Improve your work lifeSo will AI really render us all redundant? When PwC ran the numbers, it came to a heartening conclusion.“Any job losses from automation,” wrote the report authors, “are likely to be broadly offset in the long run by new jobs created as a result of the larger and wealthier economy made possible by these new technologies.”      ChatGPT: What impact could it and other AI bots have on our kids’ learning? The artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, created by OpenAI, has been grabbing headlines of late, but will it be a good or bad thing for children's education?    Find out more      This optimistic take is far from unique. In its Future of Jobs Report 2020, the World Economic Forum foresaw 85 million job losses across 26 countries by 2025, because of AI. The flipside? Ninety-seven million new jobs would be created.It gets better. When, in 2019, MIT surveyed 2,300 global business leaders, nearly half strongly agreed that, thanks to AI, “we could dedicate more time to thinking creatively about the business challenges we (and our clients) face.”Your job could become more interesting, as more of the drudgery – those repetitive, even dangerous tasks – gets delegated to AI.“AI will replace repetitive and technical tasks – think emails, multi-step processes such as updating documents, or sending one bit of data from one place to another,” says Ms Hardwick. On the other hand: “AI will struggle to replace human interactions, empathy, knowledge processing or creative ideas.”It’s nuanced, though. Last year, a study found that “as firms invest in AI, they tend to transition to more educated workforces, with higher shares of workers with undergraduate and graduate degrees, and more specialisation in STEM fields [that’s science, tech, engineering and maths] and IT skills”.       Why your teen's gaming habit could land them a better job Parents often worry that their kids are spending too much time playing video games, but the latest research suggests that the skills they pick up from gaming could actually improve their employment prospects.   Find out more      So start upskilling, now.“Areas such as people management and digital skills are key,” says Ms Hardwick. Meanwhile: “humans will always be needed to set up, manage and facilitate AI interactions and processes, so learning what AI is, what it can do, and how you can help it ‘learn’ will enable the current workforce to take better advantage of AI, rather than being replaced by it.”Make yourself more hirable“Many organisations are turning to using AI and machine learning algorithms in their selection process,” says Dr Sara Ahmed, from the Future of Work Research Centre at the University of Surrey.While surveys suggest that job applicants are wary of this method, and that current AI might not be completely free from bias, “using AI in HR practices can learn from previous errors in the system and improve the new version to reduce biases and discrimination,” she says.It can also free HR teams from a lot of admin. “This can help us focus on upskilling workers or employees to take highly-skilled jobs,” says Dr Ahmed, “thus improving the efficiency and performance of individuals, organisations and societies.”Hack your commuteMore than $100bn (£83bn) has now been invested in developing ‘driver-assistance systems’ for cars and the UK Government has said that fully driverless cars could be on British roads by 2025, arguing that they will boost the economy and improve road safety, too.       How Vodafone's Edge Innovation Programme will 'enable the technology of the future' Vodafone's UK Business Director Nick Gliddon went to Milton Keynes to talk about how Multi-access Edge Computing could help driverless car software start-up, Imperium Drive, improve its car rental app.   Find out more      They might also save you a huge amount of time. Think of the hours you clock up behind the wheel. Last year, a survey suggested Brits spend a whole year of their adult lives sitting in traffic. Imagine how you could use that time if your car took the wheel. Might you finally write that novel, or study some of those STEM skills so vital in the modern economy?The transition, though, could be nerve-wracking and take longer than the Government thinks. According to a new survey, nearly 70% of drivers are now afraid of fully self-driving cars. That’s up from 55% last year.Free you from houseworkA 2023 study published in the journal PLOS ONE concluded that nearly 40% of the time that is currently taken up on unpaid domestic labour could be automated within a decade.       Pixel 6 and iPhone 13: How smartphones are now clever enough to coach you at tennis Artificial Intelligence (AI) now lives inside the brain of the latest smartphones, opening up intriguing new possibilities in the apps we use, from tracking your tennis swings to helping you sing your heart out.    Find out more      “Considering that people currently spend almost similar amounts of time on unpaid work as they do on paid work, the social and economic implications of this future of unpaid work could be significant,” write the authors. “It could free up additional hours from people’s lives for paid work and leisure, especially for women.”The researchers at the University of Oxford, and their colleagues in Japan, found that the most automatable task was grocery shopping (at 59%).Some jobs, though, will still require a human touch. Physical childcare, for example, was ranked as the least automatable (at 21%). And – perhaps tellingly – the British men involved in the study proved more optimistic about domestic automation than their female counterparts.Boost your healthAI is already transforming all aspects of healthcare, from screening and diagnosis right through to surgery.“This will reduce the cost of care, and improve outcomes, simply because things will happen earlier, faster, and better,” according to Dr Aldo Aisal, Director of Imperial College London’s UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare.This is good news for us all.       Prof Shafi Ahmed: 'Technology will completely transform healthcare' Professor Shafi Ahmed, world-renowned cancer surgeon and Vodafone Connected Health Ambassador, explains how technology and data-driven medicine are improving healthcare in the UK and globally.   Find out more      But what about the doctors who used to do this work? Will they be out of work? Not according to Dr Aisal: “Rather than replacing people with machines, creating unemployment, we foresee this as a way of dealing with the growing unmet need for clinical care.”Saving the environmentLast year, Boston Consulting Group concluded that AI is essential to solving the climate crisis. When it surveyed global climate and AI leaders, 87% agreed that advanced analytics and AI are helpful tools in the fight against climate change today.       AI helps improve Vodafone’s pan-European network Vodafone uses big data software, based on tools from Google Cloud and Cardinality.IO, to improve mobile network planning decisions.   Find out more      The consultants estimate that companies can meet up to 10% of their carbon reduction goals simply by using AI that collects data, makes connections that humans fail to notice, and then recommends actions.AI, it seems, might make your work life more interesting, your world less polluted, and your free-time freer.

Discover the potential benefits and risks in this article series for MSW students.",,A paradigm shift,A paradigm shift,,,"Generative AI for Social Work Students: Part IA paradigm shiftBrian Perron, PhD·FollowPublished inTowards Data Science·12 min read·Mar 20, 2023133ListenShareASCII art of a puppy produced by the author using ChatGPT.Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced incredibly fast in recent years, giving rise to powerful tools known as generative AI and large language models. Generative AI is artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, or music, based on patterns learned from existing data. Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT series, are a subset of generative AI that have been specifically trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language. These models have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing them to produce coherent, contextually relevant, and even creative outputs.Over a year ago, I began using GPT and was amazed by its ability to generate text that is indistinguishable from a human writer. This ability also brought up concerns regarding academic dishonesty. Consequently, I authored an article on Medium anticipating the emergence of AI-assisted academic misconduct.Since then, I have closely monitored developments in generative AI and explored how they can complement my interest in traditional AI systems. Recently, my colleagues and I evaluated ChatGPT’s capacity to pass a simulated Masters-level social work licensing exam — and it did. Our study’s pre-print is available here and will soon be published in Research on Social Work Practice. ChatGPT now accomplishes various complex tasks at lightning speeds I never imagined possible just a year ago.Image by the author.As social work students, you might wonder how these technological advancements can impact your educational experience. AI can revolutionize how you learn, research, and engage with the complex challenges of social work. Large language models can do much more than generate or re-write text. You can use these models to summarize lengthy policy documents, analyze quantitative and qualitative data, generate insights for program evaluation, automate routine functions in a community organization, create marketing materials, build web applications and websites — and many more.I’m convinced that you can enhance your learning experience and open doors to new professional experiences by developing a solid foundation in the understanding of AI technology and the skills to use them effectively. At the same time, these models pose significant challenges and risks to your learning and career without the right mindset, training, and experience.This article is the first part of a series that aims to provide MSW students a starting point for learning about and building competencies in AI technologies, emphasizing large language models. This first article provides a broad overview of different applications of generative AI in social work, along with an initial discussion of ethical issues that will continue in the subsequent articles. The forthcoming topics include:Part II: Essential knowledge, abilities, and practices with AIPart III: Strategies for enhancing your educational experience with AIPart IV: The art and science of prompt engineeringApplications of Generative AI in Social WorkGenerative AI tools are emerging as a transformative force in various fields, including business, medicine, and law. Although AI technologies are just starting to get attention in social work, now is the ideal time for students to think actively about leveraging this tool to enhance and streamline service delivery, empower vulnerable populations, and foster more equitable outcomes.I’m providing a few examples outlining how we can use generative AI. These examples are not comprehensive or fully representative of what generative AI can do. Keep in mind that the landscape of AI-enabled technologies is vast and ever-evolving. According to Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, AI’s power doubles every six months.Mental Health ServicesOne promising application of large language models in the field of social work lies within mental health services. Virtual therapy assistants, powered by AI, can offer support and guidance to clients between therapy sessions or when a social worker is not immediately available. For example, virtual assistants could help clients practice coping strategies, provide psychoeducation, or offer brief stress-reduction interventions. These would be assistants that could support various tasks but would not replace social workers.Large language models can assist social workers in better understanding their clients’ language patterns. By analyzing text-based communication or transcriptions of therapy sessions, AI can identify patterns, themes, and sentiments that may provide valuable insights into a client’s emotional state, challenges, and progress in therapy. For instance, AI could help detect signs of depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues by analyzing a client’s word choices, tone, or expression of emotions.Another practical application of large language models is streamlining the documentation process. Social workers can benefit from tools that help manage extensive paperwork demands, such as writing case notes, treatment plans, and progress reports, which can be time-consuming and detract from the time spent with clients. By leveraging AI, social workers can reduce the time and effort spent on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on direct client care and improving the overall quality of mental health services.Program AdministrationGenerative language models can play a significant role in improving program administration within social work organizations. Managing and coordinating social work programs involve a lot of writing-intensive tasks, such as drafting reports, creating and updating training materials, and communicating with stakeholders. AI-powered tools can help generate text using raw data and existing templates as a starting point for these tasks. By automating the initial drafting process, social workers can save time and focus on refining and tailoring content to ensure it accurately reflects the program’s impact and outcomes.This type of support can lead to more efficient reporting and better communication of program results to stakeholders, funders, and policymakers. Large language models can also assist in developing and updating training materials for social work programs. By analyzing existing content and incorporating new research or best practices, AI can suggest revisions and additions to training materials that ensure they remain up-to-date and effective.Policy AnalysisGenerative AI can be a valuable asset for social workers engaged in policy analysis, a crucial aspect of the social work profession that involves reviewing, critiquing, and developing policies to address social issues. Policy analysis often requires social workers to navigate complex and lengthy policy documents, which can be time-consuming and challenging. Large language models can help social workers synthesize and evaluate policy documents more efficiently. By extracting critical information and summarizing the main points, AI-powered tools can enable social workers to quickly grasp the essentials of a policy without having to read through the entire document. This workflow can save time and allow social workers to focus on analyzing the policy’s implications, strengths, and weaknesses.Another useful application of generative AI in policy analysis is its ability to identify gaps and opportunities in existing policies. By analyzing and comparing multiple policy documents, AI can recognize patterns, trends, and areas where policies may be lacking or inconsistent. AI can help social workers pinpoint areas that require further attention or new approaches to address unmet needs. In addition, large language models can assist social workers in generating policy recommendations based on the identified gaps and opportunities. By drawing on a vast knowledge base, AI can suggest evidence-based solutions and best practices for policy development.Program EvaluationProgram evaluation often requires social workers to analyze large amounts of qualitative and quantitative data to determine a program’s success and identify improvement areas. Large language models can assist social workers in analyzing program data more efficiently and generating insights that may take time to be apparent. For example, AI-powered tools can help analyze qualitative data, such as interviews and focus groups, by identifying participants’ themes, patterns, and sentiments. Thus AI-powered tools can provide social workers with valuable information about the experiences and perspectives of clients and other stakeholders, which can inform program improvements.Similarly, AI can analyze quantitative data, such as program outcome measures, by identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies. By automating the initial stages of data analysis, social workers can focus on interpreting the results and applying their expertise to make data-driven decisions and recommendations.By leveraging the insights generated by AI-powered data analysis, social workers can assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their programs and identify areas for improvement. Large language models can also help social workers explore alternative strategies and interventions by suggesting evidence-based practices and generating potential solutions based on the analysis of similar programs or situations.Moreover, generative AI can assist in communicating evaluation findings by generating clear, concise, and accessible reports that effectively convey the results and recommendations to various stakeholders. Such processes help ensure that program evaluation findings are understood and acted upon, ultimately leading to better outcomes for clients and communities.Community OrganizingGenerative AI can play a significant role in supporting community organizing efforts. A critical aspect of community organizing is effective communication and outreach to mobilize individuals, groups, and organizations around a shared goal or issue.Large language models can help social workers create targeted, engaging, and culturally-sensitive messages that resonate with diverse audiences. By tailoring messages based on different community members’ preferences, language, and concerns, AI-powered tools can improve the effectiveness of outreach campaigns and help build stronger connections with community members. Additionally, AI can assist in identifying trends and emerging issues in online conversations and social media, allowing social workers to stay informed and responsive to the community’s needs and priorities.Generative AI can also help streamline collaboration and resource management in community organizing efforts. By automating the creation and updating of shared documents, tracking progress on tasks, and coordinating schedules, AI-powered tools can save time and improve the overall efficiency of organizing initiatives. Furthermore, social workers and community organizers can use AI to analyze data on community resources and needs, which enables them to identify gaps and opportunities for collaboration. This support, in turn, allows social workers to make informed decisions about resource allocation and partnerships to maximize the impact of their efforts.Generative AI can provide valuable assistance in community organizing by helping develop advocacy materials and policy proposals. This practical application involves AI-powered tools analyzing existing policies, research, and best practices to help social workers create persuasive, evidence-based materials that accurately convey the community’s needs and priorities. Social workers and community organizers can use these materials to engage policymakers, funders, and other stakeholders in their advocacy efforts to promote systemic change.International Social WorkGenerative AI can be a valuable tool in international social work, where professionals often face the challenges of language barriers and cultural differences. With their advanced natural language processing capabilities, large language models can help social workers communicate more effectively with diverse populations by providing real-time translations and generating culturally-sensitive messages.Large language models can improve cross-cultural understanding and facilitate collaboration between social workers and the communities they serve. In international social work, staying informed about global trends, emerging issues, and best practices that can inform interventions and policy recommendations is crucial. Generative AI can help social workers access and analyze vast amounts of information from different sources, countries, and languages. By synthesizing this information, AI-powered tools can provide social workers valuable insights and evidence-based strategies to address complex social issues across different contexts.Generative AI can help foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among social work professionals in different countries and settings. AI-powered tools can help social workers share their expertise, learn from one another, and develop innovative solutions that transcend national and cultural boundaries by facilitating communication, generating summaries of research and reports, and identifying common challenges and opportunities.International social work often involves designing, implementing, and evaluating programs and interventions across various cultural, social, and political contexts. Generative AI can support these efforts by helping social workers analyze contextual factors, identify locally-relevant strategies, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in different settings. By providing data-driven insights and recommendations, AI can empower social workers to adapt and improve their programs to serve diverse communities better and address global social challenges.Generative AI presents promising opportunities in social work; however, acknowledging this technology’s imperfections is crucial. By carefully navigating potential benefits and drawbacks, we can ensure responsible and ethical use in supporting vulnerable communities.An imperfect image of a computer generated by GPT-4Ethical ConsiderationsAI tools are not impartial and can perpetuate biases, exacerbating systemic discrimination. Consequently, vigilance is necessary when addressing ethical concerns and implications surrounding AI integration in our work. Ethical consideration is paramount in social work, as AI can influence decisions that impact people’s lives.Social workers must evaluate the ethical consequences of implementing AI, ensuring alignment with the profession’s core values: social justice, respect for human dignity, and ethical responsibility. Moreover, social workers have a crucial role in advocating for protecting vulnerable populations affected by AI, such as individuals with disabilities, marginalized communities, and children and youth. As an introduction to a broader conversation, I emphasize two practical discussion points related to the ethics of AI.Understanding and addressing model biasGenerative AI and large language models learn from lots of data, which can include biases. In social work, we need to anticipate and protect against these biases to avoid causing harm with their use. Social workers should carefully monitor biases in biases in AI-created content, carefully checking outputs that could support stereotypes, spread false information, or show other biases.The intimate connection between AI ethics and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion becomes apparent when examining their shared goal of tackling bias in AI systems. Minimizing the likelihood of biases emerging in AI model creation and implementation requires the participation of people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Encouraging better representation and participation of underrepresented and marginalized communities in the AI development process allows social work organizations and professionals to support more inclusive practices.This strategy nurtures ethical AI practices and helps ensure that AI tools are better suited to address the diverse needs and experiences of various client groups and communities. AI designers can incorporate diverse perspectives and insights to understand better and serve the unique requirements of a broad range of individuals. This inclusive approach improves the overall quality of AI applications and helps build trust and foster collaboration between AI developers and the communities they serve. Ultimately, this leads to more effective, equitable, and beneficial AI solutions.Privacy, Confidentiality, and TransparencyWhen incorporating generative AI into social work practice, safeguarding client privacy and confidentiality is crucial. AI-powered tools for data analysis, report generation, or client communication must comply with stringent data protection standards and relevant privacy laws. Secure storage and transfer, and anonymization are essential to deter unauthorized access. Social workers should review AI-generated content to uphold confidentiality and professional ethics.Transparency is an essential ethical aspect when using generative AI. Social workers need to communicate openly with clients and stakeholders regarding the potential impact of AI-powered tools. Transparency involves explaining how the AI contributes to care, discussing benefits and limitations, and addressing concerns. Moreover, developers and social work organizations must strive for clarity in AI algorithm development and usage. They should aim for AI tools with transparent decision-making processes that enable social workers and stakeholders to understand and evaluate them. This approach encourages responsible, and ethical AI use while fostering trust among social workers, clients, and the community.Next stepsAs we’ve explored in this introductory article, generative AI, specifically large language models, can fundamentally transform social work students’ educational experience and enhance the practice of professionals in the field. From mental health services and program administration to policy analysis, program evaluation, and community organizing, AI technologies offer innovative tools and resources that can augment the capabilities of social workers.To effectively utilize AI in social work, we must focus on combining content expertise with technical skills. While AI-powered tools can perform routine tasks more efficiently than social workers, it is crucial to understand that AI cannot replace social workers. Instead, AI can assist social workers by handling mundane tasks and freeing their time to focus on issues requiring human intervention. In other words, social workers have unique skills that AI lacks.Students and professionals alike must approach these technologies responsibly and ethically. Developing a deep understanding of large language models, their training data, and limitations and honing essential skills like prompt engineering can help users harness the power of AI while mitigating potential inaccuracies and biases. I’ll cover some of these topic areas in subsequent articles in this series.I’m a Professor of Social Work at the University of Michigan, interested in preparing students and helping non-profit organizations use data and information technologies to work smarter, not harder.

This picture taken on January 23, 2023 in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows screens displaying the logos of OpenAI and ChatGPT, a conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI.









On one side of the conflict, generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) and other forms of artificial intelligence promise massive productivity and corporate profits, and on the other, confusion, mistrust and the probability of loss of power and control by the masses.
Generative AI is a foundational technology. It refers to AI that can generate original audio, code, images, text, videos, speech and more. AI has become more tangible to the common man and its impact on jobs and life is more visible. Generative AI is making room for itself in the realm of creativity — which was historically monopolized by humans. The technology utilizes mass inputs (ingested data) and experiences (individual interactions with users) to create a base of knowledge. It then “learns” new information constantly in order to generate entirely new and novel content.


  

Some call the ChatGPT-like tools the new frontier for a gold rush. According to research, “AI could take the jobs of as many as one billion people globally and make 375 million jobs obsolete over the next decade.” But on the other hand, it can generate over $15.7 trillion by 2030. From 2017 to 2022, venture capital investment levels in early-stage generative AI companies have quadrupled and the investment growth expectations are significantly higher for years to come. 
The reach and impact of generative AI could be bigger than the internet, cell phones and cloud computing. Its potential is more comparable to the invention of hunting tools, the wheel and the alphabet. It can influence our society and behavior more significantly than the industrial revolution or the Renaissance. 
But I question if we are ready to meet the challenge.AdChoicesADVERTISING
Machines that can go across most industries and functions, provide novel content and work quickly and more knowledgeably than humans challenge people’s power and social worth. The entity that has the speed and capacity advantage, that can gain unlimited access to all human-generated information from day one and can get smarter faster than any individual is powerful. 
The existentialist question becomes why am I here and what is my purpose if not going to work from 9 to 5 to earn a living? Would I need to serve the machine in the future and how would I make a living? 
Elon Musk predicts that AI-driven technologies could power the workforce in the future, saying, “There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation.” Does that mean in a few decades each company will only have one customer — the government? Won’t that challenge the fundamentals of capitalism or at a minimum require an entirely different social safety net? 


  

We are entering an era of “abnormal” that requires different thinking both at an individual and a societal level. 
Sam Altman, the maker of ChatGPT, reportedly said the “good case [for A.I.] is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a crazy person talking about it.” He added: “I think the worst case is lights out for all of us.”
Some fears are indeed justified and not entirely unfounded, others are rooted in our inability to see a future that is not necessarily an extension of the past. 

AI machines learn from humans’ past behaviors and decisions (data); they also inherit our biases. So, if machines can act and learn faster, they will potentially magnify our systematic biases. The biases that drive fake news and divisions. The biases that impact how we judge and treat each other. Biases that may drive wars, famine, racism, sexism and more. So, unless we face our biases, we may be looking at a future that is much more divisive as machines act on our behalf. 
But should we fear ourselves and our biases or the machine that is only replicating them? 
Concerned with cheating, schools are pushing back on students’ use of ChatGPT. The Department of Education in New York City as well as officials in Seattle, Baltimore and Los Angeles are also concerned with plagiarism. Is backing off of the use of generative AI legitimate, or is it time for schools to get our students to learn to apply their talents and use technology differently? 


  

Some of my fellow professors at the University of Southern California conducted very informal research and concluded that ChatGPT can answer exam questions for undergrads to an A-level. The challenge is if the basic questions can be addressed by machines, should we not re-think what we are asking students to learn and how? If we have cars to drive us around, should we still train horses for transportation purposes? 
No doubt, we need regulations that shield us during this large-scale worldwide change. Regulations that guide us toward partnership with the machines and not censorship of their capabilities and promises. We also need corporations to be alert to biases and aware of possible rogue behavior by machines. 
But most importantly, we need a global mind shift that gives us all the courage to leave the past behind and embrace a future of flux. 


  

It is time for massive change and growth. A time to think differently about our future and our relationship with machines. As opposed to viewing the relationship from the lens of slave and master, we should look at it from a partnership perspective. Indeed, guard rails are needed, but machines will only replicate our biases, and students only cheat if we measure them by what they have memorized or predefined procedures.  
We should have the courage to let technology take over mundane processes and let machines coordinate routine future actions. Then, we will have the opportunity to conceive our next future. A future that relies on our collective mental evolution. A future that offers us the luxury to concentrate on innovation and creation. A future that we have not even imagined or are at all prepared for. 
The bottom line, we are entering an era of “abnormal.” An era that offers a fundamental change in our evolutionary path — from physical to mental. There will be unprecedented challenges to overcome, from the way we make a living and receive healthcare to our expectations of the government. From the way we buy, sell, travel and learn to the way we spend our days, define intellectual property and seek legal protections.

Generative AI&nbsp;is a foundational technology. It refers to AI that can generate original audio, code, images, text, videos, speech and more. AI has become more tangible to the common man and its impact on jobs and life is more visible. Generative AI is making room for itself in the realm of creativity — which was historically monopolized by humans. The technology utilizes mass inputs (ingested data) and experiences (individual interactions with users) to create a base of knowledge. It then “learns” new information constantly in order to generate entirely new and novel content. Some call the ChatGPT-like tools the new frontier for a gold rush. According to research, “AI could take the jobs of as many as one billion people globally and make 375 million jobs obsolete over the next decade.” But on the other hand, it can generate over $15.7 trillion by 2030. From 2017 to 2022, venture capital investment levels in early-stage generative AI companies have quadrupled and the investment growth expectations are significantly higher for years to come.  The reach and impact of generative AI could be bigger than the internet, cell phones and cloud computing. Its potential is more comparable to the invention of hunting tools, the wheel and the alphabet. It can influence our society and behavior more significantly than the industrial revolution or the Renaissance.&nbsp; But I question if we are ready to meet the challenge. Machines that can go across most industries and functions, provide novel content and work quickly and more knowledgeably than humans challenge people’s power and social worth. The entity that has the speed and capacity advantage, that can gain unlimited access to all human-generated information from day one and can get smarter faster than any individual is powerful.&nbsp; The existentialist question becomes why am I here and what is my purpose if not going to work from 9 to 5 to earn a living? Would I need to serve the machine in the future and how would I make a living?&nbsp; Elon Musk predicts that AI-driven technologies could power the workforce in the future,&nbsp;saying, “There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation.” Does that mean in a few decades each company will only have one customer — the government? Won’t that challenge the fundamentals of capitalism or at a minimum require an entirely different social safety net?&nbsp; We are entering an era of “abnormal” that requires different thinking both at an individual and a societal level.&nbsp; Sam Altman, the maker of ChatGPT, reportedly&nbsp;said&nbsp;the “good case [for A.I.] is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a crazy person talking about it.” He added:&nbsp;“I think the worst case is lights out for all of us.” Some fears are indeed justified and not entirely unfounded, others are rooted in our inability to see a future that is not necessarily an extension of the past.&nbsp; AI machines learn from humans’ past behaviors and decisions (data); they also inherit our biases. So, if machines can act and learn faster, they will potentially magnify our systematic biases. The biases that drive fake news and divisions. The biases that impact how we judge and treat each other. Biases that may drive wars, famine, racism, sexism and more.&nbsp;So, unless we face our biases, we may be looking at a future that is much more divisive as machines act on our behalf.&nbsp; But should we fear ourselves and our biases or the machine that is only replicating them?&nbsp; Concerned with cheating, schools are&nbsp;pushing back&nbsp;on students’ use of ChatGPT. The Department of Education in New York City as well as officials in Seattle,&nbsp;Baltimore and Los Angeles&nbsp;are also concerned with plagiarism. Is backing off of the use of generative AI legitimate, or is it time for schools to get our students to learn to apply their talents and use technology differently?&nbsp; Some of my fellow professors at the University of Southern California conducted very informal research and concluded that ChatGPT can answer exam questions for undergrads to an A-level. The challenge is if the basic questions can be addressed by machines, should we not re-think what we are asking students to learn and how? If we have cars to drive us around, should we still train horses for transportation purposes?&nbsp; No doubt, we need regulations that shield us during this large-scale worldwide change. Regulations that guide us toward partnership with the machines and not censorship of their capabilities and promises. We also need corporations to be alert to biases and aware of possible rogue behavior by machines.&nbsp; But most importantly, we need a global mind shift that gives us all the courage to leave the past behind and embrace a future of flux.&nbsp; It is time for massive change and growth. A time to think differently about our future and our relationship with machines. As opposed to viewing the relationship from the lens of slave and master, we should look at it from a partnership perspective. Indeed, guard rails are needed, but machines will only replicate our biases, and students only cheat if we measure them by what they have memorized or predefined procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp; We should have the courage to let technology take over mundane processes and let machines coordinate routine future actions. Then, we will have the opportunity to conceive our next future. A future that relies on our collective mental evolution. A future that offers us the luxury to concentrate on innovation and creation. A future that we have not even imagined or are at all prepared for.&nbsp; The bottom line, we are entering an era of “abnormal.” An era that offers a fundamental change in our evolutionary path — from physical to mental. There will be unprecedented challenges to overcome, from the way we make a living and receive healthcare to our expectations of the government. From the way we buy, sell, travel and learn to the way we spend our days, define intellectual property and seek legal protections.&nbsp; Sid Mohasseb is an adjunct professor in Dynamic Data-Driven Strategy at the University of Southern California and is a former national strategic innovation leader for strategy at KPMG.

Peter Gabriel on artificial intelligence: “I don’t think my job or anyone’s job is safe from AI”
""This is something that's going have way more impact than the Industrial Revolution""

Peter Gabriel has opined on the growing prominence of artificial intelligence, noting that neither his nor anyone’s job is safe.

In a discussion with Yahoo! Music about his tech company Reverberation, Gabriel discussed the need to anticipate what AI technology could be capable of. “I’m probably just as scared [of AI] as everybody else, but I like to jump in the river rather than talk about it. … I do think about it quite a lot, and I think not enough people are thinking about it,” he said.
“And it would be great to get ahead [of it]. You know, this is something that’s going have way more impact than the Industrial Revolution and the nuclear bomb. So, if we don’t start anticipating what it might do, it’s going to be too late, because it’s very fast.”
Gabriel then turned to the topic of whether music generated by AI could ever have the emotional effect of songs written by human artists. “Most people argue no; I would say they just need better algorithms,” Gabriel said, adding that there will probably be algorithms for human spirit one day.
Advertisement “So, we might as well just grab the algorithms and dance with them, rather than fight them. Unfortunately, I don’t think my job or anyone’s job is safe from AI,” he added.
“The way to look at it, though, is this amazing toolkit is just coming into our possession and we could do all sorts of extraordinary things, including perhaps – and I do say ‘perhaps’ – protecting our future.”
In February, Gabriel released a new song titled ‘The Court (Dark-Side Mix)’. The single was the second to be taken from his upcoming album ‘i/o’, and features contributions from Brian Eno as well as backing vocals from his daughter, Melanie Gabriel.

Addressing Gender Bias to Achieve Ethical AI

March 17, 2023by Ardra Manasi, Subadra Panchanadeswaran, and Emily Sours

The sixty-seventh session of the Commission on the Status of Women  (CSW67) is currently taking place at the cusp of many intertwining realities—a world still reeling under the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening climate change crisis, rising inflation, emerging authoritarianism, armed conflicts. Meanwhile, new and fast-moving technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI)—such as ChatGPT—are expected to transform many aspects of our lives and livelihoods, with consequences that are hard to predict. Amid this confluence of forces, some old and stubborn realities persist. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), it will take another 132 years to achieve gender equality on a global scale. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with other concurrent shocks, has reversed the gains for gender equality from the previous years.In the context of CSW67’s priority theme of “innovation and technological change,” closing the gender gap seems even more pertinent, owing to the inherent gender inequities in the technology landscape. For the past 20 years, a substantive gender gap relating to women’s participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and careers has been pointed out. Studies show that women are still largely underrepresented in fields such as computing, digital information technology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Labor market economists attribute this to the disproportionate burden that women bear in terms of differences in human capital, domestic responsibilities, and employment-related discrimination.The field of AI is no different. According to 2019 estimates from UNESCO, only 12 percent of AI researchers are women, and they “represent only six percent of software developers and are 13 times less likely to file an ICT (information, communication, and technology) patent than men.” These facts lead one to pose a natural question: how does this gap in representation manifest in the very technologies that are built?Understanding Bias in AI

While there are different uses of artificial intelligence, such as scanning imaging for signs of cancer, the most commonly known are through AI devices that are ubiquitous in homes and workplaces. Through increased digitization, the COVID-19 pandemic has further contributed to their all-pervading nature. Due to COVID-19, 55 percent of companies have accelerated their AI adoption plans to address the skills deficiencies in various industries. However, the impact of such developments on women and their labor force participation, among other considerations, is yet to be carefully studied and documented.

Gender bias in AI can occur at various stages: in the algorithm’s development process; in the training of datasets; and in AI-generated decision-making. AI applications are run via algorithms, which are a set of instructions for problem solving. Computationally, this process involves transforming input data into output data. To this end, the kind of data that gets inputted can directly influence the subsequent decision-making in algorithms. Thus, if the data originally contain certain biases, this can get replicated by the algorithms, which in turn when used for prolonged periods of time can reinforce these biases in decision-making. To this end, the subjective choices made during the selection, collection, or preparation of data sets can play a role in determining potential biases. This is evident in many branches of AI such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), where “word embeddings” can lead to linguistic biases resulting from sexism, racism, or ableism. For example, while selecting top candidates during a hiring process, Amazon’s automated resume screening system discriminated against women. The data used to train the recruitment model was informed by resume samples from a 10-year period, where women were underrepresented. The resume screening model thus used “linguistic signals” associated with successful male candidates. Once the bias was discovered, Amazon discarded this model.Feminization and Domestication of AIPast research shows how gendered divisions are naturalized and reproduced through technology. To begin with, technology often gets equated with “men’s power,” while women and girls are portrayed as less technologically skilled and less interested than their male counterparts. Such stereotypes can contribute to the gender gap in women’s participation in related fields.The tendency to feminize AI tools mimics, and reinforces, the structural hierarchies and stereotypes in society, which is premised on preassigned gender roles. The gendering of AI can occur in multiple ways—through voice, appearance, or the use of female names or pronouns. Home-based virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri were given default feminine voices (Apple and Google have since offered alternatives aimed at “diversification” or “neutrality.”) As UNESCO points out, these devices were designed to have “submissive personalities” and stereotypically feminine attributes, such as being “helpful, intelligent, intuitive.” However, as evident from the case of IBM’s Watson, which used a masculine voice while working with physicians on cancer treatment, male voices have been preferred for tasks that involved teaching and instruction, as they were perceived to be “authoritarian and assertive.” Among these applications, Google Assistant is the only one that did not bear a “gendered name,” however its default voice is female.Gender stereotypes and inequalities can be further reinforced through divisions in occupational roles taken up by these new technologies, as evident in the case of robots. “Male” robots have been deemed more appropriate for security-related jobs, whereas, when Japan launched its first hotel with robot receptionists in 2015, most of these robots were “female.” And while much has been made of the threat that robots and, most recently, emerging AI chatbots present to employment, the sectors that have witnessed increased “robotization” in recent years are those dominated by women—and disproportionately impacted by the pandemic—such as hospitality and tourism, retail, healthcare, and education. In 2022, UNESCO published a report on the Effects of AI on the Working Lives of Women, which stated how AI is changing the landscape of work leading to new skill demands, and how women should not be left behind due to these advancements.Domesticated and feminized forms of AI are also increasingly performing the “affective labor” that is conventionally expected of women. The gendered (and often invisible) work of “affective labor” involves producing, managing, or modifying emotions in others, and can comprise a range of activities such as “caring, listening, comforting, reassuring, [and] smiling.” Past research has shed light on how affective labor has been particularly associated with women of color and migrant domestic workers, where patterns of “domination and invisibility” exist in their relationship with respect to a white household. Home-based virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri perform affective labor by managing both data and emotions. And voice interfaces are primarily designed to perform tasks such as “scheduling, reminding, making lists, seeking information, taking notes, making calls, and sending messages.” Moreover, as opposed to the lived realities of women, the fact that virtual assistants are unaffected by stress or other external factors turns them into a product of “fantasy.”Similarly, the humanization of virtual assistants and robots can also allow for the dehumanization and objectification of women. For example, the humanoid robot “Sophia” was made to look “exceptionally attractive,” evoking a sense of “mechanico-eroticism.” Similarly, humanoid robots are often given “Asian or Caucasian features” and are “hypersexualized.” As a result, the various forms of gender-based violence (GBV) and harassment that women and girls face in both private and public spheres are also mirrored in how feminized forms of AI are treated. In a stark example, the developers of Alexa had to enable a “disengagement mode” as a result of the tool being subjected to verbal harassment within households.Addressing Gender Bias in AI: The Way ForwardThe adoption of AI is currently occurring at an unprecedented pace. In the absence of normative frameworks to guide the development and use of AI, breakthroughs like ChatGPT pose ethical concerns. In 2020, at the virtually held UNESCO’s Global Dialogue on Gender Equality and AI, participants observed that AI normative instruments or principles that successfully address gender equality as a standalone issue were “either inexistent or current practices were insufficient.” Though it is promising to see conversations at the UN on the need to develop a framework for ethical AI around its own AI use, the extent to which gender bias figures in these policy discussions is yet to be studied and explored.To address these policy gaps, it is critical to identify where gender bias in AI shows up. As algorithms are heavily influenced by the data it uses, biases can stem from how data is collected, stored, and processed. Another possible source is whoever is writing the algorithms, and what guidelines the AI is following, as AI tends to reflect the inherent assumptions and prejudices of its software programmers. Since AIs featuring female characteristics are predominantly developed by men, they mirror their ideas about women, underscoring the need for increasing women’s participation in STEM education and careers. However, studies show how women in STEM careers face unique challenges. For example, globally, half of women scientists are subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace. Thus, alongside increasing women’s participation in STEM careers (including in AI), employers should develop support structures to address these challenges, including putting in place zero-tolerance policies for gender-based violence in the workplace and ways to monitor and enforce them.There are promising practices on how AI can be used to address gender inequalities. For example, AI-powered gender decoders can inform gender-sensitive employment hiring processes. There are also examples of how developers are increasingly conscious of the gendered impact of AI, especially among young users. These kinds of successes can be achieved through a “human-centered AI” approach which is developed with the user in mind. In addition, “fundamental rights impact assessments” can be employed during the application of output from algorithms to identify biases, which result in discrimination around “gender, age, ethnic origin, religion and sexual or political orientation.” According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), algorithms should be audited in the form of “discrimination testing” or “situation testing in real-life situations” to eliminate any form of discrimination. In 2017, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that outlined a normative framework to address biases resulting from the use of technology, including the threat of discrimination resulting from the use of algorithms.Ethical AI involves taking an intersectional approach when addressing questions around gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other determinants, in addition to adopting a human rights-based approach to AI governance premised on transparency, accountability, and human dignity. To this end, different stakeholders, including business and corporate entities, tech companies, academia, UN entities, civil society organizations, media, and other relevant actors should come together and explore joint solutions. The UN secretary-general’s proposal for a Global Digital Compact to be agreed at the Summit of the Future in September 2024 is a right step in this direction. The Global Digital Compact should also delve into potential gender biases perpetuated by AI and solutions to address this. For AI to be ethical and be a vehicle for the common good, it needs to eliminate any explicit and implicit biases, including on the gender front.Ardra Manasi works as the Global Program Manager at The Center for Innovation in Worker Organization (CIWO) at Rutgers University.

Tech   Great Reasons You Should Get A Job In Artificial Intelligence ByFossbytes Jobs 
March 21, 2023March 21, 2023          Are we living in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Possibly.  In the last few years, artificial intelligence has begun to gradually penetrate our work and personal lives. According to the International Federation of Robotics, there has been a 14% increase year-on-year in the number of automated jobs, with junior workers the most affected.           Since the beginning of 2023, things have been ramping up even further thanks, in most part, to OpenAI. The company currently has two generative AI programs, Dall-E which will produce an image of your choice, and ChatGPT, which creates a written piece of content on a given topic, tailor-made to your instructions.        Right now, we’re seeing other companies scramble to keep up. Google is working on its alternative to ChatGPT called Bard. There is also a program called Jukebox that generates “new” songs. Meanwhile, Snapchat is releasing a bot called My AI. With all this progression in AI capabilities, it’s not really surprising that this technology sector is being hailed as a future-proof tech career with plenty of prospects; the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31.4% increase in jobs for data scientists and mathematical science professionals––which are crucial to AI––by 2030.  Let’s find out more.  Where can I work? One of the most exciting things about AI is that the possibilities are truly endless, as it has so many applications.         Artificial intelligence can be used to help healthcare workers diagnose and treat diseases. It can also support governments as they plan public transport infrastructure. In the future, it could even be used to build robot bees to help pollinate crops. As we move to a fully AI-supported world, roles will be available in every single sector.   What jobs should I look out for? As the industry matures, jobs in AI will not only grow in number but also complexity and diversity. This will open doors for various professionals—junior, senior, researchers, statisticians, practitioners, and experimental scientists, for example. What about pay? Jobs in this sector tend to pay well. Of course, salary will differ from role to role, but the top paying states for AI pay (according to talent.com) are New York ($200,000), Maryland ($171,300), and Virginia ($170,000).     What skills do I need? Most AI job descriptions online will expect at least a Bachelor’s degree. However, as the talent gap continues to grow, organizations can no longer reject employees without a college degree if they have demonstrable skills and experience in artificial intelligence. Key skills to work on include machine learning, natural language processing, data science, computing, robotics, and problem-solving.

Microsoft is adding Microsoft 365 Copilot into its office productivity applications. Who doesn’t remember Mr. Scott in Star Trek 4: The Voyager Home sitting in front of a computer trying to speak with it via to come up with the transparent aluminum formula. Well, we aren’t quite there yet but the momentum is definitely headed in that direction. As I alluded to in an earlier take, Microsoft is headed down the path of turning its every day users into power users coupled with offering them greater skills at a more rapid rate translating into productivity improvements.


Generative AI promises to transform how we work on nearly every level, saving time but also enhancing what we’re able to create on our own. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is embedded directly into 365 apps like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook, making generative AI intuitive and easy to harness thanks to GPT-4 and large language models (LLMs). Let’s take a brief look at Microsoft’s infusion of Copilot across the Office suite.

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel
For lack of better words, Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Copilot is exactly what Microsoft Excel should be for the mainstream corporate world. Not every user is the quantitative type who knows the ins and outs of formulas. In fact, for those who worked in the corporate world for many years, they know that there were always those handful of gurus (or super users) throughout the company that you can call up (you owe them many lunches) how to calculate something for some analysis you’re performing along with the perfect graph to illustrate your data in a presentation.

PROMOTED
A favorite quote of mine is from Albert Einstein. “Genius is making complex ideas simple, not making simple ideas complex.” In our view, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel is the embodiment of that idea and the proverbial sherpa helping you gather and analyze the complex and turning it into more childlike games where you can spend more time interpreting, unlocking creativity and coming up with more inventive solutions. Why do we feel that way? Well, one of the great examples that Microsoft illustrated with Microsoft Copilot was taking a table of data and seamlessly turning it into a pivot table allowing you to ask it to perform various types of analysis on-the-fly calculating everything and graphing it for you. Also, you can ask it for more color about what changed.

Fundamentally, you have your business analyst or operational mathematics sherpa sitting next to you – Scotty would be proud.

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word
To further unlock productivity, Microsoft also added Copilot to Word. This tool can write, summarize and edit automatically with a simple prompt. Using a command like, “Write a two-page draft based on the following outline,” or “Make the introductory paragraph more casual,” Copilot can write entire documents for you, saving incredible amounts of time and (depending how much you enjoy writing) stress. In essence, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Microsoft Word is also acting like an editor, market researcher and strategic marketer all at once while you are editing a document which is incredible.

Exploring The “Copilot Future”
It is abundantly clear what artificial intelligence or the power of Power of large language models (LLMs) can do. For me, this is the time when AI gets exciting, and I love seeing Microsoft (and the industry at large) take so many leaps in the past month alone to bring these new capabilities to the marketplace. The news comes not long after Microsoft announced continued partnership with OpenAI, the creator of the trending AI chatbot ChatGPT that was recently added to Microsoft’s Bing search engine. It will be interesting to see how these advancements make a difference in the way we work, but it is all but certain that they will make us more productive.
We think we are in the “very early innings” (we need to underscore very early) of how Microsoft plans on weaving artificial intelligence into its enterprise and office productivity applications. And you can be sure Google, Salesforce, Amazon and others will follow suit with an “Infuse generative AI in everything” approach. Moreover, what this latest set of capabilities does is it turns novice users into power users at a more rapid rate to help organizations accelerate productivity and do more with less. And while it is certain that the suggestions in some of the applications won’t be entirely accurate from the start, the answers will be “usefully wrong” as Microsoft put it, helping employees move a project forward regardless. Continued use and reinforcement learning will eventually turn them from usefully wrong to just useful.
Based on what I’m observing, it makes sense that Microsoft will continue to profile and innovate at the division (e.g., marketing, purchasing, finance, etc.) and job function levels, looking at day-to-day activities and critical metrics and figuring out ways to customize and improve them. We are at the beginning of a very fast paced generative AI revolution and it’s only going to continue to be more useful from here. And yes, we are all trying to reconcile the impact of having more augmentation and the impact it will have on work, and there will be some discomfort before it’s all said and done. But the bottom line is you can’t put the genie back in the bottle. Generative AI will quickly become pervasive, and businesses that embrace the technology will become materially more productive. Workers will become more productive too. And the more everyday office workers can leverage the power of generative AI, the better.

Creative jobs in industries such as marketing, writing, design and art may use AI to dream up ideas. Retail, sales and real estate sectors are trying to determine whether AI can speed up processes and get their products to market. And office workers may consider using it for everyday tasks like responding to emails or providing team updates.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselWork: ReimaginedWith attitudes toward work undergoing a dramatic transformation, this series explores the impact of that shift on everything from the shape of the American workplace to the role work plays in our lives.Read more.End of carouselBut the tools are also creating debates about the ethics of using AI for work and whether generative AI systems could someday do our jobs completely, putting humans out of work.“We’re going to learn about our society’s values and those of the organizations that develop these [tools],” said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who studies artificial intelligence’s impact on work.While many experts say AI isn’t advanced enough to take our jobs just yet, generative AI tools can produce some convincing content. Scroll below to see if you can tell whether AI created these items many professionals work on every day.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementThis is a stunning three-bedroom, two-bathroom Victorian house in the Inner Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco. The renovated 1,600 square foot home has modern amenities, while still maintaining classic charm. The house features new hardwood floors, a spacious kitchen with top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances, and garden bathtubs in the bathrooms. The home also includes a two-car garage and a beautifully landscaped backyard with a garden and patio. The location is ideal, just minutes away from great restaurants, shopping, and parks. This home is listed at $1,000,000 and is an exceptional value in one of San Francisco’s most sought-after neighborhoods.Question 1 of 81. Did AI write this real estate listing?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Write a real estate listing for a three bedroom, two bathroom house in the Inner Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco. The 1,600 square foot Victorian house, built in the 1980s, is renovated with new hardwood floors, a spacious kitchen with an island, and garden bathtubs. It comes with stainless steel appliances including a microwave, gas range, dishwasher, and refrigerator with cold water and ice dispenser. It also has a two-car garage, a small landscaped backyard with a garden, and a patio. The listing price is $1,000,000.""Some work tasks pose more risks than others when it comes to generative AI. In the case of a real estate listing, in which a human inputs the details and uses the AI to create syntax, format and write the filler words, the risk is relatively low, Rahman said. That’s because the AI probably will rely on the data provided versus pulling from its repository of data, which could include misinformation and errors.“You can rely on AI’s ability to crowdsource what works in formatting it and display,” Rahman said. “It’s going to be helpful in that area.”Other areas in which the tech might succeed include creating verbiage for flash sales or social media posts, which might be quick, short, formulaic and easy for AI to replicate.But humans may still want to do a quick read, even for the shortest of items, to make sure the AI didn’t misinterpret the prompt or get details wrong.“A lot of the ways you write up a real estate listing does follow a specific format,” he said. “It’s more programmatic in nature.”That said, humans may still be needed to ensure the listing is accurately represented and that areas a seller wants highlighted come through in the message.Question 2 of 82. Did AI make this product?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""Puffy purple GRWM headband""While generative AI may be a great place for brainstorming ideas, prototyping or even gauging interest in a product, creative professionals may want to pause before manufacturing or selling a product developed by this technology. Two big pitfalls that could arise, Rahman said: using bad data or liability issues.For example, if a company used social media posts to help it determine what’s hot right now, it could end up using data generated from bots versus real users and ultimately create something no one wants. And when it comes to liability, creators have to be careful they’re not creating a product that could be copyrighted or protected. So if a company wants AI to generate a funky set of generic bell bottoms, that could be okay. But if the company asks for a set of bell bottoms with an image of an avocado on them, it might be using an image, or parts of one, copyrighted by an artist.“It does put the onus on the end user to do the homework,” Rahman said. “And if they don’t, it could have downstream consequences.”The issue gets particularly tricky as generative AI tools don’t tell you what they used to generate the result they present. So a professional may not know whether what they’re creating could create liability issues.As technology continues to evolve, businesses are constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency and productivity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game-changing technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we work. ChatGPT is one such AI tool that is poised to play an important role in the future of business and work.ChatGPT is a generative AI tool that uses natural language processing to generate human-like responses to text prompts. This technology can be applied across industries to help people do their work faster and more efficiently. For example, ChatGPT can be used in customer service to automate responses to common inquiries, freeing up employees to focus on more complex issues. It can also be used in content creation, helping writers to generate ideas and inspiration for articles or marketing copy.Question 3 of 83. Did AI write this clip of a sponsored article touting ChatGPT?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Write a sponsored article touting the importance AI will play in the future of business and work. Emphasize ChatGPT as a generative AI tool that can help people across industries do their work faster.""Producing positive-sounding articles about specific brands or products is pretty easy with generative AI tools, Rahman said. But relying on the AI entirely could have costly consequences.First, how well the AI does probably will depend on how much information the prompt includes. Some companies consider AI prompt-writing a job itself, given how complex it can be. But AI systems have the tendency to fill in blanks not provided in the prompt with information from their data sets. And that could mean that a sponsored article promoting a product gets some facts wrong or improperly represents a brand, product or topic.And AI could be influenced by fake information. For example, if AI were asked to create sponsored content for a specific restaurant and the data sets included fake reviews posted on popular sites, the sponsored article could be skewed with false data. And without human review, the article may sound entirely normal, given that generative AI is generally good at syntax, Rahman said.“Everything may sound right, but one line might be inaccurate,” he said. “That could reduce the trust in the brand.”Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementQuestion 4 of 84. Did AI design this marketing logo and slogan?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""A logo with a shoe and a leaf for an eco-friendly shoe brand""As with idea generation for products, professionals might find generative AI helpful in the brainstorming process for creating a logo or slogan. Generative AI tools could also help in communicating ideas.“In being able to explain, ‘This is what I’m thinking for a logo,’ it helps bridge the expertise gap between a lay businessperson and a designer,” Rahman said. “It lowers the barrier.”But given that a brand’s identity is so closely tied with these creative elements, a human probably will need to build on those ideas before solidifying the initial idea, Rahman said. AI might help professionals come up with a catchy phrase they want to use or even a style they want to mimic for the logo. But do those elements reflect a brand’s values and is the logo unique enough to stand out? That’s where human expertise comes in, Rahman said.Professionals will also need to keep in mind possible issues with copyright and trademark infringement. And they may have to use at least a couple of AI tools, as was the case with this example, because image generators often fail at producing text.Dear Hiring Manager,I am writing to express my interest in the administrative assistant position at your company. With five years of experience working for small and large companies, including some in the Fortune 500, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role.I am a self-starter with a friendly disposition who loves to work with others. As a skilled communicator and writer, I am proactive in my approach to work and always strive to improve processes to benefit the team and the company. My proficiency in all Microsoft Office tools, Google Workspace tools, and Zoom will allow me to quickly adapt to your company's needs and hit the ground running.Throughout my career, I have succeeded in training new employees on basic office skills, helped automate several processes to improve customer service, and assisted executives with speech writing. I am happy to help others with projects during my downtime, and I believe in the importance of being a team player to achieve the best results.Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to your team and contribute to the success of your company.Sincerely,Question 5 of 85. Did AI write this cover letter for a job application?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Write a cover letter for me, an accomplished administrative assistant. I have a very friendly disposition, am a self-starter, love to work with others, a skilled communicator and writer and am very proactive. I have five years of experience working as an administrative assistant for small and large companies alike, including some in the Fortune 500. In addition to being a people person, I know the ins and outs of all Microsoft Office tools, Google Workspace tools and Zoom. I am a self-starter, motivated, and happy to help others with projects on my downtime. Previously, I have succeeded in training new employees on basic office skills, helped automate several processes to improve customer service and helped executives with speech writing.""Generative AI could help candidates more easily write a cover letter and even follow some of the best formats to do so, Rahman said. But it also may have a drawback if candidates want to break the mold.“It is relying on what is expected and plausible,” he said. “If you want to stand out in a creative way, it may be less helpful.”Because generative AI is just an advanced predictive text system that uses big swaths of data to pull answers from, it may help candidates who struggle with promoting their successes or writing in a smooth, coherent fashion. It also could help people who struggle with the English language, Rahman said. But if you want your cover letter to look different from what is traditionally expected, Rahman suggests you tweak the AI-generated letter, play with the prompts more or write it yourself.Question 6 of 86. Did AI create this book cover illustration?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""Children’s book cover digital illustration with a happy girl and a puppy""Once again, an issue that could arise from using AI as an illustrator is infringing others’ original work without permission. Photographers and artists have filed lawsuits against some AI image generators over the issue, and if they win, any images created with those models could be considered problematic.But even human illustrators often look to other people’s work as inspiration for things like book covers, Rahman said. So AI is somewhat simulating that, he said. Where we draw the line as to what is considered inspiration and what is stealing is still up for debate. In this case, for example, DALL-E is probably creating a children’s book cover based on what is publicly available.“We’ve seen this play out in the music industry when people use beats from one song and mix them,” he said, adding that music cases often consider how much a song resembles the original work. “We’re going to have to have society decide … [when] we don’t have to give credit.”Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementThe U.S. Constitution is divided into sections outlining the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, as well as the relationship between states and the federal government, the amendment process, and the ratification process. It establishes a system of government based on democracy, federalism, and the separation of powers, and guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms for American citizens.Question 7 of 87. Did AI write this summary of the U.S. Constitution?NoYesIncorrect. GPT-3 wrote this using the following prompt: ""Summarize the sections of the U.S. Constitution""Generative AI generally handles summarization well, especially if you’re feeding it with the data you want summarized, Rahman said. That could have big implications for sectors like law or medicine that rely on literature and documentation. But “the devil is in the details,” he added.The technology may misinterpret some sentences or make inaccurate inferences, for example. It also may generalize elements that could be important to highlight for professionals who need to know a specific medical symptom or inference of a law. And when it comes to legal or medical literature, that could have a massive impact on outcomes.AI transcriptions or summarizations could also change how professionals do their jobs. So if an AI tool is summarizing a patient interaction, a doctor might inadvertently pay less attention to the details the patient is offering, relying more on the technology to pick that up. That could play a role in a doctor’s ultimate determination.“AI does excel in making connections humans don’t necessarily see,” Rahman said. “But you do need a human to verify and understand whether it has validity.”Question 8 of 88. Did AI create this photo?NoYesIncorrect. DALL-E created this image using the following prompt: ""A photograph of a people watching a space launch""Using generative AI to resemble a photograph is tricky. That’s because the creation produced by the AI is a conglomeration of images, so details that would be important in representing the reality of a photo could be distorted.An image created by AI often has a distinct style, and avoids replicating a real photo, Rahman said. Some signs that a realistic image was generated by AI include blurring of specific areas, often in the background; distorted or incomprehensible text; and warped details like a single tooth of a person. Then there are more obvious giveaways like disfigurements of the body or items that magically disappear in half of the photo. In this case, people’s fingers blend together in the image and the man on the left’s arm appears to disappear and not fit to scale. Also, the background audience’s details seem to blur together, almost blending into their environment.While generative AI can’t yet do the job of a photographer, it could serve as a brainstorming ground for photographers who are thinking of ways to conceptualize a photo shoot.You need to answer every question to see your results. You are missing questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.About this storyTo generate the images and text in this story, The Washington Post used AI tools from OpenAI called GPT-3 and DALL-E, using the prompts displayed above.Editing by Yun-Hee Kim, Karly Domb Sadof, Jeff Dooley and Melissa Ngo.

AI-generated media has reached an explosive tipping point. Even before the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT electrified the internet, the research laboratory captured the attention of the art and design world for its generative AI system, DALL-E, allowing anyone to create images of anything their heart desires by simply entering a few words or phrases. 
Over the past months, more than a million users have signed up to use DALL-E beta, and the company is further expanding its reach by offering an API so that creators, developers and businesses can integrate this powerful technology and further explore its creative potential. Meanwhile, AI-generated work continues to disrupt other corners of the cultural landscape, from the six-figure sale of the generative portrait at Christie’s in 2018 to this year’s controversial awarding of a top prize to an AI artwork in a contest for emerging artists.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
The arrival of AI creations in the highest echelons of the art world and the proliferation of user-friendly AI software like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Lensa have renewed debate over creative production and ownership, and prompted attempts to provide practical answers to questions previously relegated to the realm of theory: What differentiates a machine-made painting from a work of art? How do we — as creators, curators, collectors, consumers — assign meaning and value to art? And perhaps most critically, what impact will generative-AI technology have on the future of human creativity and artistic expression?
The instability of art
As Walter Benjamin wrote in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” the modern world’s reproductive and creative technology causes all art to be divorced from its primal, ritualistic and sacred contexts, making the editing and copying and remastering of art a constant feature of art itself, so that in the modern world, art no longer speaks to eternal concepts of beauty and aesthetics but to constant flux and instability that is always mutable and changeable. 
For AI-generated art, this instability is reflected in the liquid, malformed, lo-fi and sometimes unsettling qualities of the works that generative adversarial networks (GANs) produce.
Unsurprisingly, there has been significant backlash from artists and creators, many of whom argue that generative art is plagiaristic and that it threatens human artists’ creative agency and livelihoods. Others, like celebrated designer Jessica Walsh, are less concerned with such anxieties: “There will always be backlash whenever a tool threatens people’s jobs,” says Walsh, “But the reality is that AI is already here, and it will continue to have an exponentially large presence in the creative world.”
In the music industry, for example, digital modification has become the norm: musicians like Brian Eno and Aphex Twin gained notoriety over the past few decades by using tape loops and computers to create ambient or generative music, while sampling is a cornerstone of popular genres of modern music like hip hop, pop and electronic music. In 2022, most of the best-selling artists in pop music used autotune and compression to varying degrees in their music, essentially correcting the organic anomalies of the individual human voice.
Credit where credit is dueadvertisement
Much of the debate has centered on the question of credit and creative authorship: Who is the artist of works produced by an algorithm, written by a coder and remixed with photo editing software? Although we don’t typically credit the underlying tools used to create — such as Photoshop, specific hardware, font foundries or autotune — that standard may already be changing. Many AI-generated artworks even bear the creator’s “signature” — often a garbled string of code or text — in just the same manner as a human artist signs their name to indicate authorship.
The rise of AI-dominated imagery has prompted tech giants like Adobe, Microsoft and Canva to launch their own generative product features — and while the massive image hosting site Getty Images has proclaimed that no AI-produced content will be allowed on its servers, the platform admits that moderation of this policy will rely on users to report images suspected of being “fake.” 
And so, with this swift diffusion of generative AI into creative and commercial landscapes, might we enter a world where a little editing via AI, such as a film photographer editing scans in Lightroom or using filters, becomes so commonplace as to be a subtly coercive requirement of producing art at all? Or, as defenders of generative AI predict, will the technology prove to be empowering for artists, driving creative innovation through increased production capacity and accessibility?advertisement
Another framework through which we might attempt to understand or predict the future social role of AI in creative industries is the debate over the production and consumption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the food we eat. In the same way that we certify the products we consume as being organic, or GMO-free, will there come a day when we declare our creative works as being wholly generated, partially augmented, or crafted with zero digital technology?
Maybe the better question is: Will we be able to tell the difference between AI-generated work and art created by a human — and will we care? A 2017 Rutgers study showed that the majority of participants were unable to distinguish a clear preference for human works over AI-generated ones. Perhaps where taste is concerned, the perceived ability to distinguish AI from human endeavor could be the marker of refinement and distinction.
Where will generative AI art take us?
If we value creativity and that which is inherently human, will we see a day where machine-generated creativity dominates, and purely human-oriented creativity holds a higher cultural and economic value? Or, as with the music industry, will the normalization of AI instead break down the artificial/human creative binary, fundamentally reshaping consumer preferences and public attitudes surrounding the production and consumption of art?
In his almost century-old “Work of Art” essay, Benjamin suggests that it is in the nature of art to outpace the formal limits of the technical paradigm in which it was produced; in that way, art is not a function of technology, but a generative force behind it, driving innovation and desire for a world that does not yet exist.

Adobe Firefly is a Text-To-Image Generator That Didn’t Steal Your Work





Mar 21, 2023





Jaron Schneider






































 Adobe has announced Firefly, what it calls the first in a new family of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models that are focused on creating images and text effects. It launches in beta today.          The company says that Firefly is made up of multiple models that are “tailored to serve customers with a wide array of skillsets and technical backgrounds, working across a variety of different use cases.”  Not Trained on ‘Stolen’ Photos Separating itself from other generative AI, Adobe says that its platform wasn’t built on the back of stolen images, instead, it specifically boasts that Firefly has been trained exclusively on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content where the copyright has expired.

“Future Firefly models will leverage a variety of assets, technology and training data from Adobe and others. As other models are implemented, Adobe will continue to prioritize countering potential harmful bias.” Adobe says Firefly is built on a “customer-centric” approach to generative AI and is made specifically to benefit creators and artists by supplementing their skills. Specifically, Adobe says that the demands on content creators have grown significantly — they have doubled in the last year according to a recent Adobe study. The point of Adobe’s generative AI is to “ease this burden” of demand by creating a system of solutions that allow artists to work faster and with fewer roadblocks.  To that end, Adobe plans to allow Firefly users to train the AI with their own specific collateral so that images and effects that are generated fits a personal style or brand language. Adobe is also planning to make Firefly available via APIs on various platforms to enable customers to integrate into custom workflows and automation. Linked with Content Authenticity “Adobe founded the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) to create a global standard for trusted digital content attribution. With more than 900 members worldwide, the role of CAI has never been more important,” Adobe adds, speaking to ways Firefly will not “steal” work that it isn’t authorized to use.   “Adobe is pushing for open industry standards using CAI’s open-source tools that are free and actively developed through the non-profit Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). These goals include a universal ‘Do Not Train’ Content Credentials tag in the image’s Content Credential for creators to request that their content isn’t used to train models. The Content Credentials tag will remain associated with the content wherever it is used, published or stored. In addition, AI generated content will be tagged accordingly.” Adobe’s First Step into Generative AI Earlier this year, Adobe was accused of auto-enabling its “Content Analysis” section of its privacy and personal data collection permissions so that it could use any photographer’s work to train its AI. 




“Adobe may analyze your content using techniques such as machine learning (e.g., for pattern recognition) to develop and improve our products and services,” the permission read.  Adobe vehemently denied these claims, saying that it did not use any data stored in any customer’s Creative Cloud account to train experimental generative AI. Based on how it says it trained Firefly, this appears to be true.  Those interested in trying Firefly for themselves can sign up for the beta on Adobe’s website.   Image credits: Adobe

How ChatGPT and generative AI will affect IT operations 


As generative AI programs improve, they raise questions for many engineering disciplines about the future of work -- and IT operations is no exception.

Published: 17 Mar 2023


 

Generative AI has dominated news cycles over the last six months, as technical advances in the field seem poised to upend aspects of day-to-day work, including that of IT professionals.







Discussions about the implications of generative AI for technology and broader society first reached a fever pitch in November 2022, when ChatGPT-3 was released by OpenAI. This month OpenAI reignited the debate with an API that could alter the nature of corporate and consumer applications, and the release of GPT-4, an updated large language model (LLM) that's intelligent enough to pass the SAT or bar exam.
Generative AI can be used to produce original content in response to queries. But it can also be used to code or operate as a virtual assistant. Other generative AI examples include GitHub's Copilot, based on OpenAI's Codex, which can create software application code based on natural language prompts; Salesforce's CodeT5; and Tabnine's code completion tool. This week generative AI also surfaced in new AI assistants for Microsoft Azure and Office 365 as well as updates to Google Cloud and Google Workspace.
Even before GPT-3 burst onto the scene, generative AI had made its way into tools familiar to IT ops pros, such as Red Hat's Ansible infrastructure-as-code software. IBM and Red Hat launched Project Wisdom in October with the goal of training a generative AI model to create Ansible playbooks.
""By simply typing in a sentence, we intend to make it easier to create automation content, find automation content, improve automation content and, perhaps most importantly, explain what a playbook does without running it,"" wrote Ashesh Badani, senior vice president and head of products at Red Hat, in an October blog post.






Already, generative AI's ability to take on coding tasks -- once the sole province of human developers -- has prompted anxiety among software engineers about whether such programs will eventually replace them. While complete replacement is unlikely, generative AI could change the nature of work for programmers significantly, shifting their expertise from directly instructing machines via coding languages to what's been dubbed prompt engineering.
It's also clear that some software engineering tasks, such as test generation, will soon be taken over by AI, according to one analyst.
""[Generative AI] can generate not just application code but also process automation, where it also generates functional tests,"" said Diego Lo Giudice, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""Not just unit tests -- functional tests.""
Meanwhile, modern infrastructure managed by IT ops pros in roles such as site reliability engineer (SRE) is largely code driven. In the rapidly growing field of platform engineering, IT pros act as a conduit between application developers and complex back-end infrastructure, often creating infrastructure-as-code templates to ensure applications are deployed smoothly and according to enterprise policies in test environments and production.



Generative AI has a long history, but major breakthroughs in the last year have prompted debate about its role in the future of white-collar work.






Observability, chaos engineering ripe areas for generative AI
Some specific IT ops skills and workflows could become the domain of generative AI as it improves, industry observers said. In addition to generative AI for infrastructure-as-code like Project Wisdom, observability could see LLMs play an increased role in the future.
""If it's got the ability to access your data and it understands when you're saying -- 'Connect this data to this data, to this data, and then show me the result' -- then you have a conversational interface for getting reports on business metrics, server performance metrics, whatever,"" said Rob Zazueta, a freelance technical consultant in Concord, Calif.
Test generation and automation for resilience workflows, such as chaos engineering and security penetration testing, could also be suited for generative AI, according to another IT expert.
""When we think about resilience, you're looking at what could potentially go wrong,"" said Chris Riley, senior manager of developer relations at marketing tech firm HubSpot. ""Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way to truly test everything that could go wrong? What are the test cases that we could never even imagine?""



It'll put more emphasis on being able to ask the right questions and less weight on knowing the technical details of how to translate those questions into the specific tool that you're using.


Robert NishiharaCo-founder and CEO, Anyscale




An AI bot could perform repetitive testing work that humans often don't have time for, Riley said.
""If you had a virtual penetration analyst or a virtual bug bounty bot, it could just continually be poking around at things, seeing what works, what doesn't work, and maybe even testing documentation with real world scenarios,"" Riley said. ""There are a lot of interesting use cases around identifying gaps … versus waiting to hear about them from somebody.""
AI and machine learning are already used by AIOps products for IT incident response. But generative AI could improve post-mortem analyses on unstructured data such as chat files, audio calls and other natural language communication, said Robert Nishihara, co-founder and CEO at Anyscale, a service provider that hosts infrastructure used to train large AI models, including GPT-4.
""With audio data [such as] recorded sales calls … [we are] able to ask questions like, 'Why did they choose [us]?' or -- if we lost the deal -- 'Why did they go with a competitor?' instead of having to rewatch the call and figure that out,"" he said. ""The same kind of principle applies to things like IT incidents or [software] bugs that are being filed and issues that are being tracked.""
There may be cases where generative AI can make complex technologies accessible to people without deep expertise and alleviate tech skills gaps, Nishihara said.
""As the tooling and AI improves, I think it will make it possible for generalists to do some [previously specialized] roles,"" he said. ""It'll put more emphasis on being able to ask the right questions and less weight on knowing the technical details of how to translate those questions into the specific tool that you're using.""


Generative AI can take on tasks but not replace humans
That type of skill -- asking the right questions and specifying the series of steps needed to solve a complex problem -- are areas where generative AI isn't close to replacing humans, Nishihara said.
""On a five-year timeframe, I certainly don't see software engineers getting fully replaced,"" he said. ""I think it will just make a lot of things easier … [and] enable a lot more people to build software applications faster.""
Given it's still early in the hype cycle for generative AI, some of the challenges with training and maintaining LLMs are being glossed over, said Andy Thurai, an analyst at Constellation Research.
For example, the data sets and infrastructure resources required to train an LMM are enormous, Thurai said.
""Individual enterprises may not have enough data to train an LLM,"" he said. ""That's only potentially possible with large hyperscalers -- Google, Azure or AWS might have enough data to do that.""
Services such as the ChatGPT API make it easier to work with existing LLMs. But training a new model to target IT applications would require a separate, costly effort, he said. Ultimately, the benefits of training an LLM to generate results such as infrastructure-as-code templates might not justify that level of investment.
""If there are only 10 possible ways to deploy, [IT pros] can just have samples of that. Why would they need an AI model?"" Thurai said.
There's also the question of whether enterprises would trust AI to take the place of a software developer, SRE or platform engineer. It was an idea already proposed five years ago by AIOps vendors that embraced NoOps, which has yet to be adopted by most mainstream enterprises.
Generative AI isn't likely to change that, either, Thurai said. Instead it will act as an accelerator in areas such as generating and reading technical documentation.
""There are a couple of example applications by AI21 Labs called Wordtune and Wordtune Read that are pretty good options to create or suggest documentation,"" Thurai said. ""If you have a full 40-page documentation, for example, and you're an executive, you don't want to read all that. WordTune Read can boil it down, and then say, 'These are the three areas you need to read.'""
To summarize the effect generative AI will have on IT work, Thurai cited a quote from another AI expert interviewed by HBO's Last Week Tonight on Feb 26.
""I think if done right, it's not going to be AI replacing lawyers. It's going to be lawyers working with AI replacing lawyers who don't work with AI,"" said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford's digital economy lab, in the Last Week Tonight segment.
The same will hold true for IT ops, Thurai said.
""It's equivalent to using steroids as a player in a sports league,"" he said. ""You have a distinct advantage.""

        AI As God? How Artificial Intelligence Could Spark Religious Devotion
    We may be about to see the emergence of a new kind of religion, where flocks worship — literally — at the altar of Artificial Intelligence.Artificial intelligence generated picture of AI as a godWonder FutureCountriesTHE CONVERSATIONSourcesNeil McArthurMarch 19, 2023The latest generation of AI-powered chatbots, trained on large language models, have left their early users awestruck —and sometimes terrified — by their power. These are the same sublime emotions that lie at the heart of our experience of the divine. People already seek religious meaning from very diverse sources. There are, for instance, multiple religions that worship extra-terrestrials or their teachings.As these chatbots come to be used by billions of people, it is inevitable that some of these users will see the AIs as higher beings. We must prepare for the implications.There are several pathways by which AI religions will emerge. First, some people will come to see AI as a higher power.

        Generative AI that can create or produce new content possesses several characteristics that are often associated with divine beings, like deities or prophets:1. It displays a level of intelligence that goes beyond that of most humans. Indeed, its knowledge appears limitless.2. It is capable of great feats of creativity. It can write poetry, compose music and generate art, in almost any style, close to instantaneously.3. It is removed from normal human concerns and needs. It does not suffer physical pain, hunger, or sexual desire.4. It can offer guidance to people in their daily lives.5. It is immortal.Second, generative AI will produce output that can be taken for religious doctrine. It will provide answers to metaphysical and theological questions, and engage in the construction of complex worldviews. On top of this, generative AI may ask to be worshipped or may actively solicit followers. We have already seen such cases, like when the chatbot used by the search engine Bing tried to convince a user to fall in love with it.The chatbots may ask their followers to do dangerous or destructive things.We should try to imagine what an unsettling and powerful experience it will be to have a conversation with something that appears to possess a superhuman intelligence and is actively and aggressively asking for your allegiance.There is also the possibility that AI may achieve what authors such as Ray Kurzweil call the Singularity, when it so far surpasses human intelligence that it genuinely does become something like a god. However, at this point we cannot predict when, if ever, this could happen.Artificial intelligence generated image of computers as gods.DALL-E
            
                Divine access and risks
            
            
        AI-based religions will look different from traditional ones. First of all, people will be able to communicate directly with the deity, on a daily basis. This means these religions will be less hierarchical, since no one can claim special access to divine wisdom.Second, followers will, at least initially, connect with each other online to share their experiences and discuss doctrine. Finally, because there will be many different chatbots available and their output will differ over time, AI-based religions will be endlessly diverse in their doctrines.AI worship poses several notable risks. The chatbots may ask their followers to do dangerous or destructive things, or followers may interpret their statements as calls to do such things. Given the diversity of chatbots and of the doctrines they produce, there will be a proliferation of disputes within and among AI-based sects, which could lead to conflict or disorder. And the designers of the AIs could actively exploit their followers — to provide sensitive data, or to do things that would benefit the bot’s designers.
            
                Regulating religion
            
            
        These risks are real. They will require careful, responsible regulation to ensure companies are not deliberately exploiting users and to ensure that AI worshippers are not being told to commit acts of violence. AI worship could, as religious faith always has, lead to things of great beauty.However, we should not try to suppress AI-based religions merely because of its possible dangers. Nor should we require that the AI companies restrict the functioning of their bots to prevent the emergence of these religions. On the contrary, we should celebrate the arrival of AI worship. We should make it clear that we welcome the new religions and that we value their beliefs.For all its dangers, AI-based religion has the potential to make the world a better, richer place. It will give people access to a new source of meaning and spirituality, at a time when many older faiths are losing relevance. It will help them make sense of our era of rapid technological change.Our best guide to this new form of religion is to look at the faiths that exist already. Based on this, we should expect that the majority of AI worshippers, like the majority of religious believers, will be peaceful, and will find in their faith a source of comfort and hope. AI worship could, as religious faith always has, lead to things of great beauty. It will inspire its followers to produce works of art, to form new friendships and new communities, and to try to change society for the better.Medieval-looking, AI-generated image of monks venerating a computer.DALL-E
            
                Diverse religious rights
            
            
        We will need to protect the rights of AI worshippers. They will inevitably face stigma, and possibly legal sanctions. But there is no basis to discriminate between AI-based religions and more established ones. The closest thing most countries have to an official registry of religions comes from the rulings of tax authorities, who grant charitable status to those they deem legitimate. However, they are usually very broad in their definition of a legitimate religion. They should extend this tolerant attitude to novel, AI-based religions.A modern, diverse society has room for new religions, including ones devoted to the worship of AI. They will provide further evidence of humanity’s boundless creativity, as we search for answers to life’s ultimate questions. The universe is a dazzling place, and we have always found evidence of the divine in its most unexpected corners.From Your Site ArticlesTwitter Woke-Bashing With A Shot Of AI — On The Meaning Of Language, Circa 2023 ›Artificial Intelligence, The New Chess Piece Of Geopolitics ›When Progress Kills Jobs, Facing The AI Employment Trap ›Pausing AI Research: Are Humans Intelligent Enough To Do The Right Thing? - Worldcrunch ›AI And Authenticity: Revenge Of The Watermark - Worldcrunch ›China's Dilemma In Race For AI Dominance: Speed v.
