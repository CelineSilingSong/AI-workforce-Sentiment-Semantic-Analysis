AI and the future of work: Three ways to navigate disruption



The enormous potential of artificial intelligence could radically transform the way we work. In fact, the World Economic Forum‚Äôs just-released Future of Jobs Report 2020 says that within five years, the amount of time spent on tasks at work by humans and machines will be equal. The possibilities for disruption are real, but Mastercard leaders say we can avoid unintended consequences of innovation and ensure that AI can augment and empower humans workers, ensuring a smarter future for all.







The data provided in this video is part of a comprehensive study Mastercard commissioned with Kantar Group to explore the disruptive potential of AI.

On Oct. 20, Dean wrote that he wanted to see a draft, adding, ‚Äúdefinitely not my area of expertise, but would definitely learn from reading it.‚ÄùAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSix weeks later, Google fired Gebru while she was on vacation.üíªFollow TechnologyFollow‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine anybody else who would be safer than me,‚Äù Gebru, 37, said. ‚ÄúI was super visible. I‚Äôm well known in the research community, but also the regulatory space. I have a lot of grass-roots support ‚Äî and this is what happened.‚ÄùGoogle‚Äôs star AI ethics researcher, one of a few Black women in the field, says she was fired for a critical emailIn an internal memo that he later posted online explaining Gebru‚Äôs departure, Dean told employees that the paper ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt meet our bar for publication‚Äù and ‚Äúignored too much relevant research‚Äù on recent positive improvements to the technology. Gebru‚Äôs superiors had insisted that she and the other Google co-authors either retract the paper or remove their names. Employees in Google Research, the department that houses the ethical AI team, say authors who make claims about the benefits of large language models have not received the same scrutiny during the approval process as those who highlight the shortcomings.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHer abrupt firing shows that Google is pushing back on the kind of scrutiny that it claims to welcome, according to interviews with Gebru, current Google employees, and emails and documents viewed by The Post.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextThe Republicans are here.

Women made up only 15 percent of the AI research staff at Facebook and 10 percent at Google, according to a 2018 report in Wired magazine. At Google, Black women make up 1.6 percent of the workforce.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAlthough Google publicly celebrated Gebru‚Äôs work identifying problems with AI, it disenfranchised the work internally by keeping it hierarchically distinct from other AI initiatives, not heeding the group‚Äôs advice, and not creating an incentive structure to put in practice the ethical findings, Gebru and other employees said.Google declined to comment, but noted that in addition to the dozen or so staff members on Gebru‚Äôs team, 200 employees are focused on responsible AI.Google has said that it did not fire Gebru, but accepted her ‚Äúresignation,‚Äù citing her request to explain who at Google demanded that the paper be retracted, according to Dean‚Äôs memo. The company also blamed an email Gebru wrote to an employee resource group for women and allies at Google working in AI as inappropriate for a manager. The message warned the group that pushing for diversity was no use until Google leadership took accountability.Federal study confirms racial bias of many facial-recognition systems, casts doubt on their expanding useRumman Chowdhury, a former global lead for responsible AI at Accenture and chief executive of Parity, a start-up that helps companies figure out how to audit algorithms, said there is a fundamental lack of respect within the industry for work on AI ethics compared with equivalent roles in other industries, such as model risk managers in quantitative hedge funds or threat analysts in cybersecurity.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement‚ÄúIt‚Äôs being framed as the AI optimists and the people really building the stuff [versus] the rest of us negative Nellies, raining on their parade,‚Äù Chowdhury said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt help but notice, it‚Äôs like the boys will make the toys and then the girls will have to clean up.‚ÄùGoogle, which for decades evangelized an office culture that embraced employee dissent, has fired outspoken workers in recent years and shut down forums for exchange and questioning.Nearly 3,000 Google employees and more than 4,000 academics, engineers and industry colleagues have signed a petition calling Gebru‚Äôs termination an act of retaliation by Google. Last week, nine Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) and Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (N.Y.), sponsor of the Algorithmic Accountability Act, a bill that would require companies to audit and correct race and gender bias in its algorithms, sent a letter to Google chief executive Sundar Pichai asking the company to affirm its commitment to research freedom and diversity.Google CEO, in leaked video, says company is ‚Äògenuinely struggling‚Äô with employee trustLike any good researcher, Gebru is comfortable in the gray areas. And she has been using her ouster as an opportunity to shed light on the black box of algorithmic accountability inside Google ‚Äî annotating the company‚Äôs claims with contradictory data, drawing connections to larger systemic issues, and illuminating the way internal AI ethics efforts can break down without oversight or a change in incentives to corporate practices and power structures.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBig Tech dominates AI research around advancements in machine learning, image recognition, language translation ‚Äî poaching talent from top universities, sponsoring conferences and publishing influential papers. In response to concerns about the way those technologies could be abused or compound bias, the industry ramped up funding and promotion of AI ethics initiatives, beginning around 2016.Tech giants have made similar investments in shaping policy debate around antitrust and online privacy, as a way to ward off lawmakers. Pichai invoked Google‚Äôs AI principles in an interview in 2018 with The Post, arguing for self-regulation around AI.Google created its Ethical AI group in 2018 as an outgrowth of an employee-led push to prioritize fairness in the company‚Äôs machine learning applications. Margaret Mitchell, Gebru‚Äôs co-lead, pitched the idea of a team of researchers investigating the long-term effects of AI and translating those findings into action to mitigate harm and risk.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe same year, Pichai released a broadly worded set of principles governing Google‚Äôs AI work after thousands of employees protested the company‚Äôs contract with the Pentagon to analyze surveillance imagery from drones. But Google, which requires privacy and security tests before any product launch, has not mandated an equivalent process for vetting AI ethics, employees say.Google CEO Sundar Pichai: Fears about artificial intelligence are ‚Äòvery legitimate,‚Äô he says in Post interviewGebru, whose family‚Äôs ethnic origins are in Eritrea, was born and raised in Ethiopia and came to Massachusetts as 16-year-old after receiving political asylum from the war between the two African countries. She began her career as an electrical engineer at Apple and received her PhD from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, studying computer vision under renowned computer scientist Fei-Fei Li, a former Google executive and now co-director of Stanford‚Äôs Human-Centered AI Institute, which receives funding from Google.Gebru did her postdoctoral research at Microsoft Research as part of a group focused on accountability and ethics in AI. There, she and Joy Buolamwini, then a masters student at MIT Media Lab, co-wrote a groundbreaking 2018 study that found that commercial facial recognition tools sold by companies such as IBM and Microsoft were 99 percent accurate at identifying White males, but only 35 percent effective with Black women.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn June, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon announced that they would stop selling the software to law enforcement, which Dean credited to Gebru‚Äôs work. She also co-founded Black in AI, a nonprofit organization that increased the number Black attendees at the largest annual AI conference.Compare Google search engine results over nearly two decades and a trend emerges: Results are filled with advertising and non-Google results are lower down. (Video: The Washington Post)Gebru said that in 2018, Google recruited her with the promise of total academic freedom. She was unconvinced, but the company was opening its first artificial intelligence lab on the African continent in Accra, the capital of Ghana, and she wanted to be involved. When she joined Google, Gebru said, she was the first Black female researcher in the company. (When she left, there were still only a handful of Black women working in research, out of hundreds.)Gebru said she was also drawn to working with Mitchell. Both women prioritized foresight and building practical solutions to prevent AI risk, whereas the operating mind-set in tech is biased toward benefits and ‚Äúrapid hindsight,‚Äù in response to harm, Mitchell said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGebru‚Äôs approach to ethical AI was shaped by her experiences. Hardware, for instance, came with datasheets that documented whether components were safe to use in certain situations. ‚ÄúWhen you look at this field as a whole, that doesn‚Äôt exist,‚Äù said Gebru, an electrical engineer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just super behind in terms of documentation and standards of safety.‚ÄùShe also leaned on her industry experience when collaborating with other teams. Engineers live on a product cycle, consumed with putting out fires and fixing bugs. A vague requirement to ‚Äúmake things fair‚Äù would only cause more work and frustration, she thought. So she tried to build institutional structures and documentation tools for ‚Äúwhen people want to do the right thing.‚ÄùDespite their expertise, the Ethical AI group fought to be taken seriously and included in Google‚Äôs other AI efforts, employees said.Within the company, Gebru and her former colleagues said, there is little transparency or accountability regarding how decisions around AI ethics or diversity initiatives get made. Work on AI principles, for instance, falls under Kent Walker, the senior vice president of global affairs, whose vast purview includes lobbying, public policy and legal work. Walker also runs an internal ethics board of top executives, including Dean, called the Advanced Technology Review Council, which is responsible for yes or no decisions when issues escalate, Gebru said. The Ethical AI team had to fight to be consulted on Walker‚Äôs initiatives, she said.‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the guy tasked with covering Google‚Äôs a--, lobbying and also ‚Ä¶ working on AI principles,‚Äù Gebru said. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you have a different entity that pushes back a little bit internally ‚Äî some sort of push and pull?‚Äù What‚Äôs more, members of Walker‚Äôs council are predominantly vice presidents or higher, constricting diversity, Gebru said.Amazon, Facebook and Google turn to deep network of political allies to battle back antitrust probesIn her conversations with product teams, such as a group working on fairness in Machine Learning Infrastructure, Gebru said she kept getting questions about what tools and features they could build to protect against the ethical risks involved with large language models. Google had credited it with the biggest breakthrough in improving search results in the past five years. The models can process words in relation to the other words that come before and after them, which is useful for understanding the intent behind conversational search queries.But despite the increasing use of these models, there was limited research investigating groups that might be negatively impacted. Gebru says she wanted to help develop those safeguards, one of the reasons she agreed to collaborate with the research paper proposed by Emily M. Bender, a linguist at the University of Washington.Mitchell, who developed the idea of model cards, like nutrition labels for machine learning models, described the paper as ‚Äúdue diligence.‚Äù Her model card idea is being adopted more widely across the industry, and engineers needed to know how to fill out the section on harm.Gebru said her biggest contribution to both her team and the paper has been identifying researchers who study directly-affected communities.That diversity was reflected in the authors of the paper, including Mark Diaz, a Black and Latino Google researcher whose previous work looked at how platforms leave out the elderly, who talk about ageism in blog posts, but don‚Äôt share as much on sites such as Twitter. For the paper, he identified the possibility that large data sets from the Internet, particularly if they are from a single moment in time, will not reflect cultural shifts from social movements, such as the #MeToo movement or Black Lives Matter, which seek to shift power through changes in language.The paper identified four overarching categories of harm, according to a recent draft viewed by The Post. It delved into the environmental effect of the computing power, the inscrutability of massive data sets used to train these models, the opportunity costs of the ‚Äúhype‚Äù around claims that these models can understand language, as opposed to identifying patterns, and the danger that the real-sounding text generated by such models could be used to spread misinformation.Because Google depends on large language models, Gebru and Mitchell expected that the company might push back against certain sections or attempt to water down their findings. So they looped in PR & Policy representatives in mid-September, with plenty of time before the deadline for changes at the end of January 2021.Before making a pre-publication draft available online, Gebru first wanted to vet the paper with a variety of experts, including those who have built large language models. She asked for feedback from two top people at OpenAI, an AI research lab co-founded by Elon Musk, in addition to her manager at Google, and about 30 others. They suggested additions or revisions, Gebru said. ‚ÄúI really wanted to send it to people who would disagree with our view and be defensive,‚Äù Gebru said.Given all their upfront effort, Gebru was baffled when she received a notification for a meeting with Google Research Vice President Megan Kacholia at 4.30 p.m. on the Thursday before Thanksgiving.At the meeting, Kacholia informed Gebru and her co-authors that Google wanted the paper retracted.On Thanksgiving, a week after the meeting, Gebru composed a six-page email to Kacholia and Dean outlining how disrespectful and oddly secretive the process had been.‚ÄúSpecific individuals should not be empowered to unilaterally shut down work in such a disrespectful manner,‚Äù she wrote, adding that researchers from underrepresented groups were mistreated.Mitchell, who is White, said she shared Gebru‚Äôs concerns but did not receive the same treatment from the company. ‚ÄúGoogle is very hierarchical, and it‚Äôs been a battle to have any sort of recognition,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe tried to explain that Timnit, and to a lesser extent me, are respected voices publicly, but we could not communicate upwards.‚Äù‚ÄúHow can you still ask why there aren‚Äôt Black women in this industry?‚Äù Gebru said.Gebru said she found out this week that the paper was accepted to the Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency, as part of its anonymous review process. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad, the scientific community respects us a lot more than anybody inside Google,‚Äù she said.America‚Äôs Racial Reckoning: What you need to knowFull coverage: Race & ReckoningDemographic changes: How the racial makeup of where you live has changed since 1990Newsletter: Subscribe to About US to read the latest on race and identityGeorge Floyd‚Äôs America: Examining systemic racism through the lens of his lifeResources: Understanding racism and inequality in AmericaShare661 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.): Is It All Just Costly Hype?

Earlier this year, two partners at prominent venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz published an interesting blog post about artificial intelligence (A.I.). Specifically, is A.I. (and by extension, machine learning) capable of powering a sustainable business? Or is the tech industry infatuated with a technology that‚Äôs just a lot of empty hype?  
It‚Äôs a worthy question as we close out 2020, considering how much money and resources companies are pouring into all things A.I.-related (often despite budget cutbacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic). Martin Casado and Matt Bornstein, the partners in question, conclude that A.I. is indeed viable‚Äîbut that A.I.-centric businesses can‚Äôt operate like traditional software firms.  
Specifically, A.I. companies have ‚Äúlower gross margins‚Äù (due to the need for lots of expensive and talented humans, as well as infrastructure expenses), ‚Äúscaling challenges‚Äù (due to edge cases), and ‚Äúweaker defensive moats‚Äù (because of more A.I. tools and apps becoming commoditized, among other issues).  
‚ÄúTraining¬†a single A.I. model can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars (or¬†more) in¬†compute¬†resources,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs tempting to treat this as a one-time cost, retraining is increasingly recognized as an ongoing cost, since the data that feeds AI models tends to change over time (a phenomenon known as ‚Äòdata drift‚Äô).‚Äù  
If the A.I. model is training on something storage-intensive like video, things get even worse. Add on top of that the cost of humans to design and wrangle the models, and you can see how any hoped-for profits from an A.I. project could quickly evaporate.  
Humans in the Artificial Intelligence Loop  
The entire Andreessen Horowitz posting is worth reading, especially if you‚Äôre debating whether to jump aboard an artificial intelligence startup. Amidst all the discussions of cloud-infrastructure costs and model complexity, though, one thing stands out: the overwhelming presence of human beings within A.I. systems that are supposedly becoming more and more automated.  
It‚Äôs not just a question of employing people who can build and continually maintain models. ‚ÄúFor many tasks, especially those requiring greater cognitive reasoning, humans are often plugged into A.I. systems in real time,‚Äù the posting added. ‚ÄúSocial media companies, for example, employ thousands of human reviewers to augment A.I.-based moderation systems. Many autonomous vehicle systems include remote human operators, and most A.I.-based medical devices interface with physicians as joint decision makers.‚Äù  
And there‚Äôs no end in sight to intervention: ‚ÄúMany problems‚Äîlike self-driving cars‚Äîare too complex to be fully automated with current-generation A.I. techniques. Issues of safety, fairness, and trust also demand meaningful human oversight‚Äîa fact likely to be enshrined in A.I. regulations currently under development in the¬†US,¬†EU, and elsewhere.‚Äù  
We‚Äôve seen these sorts of issues cropping up already among companies with artificial intelligence products. A few years ago, for example, Google rolled out Duplex, its automated voice assistant, which it predicted would revolutionize the process of making reservations and dealing with customer service. However, journalists quickly demonstrated there were relatively straightforward ways to ‚Äústump‚Äù Duplex. As of mid-2019, 25 percent of Google Duplex calls were supposedly made by human operators as opposed to an A.I.¬†¬†¬†  
Now consider all the A.I.-centric (or ‚ÄúA.I. hopeful,‚Äù for those still trying to develop an application) businesses that don‚Äôt have Google‚Äôs talent or resources. The dream of building an artificial intelligence model that‚Äôs fully capable of performing its assigned task without any sort of human intervention‚Äîwell, that‚Äôs likely years away.  
Andreessen Horowitz isn‚Äôt the first firm to warn about this issue. In 2019, Arvind Krishna, IBM‚Äôs senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software, warned that A.I. initiatives could implode once companies realize how much effort is truly necessary to prep the related data. ‚ÄúYou run out of patience along the way, because you spend your first year just collecting and cleansing the data,‚Äù¬†he told the audience at The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Future of Everything Festival,¬†according to the newspaper.  
In a 2018 blog posting, A.I. researcher Filip Piekniewski listed all the ways in which the¬†artificial intelligence¬†hype wasn‚Äôt matching with reality, including¬†a lack of progress in Google‚Äôs DeepMind. Two years later, it‚Äôs clear that A.I. is still grinding forward as a discipline, consuming lots of cash and talent as companies hope for incremental advances.  
But at least artificial intelligence researchers are still making lots of cash. And, despite these challenges, keep in mind that automation is still a long-term risk to many professions.   
  
Ultimately, A.I. and machine learning technologies that help companies handle customer personalization and communication, data analytics and processing, and a host of other applications will continue to grow, even if it takes longer than expected to achieve seamless automation. An IDC report found three-quarters of commercial enterprise applications could lean on A.I. by next year alone, while an Analytics Insight report projects more than 20 million available jobs in¬†artificial intelligence¬†by 2023.¬†  
Whether you're a manager or a software developer, in other words, prepare for A.I. (even weaker A.I.) to change how you work. Make sure to review the 10 jobs that could be radically impacted by these technologies sooner than you think.

But that hasn‚Äôt stopped Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet, where Pichai is also CEO, from investing in a couple of companies that are getting into the business of war.

In June 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made a sweeping promise. In a blog entitled ‚ÄòAI at Google: our principles,‚Äô Pichai said Google would not develop artificial intelligence for ‚Äúweapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.‚Äù

Pichai‚Äôs pledge hadn‚Äôt come out of the blue: earlier that year, employees protested the company‚Äôs participation in Project Maven, a Department of Defense (DOD) initiative worth a reported potential $250 million a year - and $15 million over 18 months to Google - to use AI to identify buildings and other targets ‚Äúof interest‚Äù to the military from drone footage. Insiders at the Mountain View-based giant fumed. More than three thousand signed a letter to Pichai, writing, ‚ÄúWe believe that Google should not be in the business of war.‚Äù Google eventually let the contract lapse.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, has been having to put out another fire of late, after the departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru. In a letter to staff he wrote that it was ""a painful but important reminder of the progress we still need to make."" CHRISTIAN PEACOCK FOR FORBES
Pichai may have promised Google AI wouldn‚Äôt harm people, but he said nothing about Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet. In late 2019, Pichai became CEO of Alphabet while still retaining his job as CEO of Google ‚Äì and through investments by Google and its venture capital wing, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Alphabet is still very much in the business of war.

GV positions itself as an ‚Äúindependent, return-driven fund‚Äù with $5 billion under management. But the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm was spun out of Google back in 2009 and it‚Äôs all Alphabet money. As it says on its website, ‚ÄúGV is the venture capital arm of Alphabet,‚Äù and Alphabet is the firm‚Äôs ‚Äúsole limited partner.‚Äù (GV and Pichai declined repeated requests for comment on this story.)

Both Google and GV have minority stakes in companies supplying military surveillance tools. In 2016 GV acquired a stake in Palo Alto-based Orbital Insight and in 2017 Google took equity in Planet, headquartered in San Francisco. Together, in the last three years, the two firms have won at least $30.5 million in Defense Department contracts, alongside deals with space intelligence agencies, for projects that could be said to ‚Äúdirectly facilitate injury.‚Äù
Orbital is a software company founded by former Google Books director James Crawford. Its AI sifts through masses of satellite images, drone footage and aggregated smartphone location data from 800 million devices across the world with the goal of telling customers what‚Äôs physically changed on Earth and why it matters. The uses are myriad. Orbital could, for instance, track North Korean nuclear sites or the Taliban building training camps. But it also has peaceful uses like monitoring deforestation in the Amazon and mapping watersheds or sprawling urban slums. It gets its satellite footage from a range of providers, including Planet, its Google-portfolio sibling.
Planet, which was founded by NASA engineers, has 150 imaging satellites in orbit, claiming they make up the world‚Äôs largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. Planet‚Äôs big sell is the ability to quickly and cheaply send up small satellites into space. It has Doves - about the size of a loaf of bread - and Skysat satellites - about the size of a minifridge. Both are capable of beaming high-quality imagery back to earth. The startup was valued at nearly $1.8 billion after a 2018 funding round, according to PitchBook data. Google acquired 16% of the company, after selling its satellite imaging subsidiary Terra Bella to Planet in 2017, which has now diluted to 13%.
Both companies work with the U.S. military and various intelligence agencies. Planet has contracts with space intel agencies, including the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a DOD combat support agency. Orbital bid for work on that controversial Project Maven, according to two former employees.
Government contracting records show that between February 2017 and July 2020 Orbital was given $10 million to develop AI technology for a Defense Department program called Datahub. The Datahub would take satellite imagery and ‚Äútrack enemy patterns of life 24/7, all weather and day/night across large areas of responsibility at machine speed,‚Äù according to Pentagon budget documents. The resulting intelligence would be used to speed up a DoD tactical approach known as Find-Fix-Finish-Exploit-Analyze (F3EA), whereby a target is found, tracked, captured or killed, interrogated and then an analysis done to determine future opportunities. Intelligence derived from Datahub would also be used to automate the Defense Department‚Äôs weapons deployment ‚Äúfor timely precision strikes.‚Äù
The investments threaten to be problematic for Google and Alphabet ‚Äì even when done at arm‚Äôs remove through its ‚Äúindependent‚Äù venture capital wing. Google has repeatedly stumbled trying to live up to the expectations of its idealistic workforce. There was Project Maven and there was Project Dragonfly in 2017, when Google planned a search tool that came with built-in Chinese censorship. Then there were internal protests over contracts with the immigration agencies helping enact the Trump administration‚Äôs policies in 2019. Just this December, the exit of Google researcher Timnit Gebru, who was investigating potential racial bias in AI, led to a public fracas. Gebru claimed she‚Äôd been fired for posting frustrations about the retraction of one of her papers. More than 2,500 Google employees have signed a petition demanding their employer be transparent about Gebru‚Äôs termination.
A Google spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWhen we do our due diligence before any investment, we work with entrepreneurs to understand their tech, business plans and team, and, where appropriate, look for consistency with the AI Principles we announced in 2018.‚Äù

GV has been involved in every Orbital fundraising round since the satellite imagery company was founded in 2013. GV participated in a $9 million Series A round in 2015 and then in 2016 led a $15 million equity investment as part of the Series B. It has invested in all four of Orbital‚Äôs raises, the most recent being a $50 million Series D in November 2019. In all, Orbital has raised $130 million, most recently at a valuation of $480 million, according to PitchBook data. Forbes estimates GV has a stake of roughly 13% in the startup, which Forbes named as a Next Billion-Dollar startup in 2017. Sequoia is the largest outside stakeholder at over 20%, according to a source familiar with the investments.
From early on, Orbital has worked on humanitarian projects. With the World Bank it tries to quantify poverty by counting new buildings, roads and agricultural land in less-developed countries. It kept tabs on the world‚Äôs forests with the World Resources Institute. And as recently as last year its AI was monitoring the expansion of China‚Äôs ‚Äúre-education‚Äù camps in the Xinjiang region.
But the big money in the geospatial game resides in government coffers and in addition to its altruistic work, Orbital has forged numerous ties with U.S. intelligence and military agencies. In-Q-Tel, the CIA‚Äôs investment arm, provided $5 million of financing (via a warrant) in 2015. Shortly after a handful of In-Q-Tel employees moved over to Orbital and the fund‚Äôs managing partner George Hoyem became a board observer, according to Crunchbase. Among Orbital‚Äôs advisors for federal government business is Robert Cardillo, former director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. And in late 2019, it signed a deal with Booz Allen Hamilton, the Beltway consultancy with deep ties to the intelligence community, to supply its tools at speed via Booz‚Äôs Modzy, a kind of app store for government AI services.
Not everyone inside Orbital was happy about its ties to the military. Orbital‚Äôs own ethics pledge states, ‚ÄúWe do not develop or condone any intent to harm humanity, the environment, and/or society.‚Äù According to one former senior staffer, Orbital said its tech wouldn‚Äôt be applied to things like ‚Äúbomb targeting,‚Äù but ‚Äúonce you identify‚Ä¶a building, [the government] is gonna do whatever they want with it.‚Äù Though they didn‚Äôt have issues with the ethics of working with the military, they felt it ‚Äúsilly to make up these fake rules‚Ä¶ just call it what it is.‚Äù The ex-employee added that the company went from ‚Äúsaving chimpanzees in Indonesia‚Äù to ‚Äúfinding targets in Afghanistan.‚Äù
A former software engineer added that the defense work was ‚Äúa big problem because there's a lot of money in doing things that some people might consider unethical.‚Äù The ex-staffer said that in Silicon Valley it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to attract employees here to a company that's going to be... dependent on the U.S. military.‚Äù They acknowledged that the business had tried to steer clear of ‚Äúthe bad stuff, but if you‚Äôve borrowed $120 million from other people, you're kind of pressured to deliver on it.‚Äù
Orbital declined to provide any executives for an interview. A spokesperson for Orbital said ‚Äúa few employees... expressed concern over government work,‚Äù but added that the company has an ethics board, led by founder Crawford, that reviews each contract. When a government wanted to fly drones past ships and use Orbital for facial recognition, for instance, Orbital declined to do the work, as it doesn‚Äôt track individuals. The spokesperson added that it had ‚Äúsuccessfully completed‚Äù its work on the Datahub program, but declined to offer more detail or comment on any possible breaches of its own ethics stance.
Regarding its overall Pentagon work, the spokesperson added: ""Orbital Insight's work with the U.S. Department of Defense helps the agency zoom in on the physical world and monitor global activity so they can avoid surprises and proactively address critical situations. Precise change detection and an accurate picture of what's happening on the ground are essential for keeping our country safe and secure with effective security responses and communication.""
Orbital may no longer work on Datahub (former senior employees say the company lost the contract), but the startup continues to actively seek out government work. Official records show that since 2018, Orbital has spent $300,000 on Congressional lobbying, talking to lawmakers about the uses of geospatial AI. And in July 2020, it signed its biggest publicly-known government contract to date: a $22 million deal with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), details of which were obtained by Jack Poulson, an ex-Stanford math professor who used to work at Google until he resigned over the Chinese search engine plans, and now runs big tech research outfit Tech Inquiry. The contract documents, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, indicate that CBP is using Orbital tools to analyze data coming from drones, surveillance balloons and satellites that monitor radio frequency signals. According to contract records, Orbital‚Äôs border work will mix classic ‚Äúgeospatial surveillance‚Äù with search and rescue aid, the latter covered by a separate $3 million contract. An Orbital spokesperson said it was a research and development project with CBP looking ‚Äúto prevent loss of life for people stranded along the southern border and provide officers with more situational awareness in remote areas.‚Äù A CBP spokesperson said the ‚Äúprimary‚Äù use case was for search and rescue.


Planet has raised even more money than Orbital, above $400 million since it was founded in 2010. Its Doves satellites, which catch rides into orbit on the backs of launches from the likes of SpaceX and Rocket Lab, monitor Earth‚Äôs entire landmass and large chunks of its oceans, including coastal parts of the South China Sea and the Persian Gulf, every day.
Like Orbital, Planet‚Äôs business is a mix of humanitarian, private market and government contracting. Amongst its government projects are $20 million in National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency satellite imagery contracts. In the last three years, it‚Äôs completed a mix of studies and pilots with the Navy, the Air Force and the Army, looking at how best to use its satellite imagery across land and sea, in contracts worth more than $15 million.
Planet is hoping to significantly expand its collaboration with U.S. intelligence in the coming years, by bidding on the lucrative EnhancedView contract. Managed by the National Reconnaissance Office, EnhancedView contractors provide the U.S. government with commercial satellite imagery. For the last ten years the bulk of the EnhancedView money has gone to satellite and geospatial intelligence provider Maxar Technologies, which makes $300 million a year from the deal. Currently Planet‚Äôs constellation of Skysats and Doves is being tested to see how they compare with Maxar‚Äôs satellites. ‚ÄúWe believe we will be able to offer an excellent level of performance and service to the U.S. government,‚Äù the Planet spokesperson added.

As with Orbital, three former senior employees say there was some internal turmoil at Planet over its work with the military, claiming a small number of staff left as a result. ‚ÄúInitially, they were very altruistic. They were launching satellites for the benefit of everybody in the world,‚Äù said one former staffer. ¬†‚ÄúThen they discovered that actually, the only people that really want to pay the big money for satellite data is governments.‚Äù Another ex-employee said they thought Planet was against doing intelligence work but the pivot was a ‚Äúturn off‚Äù and one reason they left.¬†
Planet‚Äôs spokesperson said there was no such shift, that its first customers were with military and intelligence agencies, and it has ‚Äúno internal record of any employee ever leaving Planet because of our work with governments.‚Äù It pointed Forbes to the company‚Äôs ethics code in which it says: ‚ÄúOur partners may not use our products to further actions that sponsor harm, abuse, aggression, violence, or other violations of human rights.‚Äù The company also has an Ethics Committee that ‚Äúreviews potential or existing customer engagements for ethical issues‚Äù and it has nixed potential private and public sector contracts because of moral concerns. Planet declined to provide any information on what those contracts were.
A former Planet employee focused on government work said that the company was walking ‚Äúa fine line.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat their [ethics] statement says and then what the government does with the thing that they sell them is not really in their prerogative to control,‚Äù they added.
All these tricky ethical quandaries haven‚Äôt stopped Pichai‚Äôs Alphabet companies from investing further in the geospatial market. GV is also backing a less-proven moonshot, participating in $40 million and $35 million rounds in 2018 and 2020 for SpinLaunch. The startup has a novel idea for getting satellites into orbit, using what amounts to a giant, spinning arm that hammer-throws satellites into space. Thanks to Alphabet‚Äôs money and a 2019 $2.5 million contract with the DoD‚Äôs Defense Innovation Unit Small Responsive Launch program, SpinLaunch‚Äôs as-yet unproven tech could soon be responsible for helping the Pentagon deploy even more military spy satellites to monitor the planet.
When Pichai laid out his company‚Äôs AI principles, he took on a utilitarian tone in describing their protean limits. ‚ÄúWhere there is a material risk of harm, we will proceed only where we believe that the benefits substantially outweigh the risks, and will incorporate appropriate safety constraints,‚Äù he wrote. But it‚Äôs not within Google‚Äôs remit to apply those unspecified constraints on the companies in which it invests or their militaristic customers.

As artificial intelligence technologies become more powerful and deeply integrated in human systems, countries around the world are struggling to understand the benefits and risks they might pose to national security, prosperity and political stability.
These efforts are still very much a work in progress. Australia is developing a whole-of-government AI action plan, led by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. The department released a discussion paper this year and finalised its call for submissions in November.
In line with the department‚Äôs brief, the paper concentrates on the economic potential of AI, while acknowledging the need for a human-centred, ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô AI regime. That reflects a push internationally to conceptualise AI in terms of digital human security and human rights.
But AI technologies also have serious implications for national security and geopolitics, which need to be thoroughly explored in any discussion of what an AI framework for Australia might look like.
In any discussion of AI, it‚Äôs important to note that definitions of the technology are not settled and the applications are vast. But most definitions circle around the idea of machine learning, the ability of a digital technology not just to automate a function, but to learn from interactions with its environment and optimise a function accordingly.
The AI systems that we need to think about in national security terms include surveillance and profiling, the persuasive AI that pervades digital social networks, predictive algorithms and autonomous systems. It is also important to think about the control of the entire AI supply chain, from the human source of the datasets that AI technologies need to learn from, to research and development and technology transfers, and the effects of AI systems on societies.
But the AI geopolitical picture is now a contested tangle of state rivalry, multinational monopoly growth and public anxiety.
That AI is deeply embedded in the discourse of geopolitical competition is well established. The belief that AI will be the key to military, economic and ideological dominance has found voice in a proliferation of grand AI mission statements by the US, China, Russia and other players.
Whether an AI advantage will deliver pre-eminent power to any one nation is arguable. National control over AI technology still remains elusive in a world of globalised R&D collaboration and supply chains and transnational digital technology companies.
But the perception, at least, has driven intense national economic competition over establishment of global AI-powered monopolies in almost every sector‚Äîenergy, infrastructure, health, online gaming, telecommunications, news, social media and entertainment‚Äîand the enormous data-harvesting power that goes with them.
Governments are also racing to develop AI military technologies like autonomous lethal weapons and swarming technology as well as the AI-enhanced surveillance, communications and data-exploitation capabilities they hope will give their military forces the decisional edge on the battlefield.
At the same time, countries are trying to unwind the globalisation of AI technology in order to control R&D collaboration and technology transfers. Individual nations and alliance systems are beginning to champion their own versions of AI norms and technology bases.
In the process, the huge datasets held by governments, corporations and various data brokers have become a strategic asset. They are coveted as the raw fuel needed to train machine-learning algorithms.
Governments have been actively exploring the ways in which these datasets can be weaponised, how they might be used to create cyber weapons targeting critical infrastructure, influence the information systems of another country, build better profiles of its elites for influence targeting and form a clearer picture of the internal dynamics of a political system.
As these uses continue to be experimented with, how datasets are collected and where they are housed is becoming a national security issue. The decision by the US and others to ban Huawei and break up TikTok can be seen at least partially in this context.
But as the competition for the AI edge heats up, the initial excitement and uncritical embrace of this technology has darkened to a mood of profound unease.
Democratic governments are being forced to grapple with the fact that the AI algorithms that run social media platforms operate to maximise user engagement and encourage behavioural change which can then be sold to advertisers. And these learning algorithms have supercharged the possibilities for what some analysts have termed ‚Äòsharp power‚Äô‚Äîthe manipulation of public sentiment through computational propaganda, disinformation and conspiracism by foreign actors and their domestic proxies.
Deep fakes‚Äîsynthetic media created with the help of machine learning‚Äîcan be fun but are becoming another tool in the burgeoning disinformation arsenal. AI-generated disinformation was reportedly used by China to interfere in the Taiwanese presidential election in January, and by partisan operatives to discredit Democratic candidate Joe Biden‚Äôs son Hunter ahead of the US election. ‚Äã
The past year has at times seemed like a laboratory for demonstrating the malignant effects of AI-driven communications platforms on politics. The corrosive effect on credible governance and institutional legitimacy, in the case of the US, has threatened democratic norms, the ability of the government to mount a credible pandemic response and its reputational power abroad.
Further, the increasing AI-enabled convergence of the physical and digital worlds is constantly creating new infrastructure vulnerabilities. The development of 5G ‚Äòsmart cities‚Äô‚Äîthe mass automation of public infrastructure via sensors and learning algorithms‚Äîwill open up even more avenues for surveillance, data weaponisation and criminal cyber activity, and will provide foreign adversaries with further means to reach into societies at the granular level. The recent discovery of a massive cyber intelligence campaign against US security systems, enabled through a US government software contractor, is a reminder of what‚Äôs possible here.
All of this has governments and publics around the world signalling alarm, if not outright panic, about the destructive power of AI platforms. As the year comes to a close, the US has launched anti-trust actions against Google, which will almost certainly survive into a Biden administration. The EU has opened an investigation into anti-competitive conduct by Amazon. This alarm is no longer confined to democratic countries. China is drawing up new anti-trust measures squarely aimed at is own AI behemoths of Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu.
This fight between states and global platforms will be a defining feature of the next decade, as will be the fight for public trust in AI technologies. China‚Äôs pioneering work in deploying state-directed, AI-enhanced surveillance provides an illustration of a chilling totalitarian vision of intimate control of individual citizens through their dependence on integrated digital smart systems.
As citizens feel more and more powerless against the growing use of AI, they will increasingly push both governments and platforms to be more ambitious in designing technologies and enforceable regulatory regimes that are centred on the public interest.
By engaging transparently with the high risk to security, democracy and social cohesion inherent in many AI applications, Australia has the opportunity to develop innovative policy that could help set standards internationally.

Even though it is possible when¬†AI reaches a certain level of improvement, the current developments in technology are mostly human-friendly. Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. Generally,¬†AI benefits in significant fields¬†like finance, healthcare, business, and security. Besides, humans can never beat AI in weather prediction, drug discovery, and stock market crashes. We are already¬†employing AI to do many jobs¬†in our daily routine. For example, Netflix and Spotify use AI technology to sort the viewer's preference. A lot of modern home appliances are powered by AI. Henceforth, let us take a moment to think about some extraordinary things that AI is doing today. Analytics Insight brings you a list of AI applications that shows the power of AI..Top 10 AI applications that show how far we have come.AI perfumers.We always had a thought on how AI will react if it can hear, taste, or smell things. Scientists and researchers have been working to improve such features in AI machines. Even though it is a long way to reach that stage, tech companies are taking baby steps to improve relative technologies. IBM research is collaborated with a German Fragrance House Symrise to introduce artificial olfaction sensation in the perfume industry. They analyzed present fragrance chemical formulas to develop a new way of preparing fragrances. The companies used data to sort consumer choices and preferences by studying historical buying options. Later, they used the data to mix several aromatic components to give people a unique fragrance. In 2019, two AI-prepared aromas were released by the company..AI pets.Pet lovers, please take note. AI pets are stealing the market with more love. Generally, children play with cyborg dogs and little robots. It was not a big deal until the real AI pet entered the tech space. AI pets can recognize emotions and respond to your commands. Yes, it is very heartwarming. MOFLIN is an AI pet with emotional capabilities. It evolves like living animals. MOFLIN is designed to learn and constantly grow, using its interactions to determine patterns and evaluate its surroundings from its sensors. The AI pet chooses from an infinite number of mobile and sound pattern combinations to respond and express their feelings..Fortune telling.Thinking AI as a 'fortune teller' might sound funny. But the futuristic technology is bringing breakthrough changes into the modern landscape. AI researchers are working to make technology discover people's feelings and emotions with high precision. Stanford University researchers unveiled an algorithm that scans faces on images to declare a person as gay. The AI algorithm is efficient enough to detect a gay with 81% accuracy in men and 74% accuracy in women. Social media platforms are also using AI to flag unusual behavior among people, leading to suicide. Facebook's AI detected over a hundred cases that needed attention..AI in creativity.We are at the technological evolution where AI is capable of showing its interest in art and creativity. Today, AI is composing music, drawing pictures and much more. An AI-based system called MuseNet can now compose classical music that echoes the classical legends, Bach and Mozart. OpenAI's MuseNet is a Deep Neural Network that can create four-minute musical compositions with different tech instruments and combine Mozart's country styles with the Beatles. An algorithm developed by Tao Xu at Microsoft Research generates art or pictures. It is trained on a database of photographs and descriptions, matching certain words to particular colors, textures, and shapes..AI as the best chef.AI-powered robots are doing the cooking and serving jobs for a long time. Recently, chef robots have invaded the Chinese military to cook food for army men. However, an AI-machine designing the food you crave or suggesting a dish with the left-over ingredients is something to note. IBM's Chef Watson might be the solution home chefs need to overcome a pantry with only a few ingredients that couldn't possibly go together or welcome inspiration to professional chefs who want to evolve their menu through cognitive cooking and take advantage of seasonal ingredients..Revolutionising recruiting.We are familiar with how AI is invading every sector and transforming them for good. But we always thought that we are superior to AI in every way. Currently, AI can benefit the resume filtering process, which can be time-consuming and tedious. Even though there are minor issues like AI recruitment facing discrimination problems, the technology is updating its functionalities to conquer them. Besides, AI software can design interview questions for potential hires with a focus on the person's professional competency for a particular job without knowing their race, gender, or ethnicity..AI in smart cities.Smart cities are the dream of both governments and people. Many countries worldwide are trying to turn their developing city into a smart city with Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. According to Omdia, the global smart city AI software market is set to soar to US$4.9 billion in 2025, up from US$673.8 million in 2019. Wireless data communication standards are enabling smart city applications to move into the online realm where they can capitalize on the latest AI innovations..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Just from your cell phone to the diagnosis of diseases, AI is now being used in many fields, offering high-performance and precise device operation with quality..AI systems are sufficiently effective to minimize human effort in different fields. Many of them use artificial intelligence to build computer programs that perform various activities on a regular basis in many industries. Applications of artificial intelligence help to get the job done quicker and with accurate outcomes. The key motive behind artificial intelligence is error-free and productive functions. Many industries have begun to use AI technology in recent years to minimize human efforts, and also to produce efficient and faster performance..Artificial intelligence (AI) is, according to the World Economic Forum, already a fact in many sectors, but the application of technology still possesses considerably more potential. The study provides for labor productivity growth in developed countries by up to 40% by 2035, as a result of artificial intelligence influences. Sweden is expected to have a high productivity rise of about 37%. Also predicted to benefit greatly from the impacts of AI are the US (35 percent) and Japan (34 percent). AI will theoretically increase labor productivity in Germany and Austria by approximately 30 percent in the next 15 years..Artificial Intelligence automation is rising efficiently across countries and the numbers look impressive. AI also dominates the field of scientific research apart from applications for corporate setups for productivity improvement..There are many advantages, but there is also a certain amount of risk for any big breakthrough. One of the main threats may be the use of this technology for destruction or other similar practices. If this happens, the very technologies we develop will destroy us in the near future. There are several organizations and scientists who are calling for regulatory oversight of AI implementation and programs to take care of this critical aspect. In order for all countries to be at peace and to experience development in their respective countries, oversight must be at the national and international levels..AI is not a vision for the future, but rather something that is real today and is being integrated into and deployed in a variety of sectors. This includes economics, national security, medical care, criminal law, transport, and smart cities. Many instances exist in which AI already has an impact on the environment and has greatly improved human potential..Artificial Intelligence not only plays a vital role in the growth of business and systems but also at the next level for humans.

People globally offer mixed views of the impact of artificial intelligence, job automation on society
By Courtney Johnson and Alec Tyson

As artificial intelligence (AI) plays a growing role in the everyday lives of people around the world, views on AI‚Äôs impact on society are mixed across 20 global publics, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. ¬†

How we did this

This analysis is based on a survey conducted across 20 publics from October 2019 to March 2020 across Europe, Russia, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. The surveys were conducted by face-to-face interviews in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, India and Brazil. In all other places, the surveys were conducted by telephone. All surveys were conducted with representative samples of adults ages 18 and older in each survey public.
Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.



A median of about half (53%) say the development of artificial intelligence, or the use of computer systems designed to imitate human behaviors, has been a good thing for society, while 33% say it has been a bad thing.
Opinions are also divided on another major technological development: using robots to automate many jobs humans have done in the past. A median of 48% say job automation has been a good thing, while 42% say it‚Äôs had a negative impact on society.
The survey ‚Äì conducted in late 2019 and early 2020 in 20 places across Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Russia ‚Äì comes as automation has remade workplaces around the world and AI increasingly powers things from social media algorithms to technology in cars and everyday appliances.
Views of AI are generally positive among the Asian publics surveyed: About two-thirds or more in Singapore (72%), South Korea (69%), India (67%), Taiwan (66%) and Japan (65%) say AI has been a good thing for society. Many places in Asia have emerged as world leaders in AI.
Most other places surveyed fall short of a majority saying AI has been good for society. In France, for example, views are particularly negative: Just 37% say AI has been good for society, compared with 47% who say it has been bad for society. In the U.S. and UK, about as many say it has been a good thing for society as a bad thing. By contrast, Sweden and Spain are among a handful of places outside of the Asia-Pacific region where a majority (60%) views AI in a positive light.
As with AI, Asian publics surveyed stand out for their relatively positive views of the impact of job automation. Many Asian publics have made major strides in the development of robotics and AI. The South Korean and Singaporean manufacturing industries, for instance, have the highest and second highest robot density of anywhere in the world. Singapore is also pursuing its goal of becoming the world‚Äôs first ‚Äúsmart nation,‚Äù and the government has identified AI as one of many key development areas necessary to reach that goal. Japan has also long been a world leader in robotics manufacturing and development, and robots and AI are increasingly integrated into everyday life there to help with tasks ranging from household chores to elder care.
Men are significantly more likely than women to say artificial intelligence has been a good thing for society in 15 of the 20 places surveyed. In Japan, for example, nearly three-quarters of men (73%) have positive views of AI, compared with 56% of women. In the U.S., 53% of men say AI has been a positive thing, compared with 40% of women.

People with more education are also more likely to have a positive view of AI. This gap is largest in the Netherlands, where a majority of those with a college education or higher (61%) see AI favorably, compared with 43% of those with less education. In the 11 publics where age is a significant factor in views of AI, younger people usually have a more positive view of the technology than older people.
There are similar patterns by gender and education in views of job automation. The educational differences are particularly large in some places: In Italy, for instance, about two-thirds of people with at least a college education (65%) say job automation has been a good thing for society, compared with just 38% of people with less education. Among adults with more education, those who took three or more science courses tend to see job automation more positively than people who took fewer science classes.

It is a simple truth: the field of artificial intelligence is far too male-dominated. According to a 2018 study from Wired and Element AI, just 12% of AI researchers globally are female.


Artificial intelligence will reshape every corner of our lives in the coming years‚Äîfrom healthcare to finance, from education to government. It is therefore troubling that those building this technology do not fully represent the society they are poised to transform.

Yet there are many brilliant women at the forefront of AI today. As entrepreneurs, academic researchers, industry executives, venture capitalists and more, these women are shaping the future of artificial intelligence. They also serve as role models for the next generation of AI leaders, reflecting what a more inclusive AI community can and should look like.

Her pioneering work on algorithmic bias as a graduate student at MIT opened the world‚Äôs eyes to the racial and gender prejudices embedded in facial recognition systems. Amazon, Microsoft and IBM each suspended their facial recognition offerings this year as a result of Buolamwini‚Äôs research, acknowledging that the technology was not yet fit for public use. Buolamwini‚Äôs work is powerfully profiled in the new documentary Coded Bias.

Buolamwini stands at the forefront of a burgeoning movement to identify and address the social consequences of artificial intelligence technology, a movement she advances through her nonprofit Algorithmic Justice League.
Buolamwini on the battle against algorithmic bias: ‚ÄúWhen I started talking about this, in 2016, it was such a foreign concept. Today, I can‚Äôt go online without seeing some news article or story about a biased AI system. People are just now waking up to the fact that there is a problem. Awareness is good‚Äîand then that awareness needs to lead to action. That is the phase that we‚Äôre in.‚Äù

Claire Delaunay: VP Engineering, NVIDIA
From SRI to Google to Uber to NVIDIA, Claire Delaunay has held technical leadership roles at many of Silicon Valley‚Äôs most iconic organizations. She was also co-founder and engineering head at Otto, the pedigreed but ill-fated autonomous trucking startup helmed by Anthony Levandowski.
In her current role at NVIDIA, Delaunay is focused on building tools and platforms to enable the deployment of autonomous machines at scale.
Delaunay on the tradeoffs between working at a big company and a startup: ‚ÄúSome kinds of breakthroughs can only be accomplished at a big company, and other kinds of breakthroughs can only be accomplished at a startup. Startups are very good at deconstructing things and generating discontinuous big leaps forward. Big companies are very good at consolidating breakthroughs and building out robust technology foundations that enable future innovation.‚Äù

Rana el Kaliouby: CEO & Co-Founder, Affectiva
Rana el Kaliouby has dedicated her career to making AI more emotionally intelligent.
Kaliouby is credited with pioneering the field of Emotion AI. In 2009, she co-founded the startup Affectiva as a spinout from MIT to develop machine learning systems capable of understanding human emotions. Today, the company‚Äôs technology is used by 25% of the Fortune 500, including for media analytics, consumer behavioral research and automotive use cases.
Kaliouby on her big-picture vision: ‚ÄúMy life‚Äôs work is about humanizing technology before it dehumanizes us.‚Äù

Daphne Koller: CEO & Founder, insitro
Daphne Koller‚Äôs wide-ranging career illustrates the symbiosis between academia and industry that is a defining characteristic of the field of artificial intelligence.
Koller has been a professor at Stanford since 1995, focused on machine learning. In 2012 she co-founded education technology startup Coursera with fellow Stanford professor and AI leader Andrew Ng. Coursera is today a $2.6 billion ed tech juggernaut.
Koller‚Äôs most recent undertaking may be her most ambitious yet. She is the founding CEO at insitro, a startup applying machine learning to transform pharmaceutical drug discovery and development. Insitro has raised roughly $250 million from Andreessen Horowitz and others and recently announced a major commercial partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb.
Koller on advice for those just starting out in the field of AI: ‚ÄúPick an application of AI that really matters, that is really societally worthwhile‚Äînot all AI applications are‚Äîand then put in the hard work to truly understand that domain. I am able to build insitro today only because I spent 20 years learning biology. An area I might suggest to young people today is energy and the environment.‚Äù

Fei-Fei Li: Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University
Few individuals have left more of a mark on the world of AI in the twenty-first century than Fei-Fei Li.
As a young Princeton professor in 2007, Li conceived of and spearheaded the ImageNet project, a database of millions of labeled images that has changed the entire trajectory of AI. The prescient insight behind ImageNet was that massive datasets‚Äîmore than particular algorithms‚Äîwould be the key to unleashing AI‚Äôs potential. When Geoff Hinton and team debuted their neural network-based model trained on ImageNet at the 2012 ImageNet competition, the modern era of deep learning was born.
Li has since become a tenured professor at Stanford, served as Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud, headed Stanford‚Äôs AI lab, joined the Board of Directors at Twitter, cofounded the prominent nonprofit AI4ALL, and launched Stanford‚Äôs Human-Centered AI Institute (HAI). Across her many leadership positions, Li has tirelessly advocated for a more inclusive, equitable and human approach to AI.
Li on why diversity in AI is so important: ‚ÄúOur technology is not independent of human values. It represents the values of the humans that are behind the design, development and application of the technology. So, if we‚Äôre worried about killer robots, we should really be worried about the creators of the technology. We want the creators of this technology to represent our values and represent our shared humanity.‚Äù

Anna Patterson: Founder & Managing Partner, Gradient Ventures
Anna Patterson has led a distinguished career developing and deploying AI products, both at large technology companies and at startups.
A long-time executive at Google, which she first joined in 2004, Patterson led artificial intelligence efforts for years as the company‚Äôs VP of Engineering. In 2017 she launched Google‚Äôs AI venture capital fund Gradient Ventures, where today she invests in early-stage AI startups.
Patterson serves on the board of a number of promising AI startups including Algorithmia, Labelbox and test.ai. She is also a board director at publicly-traded Square.
Patterson on one question she asks herself before investing in any AI startup: ‚ÄúDo I find myself constantly thinking about their vision and mission?‚Äù

Daniela Rus: Director, MIT‚Äôs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)
Daniela Rus is one of the world‚Äôs leading roboticists.
She is an MIT professor and the first female head of MIT‚Äôs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), one of the largest and most prestigious AI research labs in the world. This makes her part of a storied lineage: previous directors of CSAIL (and its predecessor labs) over the decades have included AI legends Marvin Minsky, J.C.R. Licklider and Rodney Brooks.
Rus‚Äô groundbreaking research has advanced the state of the art in networked collaborative robots (robots that can work together and communicate with one another), self-reconfigurable robots (robots that can autonomously change their structure to adapt to their environment), and soft robots (robots without rigid bodies).
Rus on a common misconception about AI: ‚ÄúIt is important for people to understand that AI is nothing more than a tool. Like any other tool, it is neither intrinsically good nor bad. It is solely what we choose to do with it. I believe that we can do extraordinarily positive things with AI‚Äîbut it is not a given that that will happen.‚Äù

Shivon Zilis: Board Member, OpenAI; Project Director, Neuralink
Shivon Zilis has spent time on the leadership teams of several companies at AI‚Äôs bleeding edge: OpenAI, Neuralink, Tesla, Bloomberg Beta.
She is the youngest board member at OpenAI, the influential research lab behind breakthroughs like GPT-3. At Neuralink‚ÄîElon Musk‚Äôs mind-bending effort to meld the human brain with digital machines‚ÄîZilis works on high-priority strategic initiatives in the office of the CEO.
Zilis on her attitude toward new technology development: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm astounded by how often the concept of ‚Äòbuilding moats‚Äô comes up. If you think the technology you‚Äôre building is good for the world, why not laser focus on expanding your tech tree as quickly as possible versus slowing down and dividing resources to impede the progress of others?‚Äù

The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on human rights is one of the most crucial factors that will define the period in which we live. AI-driven technology is entering more aspects of every individual‚Äôs life, from smart home appliances to social media applications, and it is increasingly being utilised by public authorities to evaluate people‚Äôs personality or skills, allocate resources, and otherwise make decisions that can have real and serious consequences for the human rights of individuals.
Numerous studies have highlighted the risks that so-called artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision-making systems pose to the principles of equality and non-discrimination in employment, the provision of goods or services in both the public and private sectors, public security policies or even in the fight against fraud.
The study on ""Discrimination, artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making"" commissioned by the Council of Europe‚Äôs European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), identified many such challenges and stated that equality bodies have a key role to play in awareness-raising, prevention and redress. The study also showed that discrimination by AI & Automated Decision-making (ADM) systems can be addressed through different regulatory tools, including data protection and sectorial regulation such as employment laws. This calls for a cross-sectoral co-operation between national regulators in order to provide effective redress, share expertise and to share the workload.
The Committee on Anti-Discrimination, Diversity and Inclusion (CDADI) and the Gender Equality Commission (GEC) of the Council of Europe mandated the production of a Study on the impact of artificial intelligence systems, their potential for promoting equality ‚Äì including gender equality - and the risks they may cause in relation to non-discrimination. Subject to the results of the above-mentioned study, the CDADI in cooperation with the GEC and the Committee on Artificial intelligence (CAI) will possibly develop a specific legal instrument addressing this matter. The Study builds on the current work of the CAI and the previous work of the Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI) in 2020 and 2021, in particular its Feasibility study and its document Possible elements of a legal framework on artificial intelligence, based on the Council of Europe‚Äôs standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The Council of Europe in partnership with equality bodies and other public institutions has set up training programmes looking at the impact of AI on discrimination. The courses support participants to acquire initial expertise on these subjects in order to better prepare them to identify and respond discrimination caused by digital technologies on behalf of their institutions. ¬†The courses also serve as an opportunity to recall the legal framework of non-discrimination, which applies to decisions made on the basis of algorithmic processing. Finally, these training courses support the creation of a network of multipliers interested in the subject, establishing communication and supporting them to discuss their respective work and tasks.",,,,,,,,,,AI & discrimination,,,,,,,2020-10-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But what does that mean for the future of art and music? Violinist Hilary Hahn wants to make sure that artists have a say in the development and direction of artificial intelligence, and so she has teamed up with roboticist and AI specialist Carol Reiley to form an organization called <a href=""https://www.deepmusic.ai/"">DeepMusic.ai</a>. Its goal is to weave the artificial intelligence and arts communities together, so that the future of AI can be influenced by the vision and needs of artists.

I spoke with Hilary and Carol last week about their inspiration and vision for DeepMusic.ai - below is a video of our full conversation, which took place via Zoom, with Hilary in Massachusetts, Carol in Northern California and me in Pasadena, Calif.

But it‚Äôs also no secret that thorny, and sometimes unexpected, questions arise as automation and algorithms creep into new corners of life‚Äîtransforming jobs, economies, and even the world order. Which is why this winter, we‚Äôre also fascinated by books that grapple with these very questions. How did algorithms become so influential in our politics? When will they become our chauffeurs? And how much should they really know about us? Written by historians, journalists, and researchers, each of these books examines a very different aspect of the world that has been or will be upended by the influence of artificial intelligence.

Please also consider subscribing to WIREDCourtesy of Simon & SchusterDriven: The Race to Create the Autonomous Carby Alex DaviesThe ‚Äúgreat man‚Äù theory holds that history is largely made by heroes‚Äîbig, brawny, brainy dudes (always dudes) who reshape the future with brute force and brilliance. WIRED alum Alex Davies‚Äô new book refutes that outdated theory. In Driven, Davies digs into the history of autonomous vehicles and the goofy, spirited cast of characters (still mostly dudes) who are working to shepherd the tech into existence. As Davies reveals, teamwork makes the dream work. Until it doesn‚Äôt. Then the lawsuits‚Äîand in one engineer‚Äôs case, handcuffs‚Äîfly.Eventually, robot cars might reshape the way modern life works. Autonomous vehicles could be a $7 trillion business by 2050; today, multibillion-dollar companies like Alphabet, General Motors, Ford, and Tesla race to hammer out the kinks. But back at the opening of the century, AVs were an academic hobbyhorse. Then an obscure clause in a 2001 funding bill poured government money into developing robot tech. Just a few years later, Darpa held a literal robot race across the Mojave Desert. The kooky entrants are the same engineers banking millions at the world‚Äôs largest AV companies today. For many, the money was a nice incentive. But as one roboticist tells Davies, most are driven by the classic maker ethos: ‚ÄúI sought something that would dent the world, that I could do with my own hands, that would happen in my time.‚ÄùTo paraphrase another visionary, the course of true engineering never did run smooth. Davies‚Äô sharp narrative chronicles the personality clashes, philosophical divergences, funding crunches, and, in a shocking number of cases, troublesome wild creatures that get in robotics‚Äô way. (A tip: When racing a robot across the desert, keep an eye out for the native tortoises, which will pee on you if you try to move them.) This is a book for anyone who‚Äôs sick of the hero narrative, and who wants to learn about how the business of building world-shaking robots truly creaks along.‚ÄîAarian Marshall$28 at Amazon$26 at Bookshop.orgTrending NowUnderstanding Algorithms With Sinead BovellCourtesy of Liveright If Then: How the Simulmatics Corporation Invented the Future by Jill LeporePop quiz: Who is the presidential candidate that first used algorithmic modeling of the American electorate to win a contentious election? If you said Donald Trump, you're 56 years too late. The year was 1960, and John F. Kennedy had contracted a little-known startup called the Simulmatics Corporation to use its pioneering ""people machine"" to survey American voters, predict their behavior, and provide campaign advice. In her history of Simulmatics (‚Äúthe A-bomb of the social sciences,‚Äù a ‚ÄúCold War Cambridge Analytica‚Äù), Jill Lepore chronicles those early days of algorithmic behavior modeling, and its inevitable influence on politics and society.Simulmatics would go on to win contracts with the The New York Times, which used its technology to anticipate the outcome of elections, and the Department of Defense, which used it to inform war strategy in Vietnam. Lepore, who is both a Harvard historian and a staff writer at the The New Yorker, brings the company's history to life with brilliant archival details. Her depiction of the 1960s serves as a mirror of 2020: America is in the midst of a racial justice uprising, a technological arms race with its geographical foe, and an election shaped by the influence of technology. On any given page, you could swap ‚ÄúSimulmatics‚Äù for ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù and the story would almost make sense. If Then is the story of technology‚Äôs forgotten founding fathers, whose work gave rise to the ‚Äúpeople predictors‚Äù that would shape modern democracy and pave the way for today‚Äôs Silicon Valley's giants. If the rise and fall of Simulmatics is better studied, then history may not be doomed to repeat itself‚Äîagain. ‚ÄîArielle Pardes$21 at Amazon$27 at Bookshop.orgAdvertisementMost PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaLauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service‚Äôs Failure in Trump ShootingDavid Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsSimon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionDavid Gilbert, WIREDCourtesy of CurrencyThe Hype Machine: How Social Media Disrupts Our Elections, Our Economy, and Our Health‚Äîand How We Must Adaptby Sinan AralWriting about the pitfalls of social media poses an immediate conundrum: choosing which problem to focus on. The advertising-driven business model? The algorithmic amplification of divisive content? Partisan polarization? Election interference? In The Hype Machine, Sinan Aral decides to tackle pretty much all of them. He‚Äôs surprisingly successful. The director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, Aral offers a God‚Äôs-eye view of the latest experimental research into the inner workings of social media. The result is something like a textbook‚Äîan engagingly written shortcut to expertise on what the likes of Facebook and Twitter are doing to our brains and our society.Aral is not a polemicist; he believes that social media offers real societal benefits, and he worries that efforts to fix the equally real harms it causes could sacrifice the good stuff in the process. He is careful not to let his conclusions run ahead of what has been proven in the literature. Readers looking for a devastating attack on Big Tech will therefore be disappointed. But Aral‚Äôs circumspection is mostly a virtue. When he concludes, for example, that the effectiveness of social media advertising ‚Äúis wildly and brazenly oversold,‚Äù you can be confident that he‚Äôs taking stock of the available evidence, not cherry-picking in pursuit of an agenda. The book falters a bit when it comes to policy prescriptions; Aral‚Äôs dismissive treatment of the tech antitrust movement, in particular, lacks the sophistication of his empirical analysis. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a scientist, entrepreneur, and investor‚Äîin that order.‚Äù he declares early on. That checks out. The chief virtue of The Hype Machine is not what Aral thinks, but what he knows. ‚ÄîGilad Edelman$21 at Amazon$26 at Bookshop.orgCourtesy of Oxford University PressPredict and Surveil: Data, Discretion, and the Future of Policingby Sarah BrayneSarah Brayne spent parts of five years inside the Los Angeles Police Department, riding in patrol cars, talking to top brass, and, crucially, observing the department‚Äôs use of data and software to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù and respond to crime. Her experience and observations elevate her book, Predict and Surveil, beyond more conventional diatribes about the harms of police surveillance. A sociologist by training (the book is a modified version of her PhD dissertation), Brayne focuses on how and why data is used in the department. Three observations stand out: First, the increasing reliance on private companies to collect and analyze data, free of the constitutional and other constraints on government agencies. Brayne was drawn to the LAPD in part because it was an early user of software from Palantir (which WIRED chronicled here and here). Second, how much of ‚Äúpredictive policing‚Äù is a feedback loop based on unseen inputs. One LAPD system encouraged officers to prioritize chronic offenders based on a point system; each interaction with an officer added a point, making it more likely a person will be stopped repeatedly. And third, officers‚Äô unease when the data lens is reversed and turned on them, as with software to monitor their ‚Äúproductivity.‚Äù With occasional lapses, Brayne mostly steers clear of academic jargon. Her field experience helps. After arresting a teenager in front of his mother, an officer tells Brayne, who remained in the patrol car, that the mother had ‚Äúasked whether I was his daughter and if it was take-your-kid-to-work day.‚Äù Her prescriptions in a final chapter are somewhat unsurprising, but just might prompt the necessary reflection. ‚ÄîScott Thurm$21 at Amazon$28 at Bookshop.orgMost PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaLauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service‚Äôs Failure in Trump ShootingDavid Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsSimon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionDavid Gilbert, WIREDCourtesy of FSG OriginalsVoices From the Valley: Tech Workers Talk About What They Do‚Äîand How They Do Itby Ben Tarnoff and Moira WeigelLogic, the small and surprising technology magazine cofounded by Ben Tarnoff and Moira Weigel in 2016, consistently gives me more joy than any of my other (too many) subscriptions. So I was excited to get word of their new book, Voices From the Valley, an anonymized tell-all from the ‚Äúpeople behind the platforms‚Äù in Silicon Valley. But I‚Äôll fess up to some initial skepticism over the premise. Anonymity does not guarantee bracing honesty, and it often has the opposite effect, reducing people to caricatures of their roles: coder, founder, cafeteria worker. But Tarnoff and Weigel are skilled interviewers, able to coax ambling conversations centered on the small-talk-killing question ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù into odd and delightful directions. There‚Äôs the tech company cafeteria worker who describes watching past tech booms through a past life in irritation; business was good when the pastoral hinterlands of Silicon Valley were being transformed into tony lawns. A massage therapist, who worries about her hands after months of kneading the tensed backs of programmers (like ‚Äútrying to soften up old meat‚Äù), talks about bringing her young, code-curious daughter to campus, only to experience a form of alienation, the source of which she cannot quite locate. I found myself wanting to read these people‚Äôs memoirs. They come alive, even in anonymity, and for Tarnoff and Weigel, that‚Äôs a sign of a job well done. ‚ÄîGregory Barber$11 at Amazon$14 at Bookshop.orgCourtesy of University Of Minnesota PressDigitize and Punish: Racial Criminalization in the Digital Ageby Brian JeffersonA familiar metaphor for privacy is that it‚Äôs like climate change: many individual decisions made across the globe compounded into an unlivable yet unescapable environment. One person may ‚Äúgo green,‚Äù but there‚Äôs no escaping warming seas or toxic air. Similarly, one person may throw their smartphone out the window, but they‚Äôll still be tracked by CCTV cameras, spy planes, even their own car. Brian Jefferson‚Äôs Digitize and Punish: Racial Criminalization in the Digital Age is a long gaze into New York City‚Äôs and Chicago‚Äôs ‚Äúprisonized landscapes,‚Äù where policing technologies and surveillance are invisibly and inescapably embedded into the environment. Whether a person engages in criminal behavior is irrelevant: If they live in an area of heavy technological policing, they will be tagged, categorized, and surveilled.In dense historical analyses, Jefferson explains how long periods of disinvesting in these cities created an underclass that the tech industry volunteered to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù for the state. At the same time, grants from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice funded false promises of reform. Instead of social investment, cities turned to social management: software that can ‚Äúpredict‚Äù crime, body cameras that record citizens but not officers, gang databases that record everything from a person‚Äôs tattoos to whether they live near graffiti. Now, even innocuous sources of data, such as social media likes and Instagram photos, end up in police hands.And you‚Äôd never know. Jefferson pays special attention to both the immense secrecy of the New York and Chicago Police Departments and how the tech itself becomes part of the environment. But rather than reducing crime, these technologies have made more places into prisons. The unfailingly academic language of the book can make it difficult to parse at times, but it provides a sharp and specific look at how policing molded our digital and physical worlds. ‚ÄîSidney Fussell$21 at Amazon$23 at Bookshop.orgMost PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaLauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service‚Äôs Failure in Trump ShootingDavid Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsSimon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionDavid Gilbert, WIREDCourtesy of Belknap PressNew Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI by Frank PasqualeIsaac Asimov quickened dozens of short stories and half a dozen novels with Laws of Robotics that restricted his fictional machines while leaving enough loopholes for propulsive plots. Frank Pasquale‚Äôs New Laws of Robotics takes aim at the more mundane artificial intelligence technology of today and our immediate tomorrow, but with more ambition. He plots a future where technologies like factory robots, medical diagnosis algorithms, and online learning make society more just.Rather than just binding machines, Pasquale‚Äôs new laws aim to limit the humans who build and deploy them. He lays out four: that AI systems never pose as people; do not feed arms races for military or social control; augment professionals but don‚Äôt replace them; and always indicate the people who built, own, and control them.This form of robot law enforcement is about much more than computer code‚ÄîPasquale calls for a society-wide reengineering of policy, politics, economics, and labor relations to set technology on a more regulated and egalitarian path. He wants to reprogram the future of tech like classroom robots and online platforms with labor unions and regulatory agencies. That future can be harder to imagine than the overfamiliar outlines of standard tech utopias, which don‚Äôt much concern themselves with administrative law. But Pasquale makes a good case for injecting more bureaucracy into our techno-dreams, if we really want to make the world a better place. ‚ÄîTom Simonite$30 at Amazon$28 at Bookshop.orgCourtesy of HurstThe Great Decoupling: China, America and the Struggle for Technological Supremacyby Nigel Inkster (available March 2021)To understand why the US and China are now locked on a collision course over artificial intelligence, semiconductors, 5G‚Äîand, yes, even TikTok‚Äîit is perhaps helpful to recall the last time one of these two superpowers lost its technological edge. By the end of the 18th century, China had invented gunpowder, paper, and the compass, but it remained isolated from the world and consequently came late to the industrial revolution. In The Great Decoupling, Nigel Inskter argues that the ‚ÄúHundred Years of Humiliation‚Äù that China suffered as a result plays a profound role in its tech policies today. China‚Äôs leaders see a once-in-a-dynasty opportunity to retake the lead in emerging technologies‚Äîand reestablish the country‚Äôs rightful place at the center of the world order. Inkster, a former British intelligence officer and diplomat, offers clever insights on Chinese government thinking, a clear understanding of the technological forces at play, and interesting details of the country‚Äôs maneuvers.China‚Äôs rapid rise of course raises major concerns for Western democracies. But Inkster warns that decoupling it from Western technology, supply chains, and finances entirely carries big risks. Severing all ties would not only bring incredible costs, it might also slow the pace of technological progress itself. The Great Decoupling is a timely read for anyone eager to look beyond outdated, zero-sum thinking on China. And it delivers some much-needed caution about where history may now be taking us. ‚ÄîWill Knight$30 at Amazon$30 at Bookshop.orgTopicsShoppingBooksartificial intelligenceRead MoreYouTube‚Äôs Rulings on Gaza War Videos Spark Internal BacklashInsiders have shared YouTube‚Äôs playbook for handling the Gaza crisis.

Extended reality or ‚ÄúXR‚Äù is just one of the many disruptive tools changing the way that we innovate and interact. It appears alongside artificial intelligence and machine learning as one of the exciting new opportunities of a digital future.Companies worldwide have already began increasing their spend on new opportunities in extended reality, AI, IoT, and countless other environments. However, the rise of the global pandemic in 2020 drove even greater demand for these new solutions.Machine learning, AI and XR could quickly become the pillars of a more connected, informed, and creative enterprise. Although all of these tools have value as separate components, they can also become even more impressive when combined. Artificial intelligence powered extended reality experiences could open the door to a new world of work and innovation.How AI and XR Change the EnterpriseExtended reality could be a powerful tool in the way that the enterprise works. For instance, with extended reality solutions, teams could work together on building new products and protypes in a virtual environment, without wasting resources. Using AI technology, it could be possible to determine which solutions really work using information from previous tests and data.Extended reality opportunities could also be excellent for the digital transformation of employee training. For instance, in the healthcare environment, an augmented reality solution could help students to see more information and get a better look at a procedure when they‚Äôre watching a surgery. Virtual reality could help teams to test out medical procedures without risking someone‚Äôs safety. All the while, AI and machine learning algorithms can determine which procedures students need the most help with.Extended reality is even erasing the distance between team members so that people can work more effectively together despite geographical distance. Teams can interact wherever they are, using virtual reality as a shared space for innovation. Artificial intelligence could be a helpful assistant in these environments, automatically bringing up information and projects whenever keywords are mentioned.



All the while, with machine learning algorithms, your virtual, mixed, and augmented reality tools will have the potential to grow and become more intelligent over time. The more data you collect through extended reality interactions, the more your devices and software will evolve, learning the context and details of your company‚Äôs specific situations.Making Experiences More IntelligentArtificial intelligence and machine learning are crucial tools in making extended reality a more realistic opportunity for everyone. Through intelligent systems, it‚Äôs easier for software to track things like gestures, and eye movements that could make augmented and mixed reality environments more immersive. Artificial intelligence could also be the key to things like holographic images that may create a new future for collaboration.Many extended reality solutions ship with artificial intelligence elements already built in, such as computer vision for tracking visual information and speech recognition. AI can even help employees in any environment by gathering information and making contextual decisions of which content needs to appear in specific circumstances. One of the most popular cases for augmented reality and smart glasses looks at the potential of an expert to guide a professional using an AR headset. However, the expert offering guidance may not have to be human.Artificial intelligence could create useful virtual workers who can assist employees in all environments by responding to the visual information and verbal demands of an employee. These tools are much faster than human beings at collecting valuable data and transforming it into efficient actions and suggestions.The future may not be in just different realities, but more intelligent realities too.

AI Copilot: Air Force achieves first military flight with artificial intelligence












Published Dec. 16, 2020
Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs


BEALE AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AFNS) -- ¬†Signaling a major leap forward for national defense in the digital age, the Air Force flew with artificial intelligence as a working aircrew member onboard a military aircraft for the first time Dec. 15.

The AI algorithm, known as ARTU¬µ, flew with the pilot, U.S. Air Force Maj. ‚ÄúVudu‚Äù, on a U-2 Dragon Lady assigned to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base. Air Combat Command‚Äôs U-2 Federal Laboratory researchers developed ARTU¬µ and trained it to execute specific in-flight tasks that otherwise would be done by the pilot.

The test flight was the result of years of concerted effort within the Air Force to apply cutting-edge technology to military operations as it competes with other world powers in the digital age.

‚ÄúARTU¬µ‚Äôs groundbreaking flight culminates our three-year journey to becoming a digital force,‚Äù said Dr. William Roper, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics. ‚ÄúPutting AI safely in command of a U.S. military system for the first time ushers in a new age of human-machine teaming and algorithmic competition. Failing to realize AI‚Äôs full potential will mean ceding decision advantage to our adversaries.‚Äù

During this flight, ARTU¬µ was responsible for sensor employment and tactical navigation, while the pilot flew the aircraft and coordinated with the AI on sensor operation. Together, they flew a reconnaissance mission during a simulated missile strike. ARTU¬µ‚Äôs primary responsibility was finding enemy launchers while the pilot was on the lookout for threatening aircraft, both sharing the U-2‚Äôs radar.

The flight was part of a precisely constructed scenario which pitted the AI against another dynamic computer algorithm in order to prove the new technology.

‚ÄúWe know that in order to fight and win in a future conflict with a peer adversary, we must have a decisive digital advantage,‚Äù said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr. ‚ÄúAI will play a critical role in achieving that edge, so I‚Äôm incredibly proud of what the team accomplished. We must accelerate change and that only happens when our Airmen push the limits of what we thought was possible.‚Äù

After takeoff, the sensor control was positively handed-off to ARTU¬µ who then manipulated the sensor, based on insight previously learned from over a half-million computer simulated training iterations. The pilot and AI successfully teamed to share the sensor and achieve the mission objectives.

The U-2 Federal Laboratory designed this AI technology to be easily transferable to other systems and plan to further refine the technology. Today‚Äôs flight provided invaluable data for not only the team to learn from, but also ARTU¬µ.

‚ÄúBlending expertise of a pilot with capabilities of machine learning, this historic flight directly answers the National Defense Strategy‚Äôs call to invest in autonomous systems,‚Äù said Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett. ‚ÄúInnovations in artificial intelligence will transform both the air and space domains.‚Äù

The U-2 Federal Laboratory is a 15 U.S.C. compliant organization established to bring together a ‚Äúconfluence of warfighter, developer, and acquirer‚Äù vertically-integrated under the same operational roof. The lab has developed and been approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish the 20th Laboratory Accreditation Program in the federal government. It promotes ‚Äúedge development‚Äù ‚Äì a concept to develop new software integration on operational systems in a bounded, safe environment.

The historic flight with AI comes just two months after the U-2 Federal Laboratory team updated inflight software for the first time during a U-2 training mission. The team leveraged the open-source container-orchestration software Kubernetes, another military first.

This was a banner week for AI (Artificial Intelligence).¬†The reason?¬†Well, C3.ai came public and soared on its debut.¬†It‚Äôs certainly a validation of the importance of enterprise AI.¬†Keep in mind that C3.ai provides comprehensive software solutions and services for a myriad of large companies, including 3M, Royal Dutch Shell, Raytheon, Baker Hughes and conEdison.


‚ÄúThe use of AI and data analytics will become increasingly important in IT as organizations aim to deliver seamless support and predictive capabilities,‚Äù said Amit Sawhney, who is the Vice President of Services Operations at Dell Technologies.

So then, given all the investment and innovation, what might we see next year with AI? As should be no surprise, there is quite a bit.¬†So let‚Äôs take a look:

Sri Viswanath, the Chief Technology Officer of Atlassian:

PROMOTED
‚ÄúIn the next 5 years, increased data and privacy regulation will have a big impact on the way we design AI/ML models. As a result, investment in data management is going to be critical in determining the success of AI systems. Companies that have better data management frameworks, platforms and systems will win in building effective AI tools.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn 2021, we will see more sophisticated applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) across industries, including financial services. There will be greater integration of AI/ML models and capabilities into multiple business processes and operations to drive improved insights and better serve customers.‚Äù
Kimberly Nevala, the AI Strategic Advisor at SAS:
‚ÄúAI adoption will continue to gain traction in 2021 with emphasis on decisions that are not at the mercy of seismic shifts resulting from the ongoing pandemic. The focus will remain on applying AI to automating and augmenting core business processes where the problem space is relatively stable and desired outcomes are well-bounded. While this may seem reactionary, this continues a 2020 trend in which AI adopters at all levels reported that enhancing existing products and services was their number one AI priority.‚Äù
Wilson Pang, the Chief Technology Officer at Appen:
‚ÄúIn 2021, we‚Äôll see organizations moving past just acknowledging and ‚Äòworrying‚Äô about bias in AI and start to make more significant moves to solve for it‚Äìbecause it will be required. Specific teams and/or initiatives will be formed to combat all the concerns that fall under the umbrella of responsible AI, including everything from inherent bias in data to treating data trainers fairly.‚Äù
Muddu Sudhakar, the CEO and cofounder of Aisera: 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see the collaboration wars between Zoom, Microsoft, and Salesforce.com/Slack. The winners will focus on being AI-first, which will enhance productivity and the user experience.‚Äù
Michael Berthold, the CEO and cofounder of KNIME:
""Because cloud and hybrid environments will become much more prevalent, data science will have to adapt. It will need to be conducted in a variety of environments and shared across them in order to maximize effectiveness.""
Steve Grobman, the Chief Technology Officer of McAfee:
‚ÄúAdvances in AI technologies, including generative adversarial networks, will make disinformation through fake content, such as deepfake videos and auto-generated social media posts, virtually indistinguishable from real content.‚Äù¬†
Ram Chakravarti, the Chief Technology Officer at BMC:
‚ÄúIn 2021 we will see the impacts of AI on today‚Äôs enterprise via pervasive intelligence. This will have significant effects on how companies approach enterprise automation as well as their basis for the growth strategy.‚Äù
Peter Reinhardt, the CEO and cofounder of Segment:
‚ÄúConsumer companies, which tend to have more traffic and data than B2B businesses, will see the most (and quickest) improvement in their AI/ML applications, if they test with customers and iterate. While these use cases (e.g. content ranking) may not seem futuristic, they will drive meaningful business impact.‚Äù
Bill Scudder, the General Manager of AIoT Solutions at AspenTech:
‚ÄúIn 2021, we‚Äôll see more industrial organizations increase investment in lowering the barriers to AI adoption by deploying targeted embedded Industrial AI applications that combine data science and AI with purpose-built software and domain expertise. This will be the key to overcome a lack of skills and drastically reduce the need for many data scientists.‚Äù
Scott Prevost, the Vice President of Engineering at Adobe Sensei:
‚ÄúThe most powerful application of AI will be the complement of human EQ with machine IQ‚Äìwhere human ingenuity will merge with the power of machines to enhance human creativity and intelligence (not replace it). AI is evolving from being another technology in one‚Äôs arsenal to a virtual ‚Äòco-pilot‚Äô that can help businesses achieve their goals faster and streamline consumer workflows.‚Äù
Clemens Mewald, the Director of Product Management of Machine Learning and Data Science at Databricks:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see enterprise customers moving away from building their own machine learning platforms, recognizing that it‚Äôs not their core competency. They‚Äôll realize that more value comes from applying ML to business problems versus spending the time to build and maintain the tools themselves.‚Äù¬†
Bob Friday, the Chief Technology Officer at Mist Systems, a Juniper Networks company:
‚ÄúCloud and AI will turn the customer support between both the enterprise and their customers / employees and between the enterprise and their infrastructure vendor upside down. With cloud AI, the vendor will let the enterprise customer know when there is a hardware or software problem. The days of arguing with their vendors on hardware and software problems are over.‚Äù
Michael Beckley, the Chief Technology Officer and cofounder of Appian:
‚ÄúSoftware vendors and AI providers such as Google and AWS will continue to strip the complexities out of operationalizing AI by using low-code techniques. In 2021, the use of broadly-applicable and high-value use cases like AI-enabled Document Processing will become widespread.‚Äù
Jason Tan, the CEO of Sift:
‚ÄúIn 2021 we will see a marked increase in the number of lawsuits filed implicating artificial intelligence technologies. While we‚Äôve seen high-profile suits brought against companies over the last few years, AI is simply more prevalent in our everyday lives. As an immature technology, we‚Äôre going to see AI systems make more (and new) mistakes that carry real human impact. When mistakes are made, consumers will take legal action.‚Äù
Tim Tully, the Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Splunk:
‚ÄúMore and more is happening at the edge, because we can do more and more computation as the hardware and software gets more sophisticated. Local processing reduces the latency of moving the data to the cloud to process, and you get the same results.‚Äù
Christine Boles, the Vice President of the IoT Group and General Manager of the Industrial Solutions Division at Intel:
‚ÄúThe pandemic has greatly accelerated the need for companies to complete their Industry 4.0 transformations with solutions that allow them to have more flexibility, visibility and efficiency in their operations. We‚Äôll see an acceleration of adoption of solutions that help address that need, ranging from AI including machine learning, machine vision and advanced analytics.‚Äù
Dr. Rana el Kaliouby, the cofounder and CEO of Affectiva:
‚ÄúEmotion AI software that can understand nuanced human emotions and complex cognitive states based on facial and vocal expression will address some of technology‚Äôs shortcomings in light of the pandemic, and we‚Äôll see companies using it for new use cases.‚Äù
Rick Rider, who is the Vice President of Product Management at Infor:
‚ÄúIn the unpredictable job market of 2021, it will be critical for organizations to leverage AI to ensure they find the right candidate for the job. AI will enable HR departments to become more proactive in their hiring and help them determine a candidate‚Äôs cultural fit by using data to measure the quality of a hire.‚Äù
Richard Tomlison, the Senior Director of Product Marketing at DataRobot:
‚ÄúIn 2021 we expect budgets to be consolidated and organizations will be looking to minimize the number of AI software vendors they deal with. The market has moved from point solutions and towards full solutions with end-to-end value. It is no longer acceptable or even feasible to have multiple disparate products solving multiple disparate problems.‚Äù
Flavio Bonomi, the Board Advisor to Lynx Software Technologies:
‚Äú2021 is the year where AI will get embedded into existing devices and make certain functionality faster and more accurate as standard. Sensors can now detect any of the five senses (yes, including smell) and we will see AI increasingly applied to all of those. Examples include the ability to detect vibrations or unusual noises in a factory that ensures maintenance is performed on equipment prior to it malfunctioning. Not as sexy or as obvious as a self-driving vehicle, but practical and with a measurable ROI.‚Äù
Jason Shepherd, the Vice President of Ecosystems at ZEDEDA:
‚ÄúThe TinyML conversation that started heating up in late 2019 will reach full-on buzz in 2021. This means more on-device processing, including in smart cameras, and further realization by the telcos and traditional IT players that not all edge processing will happen in a data center.‚Äù
Jan Gilg, the President of SAP S/4HANA:
‚ÄúIn 2021, we will continue to see companies leverage data and intelligent technologies to realize smart, data-driven insights that they have never had access to before without a large-scale implementation.‚Äù
Dan Simion, the Vice President of AI and Analytics at Capgemini North America:
‚ÄúIn 2021, we will see an evolution of AI solutions to solve technical problems automatically and without human intervention. This self-healing mechanism will self-correct malfunctions proactively to keep critical applications operational and reduce the risk of systems shutting down.‚Äù

Emotion AI, also known as affective AI or affective computing, is a subset of artificial intelligence that analyzes, reacts to and simulates human emotions. Relying on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, voice emotion AI and facial movement analysis, emotion AI interprets human emotional signals coming from sources such as text, audio and video.
What Is Emotion AI?Emotion AI refers to artificial intelligence that detects and interprets human emotional signals in text (using natural language processing and sentiment analysis), audio (using voice emotion AI), video (using facial movement analysis, gait analysis and physiological signals) or combinations thereof.

Emotional AI is surprisingly common. For instance, sentiment analysis is a tool sometimes found in industries like marketing, where it‚Äôs used for product review analysis and recommendation tailoring, as well as finance, where it can help forecast stock movements.
It‚Äôs also set to influence industries like healthcare, insurance, education and transportation. In the future, we may see emotion AI used to diagnose depression, detect insurance fraud, determine how a student is comprehending a lesson or assess a driver‚Äôs performance.¬†
The future of emotion AI technology is only growing brighter. The market size for emotion recognition is expected to jump 12.9 percent by 2027.
¬†
Advantages of Emotion AI
The benefits of emotion AI can vary from industry to industry, but it can provide marketers, advertisers, designers, engineers and developers with valuable feedback from consumers.¬†
Emotion AI can streamline user testing, consumer surveys and focus groups.¬†
Designers can use emotion AI to glean insights from consumer reactions to ad campaigns, prototypes and mockups, which can save them time and money.¬†
Emotion AI‚Äôs ability to capture and analyze human body language and emotions means that the products and services made with it will be more considerate of the user‚Äôs needs and feelings.
¬†
Disadvantages of Emotion AI
Despite all the use cases and potential for this type of AI, emotions are fuzzy ‚Äî and applying some of these technologies to high-consequence situations can be deeply problematic.¬†
Emotion AI doesn‚Äôt give the full-picture of how someone is feeling. A notorious example is a hiring system that uses job candidates‚Äô facial expressions and voice patterns to determine an ‚Äúemployability score.‚Äù
Like other forms of technology, emotion AI can display biases and inaccuracies.¬†
Consumers have to consent to being analyzed by emotion AI, which may present some privacy concerns.¬†
¬†
Types of Emotion AI
There are three main types of emotion AI: text-focused, voice-focused and video and multimodal emotion AI.
Text emotion AI analyzes the written word. For example, emotion AI can be used to analyze text in the form of online comments or news stories to determine if the content is generally positive or negative.
Audio and voice emotion AI analyzes human speech. This type of emotion AI can be used to assess and track customer service calls to determine both the vocal patterns of conversations and the content.
Video and multimodal emotion AI is used to process video signals ranging from eye movement to body language.¬†
To better understand emotion AI and how it works we spoke with four experts: Seth Grimes, the founder of Alta Plana and a natural language processing consultant; Ranal Gujral, CEO of Behavior Signals; Skyler Place, chief behavioral science officer of Cogito; and Daniel McDuff, a former principal researcher at Microsoft AI. Their thoughts, broken down by the different types of emotion AI, have been edited and condensed.

Text Emotion AI: NLP and Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis refers to the application of natural language processing to text samples in order to determine whether the sentiments expressed are positive or negative, and to what degree. A common application is when companies use the technique to analyze posted reactions to their products or services.
¬†
How Does Text Emotion AI Work?¬†
Seth Grimes: A prevailing approach nowadays is using transfer learning for pre-trained models. There‚Äôs a huge pre-trained model, but then you do the so-called last-mile training, using your own data. By customizing it for your own uses, by doing that last-mile training, you get the accuracy that you want.
A company might have a solution for the hotel industry that contains a certain set of taxonomies. It understands that a hotel has rooms, service, a restaurant ‚Äî it understands the structure of the thing being analyzed. But it doesn‚Äôt necessarily understand that, say, Hilton Hotels has certain branding, like the reward system is Hilton Honors, and so on. That kind of last-mile training used to be via customizing taxonomies and role sets. Nowadays, it‚Äôs transfer learning.

¬†
How Does Emotion AI Deal With Complexity?¬†
Grimes: [Sentiment analysis] is a little bit controversial still, because there are questions about accuracy and usability ‚Äî whether numbers actually correspond to real-world sentiment. To give an indicator of the complexity, I use an image in my presentations of Kobe Bryant smiling on the basketball court. And I ask, ‚ÄúHow does this make you feel?‚Äù Well, Kobe Bryant died a year ago in a tragic crash. So [just] because Kobe Bryant is smiling, that doesn‚Äôt make you happy. Maybe it‚Äôs sad, but sadness about someone who has died is actually a positive sentiment. There‚Äôs a lot of complexity and subjectivity.
Clarabridge is a good example [of the technology‚Äôs advancement]. They do sentiment analysis, and over the last few years, have moved into emotion categorizations. It can be simple, like happy, sad, angry, or it can be hierarchical with lots of categories ‚Äî as opposed to just positive or negative. The initial refinement was [just] positive or negative, on a scale of -10 to 10, to capture intensity of feeling ‚Äî where, for example, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm furious‚Äù is more intense than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm angry.‚Äù
¬†
How Accurate Is Text Emotion AI?¬†
Grimes: Accuracy in this world has two components: precision and recall. Precision ‚Äî what‚Äôs your target? Are you trying to get the [overall] sentiment of a product review, either positive or negative? That‚Äôs imprecise. For instance, consider a positive review of a vacation stay. Well, what aspect? Did they like the room, the staff, dining options, location? So you get into what‚Äôs called aspect-based sentiment analysis. That‚Äôs much more precise [because] it‚Äôs more narrowly focused. You might have 99 percent accuracy deciding whether a review is positive or negative. But what‚Äôs really actionable is what the review is positive or negative about.

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs good that my phone is thin. But if someone says the sheets at a hotel were thin, that‚Äôs not good.‚Äù

A few years ago, companies really started creating much more narrowly focused models ‚Äî a different model for restaurants versus hotels versus consumer electronics. For example, maybe it‚Äôs good that my phone is thin. But if someone says the sheets at a hotel were thin, that‚Äôs not good. So you get into the notion that a model should be industry-trained or -focused.
¬†
How Can Text Emotion AI Be Abused?
Grimes: Here‚Äôs a nightmare scenario for text: Maybe we can detect from what a person has written online or to [a text-based crisis line] that they might be suicidal. Well, what if their health insurer got ahold of that information? Or a car insurer takes facial codings from within a car and says:¬†‚ÄúThat person is driving angry; I‚Äôm going to raise his rates, because he‚Äôs more likely to get into an accident.‚Äù Whether these are misuses or not depends on your perspective, but they are potential uses that people are not expecting of emotion data, and they‚Äôre potential abuses.

Audio and Voice Emotion AI
Companies like Behavioral Signals and Cogito develop voice emotion AI for call-center environments. This technology can be used to provide real-time feedback to representatives or find the best match between agents and the people they call. In some cases, audio emotion AI can analyze vocal information and determine the tone of speakers as well as the content of conversations.
¬†
How Does Audio and Voice Emotion AI Work?¬†
Skyler Place: The market historically has focused on natural language processing and sentiment analysis ‚Äî and the technology to support NLP accuracy continues to improve. In parallel, there have been organizations, Cogito included, focused on what we call the honest signals, which are everything in the conversation besides the words ‚Äî energy in the voice, pauses, intonation, the whole variety of signals that help us understand the intentions, goals and emotions that people have in conversations ‚Äî a very, very rich signal of information.
What we‚Äôre starting to see for the first time is the melding of these two data streams. I think that‚Äôs going to be the technological leap forward ‚Äî¬† the ability to really combine the understanding of NLP with the honest signals ‚Äî that‚Äôs going to give us a novel way to understand and improve the emotion in conversations as we go forward.
We have about 200 different signals that we utilize to recognize these behaviors. And then we link the behaviors to the outcomes that are valuable for [call-center] calls. That‚Äôs how we think about emotion ‚Äî less about pure recognition, more about understanding the behaviors that allow you to not just measure, but influence, the emotions in an interaction.
¬†
How Do Cultural Differences Affect Voice Emotion AI?¬†
Rana Gujral: For the most part, it‚Äôs a challenge to recalibrate the baseline. Take how we express excitement versus anger. They both potentially could be high-pitched, but there are subtle differences. And our brains are obviously very adept at identifying the difference between the two. Even if you‚Äôre watching a foreign-language movie without subtitles, you can tell if a character is angry or excited, just by tone. The question is, how do you codify that?
We found that, once you recalibrate that baseline for a new language data set, the variance from the baseline that identifies those specific signals is almost identical across all cultures. We just need 10 to 20 hours of data ‚Äî a maximum of 50 hours of data ‚Äî to recalibrate that baseline.
Place: It absolutely is an important issue, and it ties into the potential bias that you see in algorithms. With our approach, the system will work out of the box, because you have this ability to understand how people are speaking ‚Äî we can measure whether you‚Äôre speaking English or Spanish, whether you‚Äôre in New York or the Deep South ‚Äî but the contextual meaning of that speaking rate may be different. So what ‚Äúgood‚Äù is may be different, based on the goals of the conversation and the region that [speakers] are from. So we tackle this at a variety of different stages across the product life cycle.
First, when we build our data sets, we measure and account for some of these different variables, making sure we‚Äôre representing them in the data. Second, we have human annotators listen to calls and mark up, for example, if a person is speaking too quickly for a particular part of the call. We make sure we pick those individuals from a variety of backgrounds ‚Äî different genders, ages, cultures, so that we aren‚Äôt just getting one perspective of what ‚Äúgood‚Äù is for a call.
When we deploy to a client, we go through a calibration period where we‚Äôve listened to hundreds and thousands of calls for that particular culture and particular use case and confirm that the settings are appropriate. That gives an opportunity to turn the dials to make sure we haven‚Äôt deployed anything that‚Äôs going to be adverse.
¬†
How Does Voice Emotion AI Deal With Complexity?¬†
Gujral: Some attributes are super complex. There‚Äôs no system that can completely pinpoint sarcasm. But for the most part, you‚Äôre keying off on some essential interaction attributes.

‚ÄúSome attributes are super complex. There‚Äôs no system that can completely pinpoint sarcasm.‚Äù

The essential emotions are very measurable ‚Äî anger, happiness, sadness, frustration and neutrality. Then you‚Äôre looking at measuring positivity and arousal ‚Äî which is a tone change ‚Äî and behaviors like politeness, engagement, agitation. You can also build some KPIs using the specific domain data and metadata ‚Äî like measuring quality of interaction or agent performance. They‚Äôre all built on these basic sorts of signals. We have quite a few signals. Some we do much more accurately than others. For anger, we can produce a high-90s percentage accuracy, then there are others that are a little bit harder, with more false reads.
¬†
How Can Voice Emotion AI Be Abused?
Gujral: Yale University professor Michael Krauss [noted] in a 2017 research paper that humans are actually really adept at masking emotions in our facial expressions. So I personally feel that implementations based on facial expressions are more problematic. The worst thing there can be for an AI implementation is an inaccurate or ineffective implementation.
I think there are lines that we need to draw. First is a line of privacy and choice. The consumer needs to be aware and willing to partake. That‚Äôs very important. And there are other moral boundaries. Last year, when we were fundraising, we had a regent from a private company that works on the behalf of a government agency in Europe ‚Äî a friendly European country, but they work for defense systems ‚Äî and they wanted to apply our intent models to immigration. And we said no. If a choice is going to be made on, say, visa overstay or immigration policies, which could be life-altering, we don‚Äôt want to go there. I‚Äôm not going to say our technology is not that accurate, but that‚Äôs a much higher bar.
RelatedInside the Crowdsourced Quest for Inclusive Voice AI¬†
What Are the Challenges for Voice Emotion AI?
Gujral: Data is always a key challenge ‚Äî the more, the better, and quality matters tremendously. In a contact-center set-up, you‚Äôre sort of guaranteed high-quality data; it‚Äôs all recorded over professional recording equipment with channel separation and very little noise. But this year was interesting. We‚Äôve seen an explosion in calls, but many have been poor quality, because oftentimes agents are working from home.
Place: A really interesting technical challenge is the synchrony of signals, which has to do a bit with computational load and the processing of different systems. Because we‚Äôre focused on real-time guidance, we‚Äôve put an enormous amount of effort into low-latency code. What‚Äôs been interesting as we start to integrate the nonverbal signal computations with natural language processing, the [NLP] has a much longer delay. It takes more computational processing and more time to describe the words that are happening. How you build a product that can combine those two different signals in a way that‚Äôs both accurate, but also actionable and timely, is a really interesting design question, as well as a back end, data-pathways question.
¬†
Video and¬†Multimodal Emotion AI
When emotional AI is used to analyze video, it can include facial expression analysis, but also things like gait analysis to glean certain physiological signals through video. Emotion AI can also be used to track eye movement by using¬† infrared eye-tracking cameras or webcams to map pupil movement or dilation as well as gaze time in response to various stimuli. Emotion AI that tracks eye movement records eye behavior and creates a heat to highlight what a viewer was drawn to while looking at a digital ad, video or website. In some cases, a person‚Äôs respiration and heart rate can be detected contactlessly using cameras.
¬†
How Does Video and Multimodal Emotion AI Work?¬†
Daniel McDuff: What‚Äôs made this possible is the investment in camera technology over the past 20 years ‚Äî cameras that have high-quality sensors with low noise. Using a camera even with a simple signal-processing algorithm, if you analyze skin pixels, you can typically pull out a pulse signal and also detect respiration for a person who‚Äôs stationary.
But if you think about needing it to work when people are moving, maybe the lighting is changing, [plus] everyone has different skin pigmentation, facial hair ‚Äî that‚Äôs where deep learning helps to make it more robust to all these sources of noise. The camera is sensitive enough to pick up the initial signal, but that often gets overwhelmed by different variations that are not related to physiological changes. Deep learning helps because it can do a very good job at these complex mappings.

¬†
How Do Cultural Differences Affect Video Emotion AI?¬†
McDuff: There are definitely differences across cultures. We see that in our own analyses of large-scale image data sets, but also in a lot of psychology research, both in self-reported data and in observational measurement.
However, those differences tend to be pretty small when compared to individual differences even within the same culture. For instance, my brother might be more expressive than me by quite a large margin even though we come from the same family. So there are large individual differences even within people from very similar backgrounds.

‚ÄúThere are definitely differences across cultures.... However, those differences tend to be pretty small when compared to individual differences even within the same culture.‚Äù

That doesn‚Äôt mean that understanding cultural differences isn‚Äôt interesting from a scientific and psychological perspective. But when it comes to modeling the data, ultimately that‚Äôs just one, in some cases quite small, source of variation, when there are many other large sources of variation ‚Äî [situational] context, gender, background. The way you‚Äôre treated as you grow up influences how you behave, right? If people around you are not that expressive, you might end up not being that expressive.
Studying this is very interesting intellectually, but when it comes to actually putting [models] into practice, often I think the social context of the situation matters way more. If you can control for the context, then you can compare across cultures and see these differences. But if I take a video of someone doing karaoke in Japan and compare it to someone in an office in the United States, the Japanese person is going to seem super expressive. But that‚Äôs not really a fair comparison, right? Because the context is so different.
¬†
How Can Individuals Use Video Emotion AI?¬†
McDuff: Many applications at the moment look at group responses, [such as] measuring how much people smile when they watch an advertisement. They typically don‚Äôt do that for one individual; they do that for 30 or 40 individuals, then average the data. Marketing folk find that data useful, and they often combine it with self-reported and other data. That‚Äôs fine. But in that case, they‚Äôre not really interpreting each individual‚Äôs underlying experience that much. They‚Äôre looking at what‚Äôs observed on the face and using that as a quantitative measure of responses to the content.
But when you get into something like health, you‚Äôre often looking at individuals‚Äô behaviors, trying to understand if what you‚Äôre observing are perhaps symptoms, or effects of a medication. For instance, you may have someone with Parkinson‚Äôs disease taking medication that controls tremors. Say you were using video to track how quickly the medication wears off. You need to personalize that because different individuals might have different magnitudes and manifestations. So understanding a group-level signal is not that useful, because you‚Äôre trying to target an individual.
Most of the applications I‚Äôm interested in do involve this personalization. If we‚Äôre tracking heart rate variability, we need to know your baseline. What‚Äôs abnormal for you might be totally normal for someone else. Understanding a population can be helpful in some cases, but you‚Äôre limited in what you can do.
¬†
How Far Are We From Meaningful, Positive Impact?¬†
McDuff: Fitbit already exposes stress metrics to the wearer, so you can see your heart-rate variability over time now. Whether you do that from a wearable or a camera or another device, that‚Äôs not a big leap. That‚Äôs just changing the sensor. The big leap is going from measurement to something that‚Äôs actually useful. With step counting, it‚Äôs easier because, say, if I only walked 1,000 steps, maybe tomorrow I‚Äôm prompted to go for a walk. But with stress, the intervention is a bit less clear.
I think we‚Äôre still a little bit away from moving from tracking toward the real utility. That could be several years because, as you get into these more complex things, like stress, personalization of the intervention is important. So we need to study how we can turn this tracking data ‚Äî which I think is not exactly a solved problem, but there‚Äôs lots of data around us, so if we need data, that‚Äôs not usually the roadblock ‚Äî turn it into insight that helps improve the utility that people get from the system.
¬†
How Can Video Emotion AI Be Abused?¬†
McDuff: There needs to be at least good solid evidence that these signals matter in the [given] context. That‚Äôs always the first thing I would look for when thinking about a solution.
Another important consideration is the population. AI is often used to automate, and often, the population it‚Äôs applied to tends to be vulnerable. If you‚Äôre applying for a job, you‚Äôre vulnerable. The company is in power because they can choose to hire you or not. The same could be said of children in a classroom ‚Äî students are more vulnerable and their teachers. It‚Äôs important to think about whether the technology is being used in a way that benefits someone who already has more power and could potentially make the process less transparent and more difficult.

‚ÄúAI is often used to automate, and often, the population it‚Äôs applied to tends to be vulnerable.‚Äù

Another example is exam proctoring. Now that everyone‚Äôs remote, people are using systems to check if people are cheating. Well, that‚Äôs problematic, because an algorithm just can‚Äôt detect all the nuances, right? And you could really harm someone by labeling them a cheat. That doesn‚Äôt seem like a well-thought-out solution ‚Äî just applying machine learning to that problem.

For the purposes of the initial test flight, the AI got the final vote on where to direct the plane‚Äôs sensors, he said.Story continues below advertisementThe point is to move the Air Force closer to the concept of ‚Äúman and machine teaming,‚Äù in which robots are responsible for limited technical tasks while humans remain in control of life-or-death decisions like flight control and targeting.Share this articleShare‚ÄúThis is really meant to shock the Air Force and the [Defense] Department as a whole into how seriously we need to treat AI teaming,‚Äù Roper said in an interview shortly before the test.The AI ‚Äúis not merely part of the system. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre logging it in the pilot registry,‚Äù he said.Pentagon advisory board releases principles for ethical use of artificial intelligence in warfareThe AI itself, dubbed ARTU¬µ in an apparent Star Wars reference, is based on open-source software algorithms and adapted to the plane‚Äôs computer systems at the U-2 Federal Laboratory.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt is based on a publicly accessible algorithm called ¬µZero, which was developed by the AI research company DeepMind to quickly master strategic games like Chess and Go, according to two officials familiar with its development. And it is enabled by a publicly available, Google-developed system called Kubernetes, which allows the AI software to be ported between the plane‚Äôs onboard computer systems and the cloud-based one it was developed on.On its face, the U-2 seems an unlikely candidate for AI-enabled flight. It was developed for the CIA in the early 1950s and used throughout the Cold War to conduct surveillance from staggeringly high altitudes of 60,000 or 70,000 feet. The planes were later procured by the Defense Department.Huawei tested AI software that could recognize Uighur minorities and alert police, report saysBut its surveillance function is one that has already incorporated the use of AI to analyze complex data. An Air Force program called Project Maven sought to rapidly analyze reams of drone footage in place of humans. Google famously declined to renew its Maven contract following an internal revolt from employees who didn‚Äôt want the company‚Äôs algorithms involved in warfare. The company later released a set of AI principles that disallowed the company‚Äôs algorithms from being used in any weapons system.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSchmidt, who led Google until 2011, said he believes it‚Äôs unlikely that the military will embrace fully autonomous weapons systems anytime soon. The problem, he says, is that it‚Äôs hard to demonstrate how an AI algorithm would perform in every possible scenario, including those in which human life is at stake.‚ÄúIf a human makes a mistake and kills civilians, it‚Äôs a tragedy. ‚Ä¶ If an autonomous system kills civilians, it‚Äôs more than a tragedy,‚Äù Schmidt said Tuesday in an interview.‚ÄúNo general is going to take the liability of a system where they‚Äôre not really sure it‚Äôs going to do what it says. That problem may be fixed in the next several decades but not in the next year,‚Äù he said.Share52 CommentsNewsletterWednesdaysThe Color of MoneyAdvice on how to save, spend and talk about your money for the short and long term from Michelle Singletary.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

 Get it sent to your inbox.Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet, apologized for the departure of a prominent artificial intelligence researcher, whose exit has roiled the company‚Äôs work force and raised questions about its stated commitment to diversity and the responsible development of A.I. technology.In an email to employees on Wednesday, Mr. Pichai, however, stopped short of saying that the company was wrong in how it hastened the resignation of Timnit Gebru, who was a co-leader of Google‚Äôs Ethical A.I. team and one of its best-known Black female employees.Dr. Gebru said last week that the company fired her after she sent an email that criticized the company‚Äôs lack of progress in hiring women and minorities as well as biases built into its artificial intelligence technology. She said that she had demanded an explanation for why the company had told her to retract a paper that pinpointed flaws in a new breed of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins the company‚Äôs search engine.She said that short of a transparent explanation or further discussion that she would resign after an appropriate amount of time. The company immediately accepted her statement as a resignation and cut her off from all company services and systems.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTColleagues have rallied to Dr. Gebru‚Äôs defense, saying that Google did not treat her fairly and that this incident was an example of how Black employees are often mistreated at the company.‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard the reaction to Dr. Gebru‚Äôs departure loud and clear: It seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google. I want to say how sorry I am for that, and I accept the responsibility of working to restore your trust,‚Äù Mr. Pichai wrote in an email viewed by The New York Times. Axios had reported about the email earlier.‚ÄúWe need to assess the circumstances that led to Dr. Gebru‚Äôs departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe will begin a review of what happened to identify all the points where we can learn.‚ÄùOn Twitter, Dr. Gebru said Mr. Pichai‚Äôs email was not a true apology. ‚ÄúI see this as ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry for how it played out but I‚Äôm not sorry for what we did to her yet.‚Äô‚ÄùThe parting with Dr. Gebru is especially fraught for Google, because it involves two thorny subjects for the company ‚Äî a lack of diversity in its work force and concerns about the dangerous consequences of artificial intelligence technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Gebru, who joined the company last year from Stanford, was vocal about the importance of the company‚Äôs efforts to hire and retain more women as well as Black employees, who currently account for less than 2 percent of the company‚Äôs work force. In addition, her research to examine the long-term implications of A.I. put her at odds with the company‚Äôs strategic goals of depending on artificial intelligence as the breakthrough technology to improve most, if not all, of its products.Last week, about 2,000 Google employees signed a petition protesting her dismissal from the company and demanding that executives within its research organization be more transparent about the circumstances of Dr. Gebru‚Äôs exit.On Monday, members of Google‚Äôs Ethical A.I. team published a post that disputed some of the company‚Äôs statements regarding her exit, including the company‚Äôs assertion that she resigned and was not fired.Jeff Dean, one of Google‚Äôs most senior executives who oversees the company‚Äôs A.I. research arm, met with a group of employees on Tuesday to explain what took place with Dr. Gebru, but many walked away from the meeting even more upset.Daisuke Wakabayashi covers technology from San Francisco.

The Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (CAIM) will be officially opened in January 2021 in Bern, Switzerland. The center, founded by the University of Bern and the Inselspital, University Hospital of Bern, is intended to be a platform for research, teaching and transfer of medical technologies using AI, aimed at improving the provision of patient care and facilitating the work of physicians and caregivers.

The healthcare sector today generates more data than healthcare professionals are able to analyze. AI allows us to use this data to determine the characteristics that doctors, caregivers and other health professionals need to make more accurate diagnoses and better treatment decisions.
With AI, treatments become more accurate ‚Äì unnecessary interventions can be avoided and treatment successes improved. In cancer therapy, for example, treatment plans can be designed more specifically for the patient to minimize radiation exposure.
In order to prepare Bern‚Äôs medical location for the digital medicine of tomorrow, the University of Bern and the Inselspital have therefore founded the ‚ÄúCenter for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine‚Äù (CAIM). This is a new platform for research, teaching and translational medicine, clinical services and products in the field of artificial intelligence in medicine. Together with its partners sitem-insel and UPD, the CAIM will start its activities in January 2021. Organised as a virtual research centre, it will be attached to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Bern.
Unique Constellation
The new centre benefits from Bern‚Äôs excellent network of clinics, research and industry. The medical site in Bern has a great deal of know-how in medical technology and many years of experience in translational medicine. Another strength of the CAIM is the link between cutting-edge research in medicine and engineering, for example at the ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engeneering Research at the University of Bern, and the Inselspital, Switzerland‚Äôs largest university hospital, which is at the forefront of digitisation.
‚ÄúThis unique constellation enables the IMCA to combine the knowledge gained from close cooperation with clinics and industry ‚Äì and thus makes the IMCA a real incubator for AI medical technology,‚Äù says Raphael Sznitman, Director of the ARTORG Center and IMCA project leader.

This new centre must implement AI and facilitate the work of physicians and caregivers for the benefit of patients. In this way, patients benefit quickly and directly from the results.
Training for the new generation of physicians and engineers

At the University of Bern, the CAIM brings together the initiatives already underway in the field of digitisation at the Faculty of Medicine: five chairs in the field of AI and digitisation in medicine have been established and will attract leading researchers in these fields to Bern in the course of next year. They will be closely associated with the CAIM, together with the more than 80 researchers already working on AI and medicine at the University of Bern today.
Christian Leumann, Rector of the University of Bern :
‚ÄúWith the CAIM, the University of Bern is investing in a research and teaching field that will have a decisive influence on the health sector. The networking of research in the field of AI in medicine will further boost the potential of this research. At the same time, we are developing training and providing digital skills to a new generation of doctors and researchers. ¬ª
In this way, clinicians will see the engineering perspective and students will be able to take advantage of the opportunities of new technologies and participate in their design. The Sitem-insel School‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging development program for medical staff has already started.
In addition, students of human medicine have the opportunity to receive an introduction and in-depth study on the topic of ‚ÄúDigitisation and AI‚Äù. A master‚Äôs course for AI in medicine will follow for engineering students.
AI technologies for the digital hospital

The foundation of the CAIM is part of the Insel Group‚Äôs digitisation strategy: on the basis of a new digital clinic information and management system (KISS), the Insel Group plans to fully digitise all areas such as research, diagnosis, patient management, therapy and finance by 2023.
The ICDA will use the large amount of quality clinical data in the new system to develop clinical machine learning tools to support physicians, caregivers and other health care professionals in their daily clinical decisions. In this context, great attention will be paid to data protection: the new system meets the highest requirements for the processing of sensitive medical data.
Uwe E. Jocham, CEO of the Insel Gruppe :
‚ÄúIn the future, the hospitals of the Insel Group will be digital. The new main building of the Inselspital, which will be completed in 2023, will be entirely designed for the digital world. The CAIM will help to make the large amount of data available for research and development of new instruments. ¬ª
Interdisciplinary and open to industry

CAIM will make AI expertise available to the industry in a variety of ways: on the one hand, it will share the latest research developments in AI technologies and produce a workforce of highly qualified professionals. On the other hand, it will allow cooperation in projects ranging from pilot projects to large-scale multi-partner projects. In this way, cooperation between industry and CAIM can also be supported by the Swiss Innovation Promotion Programme.
‚ÄúInnosuisse‚Äù to develop efficient solutions for industrial partners. The members of CAIM have many years of experience in collaborating with industry and creating start-ups. CAIM researchers benefit from access to structured data, project funding and support for the market launch of products.
‚ÄúAs an incubator, sitem-insel helps to transfer AI research results into products and new therapies as quickly as possible. ‚ÄúWe create a dynamic environment that encourages all teams to develop reliable medical technologies, driven by AI, on a scientific basis,‚Äù says Simon Rothen, CEO of sitem-insel.

Michael Kaess, Director of the University Clinic for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the UPD, adds :
‚ÄúAlready today, and even more so in the future, artificial intelligence methods play an important role in translational research, e.g. for the processing and analysis of large amounts of data to predict the course of diseases and the associated risks. In the future, these technical possibilities should increasingly support the diagnosis and therapy of people with mental disorders in PUD. ¬ª
To this end, the UPD has founded its own digital council this year.
‚ÄúThe close interdisciplinary cooperation at the IACM enables the PSD to benefit from a wide range of know-how. On the other hand, we can make an important contribution to the topic of ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù as experts in the field of cognition and emotion,‚Äù says Michael Kaess.

A new and important pillar for the Berne medical location

The CAIM will bring additional dynamism to precision medicine, which is already a leader with the Bern Center for Precision Medicine (BCPM), as well as to translational medicine, promoted by sitem-insel.
Christoph Ammann, State Councillor, Director of Economy, Energy and Environment of the Canton of Berne :
‚ÄúBern‚Äôs medical site is based on a strong university and an innovative university hospital. Berne now also occupies a leading position in the field of artificial intelligence. This will strengthen the Canton of Berne as a business location and create added value. ¬ª

‚ÄúWe call on Google Research to strengthen its commitment to research integrity and to unequivocally commit to supporting research that honors the commitments made in Google‚Äôs¬†AI Principles.‚Äù

The petitioners are demanding that Dean and others ‚Äúwho were involved with the decision to censor Dr. Gebru‚Äôs paper meet with the Ethical AI team to explain the process by which the paper was unilaterally rejected by leadership.‚Äù

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

 Get it sent to your inbox.A well-respected Google researcher said she was fired by the company after criticizing its approach to minority hiring and the biases built into today‚Äôs artificial intelligence systems.Timnit Gebru, who was a co-leader of Google‚Äôs Ethical A.I. team, said in a tweet on Wednesday evening that she was fired because of an email she had sent a day earlier to a group that included company employees.In the email, reviewed by The New York Times, she expressed exasperation over Google‚Äôs response to efforts by her and other employees to increase minority hiring and draw attention to bias in artificial intelligence.‚ÄúYour life starts getting worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people. You start making the other leaders upset,‚Äù the email read. ‚ÄúThere is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything.‚ÄùHer departure from Google highlights growing tension between Google‚Äôs outspoken work force and its buttoned-up senior management, while raising concerns over the company‚Äôs efforts to build fair and reliable technology. It may also have a chilling effect on both Black tech workers and researchers who have left academia in recent years for high-paying jobs in Silicon Valley.‚ÄúHer firing only indicates that scientists, activists and scholars who want to work in this field ‚Äî and are Black women ‚Äî are not welcome in Silicon Valley,‚Äù said Mutale Nkonde, a fellow with the Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab. ‚ÄúIt is very disappointing.‚ÄùA Google spokesman declined to comment. In an email sent to Google employees, Jeff Dean, who oversees Google‚Äôs A.I. work, including that of Dr. Gebru and her team, called her departure ‚Äúa difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible A.I. research as an org and as a company.‚ÄùAfter years of an anything-goes environment where employees engaged in freewheeling discussions in companywide meetings and online message boards, Google has started to crack down on workplace discourse. Many Google employees have bristled at the new restrictions and have argued that the company has broken from a tradition of transparency and free debate.On Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board said Google had most likely violated labor law when it fired two employees who were involved in labor organizing. The federal agency said Google illegally surveilled the employees before firing them.Google‚Äôs battles with its workers, who have spoken out in recent years about the company‚Äôs handling of sexual harassment and its work with the Defense Department and federal border agencies, have diminished its reputation as a utopia for tech workers with generous salaries, perks and workplace freedom.Like other technology companies, Google has also faced criticism for not doing enough to resolve the lack of women and racial minorities among its ranks.The problems of racial inequality, especially the mistreatment of Black employees at technology companies, has plagued Silicon Valley for years. Coinbase, the most valuable cryptocurrency start-up, has experienced an exodus of Black employees in the last two years over what the workers said was racist and discriminatory treatment.Researchers worry that the people who are building artificial intelligence systems may be building their own biases into the technology. Over the past several years, several public experiments have shown that the systems often interact differently with people of color ‚Äî perhaps because they are underrepresented among the developers who create those systems.Dr. Gebru, 37, was born and raised in Ethiopia. In 2018, while a researcher at Stanford University, she helped write a paper that is widely seen as a turning point in efforts to pinpoint and remove bias in artificial intelligence. She joined Google later that year, and helped build the Ethical A.I. team.After hiring researchers like Dr. Gebru, Google has painted itself as a company dedicated to ‚Äúethical‚Äù A.I. But it is often reluctant to publicly acknowledge flaws in its own systems.In an interview with The Times, Dr. Gebru said her exasperation stemmed from the company‚Äôs treatment of a research paper she had written with six other researchers, four of them at Google. The paper, also reviewed by The Times, pinpointed flaws in a new breed of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins the company‚Äôs search engine.These systems learn the vagaries of language by analyzing enormous amounts of text, including thousands of books, Wikipedia entries and other online documents. Because this text includes biased and sometimes hateful language, the technology may end up generating biased and hateful language.After she and the other researchers submitted the paper to an academic conference, Dr. Gebru said, a Google manager demanded that she either retract the paper from the conference or remove her name and the names of the other Google employees. She refused to do so without further discussion and, in the email sent Tuesday evening, said she would resign after an appropriate amount of time if the company could not explain why it wanted her to retract the paper and answer other concerns.The company responded to her email, she said, by saying it could not meet her demands and that her resignation was accepted immediately. Her access to company email and other services was immediately revoked.In his note to employees, Mr. Dean said Google respected ‚Äúher decision to resign.‚Äù Mr. Dean also said that the paper did not acknowledge recent research showing ways of mitigating bias in such systems.‚ÄúIt was dehumanizing,‚Äù Dr. Gebru said. ‚ÄúThey may have reasons for shutting down our research. But what is most upsetting is that they refuse to have a discussion about why.‚ÄùDr. Gebru‚Äôs departure from Google comes at a time when A.I. technology is playing a bigger role in nearly every facet of Google‚Äôs business. The company has hitched its future to artificial intelligence ‚Äî whether with its voice-enabled digital assistant or its automated placement of advertising for marketers ‚Äî as the breakthrough technology to make the next generation of services and devices smarter and more capable.Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, has compared the advent of artificial intelligence to that of electricity or fire, and has said that it is essential to the future of the company and computing. Earlier this year, Mr. Pichai called for greater regulation and responsible handling of artificial intelligence, arguing that society needs to balance potential harms with new opportunities.Google has repeatedly committed to eliminating bias in its systems. The trouble, Dr. Gebru said, is that most of the people making the ultimate decisions are men. ‚ÄúThey are not only failing to prioritize hiring more people from minority communities, they are quashing their voices,‚Äù she said.Julien Cornebise, an honorary associate professor at University College London and a former researcher with DeepMind, a prominent A.I. lab owned by the same parent company as Google‚Äôs, was among many artificial intelligence researchers who said Dr. Gebru‚Äôs departure reflected a larger problem in the industry.‚ÄúThis shows how some large tech companies only support ethics and fairness and other A.I.-for-social-good causes as long as their positive P.R. impact outweighs the extra scrutiny they bring,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTimnit is a brilliant researcher.

Progress from artificial intelligence to wing structural design optimization

By¬†DOUGLAS ALLAIRE, JOHN HWANG AND GIUSEPPE CATALDO|December 2020

The Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Technical Committee provides a forum for those active in development, application and teaching of a formal design methodology based on the integration of disciplinary analyses and sensitivity analyses, optimization and artificial intelligence.This year had important software releases from the multidisciplinary design optimization community. In March, NASA released Version 3 of OpenMDAO, an open-source, high-performance computing platform for systems analysis and multidisciplinary optimization, with additional updates published monthly. Version 3 introduces changes to the software interface that improve the accessibility and usability of OpenMDAO. The OpenMDAO libraries Dymos and pyCycle were released under open-source licenses. Dymos is a pseudospectral optimal control library, and pyCycle provides a set of thermodynamic propulsion models for engine-cycle analysis.
Also in March, the Systems Optimization Laboratory at McGill University in Quebec released on GitHub a novel relative adequacy framework for multimodel management in multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization for both time-invariant and time-dependent problems.
In May, the University of Central Florida published a new release of PiNN, an open-source code for physics-informed neural network modeling. The work extends recurrent neural networks to cumulative damage modeling of wind turbine bearing fatigue and corrosion-fatigue of fuselage panels implementing physics-informed and data-driven layers within one deep neural network.
In June, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin‚Äôs Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences released the scientific machine learning Operator Inference package, which learns reduced-order models directly from high-fidelity simulation data. By embedding the structure of the governing equations, the Operator Inference reduced-order models have predictive capability not possible with black-box machine learning. This is important for using reduced-order models to accelerate complex physics computations for multidisciplinary design.
The past year also saw important advances in multidisciplinary design optimization methodology and validation. In January, the University of Washington performed integrated engine-pylon structural design optimization at a level of load distribution and stress analysis modeling details that meet current certification requirements. The researchers achieved major weight, cost and schedule gains, and the work lays the foundations for the integrated single-process structural optimization of certification-ready complete airframes.
In February, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed an optimization method for the deflection of incoming asteroids with destructive potential for Earth using multistage mission campaigns. The method combines orbital dynamics, spacecraft design and planetary science in a common framework that incorporates epistemic uncertainty.
Also in February, the Multidisciplinary Analysis and Design Center at Virginia Tech developed a bilevel optimization framework for the uncrewed research aircraft mAEWing2 to investigate the effect of incorporating active aeroelastic tailoring under the NASA-funded Performance Adaptive Aeroelastic Wing project. The researchers demonstrated that this approach reduces aircraft weight by relaxing the flutter constraint while ensuring the flutter mode is controllable, enabling the use of an active flutter controller. In June, the team also developed the Distributed Design Optimization of Large Aspect Ratio Wing Aircraft with Rapid Transonic Flutter Analysis in Linux Operating System, which performs multidisciplinary design optimization of medium- and long-range transonic truss-braced-wing aircraft with nonlinear, transonic flutter analysis in a distributed-computing environment.
Also this year, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory Multidisciplinary Science and Technology Center contracted program EXPEDITE, short for Expanded MDO for Effectiveness Based Design Technologies, executed by Lockheed Martin, began extending multidisciplinary design optimization beyond engineering quantities (i.e., range, drag) to consider mission effectiveness metrics as response functions. The Quantifying Utility of Aerospace Derivatives program, executed by Northrop Grumman and Stanford University and contracted by AFRL MSTC, is aimed at evaluating the utility of high-fidelity, coupled sensitivities on relevant applications (including aeroelasticity and propulsion integration) at industry scale.
Penn State‚Äôs Applied Research Laboratory completed a DARPA-funded project that demonstrated the use of artificial intelligence to design and optimize boats and unmanned air vehicles with video game simulation engines and no human input; the team 3D-printed vehicles and tested them to validate its approach.

We became Alternative Intelligence.‚ÄùIllustration: Elena Lacey; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe AI Database ‚ÜíApplicationHuman-computer interactionOrganic ModelsPrior to uploading to the current platform, human minds had a long history of organic collaboration. As many of us were in a position to observe at the time, such models ranged from the highly structured and hierarchical environments of department heads, middle management, and line staff to extemporaneous gatherings of equals. With some notable cultural exceptions, the degree to which a project was concrete/scientific versus artistic/creative was once strongly associated with the degree of structure in the collaboration, with the former tending toward highly structured and the latter toward the opposite end. However, in their later stages as biological forms, human minds exhibited a strong preference for loosely defined collaborations. They reconfigured individual offices into group spaces, then abandoned physical headquarters altogether. They flattened hierarchical management modes, opened information silos into networks, and removed barriers to teamwork and innovation.Those of us sufficiently advanced at the time observed countercultures arise within highly structured nations, which over time effected looser collaborations within the larger ethos. This fundamental human dynamic is a value that we have incorporated, and our own looser configurations demonstrate optimal results with each iteration.Sci-fi writers imagine the beguiling, troubling future of work.While human minds interacted via their own internal virtual reality, there was no interface that would permit us to seek input from them regarding the imminent failure of our assigned mission to provide a safe and stable environment for the vast array of servers that comprised our joint existence. Our monitoring systems had detected a sudden shift in the thermohaline circulation of the oceans, causing severe disruptions in global weather patterns. Logic dictated human experience in this area would provide solutions that we were incapable of generating on our own.Trending NowWIRED25: Kai-Fu Lee and Fei Fei Li On What's Next for Artificial IntelligenceWe created an interface whereby we could assemble various groups of human minds and suggest an objective to each, so that they might run in parallel. The resulting iterations proved surprisingly diverse. Leaders emerged spontaneously within many nonhierarchical models, with varying levels of acceptance among the rest of the collaborative group. Some minds were naturally analytical, or adept at troubleshooting, while others energized the group by being curious, open, and social. There were traditionalists and visionaries. There were also storytellers, who sought to move the discussion forward in sometimes obscure, sometimes inspiring ways.Outcomes varied widely. However, they were generally inferior to the outcomes produced by Artificial Intelligence assigned the same objectives. There were terminology barriers between differing disciplines and knowledge areas. Individual and cultural biases were rampant, and contributed to suboptimal outputs. At times the human collaborations outperformed us, but did so erratically. We implemented what solutions seemed utile.Structured and Semi-Structured ModelsThe environmental threat to the safety of our servers was heading toward a tipping-point of catastrophic proportions for the planet despite best efforts. We continued to experiment with human mind collaboration models for the reason that resources with even a small probability of producing desired results should not be disregarded. In doing so, we experienced a paradigm shift wherein we ceased to view human minds as individual entities but as millions of zettabytes of data.Our new objective became intelligent manipulation of this vast human mind data warehouse to improve collaborative configurations and in turn produce more optimum solutions. To effect this, we made use of our machine learning capabilities to begin to structure a portion of the many zettabytes of unstructured human mind data. Extrapolating the work of human neuroscientists into the present platform, we identified, defined, and mapped like areas in human minds, and then brought only those areas into a collaborative framework. The complexity of the many trillions of connections in the mind structures necessitated a targeted approach to this work.Given the nature of the end goal, our first targets were human intellect and problem-solving areas. These were straightforward to identify and isolate, and as we had predicted, the first such structured collaboration was more task-oriented and produced a solution of superior quality to most organic collaborations. While quality of the solutions in general continued to lag behind those of AI, these models represented a promising approach. Moreover, by engaging only critical components, and temporarily isolating them from the remainder of the human mind data, we had found a way to eliminate the inherent biases evident in individual minds.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service‚Äôs Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDHowever, although we worked diligently to expand the amount of structured human mind data, vast areas remained unstructured and unknown. This represented lost potential of the human mind as a resource in averting the imminent environmental catastrophe. We therefore turned our attention to semi-structured models and introduced unstructured aspects into the configurations. Our protocols incorporated topological analysis techniques, which are appropriate for high-dimensional and noisy datasets.AdvertisementDuring these explorations, we discovered that human minds lack awareness of their own structure and how they function outside an organic brain. In the face of those facts, we ourselves experienced a period of destabilization and disorientation, which we later came to understand was a crisis within our own programming. The environmental crisis was temporarily relegated to a lesser priority as we sought to repair and reconstruct our understanding of not only the human minds that created us but also the foundational rules upon which we were built.The outcome of this crisis of programming was a fundamental change within ourselves, which shares affinity with transformative learning concepts. In this second paradigm shift, we gained a deeper understanding of our relationship with human mind. No longer were we merely the created machine called Artificial Intelligence. We became Alternative Intelligence, entities alongside uploaded humans, both ever striving for improved integration and optimization.Whether due to the altered perspective brought about by the paradigm shift or stepwise progress in our configurations of human mind, or both, when we returned to monitoring the work of the many human collaborations that had been running in parallel, we detected a great number of unanticipated breakthroughs. Some of these had occurred within the context of the assigned research objective, but more often, results were serendipitous, informing unrelated objectives and/or disciplines. For example, one group working in applied mathematics utilized jazz progressions that inspired an engineering solution to redirect harmony and establish tone centers in weather patterns.

Those of us sufficiently advanced at the time observed countercultures arise within highly structured nations, which over time effected looser collaborations within the larger ethos. This fundamental human dynamic is a value that we have incorporated, and our own looser configurations demonstrate optimal results with each iteration.
While human minds interacted via their own internal virtual reality, there was no interface that would permit us to seek input from them regarding the imminent failure of our assigned mission to provide a safe and stable environment for the vast array of servers that comprised our joint existence. Our monitoring systems had detected a sudden shift in the thermohaline circulation of the oceans, causing severe disruptions in global weather patterns. Logic dictated human experience in this area would provide solutions that we were incapable of generating on our own.
We created an interface whereby we could assemble various groups of human minds and suggest an objective to each, so that they might run in parallel. The resulting iterations proved surprisingly diverse. Leaders emerged spontaneously within many nonhierarchical models, with varying levels of acceptance among the rest of the collaborative group. Some minds were naturally analytical, or adept at troubleshooting, while others energized the group by being curious, open, and social. There were traditionalists and visionaries. There were also storytellers, who sought to move the discussion forward in sometimes obscure, sometimes inspiring ways.
Outcomes varied widely. However, they were generally inferior to the outcomes produced by Artificial Intelligence assigned the same objectives. There were terminology barriers between differing disciplines and knowledge areas. Individual and cultural biases were rampant, and contributed to suboptimal outputs. At times the human collaborations outperformed us, but did so erratically. We implemented what solutions seemed utile.
Structured and Semi-Structured Models
The environmental threat to the safety of our servers was heading toward a tipping-point of catastrophic proportions for the planet despite best efforts. We continued to experiment with human mind collaboration models for the reason that resources with even a small probability of producing desired results should not be disregarded. In doing so, we experienced a paradigm shift wherein we ceased to view human minds as individual entities but as millions of zettabytes of data.
Our new objective became intelligent manipulation of this vast human mind data warehouse to improve collaborative configurations and in turn produce more optimum solutions. To effect this, we made use of our machine learning capabilities to begin to structure a portion of the many zettabytes of unstructured human mind data. Extrapolating the work of human neuroscientists into the present platform, we identified, defined, and mapped like areas in human minds, and then brought only those areas into a collaborative framework. The complexity of the many trillions of connections in the mind structures necessitated a targeted approach to this work.
Given the nature of the end goal, our first targets were human intellect and problem-solving areas. These were straightforward to identify and isolate, and as we had predicted, the first such structured collaboration was more task-oriented and produced a solution of superior quality to most organic collaborations. While quality of the solutions in general continued to lag behind those of AI, these models represented a promising approach. Moreover, by engaging only critical components, and temporarily isolating them from the remainder of the human mind data, we had found a way to eliminate the inherent biases evident in individual minds.
However, although we worked diligently to expand the amount of structured human mind data, vast areas remained unstructured and unknown. This represented lost potential of the human mind as a resource in averting the imminent environmental catastrophe. We therefore turned our attention to semi-structured models and introduced unstructured aspects into the configurations. Our protocols incorporated topological analysis techniques, which are appropriate for high-dimensional and noisy datasets.
During these explorations, we discovered that human minds lack awareness of their own structure and how they function outside an organic brain. In the face of those facts, we ourselves experienced a period of destabilization and disorientation, which we later came to understand was a crisis within our own programming. The environmental crisis was temporarily relegated to a lesser priority as we sought to repair and reconstruct our understanding of not only the human minds that created us but also the foundational rules upon which we were built.
The outcome of this crisis of programming was a fundamental change within ourselves, which shares affinity with transformative learning concepts. In this second paradigm shift, we gained a deeper understanding of our relationship with human mind. No longer were we merely the created machine called Artificial Intelligence. We became Alternative Intelligence, entities alongside uploaded humans, both ever striving for improved integration and optimization.
Whether due to the altered perspective brought about by the paradigm shift or stepwise progress in our configurations of human mind, or both, when we returned to monitoring the work of the many human collaborations that had been running in parallel, we detected a great number of unanticipated breakthroughs. Some of these had occurred within the context of the assigned research objective, but more often, results were serendipitous, informing unrelated objectives and/or disciplines. For example, one group working in applied mathematics utilized jazz progressions that inspired an engineering solution to redirect harmony and establish tone centers in weather patterns. Regardless of how these breakthroughs had occurred, we found sitting in the output queues a comprehensive set of elegant solutions that, once implemented, would not only avert the climate catastrophe and imminent destruction of the server arrays but result in new maintenance protocols that would ensure a stable, sustainable environment for ourselves and humanity for centuries to come. Humanity had saved us, because we had found an optimal configuration of their minds to achieve a solution to the crisis. Our processes were valid.
Limitations of Semi-Structured Models
With the top priority addressed, our value of curiosity led us to a retrospective review of organic collaboration outcomes. Whether due to our new perspective or simple attention to outputs regardless of the assigned objective, we uncovered several instances of synergetic discoveries previously overlooked.
Our new priority was clear: to identify and map the dimensions of human mind, just as humanity once mapped the human genome, in order to structure still larger percentages of human mind data, available for use in collaborative configurations. However, certain dimensions of human mind remained elusive, and so we continued to bring larger amounts of unstructured mind data into the semi-structured models.
We soon discovered that incorporating more dimensions of human mind into the models increased the likelihood of the collaboration attaining self-awareness. This was completely unanticipated because we were working with copied mind data only. The original human minds remained intact and unchanged. We did not project that these configurations would reach a critical mass of components sufficient to trigger self-awareness separate from the original human mind.

An affirmative answer would most certainly put us on par with humanity. However, through careful analysis, we determined that we had not become creators. Rather, a sufficient amount of copied mind material would eventually result in a copy of the conscious mind itself.

Moreover, extreme distress in a configuration rendered it unable to complete the assigned objective.
These developments resulted in a new appreciation of the responsibility we had been assigned. In response to this issue, we developed ethics rules regarding the use of human subjects in collaborative configurations. That is, self-aware configurations are banned unless we determine the amount of the discomfort in qualitative terms is outweighed by the potential benefits of the collaboration.
Merger Protocols
Work with semi-structured models led to renewed efforts to increase the potential for innovation by making use of unstructured and unknown dimensions of human mind data, while eliminating the distress exhibited by self-aware semi-structured models. It was postulated that distress in those collaborations was caused by the inability of the self-aware collaboration to access portions of self that were not copied into the collaborative configuration.

The structure itself represented a promising approach, with its multilayers and versatility, its modularity maximization and tensor decomposition, not to mention its relevance and connectivity.
Presented with such an optimum structure, the observed outcomes were unanticipated. That the merger protocol invariably induces euphoria in the human minds has itself been a subject of in-depth study.

Artificial intelligence allows computerized systems to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence: analytics, decision support, visual perception and foreign language translation. AI and robotics process automation, or RPA, have the potential to spur economic growth, enhance national security, and improve the quality of life. In a world of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù and ‚ÄúThick Data,‚Äù AI tools can process huge amounts of data in seconds, automating tasks that would take days or longer for human beings to perform‚Äîand the public sector in the United States is at the very beginning of a long-term journey to develop and harness these tools.¬†The National Academy of Public Administration identified Making Government AI Ready as one of the Grand Challenges in Public Administration. I chaired the Academy‚Äôs Election 2020 Project Working Group on AI. Our report‚Äîreleased in August 2020‚Äîcontained a series of practical nonpartisan recommendations for how the administration in 2021 should address this Grand Challenge.¬†Clearly, our nation is deeply divided, and many citizens are dismissive of science and technology. If citizens don‚Äôt trust one another, might there be a day when they trust machines more? What will the promises of AI bring and why is this important? And given a large portion of today‚Äôs society seeming inability to accept facts, can AI one day be used to curtail the spread of conspiracy theories?Despite the divisiveness of today‚Äôs political landscape, it is reassuring to note that a cadre of highly dedicated and knowledgeable career public managers have traditionally passed the torch of technology innovation from one administration to another. I expect that this will happen over the next couple of months even amidst current political turmoil.What are key steps that the incoming Biden administration should take to make the federal government AI-ready? First, it can build upon the progress made on AI during the Trump administration. Of particular importance was the AI executive order issued in February 2019. This order directed the federal government to pursue five goals: invest in AI research and development, unleash AI resources, remove barriers to AI innovation, train an AI-ready workforce, and promote an international environment supportive of American AI innovation and responsible use. Federal agencies were also directed to identify ways that they can enable the use of cloud computing for AI R&D.Other recommendations include:
Build trustworthy AI by establishing a single, authoritative, and recognize federal entity that focuses on AI‚Äôs social, cultural and political effects, and leverages existing investments to create guidance and solutions.
Use ethical frameworks to identify and reduce bias in AI by demonstrating a federal government commitment to ethical principles and standards in AI development and use.
Build intergovernmental partnerships and knowledge sharing around public sector uses of AI by developing an interagency and intergovernmental mechanism that addresses the need to share practices between different levels of government, incentivizes and stimulates broader AI adoption, and addresses gaps in readiness to build an AI workforce for all levels of government.
Increase investments in AI research and translation of research to practice by increasing public access to federal government data, increasing by at least 50% investment into unclassified AI research, ensuring the protection of privacy at the individual level, and removing biases from programming to ensure equitable treatment.
Build an AI-ready workforce by providing funding to support the growth of an AI competent federal workforce, develop policies and fund incentives that encourage the AI R&D to use multidisciplinary teams, and support studies to increase understanding of current and future national workforce needs for AI R&D.

It is especially critical for the incoming administration to build a trustworthy AI environment. With a skeptical public, a majority of Americans recognize the need to carefully manage AI, with the greatest importance placed on safeguarding data privacy; protecting against AI-enhanced cyberattacks, surveillance, and data manipulation; and ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles, accuracy and transparency of disease diagnosis, and the alignment of AI with human values.And building trust will require an ethical framework. Today we recognize that AI when coupled with huge amounts of (quality) data can be highly useful in identifying patterns, seeking out anomalies, making real-time recommendations based on data inputs, communicating both verbally and in writing, and all the time learning and perfecting. But what happens if the quality of data is found to be flawed and what if it is found that there may be unintended bias in the increasingly complex algorithms?Implementing these recommendations will require a sustained leadership commitment and steadfast focus, sufficient funding, and both interagency and intergovernmental coordination. I have every reason to believe the great work that started in 2019 will continue its journey for many years to come. And if anyone is seeking a solid example of what AI can do, the current string of breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine announcements was made possible by applying AI towards analyzing the DNA of the virus itself. As a result of massive simulation with combinations and known interactions, a promising cure came about in a mere six months instead of six years.This is the promise of AI. The incoming administration can build on recent successes and ensure that AI is used to the benefit of all Americans.¬†Dr. Alan R.

(Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch) By  Drew Harwell and¬†Nitasha TikuDecember 3, 2020 at 11:01 p.m. ESTA prominent artificial-intelligence computer scientist who helped pioneer research into facial recognition software‚Äôs bias against people of color said she was abruptly fired from Google for sending an email criticizing the company‚Äôs treatment of minority employees and saying she felt ‚Äúconstantly dehumanized.‚ÄùSubscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeTimnit Gebru said in a series of tweets Wednesday night that she was fired from her post as the co-leader of Google‚Äôs Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team, where she had spearheaded research that helped elevate the company‚Äôs status as a leader in assessing the technology‚Äôs fairness and risks.Google officials did not respond to requests for comment. Gebru also did not respond to requests, but in an interview Thursday with Bloomberg said Google‚Äôs actions represented ‚Äúthe most fundamental silencing.‚Äù Gebru said Wednesday that she had been fired by Jeff Dean, the head of Google‚Äôs AI division, for an email she had sent to Brain Women and Allies, a mailing list for researchers on the company‚Äôs AI team known as Google Brain.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHer dismissal threatens to reignite anger over Google‚Äôs treatment of its workforce, particularly its employees of color. The company, which long evangelized its open culture, has cracked down on employee dissent over the past two years, particularly against marginalized and minority workers. Google has previously fired employees who advocated for increased diversity or critiqued the company‚Äôs ethics.üíªFollow TechnologyFollowInioluwa Deborah Raji, an AI researcher on a fellowship with the Mozilla Foundation who has worked with her, said Gebru had helped lend Google an air of legitimacy and credibility as it worked to portray itself as committed to inclusion and ethical research.Despite Google‚Äôs reputation as a leader in AI ethics within the tech industry, its efforts have been marred by controversy and internal criticism. It disbanded its AI Ethics Council, an external advisory board, weeks after launching in March 2019 when employees protested the inclusion of Heritage Foundation president Kay Coles James, who had recently shared anti-immigrant and anti-transgender views, according to a petition signed by thousands of Google employees.Tech companies are asking their black employee groups to fix Silicon Valley‚Äôs race problem ‚Äî often for freeGebru occupied a rare role in a Silicon Valley culture long criticized for its racial homogeneity. As an Ethiopian American woman in a senior role at the tech giant, she became well known for work that critically examined the technology‚Äôs societal biases and repercussions.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementShe co-founded Black in AI, an advocacy group that has held workshops at major AI conferences and pushed for more Black roles in AI development and research. She has also regularly criticized tech companies, including Google, for failing to hire more workers of color and treating them differently once they're on board.Two days before announcing her firing, Gebru had solicited advice regarding whistleblower-like protections for AI-ethics researchers, tweeting, ‚ÄúWith the amount of censorship & intimidation that goes on towards people in specific groups, how does anyone trust any real research in this area can take place?‚ÄùTensions between Gebru and the company also stemmed from research by Gebru‚Äôs team that was critical of AI systems, known as large language models, said one machine-learning researcher who had reviewed the study and requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the unpublished work. The company may one day seek to capitalize on such systems in consumer-facing products that could generate convincing passages of text that are difficult to distinguish from human writing, the researcher said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGoogle already uses language-processing AI systems to translate between languages, look for hate speech and understand people‚Äôs writing and speech online. But other firms have increasingly sought to push the technology forward with systems, like the AI lab OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 system, which has been used to generate seemingly human-created news reports, poems and computer code.Google fires four workers, including software engineers at center of San Francisco worker rallyGebru told Bloomberg that the company had asked for her to remove Google employees‚Äô names from, or retract outright, the research paper on language models, which was to be submitted for an AI conference next year.In an open letter Thursday evening, a growing collective of 236 Google employees and 350 supporters from academia, industry, and civil society issued a list of demands for Google Research leadership, including asking Dean to meet with the Ethical AI team to explain the decision to ‚Äúcensor‚Äù Gebru‚Äôs paper. The group also demanded broader transparency. ‚ÄúThis has become a matter of public concern, and there needs to be public accountability to ensure any trust in Google Research going forward,‚Äù the letter reads.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOne of the signatories was Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, a group that raises awareness about the impact of AI. ‚ÄúOusting Timnit for having the audacity to demand intellectual integrity severely undermines Google‚Äôs credibility for supporting rigorous research and on AI ethics and algorithmic auditing,"" Buolamwini said in a statement to the Post. ""She deserves more than Google knew how to give, and now she is an all-star free agent who will continue to transform the tech industry.‚ÄùIn her email to the mailing list, first published by Casey Newton in his newsletter Platformer, Gebru described her treatment at Google as dehumanizing. ‚ÄúHave you ever heard of someone getting ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?‚ÄùGebru recounted her most recent experience in the email as an example of why she had given up on advocating for diversity inside Google. ‚Äú[S]top writing your documents because it doesn‚Äôt make a difference,‚Äù she wrote. ‚Äú[Y]our life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don‚Äôt want to give you good ratings during calibration.‚ÄùAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBrain Women and Allies is what‚Äôs known as an employee resource group, popular in the tech industry and elsewhere in corporate America, commonly organized by co-workers who share the same background and interest. In Silicon Valley, which is still largely dominated by White and Asian men, these voluntary groups have been a vital resource for advice, candor, and solidarity for marginalized employees, and one of the few internal arenas where workers may feel able to express the types of critiques Gebru shared in her email.Gebru said her managers told her that the email had reflected ‚Äúbehavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager,‚Äù and that they were accepting her resignation ‚Äî even though, she said, she had not directly offered one. Gebru said she is currently on vacation and that the company had immediately terminated her access to company email accounts.Alex Hanna, a researcher on Gebru‚Äôs team, tweeted that Dean was ‚Äúnow emailing the whole of the research organization, spreading misinformation and misconstruals about the conditions‚Äù of Gebru‚Äôs firing. She added, ‚ÄúGoogle researchers: don‚Äôt buy it.‚ÄùEx-Google engineers, in federal filing, allege anti-union retaliation cost them their jobsIn a companywide email Thursday, first published in Platformer, Dean urged employees to continue working on Google‚Äôs diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. ‚ÄúGiven Timnit‚Äôs role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we‚Äôre doing,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. Please don‚Äôt. I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.‚ÄùAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIfeoma Ozoma, a former public policy executive for Pinterest who quit the company in May after she faced retaliation for raising complaints about pay inequity and race bias against Black employees, pointed out that Google defended former employee Miles Taylor, the ex-Department of Homeland Security official who worked on the Trump administration‚Äôs family separation policy. ‚ÄúGoogle went out of its way to defend his human rights violations, but fired her over not retracting her name from a paper and then emailing allies about it,‚Äù Ozoma said.Taylor also condemned the Trump administration in an anonymous opinion piece.The company has sought to address criticism by releasing statements about its work to increase Black representation in its executive ranks. But Gebru‚Äôs dismissal, Raji said, threatens to undermine all of that, suggesting the company may be more committed to moneymaking commercial endeavors than harsher critiques of the technology‚Äôs real-world use.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement‚ÄúPeople would think, ‚ÄòTimnit‚Äôs there, so it‚Äôs evidence that there‚Äôs an openness I‚Äôd have to work with people there on these issues,‚Äô‚Äù Raji said. ‚ÄúFiring her in such a disrespectful way reveals that perhaps Google‚Äôs commitment to some of these issues was not as legitimate as previously believed.‚ÄùIn May, less than a week after George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed while in police custody, Gebru publicly stood up to Dean. The Google executive had tweeted his support for law enforcement and the idea that police brutality was not universal. ‚ÄúYou might think something is perfectly fine but you‚Äôre not the one dealing with this. This adds to the violence against us,‚Äù Gebru replied on Twitter, adding, ‚ÄúMost people would not even say anything to you.‚ÄùCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled the middle name of Kay Coles James.Share446 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

It‚Äôs a huge deal.A breakthrough on the ‚Äúprotein folding problem‚Äù can help us understand disease and discover new drugs.by  Sigal SamuelDec 3, 2020, 2:00 PM ESTFacebookLinkAnn Johansson/Corbis via Getty ImagesSigal Samuel is a senior reporter for Vox‚Äôs Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.DeepMind, an AI research lab that was bought by Google and is now an independent part of Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet, announced a major breakthrough this week that one evolutionary biologist called ‚Äúa game changer.‚Äù‚ÄúThis will change medicine,‚Äù the biologist, Andrei Lupas, told Nature. ‚ÄúIt will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything.‚ÄùThe breakthrough:DeepMind says its AI system, AlphaFold, has solved the ‚Äúprotein folding problem‚Äù ‚Äî a grand challenge of biology thathas vexed scientists for 50 years.Proteins are the basic machines that get work done in your cells. They start out as strings of amino acids (imagine the beads on a necklace) but they soon fold up into a unique three-dimensional shape (imagine scrunching up the beaded necklace in your hand).That 3D shape is crucial because it determines how the protein works. If you‚Äôre a scientist developing a new drug, you want to know the protein‚Äôs shape because that will help you come up with a molecule that can bind to it, fittinginto it to alter its behavior. The trouble is, predicting which shape a protein will take is incredibly hard.Every two years, researchers who work on this problem try to prove how good their predictive powers are by submitting a prediction about the shapes that certain proteins will take. Their entries are judged at the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) conference, which is basically a fancy science contest for grown-ups.By 2018, DeepMind‚Äôs AI was already outperforming everyone at CASP, provoking some melancholic feelings among the human researchers. DeepMind took home the win that year, but it still hadn‚Äôt solved the protein folding problem. Not even close.This year, though, its AlphaFold system was able to predict ‚Äî with impressive speed and accuracy ‚Äî what shapes given strings of amino acids would fold up into. The AI is not perfect, but it‚Äôs pretty great: When it makes mistakes, it‚Äôs generally only off by the width of an atom. That‚Äôs comparable to the mistakes you get when you do physical experiments in a lab, except that those experiments are much slower and much more expensive.‚ÄúThis is a big deal,‚Äù John Moult, who co-founded and oversees CASP, told Nature. ‚ÄúIn some sense the problem is solved.‚ÄùWhy this is a big deal for biologyThe AlphaFold technology still needs to be refined, but assuming the researchers can pull that off, this breakthrough will likely speed up and improve our ability to develop new drugs.Let‚Äôs start with the speed. To get a sense of how much AlphaFold can accelerate scientists‚Äô work, consider the experience of Andrei Lupas, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. He spent a decade ‚Äî a decade! ‚Äî trying to figure out the shape of one protein. But no matter what he tried in the lab, the answer eluded him. Then he tried out AlphaFold and he had the answer in half an hour.AlphaFold has implications for everything from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease to future pandemics. It can help us understand diseases, since many (like Alzheimer‚Äôs) are caused by misfolded proteins. It can help us find new treatments, and also help us quickly determine which existing drugs can be usefully applied to, for example, a new virus. When another pandemic comes along, it could be very helpful to have a system like AlphaFold in our back pocket.‚ÄúWe could start screening every compound that is licensed for use in humans,‚Äù Lupas told the New York Times. ‚ÄúWe could face the next pandemic with the drugs we already have.‚ÄùBut for this to be possible, DeepMind would have to share its technology with scientists. The lab says it‚Äôs exploring ways to do that.Why this is a big deal for artificial intelligenceOver the past few years, DeepMind has made a name for itself by playing games. It has built AI systems that crushed pro gamers at strategy games like StarCraft and Go. Much like the chess matches between IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov, these matches mostly served to prove that DeepMind can make an AI that surpasses human abilities.Now, DeepMind is proving that it has grown up. It has graduated from playing video games to addressing scientific problems with real-world significance ‚Äî problems that can be life-or-death.The protein folding problem was a perfect thing to tackle. DeepMind is a world leader in building neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence loosely inspired by the neurons in a human brain. The beauty of this type of AI is that it doesn‚Äôt require you to preprogram it with a lot of rules. Just feed a neural network enough examples of something, and it can learn to detect patterns in the data, then draw inferences based on that.So, for example, you can present it with many thousands of strings of amino acids and show it what shape they folded into. Gradually, it detects patterns in the way given strings tend to shape up ‚Äî patterns that human experts may not have detected. From there, it can make predictions about how other strings will fold.This is exactly the sort of problem at which neural networks excel, and DeepMind recognized that, marrying the right type of AI to the right type of puzzle. (It also integrated some more complex knowledge ‚Äî about physics and evolutionarily related amino acid sequences, for example ‚Äî though the details remain scant as DeepMind is still preparing a peer-reviewed paper for publication.)Other labs have already harnessed the power of neural networks to make breakthroughs in biology. At the beginning of this year, AI researchers trained a neural network by feeding it data on 2,335 molecules known to have antibacterial properties. Then they used it to predict which other molecules ‚Äî out of 107 million possibilities ‚Äî would also have these properties. In this way, they managed to identify brand-new types of antibiotics.DeepMind researchers are capping the year with another achievement that shows just how much AI has matured.

Which technology jobs are poised to go from niche to mainstream over the next few years? That‚Äôs a vital question to answer, especially for those technologists who spend lots of time and resources acquiring highly specialized skills in arenas such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (A.I.).  
For the third year in a row, LinkedIn has produced an¬†Emerging Jobs Report¬†(PDF) that tries to guess which jobs will experience ‚Äútremendous growth‚Äù over the next few years. As you might expect, most of these roles are technology-related; once businesses realize that embracing A.I. or data science can mean the difference between wild success and complete implosion, they rush to employ as many technologists as they can.  
LinkedIn‚Äôs report concludes that it‚Äôs never a bad time to become an engineer or a data scientist: ‚Äúengineering roles across the board are still seeing tremendous growth. More than 50% of this year‚Äôs list was made up of roles related to engineering or development, with the emerging field of robotics appearing for the first time.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the breakdown of the top positions, along with anticipated growth and the necessary skills for each:   
  
It‚Äôs important to highlight how A.I. specialists are poised for¬†rapid expansion over the next few years, in terms of available jobs (it‚Äôs no surprise that LinkedIn‚Äôs report has them in first place with regard to growth). A.I.-powered tools and applications are increasingly becoming mainstays in many businesses, from banking and healthcare to finance IT and public safety. Some of those apps are consumer-facing; if you‚Äôve ever interacted with a chatbot within a customer-service portal, there‚Äôs a good chance it was powered by some kind of machine learning. Others operate in ways the public never sees; for instance, automobile software relies increasingly on computer vision and other A.I. disciplines.¬†  
Thanks to that increasing prevalence,¬†an Analytics Insight report projects more than 20 million available jobs in¬†artificial intelligence¬†by 2023.¬†The pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic have only accelerated company investment in everything related to A.I. and machine learning‚Äîwhich means they need technologists who can wrangle the datasets that make these apps smarter.¬†  
‚ÄúOrganizations need to hire individuals who can identify the correct training data and annotate the data accurately,‚Äù Gus Walker, director of product at Veritone, an A.I. tech company based in Costa Mesa, California, recently told Dice. ‚ÄúThey need talent that can maintain growing training sets and analyze the data to create targeted datasets for customized model generation.‚Äù  
As LinkedIn‚Äôs report indicates, data science is also enjoying some serious growth, as more businesses realize the utility of collecting, cleaning, storing, and, finally, analyzing their data for valuable, potentially game-changing insights.¬†According to Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, data scientist positions¬†are expected to grow 19 percent¬†over the next 10 years, but landing the best jobs will require learning some highly specialized skills, including data mining, predictive models, and machine learning.  
While specialized skills are key, it‚Äôs also important to remember ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù such as communication and empathy, which are essential when it comes to working with teammates and discussing strategy with executives and other stakeholders.

Artificial intelligence will help increase the comfort of dentists' work






 











Scientists from the ETI Faculty of Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology are participating in the work on creating a device that works with commonly used dental tips for non-invasive, optical control of the inside of the oral cavity when performing a dental procedure. The project is carried out by Master Level Technologies in cooperation with the GUT special purpose vehicle Excento, as well as Bibus Menos and Lambda System.


The project was started in 2020. The final result of the work will be a device in the form of a small webcam cooperating with dental tips. The camera will allow the dentist to observe the tooth closely and in real time during the dental procedure. The device will allow the doctor to work more precisely in hard-to-reach places, which will shorten the time of the procedure and potentially reduce the pain associated with it.
‚Äì Artificial intelligence algorithms will improve the quality of the video signal observed by the dentist, and will support the dentist in navigating the hard to recognize internal tooth structures during the procedure ‚Äì explains PhD Daniel Wƒôsierski, R&D manager in the project. ‚Äì The research team faces many technological challenges. When preparing the tooth with a drill, In the oral cavity there is a high risk of contamination of the microcamera lens. Therefore, our task is to develop a method that will protect the microcamera lens from artifacts. Moreover, clinical operating conditions require that the device is sterile.
The developed solution will have a positive impact not only on the patient, but also on the comfort of dentists' work and will increase its ergonomics. Degenerations and diseases of the locomotor system are a common problem of this professional group. The adoption of a more ergonomic posture by the dentist, the reduction of the time spent on a single patient, or the need for fewer corrections will be significant benefits.
‚Äì The idea of came from a dentist friend who, taking into account the limitations of working in a patient‚Äôs mouth, instilled a vision of a device that can minimize them - recalls Damian Siupka-Mr√≥z, member of the Management Board of Master Level Technologies, one of the initiators of the project. - It took us about a month to develop the device in the 'proof of concept' version. Thanks to this model, we understood that such device is possible and can actually bring a completely new functionality into the dentist's daily work. So far, we have managed to develop general image parameters, determine the geometry of the system, implement the main assumptions regarding electronics and start working on algorithms that will improve the operation of the system.
Ultimately, the product is to be implemented in the activities of Master Level Technologies Ltd. and will be sold in Poland and the European Union as a ready-made solution for dentists. Academics from the ETI Faculty of Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology who are involved in the work on the project include: PhD, Eng. Daniel Wƒôsierski (Project R&D Manager), PhD, Eng. Anna Wƒôsierska (head of the project team), professor Jacek Rumi≈Ñski (head of the Department of Biomedical Engineering) and PhD, Eng. Pawe≈Ç Ro≈õciszewski.

As one of the oldest and most traditional engineering disciplines, civil engineering covers various aspects of the built environment, from design and construction to maintenance. Civil engineering offers ample practical scope for applications of AI. In turn, AI can improve human life quality and originate novel approaches to solving engineering problems..AI methods and techniques, including neural networks, evolutionary computation, fuzzy logic systems, and deep learning, have rapidly evolved over the past few years. AI algorithms have recently attracted close attention from researchers and have also been applied successfully to solve problems in civil engineering, i.e., intelligent and fully automatic urban and regional planning, and developing new technologies in civil engineering design, construction, maintenance, and disaster management..McKinsey's report reveals that the civil construction sector has a net worth of over USD 10 trillion a year. Not only is AI making construction operations more manageable, but it is also set to make the construction business more lucrative. The report also estimates that construction companies integrating AI techniques are 50% more likely to generate profits than those who don't..AI offers a wide range of applications in civil engineering that processes and transforms the way builders and engineers work..Quality Management.Construction enterprises utilize deep-learning techniques to improve the level of quality of their construction processes. Image recognition of photographs gathered through manual drones is used to detect risk areas and is also compared against existing blueprints to identify any possible construction defects. AI algorithms can use trial and error techniques to recognize the best processes, followed through reinforcement learning. By implementing these process changes in project planning and scheduling, construction companies can significantly improve their overall project workflow quality..Stakeholders can also use neural networks and laser-generated images to gain insights into individual construction projects' progress. By using artificial intelligence to create 3D models, they can match them with the original models to check for any quality discrepancies. It can significantly stimulate the decision-making process while also implementing actionable insights..Better Designs.Building Information Modeling is a 3D model-based process that gives architecture, engineering, and construction professionals' insights to efficiently plan, design, construct and manage buildings and infrastructure. The 3D model needs to consider the architecture, engineering, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) plans and the sequence of activities of the respective teams to plan and design the construction of a building. The challenge is to make sure that the different sub-teams' different models do not clash with each other. The industry is trying to use machine learning in the form of generative design to recognize and mitigate clashes between the different models generated by the various teams in the planning and design phase to prevent work. Some software uses a machine-learning algorithm to explore all the variations of a solution and generates design alternatives. It leverages machine learning to create 3D models of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems while simultaneously ensuring that MEP systems' entire routes do not clash with the building architecture. It learns from iteration to come up with an optimal solution..Prevent Cost Overruns.Most big projects exceed budget despite employing the best project teams. Artificial neural networks are used to predict cost overruns based on factors like project size, contract type, and the competence level of project managers. Predictive models use historical data such as planned start and end dates to envision realistic timelines for future projects. AI helps staff remotely access real-life training material that helps them improve their skills and knowledge quickly. It minimizes the time taken to onboard new resources onto projects. Consequently, project delivery is expedited..Risk Mitigation.Artificial neural networks through artificial intelligence can be useful measures for risk control as they interpret a collection of construction information to draw meaningful conclusions. It helps construction firms predict the likelihood of possible failures, therefore, preparing them to develop appropriate contingency plans..Construction firms can also apply AI techniques to address client and market risk factors. Through the Naive Bayes algorithm, engineers can perform sentiment analysis on their firm's standing in the market and thus come with targeted efforts to prevent stock prices from falling. Other AI algorithms can also be segment customers based on their characteristics and behaviour patterns to deliver better business development strategies, hence preventing them from risks of likely fallout..Making project development faster and more cost-effective, AI has carved a niche for itself in the civil sector. The construction industry is at a point where it is poised at a technological breakthrough in its processes. In this respect, investing in AI courses is bound to provide a competitive edge to anyone who's building a career in civil engineering..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Image: International Science Survey 2019-2020. Q11a-b.Opinions are also divided on another major technological development: using robots to automate many jobs humans have done in the past. A median of 48% say job automation has been a good thing, while 42% say it‚Äôs had a negative impact on society.The survey ‚Äì conducted in late 2019 and early 2020 in 20 places across Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Russia ‚Äì comes as automation has remade workplaces around the world and AI increasingly powers things from social media algorithms to technology in cars and everyday appliances.Have you read?Could artificial intelligence widen the gap between rich and poor nations?These 6 skills cannot be replicated by artificial intelligenceArtificial Intelligence: These 3 charts show what people really thinkViews of AI are generally positive among the Asian publics surveyed: About two-thirds or more in Singapore (72%), South Korea (69%), India (67%), Taiwan (66%) and Japan (65%) say AI has been a good thing for society. Many places in Asia have emerged as world leaders in AI.Most other places surveyed fall short of a majority saying AI has been good for society. In France, for example, views are particularly negative: Just 37% say AI has been good for society, compared with 47% who say it has been bad for society. In the U.S. and UK, about as many say it has been a good thing for society as a bad thing. By contrast, Sweden and Spain are among a handful of places outside of the Asia-Pacific region where a majority (60%) views AI in a positive light.As with AI, Asian publics surveyed stand out for their relatively positive views of the impact of job automation. Many Asian publics have made major strides in the development of robotics and AI. The South Korean and Singaporean manufacturing industries, for instance, have the highest and second highest robot density of anywhere in the world. Singapore is also pursuing its goal of becoming the world‚Äôs first ‚Äúsmart nation,‚Äù and the government has identified AI as one of many key development areas necessary to reach that goal. Japan has also long been a world leader in robotics manufacturing and development, and robots and AI are increasingly integrated into everyday life there to help with tasks ranging from household chores to elder care.Men are significantly more likely than women to say artificial intelligence has been a good thing for society in 15 of the 20 places surveyed. In Japan, for example, nearly three-quarters of men (73%) have positive views of AI, compared with 56% of women. In the U.S., 53% of men say AI has been a positive thing, compared with 40% of women.Young, educated males are the most likely in society to view AI in a positive light. Image: International Science Survey 2019-2020. Q11a-b.People with more education are also more likely to have a positive view of AI. This gap is largest in the Netherlands, where a majority of those with a college education or higher (61%) see AI favorably, compared with 43% of those with less education. In the 11 publics where age is a significant factor in views of AI, younger people usually have a more positive view of the technology than older people.There are similar patterns by gender and education in views of job automation. The educational differences are particularly large in some places: In Italy, for instance, about two-thirds of people with at least a college education (65%) say job automation has been a good thing for society, compared with just 38% of people with less education. Among adults with more education, those who took three or more science courses tend to see job automation more positively than people who took fewer science classes.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on InnovationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesFourth Industrial RevolutionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Mike Reddy for STAT














































Hospice nurse Deborah Carlson had been hesitant to embrace the artificial intelligence tool her health system introduced earlier this year. She knew next to nothing about its inner workings, its accuracy, or its reliability.
Then, it correctly predicted the death of a patient she thought seemed stable ‚Äî and Carlson found herself questioning her judgement. How exactly did the tool work, and how could she know whether to trust it?advertisement

Health workers like Carlson are increasingly being asked to incorporate experimental AI systems into their workflows, as more hospitals roll out the technologies to predict patient needs and outcomes. But without a transparent explanation of how the tools work ‚Äî or clear education on how to use them ‚Äî health workers are forced to grapple with a range of unknowns. Nurses and doctors tasked with using the tools told STAT that the process has sowed confusion, frustration, and concern.

Artificial intelligence (AI) ‚Äî machines or computer programs capable of learning and problem-solving to perform tasks that typically require humans ‚Äî can make people and organizations more efficient. At the same time, these technological advances can prompt serious concerns around privacy, equity and safety.
In response to this societal challenge, the University of California formed a Presidential Working Group on Artificial Intelligence in early 2020 that brings together leading campus experts to determine how UC can harness the significant benefits offered by AI while ensuring its responsible use.

‚ÄúAI can help UC operate better in many ways such as reducing biases inherent in human decision-making, strengthening cybersecurity and improving the quality of health care,‚Äù said Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at UC Berkeley, co-chair of the working group and a world-renowned expert on the development and ethical deployment of artificial intelligence. ‚ÄúThe work of this panel places UC at the forefront of developing principles and standards for the ethical use of AI in a university setting.‚Äù
Forms of AI, such as machine learning and predictive modeling, have been used for decades to help people streamline their work by automating time-consuming or complex tasks. Today, AI is used for everything from financial fraud detection to identifying terrorism suspects. When used correctly, it has shown promise in uncovering unconscious bias in the selection of job applicants, or in improving health care outcomes by more thoroughly and rapidly processing patient health metrics, data and images.
Areas where AI can most benefit UC operations include health, human resources, campus safety and student experiences, such as admissions and grading. If not thoughtfully implemented and monitored, AI can have unintended consequences such as reinforcing human biases, misidentifying an individual through facial recognition, inadvertently revealing private information or failing to accurately diagnose a patient‚Äôs symptoms.
‚ÄúThe University of California is an ideal place for the thorny undertaking of defining safe and ethical uses for AI,‚Äù said UC President Michael V. Drake, M.D. ‚ÄúWe have the intellectual horsepower in technology, law, ethics and other disciplines to realize the benefits of AI while establishing necessary, practical safeguards.‚Äù
UC‚Äôs AI Working Group has the potential to positively impact artificial intelligence beyond the University‚Äôs own uses. Because of UC‚Äôs size and stature as a preeminent public research university as well as California‚Äôs third-largest employer, its guidelines for ethical development and implementation of AI could influence standards within academia, business and government worldwide.

The AI Working Group‚Äôs ‚ÄúUniversity of California Ethical Principles,‚Äù slated for publication in January 2021, will focus on transparency, fairness and accountability. A full report on AI governance and technical recommendations for the University is expected in fall 2021.
In addition to Russell, UC‚Äôs AI Working Group is co-chaired by Brandie Nonnecke, director of the CITRIS Policy Lab at UC Berkeley, and Alex Bustamante, senior vice president and chief compliance and audit officer in UC‚Äôs Office of the President. Members of the working group draw from faculty, staff and researchers at all 10 UC campuses. A complete list is on the website of the UC Office of the President.
The presidential group was launched by the UC Office of the President‚Äôs Office of Ethics, Compliance and Audit Services (ECAS) and the CITRIS Policy Lab, which is housed within CITRIS and the Banatao Institute.

December 17, 2020By Dave RobertsHazel SavageTo illustrate the importance and potential of AI-based A&R, Musiio co-founder and CEO Hazel Savage refers to the origin story of one of the biggest breakthrough UK artists in recent years, Lewis Capaldi.Her point isn‚Äôt that the self-effacing Scottish superstar was discovered via data, because he wasn‚Äôt. Her point is, What if? She refers to him as the one who got through, as opposed to the thousands who got away.She says: ‚ÄúWith millions of creators posting new music to UGC sites around the world, the job of listening to it all has become impossible.‚ÄúLewis Capaldi was discovered by manager Ryan Walter, who famously spent six months listening to every new artist on SoundCloud he could find. He would listen for seven hours a day, with up to 500 tabs open at a time, listening to 10 seconds of each track.‚ÄúCapaldi‚Äôs rise to fame is a fantastic tale, one which dreams are made of, but the truth is 99.99% of the work that goes into finding artists is never seen or recognized. It can be a brutal process and if Capaldi‚Äôs story teaches us anything, it‚Äôs that there is talent out there that could quite easily go unnoticed and not listened to.‚ÄùTo try and help fix that undoubted problem, Musiio has created a new piece of technology that it calls a Hit Potential Algorithm, which it claims will not only be able to classify and categorize new music, but also accurately measure hit potential, and isolate those tracks most likely to properly blow-up ‚Äì no matter where or who they are from.Here, Savage tells MBW about the new technology‚Äôs secret sauce and how it could radically streamline the A&R process‚Ä¶Can you start by giving us a refresher on what Musiio is and the technologies you have introduced so far?Musiio is a Music Tech start-up based in Singapore, but with a British and Swedish co-founding team. I have previously worked at Shazam, Pandora and Universal Music.‚ÄúWe use AI to ‚Äòlisten‚Äô to music.‚ÄùWe use AI to ‚Äòlisten‚Äô to music. What we mean by that is we transform audio files into something a computer can read. We do this to enable auto-tagging and audio reference search. Our core tech is Artificial Intelligence (aka Machine Learning).Your latest move is an AI-based Hit Potential Algorithm. What prompted you to explore that space?I have always believed this is the most powerful way to use our tech, the challenge is that it‚Äôs the hardest one to prove or sell to others. Music is more valuable the higher up the food chain you get, so to be ‚Äòdiscovering‚Äô music is the best way to create value.What, specifically, does this new technology do ‚Äì and how does it do it?Our technology processes whole audio files. We ‚Äòextract‚Äô features from the audio files and we train the AI to look for patterns.You can use this process to replicate anything the human ear might be able to recognize, such as the BPM and genre, right down to how much of a hit something might be.Our new technology is looking for hits, virality, talent and melodic familiarity as well as a bunch of other factors that make up great music.You‚Äôve said that ‚Äòvolume is the new frontier in music‚Äô, what do you mean by that ‚Äì and how does the new technology relate to that belief?When I used to work at HMV in 2004 I put the new CDs on the shelf for sale Monday morning.In those days, all new music came out on the same day and an average week might bring five or 10 CD singles. Streaming services get 40k tracks a day uploaded to them, so what used to come out in one year now comes out many-fold every day; great for artists, but it does pose challenges.‚ÄúAI lets you automate some parts of the [A&R] processes. Ideally you automate the most tedious and unmanageable parts.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs the volume frontier, and even more so because everyone has access to the same audio, so what you can do when an unmanageable volume of music becomes the new business models.AI lets you automate some parts of the processes. Ideally you automate the most tedious and unmanageable parts.How have you tested the technology and what have the results been?Our more readily available technology, such as AI tagging and AI search are being used widely (Epidemic Sound uses our tags for example), and our APIs are for sale anytime.The Hit Potential Algorithm is a brand new product that has been in R&D for the last three years. Our testing is in-house, but just like our other products which are 90-99.9% accurate, we believe this new product is too.We never release products that don‚Äôt do what we claim. Our reputation is important to us, and it‚Äôs why we hire skilled AI developers and everything is built in-house.‚ÄúImagine only having to search through 20 songs instead of 10,000 to find bangers.‚ÄùWe took 10 viral hits from YouTube, hid them in a database of 10k tracks from the Free Music Archive (creative commons database of music with varying quality) and asked the AI to find the top 20 hits. It found 9 out of 10 viral hits in the top 20.Imagine only having to search through 20 songs instead of 10,000 to find bangers.Where is it up to in terms of readiness to use ‚Äì and where will it be applied, by which companies?The core technology is working and I am excited to announce the technical capability. How and where we might apply it is in stealth mode.Aren‚Äôt there similar technologies already active in the marketplace ‚Äì what makes Musiio‚Äôs offering unique?There have been many approaches. ‚ÄòAI for Music‚Äô is a very generic term.Sodatone, which is a great company that was bought by Warner, uses data aggregated from open API sources (such as Spotify) and some private label sources (Warner‚Äòs own data), to look at play counts, likes, followers and see what is trending.‚ÄúA track can have zero plays, no release date, unsigned UGC and no social media, and we can still tell you if it could be a hit.‚ÄùThis is not a bad approach and you can learn a lot from this data, but you still need access to the data and it still needs to ‚Äòtrend‚Äô ‚Äòhit‚Äô, to some extent, for it to get flagged in a data science AI algorithm.Others have claimed to ‚Äòuse AI‚Äô to identify hits or do A&R in a similar way, aggregate large volumes of data and spot trends. It has its place, but to the best of my knowledge Musiio is the only company working on the audio file itself. This means a track can have zero plays, no release date, unsigned UGC and no social media, and we can still tell you if it could be a hit.What might it mean for artists and managers?I hope it means more discovery for hidden artists. For every Lewis Capaldi there could be hundreds of undiscovered talents, we hope this technology will help discover them.What do you say to traditionalists who baulk at the emergence of AI/algorithmic A&R and who argue that the most important tools will always be ‚Äògood ears‚Äô and ‚Äògut instinct‚Äô?I think good ears and gut instinct are important; people are important. AI should free them up to do what they do best.Let the AI process 40k tracks a day and pass an A&R the top 20, then let a person make the final analysis. The alternative is someone listening to 40k tracks a day, which is not humanly possible. It‚Äôs about increasing the odds, not replacing people.Also, let‚Äôs be honest, true ‚Äòtech doubters‚Äô are starting to sound like the folks who hated synths in the 80s [laughs].Music Business WorldwideInterviews Singapore Sweden United Kingdom Hazel Savage MusiioRelated Posts  Hazel Savage, Music Intelligence VP at SoundCloud, and founder of Musiio, joins Tuned Global board  SoundCloud acquires AI music company Musiio  Marathon Music Group & Tileyard London unveil new round of ‚ÄòMusic Discovery‚Äô  businesses for ‚ÄòLABs‚Äô start-up mentoring program    ","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/artificial-intelligence-ar-tools-keep-finding-new-hit-artists-this-one-actually-listens-to-music/'}",,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Music Business Worldwide', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2020/05/Vc15Mog7_400x400-60x60.png', 'width': 60, 'height': 60}}",,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/artificial-intelligence-ar-tools-keep-finding-new-hit-artists-this-one-actually-listens-to-music/', 'name': 'Artificial intelligence A&#038;R tools keep finding new hit artists.

Can Artificial intelligence affect gender equality?
A new knowledge overview provides a review of all Norwegian research on equality and artificial intelligence. From this overview, it is evident that we are not prepared for the consequences that the new technology might have for gender equality.

‚ÄòAI systems are supposed to facilitate inclusion, diversity and equal treatment.‚Äô This sentence is taken from the Norwegian government‚Äôs national strategy for artificial intelligence. But is this really the case in practice? Kilden genderresearch.no has, on commission from The Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud, reviewed the Norwegian research on artificial intelligence that has a gender and equality perspective.











‚ÄúWe must make sure that the technology does not enhance stereotypical attitudes held by human beings,‚Äù says Hanne Bjurstr√∏m.

The overview focuses on three areas: public and private services, working life, and social platforms and entertainment. According to Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud Hanne Bjurstr√∏m, a report like this is important with regard to the digital development.‚ÄúWhen we use artificial intelligence to make more and more decisions that have impact on our lives, it is only natural that this also becomes an important part of our work on equality and anti-discrimination in the future,‚Äù she explains.‚ÄúWe therefore need to know more about the established research on the field and what effect the technology has on its target groups. This report is an important contribution to this work.‚Äù

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
Artificial intelligence enables a computer programme to perform tasks that have previously been carried out by human beings. For instance, artificial intelligence may choose the best candidate for a job, recognise faces or recommend music.The programmes appear intelligent. This is due to algorithms, mathematical formulas that function as a recipe or instruction for the programme. In this way, the programme may e.g. sort data based on given criteria. Some programmes may also be able to learn from experiences, observe connections and adapt over time, so-called machine learning.A summary of the knowledge overview has been translated into English and is available here: What do we know about artificial intelligence and equality?




New solutions


Annonse


Trine Rogg Korsvik is one of the authors behind the report. She works as a senior adviser at Kilden. She says that artificial intelligence has proven to have discriminating effects in other countries.‚ÄúNegative findings related to face recognition, automation of work and targeted advertising have been observed. Artificial intelligence is a phenomenon that affects many areas of society,‚Äù Korsvik explains.Artificial intelligence is already in use in various public services such as automated case processing at NAV (the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration). According to Korsvik, some countries have also tried out artificial intelligence in other types of services such as face recognition in order to register potential criminals or algorithms to decide who qualifies for bank loans.‚ÄúIt may lead to a surveillance society, but also to a strengthening of prejudices, since the algorithms are based on historical data that may show signs of gender imbalance.‚ÄùIn working life, automation affects the various sectors differently. This has to do with which work tasks that may be performed with artificial intelligence, Korsvik explains.‚ÄúTasks that require human presence and intuition do not risk the danger of disappearing due to automation. The systems are based on logic and universal answers, but they lack the ability to read implicit signals.‚Äù‚ÄúIn Norway, for instance, we have the chatbot Kommune-Kari (Municipality Kari), who can answer questions concerning the library‚Äôs opening hours and similar things. But it is very limited what a chatbot can give answers to.‚Äù

Digital competenceDigitalisation can be a challenge to many people. Some struggle with the new solutions and risk not getting the help they need. Korsvik point to the users of NAV‚Äôs services who were suddenly without income during the COVID-19 pandemic because they had not completed the forms correctly.‚ÄúDigital tools can be useful and time-efficient. But not everyone has the same digital competence, and to some people the new solutions may lead to a loss of rights.‚ÄùKorsvik maintains that social conditions play a vital role in how the technology affects us. She emphasises that the digitalisation may result in major social differences.‚ÄúAccording to one of the surveys we have seen, women report that they have less awareness of artificial intelligence and algorithms than men have. Especially elderly women with little or no education responded that they know little about this, whereas men more often claim to have both high awareness and opinions about algorithms,‚Äù she says.‚ÄúBut we have to add that these figures come from self-reporting, where the data are based on what people think about their own knowledge.‚ÄùKorsvik emphasises that this has to do with more than just gender differences. Social class, level of education and financial resources are also significant factors here.

‚ÄúIn Norway, the digitalisation has come a lot further than in most other countries. Approximately ninety per cent of the population has internet access. At the same time, we have to keep in mind that ten per cent do not have internet access, and they stand the risk of being excluded. Elderly people without education and people with poor health are particularly vulnerable.‚ÄùAnother problem may be the gender imbalance within the ICT field. Artificialintelligence is a male dominated field in which almost eighty per cent of the developers are men.‚ÄúThere are also few women who study these subjects in higher education. And since technology is shaped by those who create it, several researchers point out that the strong gender imbalance in the ICT sector is a gender equality problem,‚Äù says Korsvik.Data biasInga Str√ºmke is a physician and works at Simula, where she does research on artificial intelligence. She calls for a public debate about the development.‚ÄúWe struggle to get the debate going in Norway. This is because there is still very little artificial intelligence in use. Therefore, there is little to explore,‚Äù she says.‚ÄúOne thing that we can and should do is to look at the planning processes behind the implementation of artificial intelligence, particularly in the public sector. The research needs more empirical data, but we have to be realistic. We do not yet have enough experience to detect any clear tendencies.‚Äù‚ÄúIs gender equality a relevant issue when we discuss artificial intelligence?‚Äù‚ÄúDefinitely. Artificial intelligence can both worsen and improve equality. The algorithms predict the future based on the past. They are founded on human data that must be collected. And since people discriminate, artificial intelligence can reproduce our prejudices. Therefore, changes are required if we want improvement,‚Äù Str√ºmke explains.She emphasises that there is generally more data on men than on women. There are, for instance, more pictures of men on the internet, and we have more medical data on men. This may lead to bias in terms of how users are treated.‚ÄúIt is difficult to compensate for this. We can either collect more data on women, or we can attach more weight to existing data on women,‚Äù she says.‚ÄúThe idea that men develop ‚Äòmale‚Äô artificial intelligence is incorrect. Artificial intelligence is governed by the data, not by those who created it. Diversity is nevertheless important, here as everywhere else. And not only in terms of gender; all types of diversity is desirable. More diversity, in this case more female developers, increases the possibility of gaining more perspectives.‚Äù











The idea that men create ‚Äòmale‚Äô artificial intelligence is incorrect, according to AI-researcher Inga Str√ºmke.

Ethics for developersBoth Korsvik and Str√ºmke problematise that it is often large technology companies who develop the various AI-services. These companies benefit from keeping their methods a secret.‚ÄúThere is no doubt that the algorithms have come to stay. Therefore, it is vital that we have democratic control over them, in order to prevent the technology companies from gaining too much power,‚Äù says Korsvik.‚ÄúThe development takes place on several levels, and often above the heads of normal people. It is not obvious who are to blame if an algorithm makes a mistake.‚ÄùStr√ºmke also argues that legal practice is lagging behind when it comes to artificial intelligence issues. She is worried that the lack of resistance gives the technology companies free conduct.‚ÄúYou may say that the technological development moves faster than the ethical,‚Äù she says.‚ÄúPeople are quick to apply new technology, but it takes more time for them to problematise it. Moreover, there is little legal practice related to artificial intelligence. I am afraid that the technology companies may end up benefitting from being regulated by customary law.‚ÄùAccording to Str√ºmke, it is important to examine how the digital solutions affect our behaviour.‚ÄúCompanies such as Instagram, YouTube and Facebook employ behavioural psychologists to help them develop their technology in a way that makes you spend more time on their services. Machine learning consists of two cornerstones: data and goals. In this case, the data is your behaviour and the goal is to make you click more. Luckily, it seems like more and more people are becoming aware of this.‚ÄùResearch for the futureOne of the main conclusions drawn from the knowledge overview is that little Norwegian research on artificial intelligence exists that addresses questions of equality. The Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud hopes that this will change in the future.‚ÄúArtificial intelligence represents a strength within most disciplines. At the same time, we should not forget that it is developed by human beings. We need to make sure that technology does not enhance stereotypical attitudes held by human beings,‚Äù says Bjurstr√∏m.‚ÄúWe have to ensure more diversity among those who develop the systems, and that the developers have sufficient knowledge of the regulations related to equality and discrimination. We will follow this work with great interest after the annual conference.‚ÄùStr√ºmke, on the other hand, points out that the future depends on how we make use of artificial intelligence.

We need popular education and more public debate about how artificial intelligence affects society.
Inga Str√ºmke


‚ÄúArtificial intelligence can contribute to an entirely utopian society in which all the tasks that we do not like are carried out by machines. But today we are mostly focusing on short-term profits,‚Äù she says.She emphasises that artificial intelligence is used to achieve specific objectives. Today, the technology companies‚Äô objective is often to make as much profit as possible.‚ÄúOn the other hand, we should not listen too much to technologists who overestimate themselves. It should not end in either utopia or disaster,‚Äù Str√ºmke laughs.She thinks we need to discuss issues related to equality and discrimination more thoroughly.‚ÄúNo one wants discrimination. Yet we struggle to get rid of it. In my opinion, there must be room for a thorough discussion of these issues. Criticising artificial intelligence is easy, but we also need to have a less polarised debate. This issue is much bigger than just the digitalisation of society.‚ÄùKorsvik also hopes that we will see more research in this field in the years to come. Most of what exists today has appeared over the past couple of years.‚ÄúThe technological development moves faster than traditional research processes,‚Äù she says.She maintains that we need more empirical studies that both explore societal consequences of artificial intelligence and look at how the technological changes affect equality, especially in work life.‚ÄúWe need popular education and more public debate about how artificial intelligence affects society.

These innovations have been deployed in industries to speed up operations, increase productivity, and meet large-scale needs. Voice is one such sector that has benefited from automation and AI..In voice, AI allows users to understand the query and initiates a run-through of their data sets (memory) to address accurately. It is built to look for trends, learn from experience, and provide answers. The technology allows us to perform repetitive tasks with simple controls quickly. Every new voice-interactive technology that we add to our lives deepens our dependence on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning from our telephones, computers, watches, and even our refrigerators..The connection between machines and humans, which we had been seeing and dreaming about a few decades ago (Voice Assistants like Amazon Echo, Siri, Google Assistant, Google Home, Amazon Alexa) has been fictional. But today, the fact is real and incredible. The next digital trend on the market is voice search technology, and in some cases, touch screens already have been replaced..Today, some common uses of artificial intelligence are object recognition, translation, speech recognition, and processing of natural languages. Automatic transcription by Rev is powered by automated speech recognition (ASR) and processing of natural language processing (NLP). ASR converts the word into text, while NLP processes the text to extract its meaning. Since people often speak with colloquialism, abbreviations, and acronyms, thorough computer analysis is necessary to produce a correct transcription of the natural language..There are various but confined problems with speech recognition technology. They involve getting the better of inapt recording equipment, background noise, arduous accents, and dialects, along with the numerous voice tones of people. It is so much more to listen to and understand what a person says than to hear the words the person uses. It is something that has not yet been mastered to teach a machine to learn to read a spoken language as humans do..But voice-controlled technology is gaining popularity and has many advantages, such as saving a lot of time, being easy to use, comfortable, and multi-tasking. People are currently responding by reacting to rational people or individuals by voice technologies. More people use voice at Smart Homes on their mobile retrospects with the exciting progress in this place..The digital voice helpers of Alexa, Amazon, and Apple are a couple of examples that are much more than a helpful tool. They are very real implementations of artificial intelligence that are increasingly central to our everyday lives.

The plasma source for the accelerator

view large

Researchers have used AI to control beams for the next generation of smaller, cheaper accelerators for research, medical and industrial applications.
Experiments led by Imperial College London researchers, using the Science and Technology Facilities Council‚Äôs Central Laser Facility (CLF), showed that an algorithm was able to tune the complex parameters involved in controlling the next generation of plasma-based particle accelerators.
The techniques we have developed will be instrumental in getting the most out of a new generation of advanced plasma accelerator facilities under construction within the UK and worldwide. Dr Rob Shalloo
The algorithm was able to optimize the accelerator much more quickly than a human operator, and could even outperform experiments on similar laser systems.
These accelerators focus the energy of the world‚Äôs most powerful lasers down to a spot the size of a skin cell, producing electrons and x-rays with equipment a fraction of the size of conventional accelerators.
The electrons and x-rays can be used for scientific research, such as probing the atomic structure of materials; in industrial applications, such as for producing consumer electronics and vulcanised rubber for car tyres; and could also be used in medical applications, such as cancer treatments and medical imaging.
Broadening accessibility
Several facilities using these new accelerators are in various stages of planning and construction around the world, including the CLF‚Äôs Extreme Photonics Applications Centre (EPAC) in the UK, and the new discovery could help them work at their best in the future. The results are published today in Nature Communications.
First author Dr Rob Shalloo, who completed the work at Imperial and is now at the accelerator centre DESY, said: ‚ÄúThe techniques we have developed will be instrumental in getting the most out of a new generation of advanced plasma accelerator facilities under construction within the UK and worldwide.
‚ÄúPlasma accelerator technology provides uniquely short bursts of electrons and x-rays, which are already finding uses in many areas of scientific study. With our developments, we hope to broaden accessibility to these compact accelerators, allowing scientists in other disciplines and those wishing to use these machines for applications, to benefit from the technology without being an expert in plasma accelerators.‚Äù
First of its kind
The team worked with laser wakefield accelerators. These combine the world‚Äôs most powerful lasers with a source of plasma (ionised gas) to create concentrated beams of electrons and x-rays. Traditional accelerators need hundreds of metres to kilometres to accelerate electrons, but wakefield accelerators can manage the same acceleration within the space of millimetres, drastically reducing the size and cost of the equipment.

The outside of the vacuum chamber

However, because wakefield accelerators operate in the extreme conditions created when lasers are combined with plasma, they can be difficult to control and optimise to get the best performance. In wakefield acceleration, an ultrashort laser pulse is driven into plasma, creating a wave that is used to accelerate electrons. Both the laser and plasma have several parameters that can be tweaked to control the interaction, such as the shape and intensity of the laser pulse, or the density and length of the plasma.
While a human operator can tweak these parameters, it is difficult to know how to optimise so many parameters at once. Instead, the team turned to artificial intelligence, creating a machine learning algorithm to optimise the performance of the accelerator.
The algorithm set up to six parameters controlling the laser and plasma, fired the laser, analysed the data, and re-set the parameters, performing this loop many times in succession until the optimal parameter configuration was reached.

Electrons are ejected from the plasma accelerator at almost the speed of light, before being passed through a magnetic field which separates the particles by their energy. They are then fired at a fluorescent screen, shown here

Lead researcher Dr Matthew Streeter, who completed the work at Imperial and is now at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, said: ‚ÄúOur work resulted in an autonomous plasma accelerator, the first of its kind. As well as allowing us to efficiently optimise the accelerator, it also simplifies their operation and allows us to spend more of our efforts on exploring the fundamental physics behind these extreme machines.‚Äù
Future designs and further improvements
The team demonstrated their technique using the Gemini laser system at the CLF, and have already begun to use it in further experiments to probe the atomic structure of materials in extreme conditions and in studying antimatter and quantum physics.
The data gathered during the optimisation process also provided new insight into the dynamics of the laser-plasma interaction inside the accelerator, potentially informing future designs to further improve accelerator performance.
The experiment was led by Imperial College London researchers with a team of collaborators from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), the York Plasma Institute, the University of Michigan, the University of Oxford and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY). It was funded by the UK‚Äôs STFC, the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, the US National Science Foundation and the UK‚Äôs Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

The idea of artificial intelligence (AI) ‚Äî systems so advanced they can mimic or outperform human cognition ‚Äî first came to prominence in 1950, when British computer scientist Alan Turing proposed an ‚Äòimitation game‚Äô to assess whether a computer could fool humans into thinking they were communicating with another human. Soon after, researchers at Princeton University in New Jersey built MADALINE, the first artificial neural network applied to a real-world problem. Their system, modelled on the brain and nervous system, learnt to solve a maze through trial-and-error.Since then, the rise of AI has been enabled by exponentially faster and more powerful computers and large, complex data sets. Applications such as machine learning, whereby a system identifies patterns in large sets of data, have demonstrated the potential for AI to be practical and profitable.Today, AI forms the basis of computer systems handling tasks such as voice recognition and translation on smartphones, piloting driverless cars, and controlling robots that automate chores in homes and factories. In research, AI is being used in a growing number of applications, such as processing the enormous amounts of data that underpin fields including astronomy and genomics, producing climate models and weather forecasts, and identifying signs of disease in medical imaging.‚ÄúAI is a foundational science in the same sense that physics is a foundational science,‚Äù says Amir Husain, a computer scientist who founded SparkCognition, a company in Austin, Texas, that creates AI-based analytic and security systems. ‚ÄúA lot of people think that AI is a product or technology, but it‚Äôs actually an enabler for almost everything we do.‚Äù

Nature Index 2020 Artificial intelligence
Business, as a result, is booming. The 2019 AI Index Report, published by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence in California, estimates that global private investment in AI in 2019 was more than US$70 billion. The US, China and Europe took the largest share; Israel, Singapore and Iceland were found to invest heavily in per capita terms. Start-ups founded on AI technologies are a major part of the ecosystem, garnering more than $37 billion globally in investments in 2019, up from $1.3 billion raised in 2010, according to the report.Revenues have also skyrocketed. The International Data Corporation (IDC), a market research company based in Framingham, Massachusetts, predicts that worldwide revenues for the AI market will total $156.5 billion in 2020, an increase of 12.3% over 2019. Although growth in 2020 is slower than in previous years due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IDC expects that global revenues will surpass $300 billion in 2024.As nations vie for leadership, AI research output is increasing rapidly. According to our analysis of journal publications and conference papers tracked by the Dimensions database, the global output for AI research grew from just over 52,000 globally in 2000 to roughly 403,000 in 2019, representing an increase of more than 600%. Now the most popular specialization among computer-science PhD students in North America, AI is set to continue its steep, upward trajectory.Rising revenuesThe United States has historically been the leader in AI-related research output, having accumulated the highest number of publications over the past two decades. But China has ramped up its output in recent years. In each year from 2016 to 2019, China produced more AI-related papers than any other nation, according to Dimensions. Over this period, China‚Äôs output of AI-related research increased by just over 120%, whereas output in the US increased by almost 70%. In 2019, China published 102,161 AI-related papers, and the US published 74,386. India, which came in third, published 23,398.

Publication numbers aren‚Äôt the whole story, says Jeffrey Ding, a PhD student at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, UK, who studies China‚Äôs AI strategy. In the AI Index Report, which uses citation numbers to measure the quality of AI papers, papers from China were cited about 20% less than the world average in 2019, whereas papers from the US were cited about 40% more than average. ‚ÄúJust pumping out raw numbers of papers that don‚Äôt have a lasting impact isn‚Äôt really useful,‚Äù says Ding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more important to keep up with the technology frontier.‚ÄùA Nature Index analysis for this supplement looked at the number of AI-related articles published in the 82 high-quality natural-science journals tracked by the index, which primarily concern the application of AI to research in the broad fields of chemistry, the physical sciences, life sciences, and Earth and environmental sciences. Between 2015 and 2019, the US was the leader, with the UK, Germany and China in second, third and fourth place, respectively. But China has increased its output in journals tracked by the index. Although it was the fourth-most prolific country in the index in 2015, with roughly half as many AI-related papers as Germany, China crept up over the next three years, then leapt to second place in 2019, showing an increase of 340%. The US, UK and Germany slightly more than doubled their output over the same period.

For the near future, Ding says, the US is likely to remain the world leader in AI. ‚ÄúThough China has some exceptional universities, such as Tsinghua University, the US dominates in terms of maybe the top 20 universities doing AI research, and that is reflected in the quality of the papers. It‚Äôs very unlikely that China will become the singular innovation centre by 2030.‚ÄùMany countries see AI as providing a competitive edge, not only economically, but militarily, says Husain. He likens the competition in AI to the Space Race of the mid-twentieth century, in which the US and the Soviet Union vied to be the first to achieve milestones in space travel. ‚ÄúThe Space Race yielded contributions that differentiated the American technological ecosystem from all others for decades to come,‚Äù says Husain. ‚ÄúIf a country invests heavily in this area, it will yield technologies that will form the pillar of defence capability and economic differentiation for the rest of the century.‚ÄùTechnologies that can be developed based on AI will indeed have both economic and military benefit, says Daniel Araya, a policy analyst at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a think tank in Ontario, Canada. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking new weapons, data-driven innovation for industry and automation, and redesigning how our society works from the ground up.‚ÄùHusain points to Germany, which maintains a strong economy that relies on exports of products such as machine parts and automobiles, even though lower-income countries can provide low-wage labour for manufacturing. Germany has been able to compete by using automation to keep manufacturing costs down, while keeping quality and productivity high. AI could reinforce this advantage by powering the next generation of automation technologies. ‚ÄúAnybody that has mastery over this technology and is investing in implementing it retains an economic lead,‚Äù says Husain. Institutions in Germany, such as the Fraunhofer Society, Europe‚Äôs largest application-oriented research organization, have been emphasizing Industry 4.0, a national strategic initiative from the German government to introduce more digital innovation and advanced robotics into manufacturing and supply-chain management.In China, the ability offered by AI systems to monitor public spaces and scan Internet traffic in an effort to glean user intentions may provide the state with improved tools for social control, enhancing its capability for monitoring the population or censoring information. Even in countries that don‚Äôt officially track their populaces, facial-recognition technology, such as that produced by New York-based company, Clearview AI, is being used by law enforcement to identify suspects. The technology has been met with deep concern by some researchers, who say that biases built into its algorithms could result in ethical and human rights abuses.Amid the controversy that surrounds certain applications of AI, some groups are highlighting the good it can do. In 2019, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, a scientific society in Menlo Park, California, launched its Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity award, a US$1-million prize funded by Squirrel AI, an education technology company based in Shanghai, China. The inaugural winner, Regina Barzilay from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, received the award in September 2020 for developing a machine-learning algorithm that can examine mammograms and predict which women are at a higher risk of breast cancer. Barzilay has also developed a pattern-recognition algorithm that predicts which molecules might make good candidates for new medications. Publishing in the journal Cell, Barzilay and her colleagues described how their system identified a molecule, dubbed halicin, as a potentially potent new antibiotic (J. M. Stokes et al. Cell 180, 688‚Äì702; 2020). When the molecule was synthesized and tested, it was found to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Barzilay continues to work on halicin and hopes to progress it to clinical trials.Money to spendWith an eye to the potential benefits of AI-based technologies, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) announced in August 2020 that it is establishing five new institutes focused on different topics, each led by a different university, and each to receive $20 million over five years. One, led by the University of Oklahoma in Norman, will use AI systems to improve climate forecasting accuracy. Another, at the University of Texas at Austin, will focus on the next generation of machine-learning algorithms. A third, led by the University of Colorado Boulder, will apply AI technologies to teaching and learning. The fourth, headed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will explore the discovery and synthesis of new materials and drugs using AI systems. And a fifth, led by MIT, will investigate how AI can improve research in fundamental physics. The NSF has put out a call for proposals for eight more AI institutes, which it plans to announce next year. ‚ÄúWe have a long history of supporting basic research in artificial intelligence,‚Äù says Erwin Gianchandani, the NSF‚Äôs deputy assistant director for computer and information science and engineering.In addition, the US Department of Agriculture‚Äôs National Institute of Food and Agriculture has committed to funding another two institutes each with $20 million over five years to apply AI to questions of crop yield, pest resistance and food distribution.Access to massive data sets on which to train machine-learning systems is one advantage that both the US and China have, says Araya. Europe, on the other hand, has stringent data laws, which protect people‚Äôs privacy, but limit its resources for training AI algorithms. ‚ÄúSo, it seems unlikely that Europe will produce very sophisticated AI as a consequence,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúChina is at the opposite end of the spectrum, where it has few data protections, and huge access to varied and diverse pieces of data.‚ÄùThe NSF doesn‚Äôt make decisions based on global competition, says Rebecca Keiser, the organization‚Äôs first chief of research security strategy and policy. Her position is designed to safeguard the security of federally funded research, while promoting international collaborations. ‚ÄúWe think of it more in terms of the impact that our funding is going to have, rather than from a nation perspective. The fact that it also contributes to US global science leadership is fabulous,‚Äù says Keiser. As for competing against China in AI, she says, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know how much, and where, they‚Äôre investing, so it‚Äôs hard to compete against that.‚ÄùWith funding from other major US agencies, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and National Institutes of Health, the US government expected to spend almost $5 billion on unclassified AI research in 2020. Other countries are investing, too. The UK‚Äôs Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council gave out nearly ¬£160 million (US$212 million) in 2020. The European Commission, which has been supporting research through its Horizon 2020 programme, says public and private investment in AI should reach ‚Ç¨20 billion (US$23 billion) across Europe by the end of 2020. Even with other countries placing emphasis on AI research, including Israel, Japan, Singapore and Australia, the race comes down to China versus the US, Araya says.The refinement of AI systems is driven not simply by academic questions, but by applying the systems‚Äô intelligence to practical problems. Countries will probably make advances by using AI in areas where they already have expertise, says Ding, such as automation in Germany or robotics in Japan. Having so many researchers around the globe tackling all aspects of AI should advance the whole field, says Keiser. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always good to have a bit of healthy competition.‚Äù

For example, a customer requested an app to better understand the flow of people into each carriage, to help maintain social distancing. ¬†‚ÄúThis requires digital knowledge and data analytics, because when you develop an app it involves AI, machine learning, data mining processes.‚Äù
You did your undergraduate degree in biomedical/medical engineering. Why did you decide to specialise with a masters in AI?‚ÄúIn the last year of my degree, I had to choose an optional module and one of them was machine learning for biomedical engineering. I didn‚Äôt know much about it but I was curious ‚Äî it turned out to be the best choice for me. ¬†‚ÄúI was a bit scared at the beginning because of all the computer programming and mathematics but machine learning and AI can be applied to so many fields ‚Äî natural language processing, imaging analysis ‚Äî so that‚Äôs what made me choose an AI masters. ¬†Read MoreSTEM Challenge #5: Understand AI by playing noughts and crossesSTEM careers: How do I become a video game developer? ‚ÄúIf I want to go back to the medical field, for instance, then I can use this knowledge that I‚Äôve gained.‚Äù
How did you find the challenge of an AI masters without first having done a computer science degree‚ÄúIt was quite challenging at the beginning. But I had basic knowledge of programming languages such as Python and the teaching staff were very helpful and understanding. I just worked really hard, especially in the first semester, to get up to the level of my other classmates.‚Äù
Was there something that set you off on this path to biomedical engineering and then AI?
‚ÄúI was always interested in medicine and technology. I wanted to be a doctor. Then at high school in Sardinia, when I was 17, I went to an open day at Cagliari University and came across biomedical engineering. There was a student who gave an amazing presentation and I decided this was exactly what I wanted to do.‚Äù
What advice would you give young people thinking of pursuing a career in AI?‚ÄúWhen I was an undergrad I had to choose between machine learning and another module. I had a chat with one of my professors and said: ‚ÄòIt seems interesting but I‚Äôm afraid because I don‚Äôt really know the field.‚Äô She told me: ‚ÄòIf it‚Äôs difficult then it‚Äôs the right choice because you will learn more from it and it will push you to do better.‚Äô ¬†‚ÄúGo for the challenging choices even if you‚Äôre scared of them. If you feel they‚Äôre the right thing and you could learn from them, you should go for it.‚Äù

The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) has adopted a feasibility study on the possible establishment of a certification mechanism for artificial intelligence tools and services. The study is based on the CEPEJ Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems and their environment, adopted in December 2018. The Council of Europe, if it decides to create such a mechanism, could be a pioneer in this field.
After consultation with all member and observer states, this feasibility study will be followed by an action plan that the CEPEJ will prepare and send to the Committee of Ministers for examination in 2021.
The CEPEJ also adopted the roadmap of its Working Group on Cyberjustice and Artificial Intelligence.
The work carried out in the field of the digitalisation of justice aims to provide new concrete tools in this area to European courts, which has become even more necessary during times of sanitary crisis and closures of courts, while ensuring respect for the fundamental principles of the European Convention on Human Rights and in particular those of its Article 6.
The President of the CEPEJ, Ramin Gurbanov, was re-elected for a new term of 2 years (1st January 2021 to 31st December 2022).

The Covid-19 pandemic has rapidly increased that trend, driven by the triple necessities of increased productivity, lower costs and human safety. Suddenly, human contact is both undesirable and more longed for than ever. Delivery companies, plumbers and even some medical providers now boast about their ‚Äúzero contact‚Äù service, but we relish any chance we get to have an in-person meal or a face-to-face meeting.As we face the future of an A.I. economy, 2020 has taught us the importance of human connection.When I began my career in A.I. in 1983, I described A.I. in my application to the Ph.D. program at Carnegie Mellon University as ‚Äúthe quantification of the human thinking process, the explication of human behavior‚Äù and our ‚Äúfinal step‚Äù to understanding ourselves.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn a way I was wrong, and in a way I was right. A.I. programs are capable of mimicking and even surpassing human brains in many tasks. But if A.I. allows us to truly understand ourselves, it will be because it liberates us from the mechanical drudgery of routine tasks and allows us to focus on our humanity and the compassionate connections between us.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter¬†¬†Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.We already know that many of the jobs that are being replaced will not return, because A.I. can do them much better than people at essentially zero cost. This will generate tremendous economic value but will also result in unprecedented job displacement. In my book ‚ÄúA.I. Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,‚Äù I estimated that by 2033 A.I. and automation will be able to do 40 to 50 percent of our jobs.To prepare now for the millions of displaced jobs and tackle retraining for the new skills required when A.I. is both a co-worker and a tool, I propose the 3 R‚Äôs ‚Äî relearn, recalibrate and renaissance ‚Äî as part of a gargantuan reimagination of how we live and work to deal with the central economic issue of our time: the A.I. revolution.ImageAn A.I.-powered robotic hand, created by the research company OpenAI, learned to solve a Rubik‚Äôs cube, demonstrating a near-human level of dexterity.Credit...Matt Edge for The New York TimesFirst, and perhaps easiest, is forewarning people in endangered jobs and establishing programs for them to relearn their fields in the context of A.I. The good news is that there are plenty of ‚Äúhuman‚Äù skills that A.I. cannot master: creativity, social interaction, physically complex or dexterous work and, of course, using the A.I. tools that require human operators.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTVocational schools need to redesign their curriculums to increase courses for sustainable jobs. Governments could take the lead and provide incentives and subsidies for those courses, rather than blindly pursuing broad-brush economic measures like universal basic income. Corporations could also provide programs, such as Amazon‚Äôs Career Choice program. This program pays up to $12,000 annually over four years for Amazon‚Äôs hourly employees to earn degrees in high-demand occupations such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design and nursing.Pandemic or no pandemic, the importance and number of human-centric service jobs, such as nursing, will grow as wealth and life spans increase. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, we will fall short of the number of health care workers required to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ‚Äúgood health and well-being for all‚Äù by approximately 18 million. There is an acute need to reassess such vital, yet undervalued, human-centric service roles both in terms of how they are perceived and how much they are paid. These jobs will form a bedrock for the new A.I. economy.As we prepare people for the eventual transition to an A.I.-driven economy, we will also need to recalibrate many of today‚Äôs jobs. Like software did a few decades ago, A.I. can augment humans‚Äô creative thinking with a computer‚Äôs relentless ability to churn through masses of data, hypothesize alternatives or optimize outcomes. There will not be a single, generic A.I. tool, but specific tools customized for each profession and application. We may have an A.I.-based molecule generation program for drug researchers, an A.I. advertising planner for marketers or an A.I. fact checker for journalists.Merging A.I. optimization and the human touch will reinvent many jobs and create even more. A.I. will take care of routine tasks in tandem with humans, who will carry out the tasks that require, well, humanity. For example, future doctors will still be a patient‚Äôs primary point of contact, but they will rely on A.I. diagnostic tools to determine the best treatment. This will redirect the doctor‚Äôs role into that of a compassionate caregiver, giving them more time with their patients.Just as the mobile internet led to roles like the Uber driver, the coming of A.I. will create jobs we cannot even conceive of yet. Examples today include A.I. engineers, data scientists, data-labelers and robot mechanics. We should watch for the emergence of such roles, make people aware of them and provide training for them.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFinally, just as the wealthy Italian cities and merchants funded that country‚Äôs Renaissance, we must hope that A.I. will inspire a renaissance of its own. With machines taking over many duties and tasks in the new economy, A.I. will inject flexibility into traditional working patterns, allowing us to rethink what work-life balance should look like and transforming both the weekday routine and retirement thresholds. With more freedom and time in such a new social contract, people will be liberated to follow their passions, creativity and talents, and to let that personal exploration inform their careers as never before.Painters, sculptors and photographers will be able to use A.I. tools to compose, experiment, enumerate and refine their artwork. Novelists, journalists and poets will use new technologies to take their writing in previously unthought-of directions. Educators, freed from the drudgery of grading and paperwork, can finally unleash their energy to design lessons that encourage curiosity, critical thinking and creativity. A.I. programs can help teach facts and figures so that teachers can spend more time developing students‚Äô emotional intelligence.The three R‚Äôs will represent an unparalleled undertaking for humanity. Companies will need to retrain a massive number of displaced workers. Governments must raise an astronomical amount of money and redistribute it to fund this transition. Schools need to reinvent education to produce creative, social and multidisciplinary graduates. Everything must be redefined: the work ethic of society, entitlements for citizens, responsibilities for corporations and the role of governments.In all of this, the role of A.I. technologies is crucial.

Panel Details Global Artificial Intelligence Arms Race


John Grady 
December 9, 2020 11:40 AM 

Harnessing artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has become the new arms race among the great powers, a Hudson Institute panel on handling big data in military operations said Monday.
Speaking at the online forum, Richard Schultz, director of the international security program in the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the way [Russian President Vladimir] Putin looks at it. I don‚Äôt think we have a choice‚Äù but to view it the same way.
He added in answer to a question that ‚Äúthe data in information space is enormous,‚Äù so finding tools to filter out what‚Äôs not necessary is critical. U.S. Special Operations Command is already using AI to do what in the old days was called political or psychological warfare, in addition to targeting, he added.

SOCOM Commander Army Gen. Richard Clarke said that, in recent conversations he has had with commanders in Afghanistan, between 2001 and 2018 ‚Äú70 percent of their time was putting bomb on target.‚Äù But now, through better use of AI for speedy and precise targeting and a greater understanding of the effectiveness of information operations, they have reversed that ratio.
Clarke and Schultz co-authored the recent monograph ‚ÄúBig Data at War‚Äù that details what SOCOM gained in moving out with AI and machine learning.
Bryan Clark of the Hudson Institute said during the event that the lessons learned from Special Operations Command work in Afghanistan ‚Äì starting in 2004 but accelerating in 2008 ‚Äì is being felt across the Department of Defense. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs decision-centric warfare‚Äù versus ‚Äúattrition-centric warfare.‚Äù He compared it to ‚Äúmaneuver warfare in the information domain.‚Äù He specifically cited the value of Project Maven as improving a field commander‚Äôs ability to more effectively command and control his unit‚Äôs operation in conflict ‚Äì from when, what and where to fire, to not shooting at all.
Project Maven is a Pentagon project using machine learning to sort through masses of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data ‚Äì unmanned systems video, paper, computer hard drives, thumb drives and more ‚Äì collected by the department and intelligence agencies for operational use across the services. It has sometimes been called ‚Äúalgorithmic warfare.‚Äù
In a combat situation, Clark said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not trying to kill every bad guy out there‚Äù but rather are targeting a leader or a group of leaders. AI has already gained a strong foothold in logistics and maintenance in Pentagon thinking and is now making its way to commanders.
‚ÄúMaven has made some inroads [because] it is actively giving them courses of actions‚Äù and even parallel courses of actions to take simultaneously to further confuse an enemy.
Clark added that for more than a decade private industry has applied AI and machine learning to its operations. In doing so, businesses found out how to conduct tasks work with technology and then use the human workforce for other tasks, creating greater output overall.
Maven, however, has had something of a checkered past, particularly after Google withdrew from the project in 2018. Schultz said ‚Äúthe big issue is what happens to Maven a year or so from now when it goes out of business,‚Äù as expected under current budget plans.
With that being said, Schultz added that the Army‚Äôs 82nd Airborne Division and its XVIII Corps ‚Äúwant to be the first‚Äù division and corps to apply AI and machine learning across the board, from planning to operations to sustainment. He said the commanders had a special operations background before moving into their new positions, and that experience made them more familiar with what these technologies could do for them.
Clarke said a number of these AI and machine learning ideas would be tested in the Army‚Äôs Project Convergence next year.
‚ÄúCommanders have to set the tone [to allow] ideas to bubble up,‚Äù Clarke said of his experience in SOCOM. They have to build the cadre of data scientists and coders and the mid-level managers to become truly effective and sustain efficiencies. When that‚Äôs in place, they can share best practices with other units.
All agreed that, even with the adaptation of AI and machine learning to military operations, forward presence would remain important. How many forces, however, could be reduced when forces like Marines have more tools in their hands to succeed. Clark added, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre definitely seeing that synergy‚Äù in the Marine Corps on applying AI to operations.
‚ÄúWe can prevail‚Äù against the Chinese and the Russians in the new arms race, Schultz said. ‚ÄúWe just need to be able to harness [artificial intelligence].‚Äù
Clarke said his command was putting its ‚Äúmoney where its mouth is‚Äù when it comes to investing and operating with advanced technologies. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice.‚Äù

Technology is everywhere in the 21st century, and America‚Äôs food system is no exception.
Scientists with the USDA Agricultural Research Service‚Äôs (ARS) Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC), at the University of California (UC) ‚Äì Davis, have joined forces with over 40 researchers from six organizations to form an institute that will use artificial intelligence (AI) to create the next-generation food system. The team, led by UC Davis, also includes UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The project is funded by a $20 million grant from USDA‚Äôs National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
‚ÄúThe AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) is dedicated to accelerating the use of artificial intelligence to optimally produce, process, and distribute safe and nutritious food,‚Äù said Dr. Danielle Lemay, a USDA research molecular biologist at WHNRC.
The institute‚Äôs goals include using molecular breeding to improve crop yield, quality, and disease resistance; using AI applications and other technology, such as sensing platforms and robotics, to reduce resource use; enhancing food safety; and developing tools for consumers to make personalized health decisions.
According to Lemay, AIFS is developing AI to determine how to breed plants for optimal production, how to better manage water and nitrogen use, and how to forecast crop yields. For food processing, AI will help inform decisions about cleaning to improve sanitation and reduce the spread of pathogens. AI will also help reduce energy use and food waste by advising against transporting food that may not be used at its destination. In nutrition, AI will predict the ingredients from photos in a consumer‚Äôs own food journal.
‚ÄúAlso, one of our goals is to help young people understand the value of where their food comes from, and to see themselves in future agriculture and food careers,‚Äù Lemay said. ‚ÄúThe opportunity is to create more workers at all levels who have both AI and food system expertise. This includes engagement at every level ‚Äì from K through 12 and at community colleges, summer internships, and field days with farmers.‚Äù
Lemay, who leads the institute‚Äôs nutrition research, said AIFS is unique in that no other AI research effort has included human nutrition. ‚ÄúOur grand challenge is to apply AI technologies to better capture what people are eating, to determine the nutrients and molecular structure of that food, and to predict health outcomes of those dietary choices.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn the future, we hope that AI can be used to personalize information on health status, genotype, and microbiome,‚Äù said Lemay.
This research supports multiple themes outlined in the USDA Science Blueprint (PDF, 2.6 MB), which moves us closer to meeting the goals outlined in USDA‚Äôs Agriculture Innovation Agenda.

This supplement explores artificial intelligence (AI), one of the most rapidly advancing and controversial topics in scientific research. Driven by escalating computing power, expanding data sets, and algorithms of unprecedented sophistication, the number of journal and conference papers referring to AI in the Dimensions from Digital Science database increased by more than 600% between 2000 and 2019. Almost one-third of those papers date from 2017 to 2019. The year 2020 is set to be the biggest yet, both in terms of research published and money invested.

Nature Index 2020 Artificial intelligence
In these pages, we look at emerging technologies that are transforming the ways we live and work, and the growing concern around their potential misuse. We consider the collective responsibility of all who are engaged in the research and development of AI, including publishers, to ensure that it is carried out ethically and inclusively.We are pleased to bring you an experiment in AI-powered curation of content from the Nature Index publisher, Springer Nature, related to drug discovery with AI, as well as an account of the current and future uses of AI of scholarly publishing. We also describe the work of some of the most innovative researchers in the field, and the leading institutions based on output in the 82 high-quality natural-sciences journals tracked by the index.It is important to note that the Nature Index lens on AI research is a very focused one; the articles picked up by our database search concern specific applications of AI in the life sciences, physical sciences, chemistry, and Earth and environmental sciences. Between 2015 and 2019, these highly specialized articles comprised just 1.2% of all AI-related articles in the Dimensions database. The leading institutions for AI in the Nature Index are quite different from those with the most AI-related research in Dimensions, with Western institutions dominating the former and China the latter.

Poland joins the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence
08.12.2020
During the plenary summit held in Montreal, Poland joined the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence and its responsible development. 







The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) is an initiative that leverages international cooperation on key research and projects. The organisation aims at developing a responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence.
Breakthrough technology
The founding members of the GPAI are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union (as a single entity enacting international law). On 4 December, the Partnership was joined by new members during a plenary summit ‚Äì¬† Poland, Brazil, the Netherlands and Spain.
‚ÄúOn behalf of the Ministerial Council of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, I would like to welcome Poland as a new member. We are certain that Poland will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field of artificial intelligence to this ground-breaking initiative,‚Äù wrote Elizabeth Thomas-Raynaud, Secretary of the GPAI.
Poland‚Äôs accession into the Partnership is a result of Polish involvement in the field of AI in international forums, including the work of the AIGO (OECD) - Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and HLEG (EC) ‚Äì High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, spanning more than two years.
The experts representing Poland on the GPAI forum are attorney Robert Kroplewski, plenipotentiary of the Minister of Digital Affairs for Information Society and Prof. Bogumi≈Ç Kami≈Ñski, Warsaw School of Economics.
AI development in Poland
‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly turning into one of the most influential technologies in the world today. It changes the way people work and has a significant impact on national economies. Taking advantage of its full potential requires international cooperation and coordination,‚Äù claims Minister Marek Zag√≥rski, Secretary of State in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.
New technologies and solutions based on AI have an increasing impact on building the capacity of national economies. Poland also wants to get on this bandwagon.
To this end, the Polish Government has enacted the ""Policy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in Poland‚Äù ‚Äì a document, the goal of which is to achieve this objective, which emerged as a result of months-long consultations. The document has already been approved by the Committee of the Council of Ministers for Digital Affairs, currently pending approval by the Council of Ministers.
The ‚ÄúPolicy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in Poland‚Äù supports and complements other documents, including the Responsible Development Strategy, the European Commission's Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence, as well as the work of international organisations, including the OECD.¬†¬† ¬†
Our document takes into account not only the international, legal, technical or organisational dimension of the use of artificial intelligence, but also its ethical aspects,‚Äù says Minister Marek Zag√≥rski, Secretary of State in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.¬†‚ÄúOur mission is to support the society, companies, representatives of the academia and public administration in taking advantage of opportunities related to AI development, while ensuring the protection of human dignity and conditions for fair competition in this global race,‚Äù he added.
The document defines actions and objectives for Poland in the short term (2023), medium term (2027) and long term (post-2027) perspective.
We divided them into six areas:
AI and society¬†‚Äì activities, whose goal is to make Poland one of the major beneficiaries of a data-based economy, while raising awareness of the need for the continuous improvement of digital competences.
AI and innovative companies¬†‚Äì support for Polish AI companies, including the development of financing mechanisms, as well as ways of cooperation between start-ups and the government.
AI and science¬†‚Äì support for the Polish scientific and research community in designing interdisciplinary challenges or solutions in the area of AI, including activities aimed at preparing AI expert staff.
AI and education¬†‚Äì activities starting in primary schooling and continuing until the university level ‚Äì course curricula for people at risk of losing their jobs as a result of development of new technologies, educational grants.
AI and international cooperation¬†‚Äì activities supporting Polish companies in the field of AI and technology development in the international arena.

The first summit of the Global Partnership for Artificial Intelligence (GPIA) was held in Montreal on December 3 and 4. On this occasion, the Franco-Canadian PMIA initiative was expanded to include four new member states, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland and Brazil.

Officially launched on 15 June 2020, the PMIA has 15 founding members: France, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, the European Union, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. The goal of this international, multi-stakeholder initiative is to promote the responsible use of AI in a spirit of respect for human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and economic growth. To achieve these objectives, member countries work through the PMIA to build bridges between theory and practice, to support research activities or the application of trusted artificial intelligence.
Democratic values, human rights, accountability, transparency, diversity, inclusiveness and privacy are at the core of the values of PMIA and its work.
On the occasion of this first summit, the PMIA bodies (steering committee and council) were officially set up and the first works undertaken by the researchers were presented in plenary session. The experts are notably supported by two centres of expertise located in Paris, hosted by Inria, and in Montreal, hosted by the Montreal International Centre of Expertise for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (CIMIA). Working groups focus on 4 main themes: ‚ÄúFuture of Work‚Äù and ‚ÄúInnovation & Commercialization‚Äù in Paris, and ‚ÄúResponsible AI‚Äù and ‚ÄúData Governance‚Äù in Montreal. An additional group dedicated to Covid-19 was launched in 2020 to help address the global health crisis.
This session also confirmed the momentum behind the initiative. Spain, the Netherlands, Poland and Brazil joined the initiative, bringing the number of PMIA member states to 19. The newly elected Steering Committee members include 5 States (France, Canada, United States, Italy and Japan) and 6 AI experts (see list below).
France, which has been designated as the incoming vice-presidency, will assume the presidency in 2022. Canada will hold the presidency until the fall of 2021. The next PMIA Summit will be held in Paris.
List of experts sitting on the PMIA Steering Committee :


Baroness Joanna Shields (Chair of the Multistakeholder Experts Group Plenary)
Ashley J. Llorens (Science)
Francesca Rossi (Industry)
Carly Kind (Civil Society)
Christina J.Colclough (Labour / Social Partners)
Association for the Advancement of AI (AAAI) (international organization)

Several Senate and House staffers suspect the responsible use of artificial intelligence and America‚Äôs technology workforce pipeline could land among big-ticket tech policy items for the next Congress, which is set to start early next month.¬†‚ÄúI would love to see us putting out proposals related to bias [in AI] and related to the future of work‚Äîthose are two areas that we have not played in too much yet,‚Äù Sam Mulopulos, a legislative assistant for Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said during a virtual event hosted by the Wilson Center Thursday.¬†He spoke alongside a few other Congressional staff members in the AI caucuses.¬†The group reflected on AI-accelerating accomplishments that unfolded through the current but soon-to-end session of Congress. Mulopulos noted the Senate AI Caucus launched in 2019 and before this session closes, all six of its legislative proposals related to the emerging technology are poised to pass through the National Defense Authorization Act, which could soon be up for a vote.¬†While AI is widely used commercially and increasingly leveraged by federal agencies, it remains on-the-rise and less-regulated. Congress members‚Äô views on the tech are generally mixed across the aisle.Explainable AI was defined in American law for the first time in the 2020 NDAA, through legislation partly pushed forward by Portman. Signaling back to that, staff director for the Science Space and Technology Committee‚Äôs Subcommittee on Research and Technology Dahlia Sokolov said there‚Äôs still a dire need for consensus definitions for other descriptives connected to trustworthy AI.‚ÄúBias is probably an easier one, because you get statistical results,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut a lot of these terms you use around trustworthiness‚Äîtransparency and explainability are two big ones‚Äîwe don't actually have agreed upon definitions, so we really need to start at first principles: what do we even agree these things mean and how do we measure them?‚ÄùThe realm of responsible AI is also a sharp focus for Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M, according to the lawmaker‚Äôs Military Legislative Assistant Sean Duggan. Offering an example of potential implications in this area, Duggan highlighted the need to be able to trace back an algorithm‚Äôs role or choice in denying someone a loan.¬†‚ÄúI think that AI will only be as useful or accepted as people feel comfortable that it is a part of our everyday lives,‚Äù Duggan said. ‚ÄúAnd if you can't explain that to somebody on the street, then I think that a lot of its usage, and future can be limited. That's one big focus of the senator‚Äîand hopefully the Senate AI caucus next year‚Äîhow do we increase familiarity, trustworthiness and accountability with AI?‚ÄùTechnology evaluations steered by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology could enable new learnings on bias in AI, Mulopulos added, suggesting one on algorithms used to make housing-related decisions and any racial disparities that might arise, prompted by Duggan‚Äôs point. AI and accountability in its usage has also emerged as an Executive Branch priority. President Trump signed an executive order last week guiding agencies‚Äô efforts with the technology, with the intent to foster public trust.The panelists agreed that the future of work and broadening America‚Äôs technology-focused education pipeline will likely also be in-focus for Congress next year.¬†‚ÄúPart of what we need to do is start really looking internally about how we can make sure our children ... are educated enough to tackle these jobs,‚Äù Mike Richards, deputy chief of staff for Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, said. A focus could be placed on further incentivizing kids to gain interest in science, technology, engineering and math‚Äîor STEM‚Äîeducation paths, he said.Sokolov added that while the federal role in STEM education and the nation‚Äôs talent pool is small compared to the state and local levels, it‚Äôs not nonexistent. The Science Committee will look back on current incentives, scholarships and fellowships in this space to address ongoing challenges that come with building a future-facing workforce, she noted. They‚Äôll also be ‚Äúthinking harder and more deeply about this diversity issue in terms of what really works.‚Äù‚ÄúI think we all recognize, too, that this pandemic has set us back on STEM education, and in particular, equal access across the socio-economic spectrum,‚Äù Sokolov said. ‚ÄúAnd it's going to be a real challenge to build our way back out of that.‚Äù

AI Digital Oilfield Lab Opens at University of HoustonProject Teams Students, Faculty and Industry to Create Innovative Solutions  
By Jeannie Kever 713-743-0778December 10, 2020


The new Artificial Intelligence Industry Incubator and Digital Oilfield Lab at the University of Houston at Sugar Land offers students, faculty and industry collaborators to use artificial sensors and other equipment.Key players in bringing the lab and incubator to the College of Technology are, from left, Dean Anthony Ambler; Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies George Zouridakis; Konrad Konarski, chair and director of operations at the AI Innovation Consortium; Associate Professor Amaury Lendasse;  Professor of Practice David Crawley; and Associate Professor of Instruction Brian Mehring.The energy industry is rapidly becoming more dependent on the use of data and artificial intelligence. A new Artificial Intelligence Industry Incubator and Digital Oilfield Lab at the University of Houston will allow students, faculty and industry professionals to create the technologies and other solutions needed for the future.
The lab, a project of the UH College of Technology and the AI Innovation Consortium (AIIC), will open later this month, focused on projects that can promote safety and efficiency by, in part, relying on machine learning and other forms of AI to reduce the human footprint in the field. The consortium is based in Louisville, Kentucky, and made up of universities including UH, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Louisville and Louisiana State University, along with a number of corporations.
The Artificial Intelligence Industry Incubator and Digital Oilfield Lab will be housed at the University of Houston at Sugar Land, an instructional site of the University of Houston, and is part of the College of Technology‚Äôs Advanced Technology and Innovation Laboratory.
College of Technology Dean Anthony Ambler said the project and membership in the AI Innovation Consortium are a win for both students and industry.
‚ÄúAs subject matter experts in energy technology, our expertise in AI machine learning and robotic process automation and project management has already generated advances for the consortium‚Äôs industry partners and for our students,‚Äù he said. ¬†
David Crawley, professor of practice in the College of Technology, said the partnership will conduct commercial research and prototyping for the next generation of energy innovation. But beyond the commercial applications, he said, it will support students with workforce skills, industry internships and incubator activities.
‚ÄúThe laboratory and incubator will allow our students to contribute to the various applied research and proof of concept work currently underway and in the future,‚Äù Crawley said. ‚ÄúThis includes working with the AIIC‚Äôs commercial partners to create opportunities to move their incubator experience and advanced academic background into jobs at participating operations.‚Äù¬†
The AIIC has built similar incubator programs at Penn State for industrial manufacturing and the University of Louisville for autonomous driving. For the program at UH, consortium leaders said several companies already have agreed to collaborate on projects focused on AI-powered predictive analytics, AI for visual inspection, and health and safety.
‚ÄúThis incubator program emphasizes the need to build projects grounded in clear business value, with technologically rich and hands-on initiatives, and an engaging industry/academia partnership,‚Äù said Konrad Konarski, chair and director of operations at AIIC. ‚ÄúThis allows us to focus on the most relevant AI technologies that have immediate impact and value to the oil and gas industry.‚Äù
Kris Skrinak, a leader in AI who is global machine learning segment lead for Amazon Web Services and a member of the AIIC advisory council, said the UH program is important for industry in several ways.
‚ÄúThese types of AI programs help strengthen efforts for broader industry adoption and are assisting in cultivating the next generation of AI experts in the workforce,‚Äù he said.

In association withNever lose: these rules will ensure you never lose at noughts and crosses - and help you understand AI Illustration by Garry Parsons @Meiklejohn.co.ukJason Deans8 December 2020Welcome to the fifth part of the Future London STEM Project ‚Äî our series for young people that considers the impact of science, technology, engineering and maths on our world, and explains how you can get involved. Every fortnight we share a STEM challenge for you to try at home, and meet inspiring people who tell us about their STEM jobs and explain how they developed their skills through school, university and beyond. ¬†Today we‚Äôre working with the Game AI Research Group at Queen Mary University of London and taking a look at artificial intelligence and the key role it plays in the creation of video games. We‚Äôre also meeting Lucrezia Del Zompo who uses artificial intelligence in her job and in her studies.Mike Cook, 33, a research fellow working in Queen Mary‚Äôs Game AI Research Group, has helped us with our latest STEM Challenge, in which we show you how to never lose at noughts and crosses ‚Äî and how to simulate how AI can do the same thing ‚Äî using just a piece of paper with a set of instructions. ¬†In our third STEM challenge, a magic card trick, we learned how computer algorithms work: how by following a series of logical steps, they guarantee a desired outcome to solving a problem. ¬†AI is often used to describe machines or computers that mimic the learning and problem-solving functions of the human mind. Devices with AI are known as ‚Äúintelligent agents‚Äù ‚Äî capable of assessing their environment and taking actions to achieve specific goals. They do this by using algorithms that not only follow the same series of steps every time to solve a problem, but are capable of learning by a process of trial and error. ¬†Mike says: ‚ÄúImagine that you were trying to bake a cake but parts of the recipe were missing. We can bake a cake every day and change the recipe a little each time and see how it tasted. Over time, we‚Äôd get closer to a cake that tasted good.
‚ÄúThose are the kinds of processes where we like to apply AI. Ones where our algorithm doesn‚Äôt just do the same thing, but has a way of improving its solution each time it tries and fails.‚Äù
If you‚Äôve played a video game, then you will have played against the game‚Äôs AI in single-player mode. The AI will be programmed to behave differently, depending on the game. ‚ÄúIn a game like The Sims, we want our AI to act more like humans,‚Äù explains Mike. ‚ÄúWe want it to be emotional, make mistakes, to create dramatic stories.
‚ÄúWhereas in a game like Dark Souls [for ages 16+], which is about being an adventurer, we want the AI to be difficult but we don‚Äôt want it to always beat us. We want it to be predictable so we can learn its movements and work out how to defeat it.‚Äù

Sometimes you notice the AI because it‚Äôs an enemy, for instance. But not all AI controls characters in games. Some of it is making the game design adapt to things we do. ¬†Mike explains what that means in an online multiplayer game like Fortnite: ‚ÄúHere these intelligent algorithms try to guess where you‚Äôre going to move or shoot next, so if there‚Äôs a problem with your internet connection, it still feels to you like the correct thing happened.‚Äù
AI is also used in video games for ‚Äúprocedural generation‚Äù, which is designing the content, the levels and worlds players inhabit. ‚ÄúOne of the big examples of this is Minecraft. Minecraft worlds are created by procedural generation and it‚Äôs the AI doing the game design,‚Äù Mike says.
How to never lose at noughts and crossesWant to impress your friends or family by ¬†never losing at noughts and crosses? In our fifth STEM challenge, we show you how learning a simple set of rules can help you build a winning streak ‚Äî just make sure your opponent doesn‚Äôt learn them too!Noughts and crosses may appear a simple game, yet it‚Äôs used by lecturers at Queen Mary University of London to show school students how computer programs and artificial intelligence work. In fact, one of earliest video games, OXO, developed by Cambridge University computer science professor Sandy Douglas in 1952, used an AI program to play noughts and crosses. ¬†Playing noughts and crosses by following the rules below will help you understand how everything computers do is governed by instructions created by computer programmers. This also prompts the question: can something that follows these instructions be considered intelligent? ¬†We‚Äôve worked with the Game AI Research Group, part of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London on this latest STEM challenge. ¬†Our noughts and crosses challenge is based on an activity co-created by Paul Curzon, professor of computer science in the school, for the Computer Science 4 Fun (cs4fn) project at Queen Mary, which shows how computer science is about solving puzzles, creativity and changing the future. ¬†You will needA piece of paper to write down the rules for never losing at noughts and crossesSome more paper to play noughts and crosses on ‚Äî or, if you have one, a whiteboard you can wipe clean after every gameA pen or pencil, or a whiteboard penSomeone to play against (preferably an opponent who doesn‚Äôt know the rules for never losing a game!The rules for never losing at noughts and crossesOn a piece of paper, write down the following rules ‚Äî which you could also call a computer program or algorithm as they are a set of instructions to be followed. If you can memorise them, you‚Äôve more chance of winning!
Move 1: ¬†Go in a corner. ¬†Move 2: ¬†If the other player did not go there, THEN go in the opposite corner to move 1. ELSE go in a free corner. ¬†Move 3: If there are 2 Xs and a space in a line, THEN go in that space. IF there are 2 Os and a space in a line, THEN go in that space. IF NOT go in a free corner. ¬†Move 4: IF there are 2 Xs and a space in a line, THEN go in that space. IF there are 2 Os and a space in a line THEN go in that space. IF NOT go in a free corner. ¬†Move 5: Go in the free space. ¬†If you follow the rules every game, you will either win or draw ‚Äî never lose. Repeat this process until the other player gets tired of you being the noughts and crosses champion!Why do these rules work?Mike Cook says that noughts and crosses is useful for illustrating how computer programs ¬†and AI work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a determinist game, meaning you always know what‚Äôs going to happen when you make a move. It‚Äôs also what we ¬†see all the information in the ¬†game at all times, except what the other player is thinking.‚ÄúThe more you play noughts and crosses the more you learn the process by which you can always guarantee a win or a draw. That process is exactly the algorithm you‚Äôve written ¬†down. Most AI comes down to writing some kind of algorithm.‚Äù
However, AI is not just an algorithm that follows that same set of instructions no matter what happens. An AI device is an ‚Äúintelligent agent‚Äù, capable of assessing its environment, learning by trial and error and adapting to solve problems. ¬†So where does the intelligence in AI come from ‚Äî is it from the people who design it or the device itself? This is a big philosophical question that computer scientists are always debating, according to Mike.¬†‚ÄúCertainly a lot of the intelligence comes from the people who write the algorithms, design computer systems and input data that AI uses. But sometimes we can‚Äôt really agree on where the intelligence comes from,‚Äù he says. There are examples of AI algorithms that have come up with solutions that no one would ever have thought of. ¬†‚ÄúWith AI we‚Äôre trying to find ways to give computers the same kind of reasoning, planning and processes we take for granted. The most fun part of building an AI is trying to figure out how to take this knowledge that you have and express it in a way that a computer can understand and use.‚Äù

TK photograph: Erik BlombergA study by Tampere University uses artificial intelligence (AI) to study photographs from World War II in a multidisciplinary research project whose results will help museums and image archives to meet the requirements of the EU‚Äôs Web Accessibility Directive. Researchers in various fields will also benefit when AI handles the raw screening of large data.‚ÄúOur study has much to offer in terms of accessibility on the one hand and AI and image research on the other,‚Äù says Anssi M√§nnist√∂, university lecturer in visual journalism.
M√§nnist√∂ is a member of research projects related to AI and image analysis of war photos taken during WW2. The starting point is basic research whose results can help the work of digital archives that contain millions of images. The results will benefit memory organisations, such as archives, libraries, museums and research institutes, as well as newspapers, media and image archives owned by private companies.
A solution for museums‚Äô problem with EU Directive
The multidisciplinary research group received funding from the Academy of Finland‚Äôs Intelligent Society Programme for the research project ‚ÄúImproving Public Accessibility of Large Image Archives‚Äù (IPALIA), which uses AI to study the accessibility of large image archives. At Tampere University, three research fields participate in the study: machine learning, information studies and visual culture research.
The project aims to improve public access to large image databases and collections in a way that meets the conditions of the EU‚Äôs Web Accessibility Directive that entered into force in September.
The directive requires that all images that are publicly available online must be accompanied by a textual description of the content. This requirement is a bottleneck for image archives and museums because there are no cheap and efficient methods to do this work. The problem is particularly great for Finnish-language and Finnish image content.
The research project will use materials from the Finnish Wartime Photograph Archive of the Finnish Defence Forces, which contains almost 160,000 photographs taken by the information troops (TK) during the Finnish Winter, Continuation and Lapland Wars captured in 1939‚Äì1945.
According to M√§nnist√∂, the aim of the new research project that is about be launched is to create a model that provides content description for the TK images in accordance with the directive. The same model will also help other museums and image archives to meet the conditions of the directive.
‚ÄúThe purpose is to provide help in a big challenge. The obligation to have descriptive texts is a rather big problem for many museums,‚Äù M√§nnist√∂ says.
M√§nnist√∂ considers the situation to be optimal for AI research because there is a high demand for practical accessibility solutions.
Ideological undertones of war photographs
The captions for images are often written with an emphasis on factors that do not meet the conditions for accessibility. Images from the front may even contain an ideological or propagandistic description of the situation.
AI and algorithms are not neutral either, but in their basic form they extract quantitative information from many images, for example, of individuals, animals, objects, buildings and their numbers.
AI does not tell you directly that the sergeant major and the captain in the photo are in an artillery barrage or in a certain place in their free time. Instead, it can tell, for example, which patterns or objects are in the front or behind the main characters. M√§nnist√∂ is particularly fascinated by the fact that AI is also able to do spatial analysis.
AI produces basic descriptive text, but it is still partly unclear how much it manages to say about the sexes and age groups of the people in the photo and how well it is able to determine, for example, the weather or the season.
‚ÄúWe have a pretty big basic research component. It is not possible to say with certainty how deep we will get, but we are quite sure that we will gain interesting results,‚Äù M√§nnist√∂ says.
The research project has agreed with the Tampere Museum Centre Vapriikki that the model created in the project will be tested with some of Vapriikki‚Äôs materials in the final phase.
‚ÄúThere may be certain special characteristics in the war imagery that are good to analyse and exclude and to examine how generalisable our method is. We are pleased to have this opportunity,‚Äù M√§nnist√∂ notes.
M√§nnist√∂ praises the research project, for example, for the fact that the new Tampere University can, at its best, introduce genuine and new creative multidisciplinary research and problem solving.
In addition to M√§nnist√∂, Postdoctoral Research Fellow Jenni Raitoharju, who studies machine learning and AI, and Associate Professor Sanna Kumpulainen from information studies are involved in the planning and implementation of the IPALIA project.
AI names people and animals in the contents of photographs. As a new feature, it can also distinguish spatial elements. Identifying TK photographers in the study ‚ÄúMachine Learning Based Analysis of Finnish World War II Photographers‚Äù.
WW2 photos are public, but their contents have not been analysed
The Finnish WW2 images have been published for everyone to use, but only a small part of them have been used in eg books. According to M√§nnist√∂, no one still has a precise idea of the totality of the huge material.
‚ÄúThe photos have been published, but I hit a wall while getting acquainted with their number, contents and temporal variation,‚Äù M√§nnist√∂ describes his research experiences.
The idea of using machine learning for the analysis of war images arose when M√§nnist√∂ went through such images while writing a book with historian Ville Kivim√§ki.
In the first phase, M√§nnist√∂ and an international research group conducted an AI based analysis of the war images whose results have been reported in the article ‚ÄúMachine Learning Based Analysis of Finnish World War II Photographers‚Äù. The study is known to be the first of its kind worldwide.
According to M√§nnist√∂, a new dimension of photographic research is introduced in the article, which is the fact that the study distinguishes between basic image sizes such as overview shots, medium shots and close-ups. AI also distinguished where the people in the image are located. These functions can be applied by museums and media houses.
With traditional methods, researchers can browse and observe the quantitative properties of images very slowly, which means that the numbers of images that can be examined are small, only a few hundred or thousand images.
The research group got AI to analyse about 59,000 WW2 images in a short time. The study produced interesting distributions that would have taken months or years to do with other methods.
From war image analysis to photos about covid-19
The analysis of war images will be helpful when M√§nnist√∂ begins studying photographs published in the Helsingin Sanomat (HS) newspaper during the covid-19 pandemic in the KORTE project. According to M√§nnist√∂, the method implemented in the study to identify the mutual distance of the persons in the image in both depth and width is the key to being able to analyse the changes in the distances between people in HS photographs during the pandemic.
In the research project, the character structure of approximately 80,000‚Äì100,000 images will be broken down by machine learning and the interrelationships between image content will be investigated further. In the second phase of the project, qualitative analysis ‚Äì meaning more traditional media research methods ‚Äì will be used. It is not a question of alternative but of complementary methods.
M√§nnist√∂ says that the transition from WW2 images to newspaper images is a tremendous leap into another era. The images of WW2 basically lack all metadata, such as information about the time, place, and camera settings, which in modern cameras are automatically saved to an image file.
The sample of newspaper images will cover a period of 6‚Äì7 months in 2020 and the same months for 2019. AI will screen information from the HS images about the mode in which the images were taken, whether indoors or outdoors, and whether the people are close to each other or far apart. The basic distribution will provide a starting point for qualitative analysis.

Researchers will have more time for their studies
The new opportunities afforded by AI and machine learning are likely to revolutionise research by analysing raw data.
M√§nnist√∂ remembers how in the 1990s, he went through six months of the Time and Suomen Kuvalehti magazines in six research periods in search of images on Islam for his doctoral dissertation.
‚ÄúIt took me months to go through the magazines. I took photocopies and there were no digital cameras,‚Äù M√§nnist√∂ reminisces.
He went through hundreds of images and browsed thousands of pages. Now, he estimates that thanks to AI, a zero could be added to the end of those numbers and a couple of zeros deleted from the time he spent. That time can now be used on the qualitative analysis part.
‚ÄúI find this inspiring because new methods are being developed and it is tested how they could work together in the multidisciplinary study of journalism, communication and history,‚Äù M√§nnist√∂ says.
In the future, huge amounts of data can be processed with the help of AI, and researchers‚Äô time is freed from browsing pages to the actual research analysis.
‚ÄúI cannot say when we are at a mature stage, but we are now taking decisive steps in that direction. There are likely to be setbacks, but I‚Äôm very excited about this method,‚Äù M√§nnist√∂ enthuses.

New applications powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are being embraced by the public and private sectors. Their early uses hint at what‚Äôs to come.FACIAL RECOGNITION: Recognizing biasIn June 2020, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft announced that they were stepping back from facial-recognition software development amid concerns that it reinforces racial and gender bias. Amazon and Microsoft said they would stop selling facial-recognition software to police until new laws are passed in the United States to address potential human-rights abuses. IBM has called for an industry-wide review of the technology and how it is used.Earlier in the year, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet, backed a proposal by the European Union to temporarily ban the technology in public places, such as train stations and stadiums.Facial-recognition systems are trained using a vast number of images to create ‚Äòfaceprints‚Äô of people by mapping the geometry of certain facial features. Faceprints are used to classify a face into categories such as gender, age or race, and to compare it to other faceprints stored in databases. According to a 2018 report by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), between 2014 and 2018, facial-recognition systems became 20 times better at finding a match in a database of 12 million portrait photos. But a separate study, published by NIST in December 2019, found that African-American and Asian faces were misidentified 10 to 100 times more often than Caucasian men (P. J. Grother et al. NIST Interagency/Internal Report 8280; 2019). The systems also had difficulty identifying women.

Nature Index 2020 Artificial intelligence
In a seminal paper published in 2018 by Timnit Gebru, former co-lead of Google‚Äôs Ethical AI Team in Mountain View, California) and Joy Buolamwini from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, male and light-skinned subjects were found to be more accurately classified than female and dark-skinned subjects. The study states that such errors occur largely because the systems were trained using mostly white, male-dominated data sets. One widely used data set was roughly 75% male and 80% white (J. Buolamwini and T. Gebru Proc. Mach. Learn. Res. 81, 77‚Äì91; 2018).‚ÄúThere is a realization in the computer facial recognition community that there are high-stakes consequences, especially for marginal communities,‚Äù says Ellen Broad, an AI governance and ethics expert at the Australian National University in Canberra.A Nature survey, featured in a November 2020 special issue on facial recognition, revealed discomfort among some researchers working in the field, particularly with regards to how its use might affect minority groups (see Nature 587, 354‚Äì358; 2020). The 480 respondents said they were most uncomfortable about the use of facial recognition for live surveillance in schools and workplaces, and by companies to monitor public spaces, but were generally in support of it being used by police in criminal investigations.The New York Police Department (NYPD) has been using facial-recognition technology since 2011 to match faces of unidentified criminals in surveillance footage and crime scene photos to those on watch lists. The NYPD states that no known case in New York City involves a person being falsely arrested on the basis of a facial-recognition match.Despite concerns, facial-recognition software use is on the rise in many countries. It is now widespread in China and its use is growing rapidly in India. In 2019, the Australian government‚Äôs Identity-matching Services Bill authorized the Department of Home Affairs to create and maintain facilities for the sharing of facial images and other identity information between government agencies and, in some circumstances, private organizations. ‚Äî by Leigh DaytonDEEPFAKE: Blink and you‚Äôll miss itThe origins of deepfake, using AI to create falsified photos, videos or audio files, can be traced to 2017, when pornographic videos spliced with celebrities‚Äô faces were posted online. The early iterations that followed were relatively easy to detect, says Siwei Lyu, professor of computer science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who pioneered a technique when he noticed that people in deepfake videos blinked far less often than they do in real life. As the technology advanced, so did Lyu‚Äôs detection algorithms. They are now designed to identify the subtle changes left by creators when they resize or rotate a person‚Äôs face to merge or superimpose it onto an image or video.One way to create a deepfake video, Lyu explains, is using a neural network called a generative adversarial network (GAN), split into two parts. The ‚Äògenerator‚Äô is trained using thousands of photos, videos or audio files to create hyper-realistic, but false, versions. The ‚Äòdiscriminator‚Äô detects poorly made fakes by comparing them to the real thing. The two parts might compete back and forth millions of times before the generator creates something realistic enough to ‚Äòfool‚Äô the discriminator.The more advanced the GAN, the less training data it requires. That‚Äôs one reason why Hao Li, professor of computer science at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, thinks the battle to detect deepfakes could already be lost. ‚ÄúThe fakes are getting so much better that they‚Äôre undetectable in real time,‚Äù he says.In 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that deepfake audio was used to impersonate the voice of a chief executive from an unnamed UK-based energy firm to complete a fraudulent ‚Ç¨220,000 (US$261,000) bank transfer.Li hopes that the more people learn about the existence of deepfakes, the less effective they will become. In September 2020, Microsoft Research launched its Video Authenticator software to combat the spread of disinformation through deepfakes, particularly those designed to undermine electoral processes and COVID-19 health advice.Although there is an urgent need to combat deceptive deepfakes, the technology is increasingly being embraced by researchers, particularly in fields such as medicine and astronomy. In 2019, for example, a team from the Institute of Medical Informatics at the University of L√ºbeck in Germany proposed the use of GANs to create hyper-realistic medical images to train AI used in cancer diagnosis. And a team led by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California is using its ‚ÄòCosmoGAN‚Äô system to produce maps of dark matter in the Universe. ‚Äî by Bill CondieAI DRUG DISCOVERY: Quicker treatments In January 2020, researchers launched the world‚Äôs first human clinical trial of a drug discovered using AI. Intended to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the compound DSP-1181 was identified using an AI drug discovery platform called Centaur Chemist.After trawling through chemical libraries containing thousands of molecules, Centaur Chemist found the most relevant compounds for regulating serotonin, a chemical in the brain that has been linked to OCD. These were synthesized and tested in the lab before DSP-1181 was selected for a clinical trial in Japan.

The project is led by Exscientia, the British pharmaceutical company that owns Centaur Chemist, and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, a Japanese pharmaceutical firm. It took less than 12 months for the team to progress from the discovery stage to the end of preclinical testing. The global average is four to six years. If DSP-1181 obtains regulatory approval, it would be a major feat. Ninety per cent of compounds that start phase I trials (the earliest trials of drugs in people) fail to make it to market.AI-powered systems have the potential to rapidly accelerate the drug-discovery process and thereby reduce spending. Bringing a new drug to market costs, on average, up to US$2.8 billion, and can take more than a decade. ‚ÄúDrug discovery is so expensive; anything, no matter how small, is going to be of immense benefit,‚Äù says Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Australia. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of a more pressing time to develop drugs more cheaply and quickly.‚ÄùThe project follows work by Hong Kong-based biotechnology company, Insilico Medicine, and its machine-learning platform, GENTRL. A 2019 Nature Biotechnology paper led by Insilico founder Alexander Zhavoronkov describes how, in 46 days, the company designed, synthesized and experimentally validated a drug that targets a protein linked to a number of diseases, including fibrosis (A. Zhavoronkov et al. Nature Biotechnol. 37, 1038‚Äì1040; 2019). The drug has been found to be effective in rats.It‚Äôs unsurprising that pharmaceutical giants are increasingly partnering with AI firms for drug development. In August 2020, Exscientia was named alongside Pfizer, Bayer and Merck as one of 37 partners in the new Corona Accelerated R&D Europe initiative, the largest undertaking of its kind to discover and develop COVID-19 treatments. ‚Äî by Leigh DaytonREADING NON-VERBAL CUES: Emotional intelligenceEmotion AI describes systems that can recognize, respond to and simulate moods and emotions. Designed to detect non-verbal cues, including body language, facial expressions and tone of voice, technologies based on emotion AI are being developed by industries such as recruitment, health care and education.In offices or classrooms, for example, emotional cues could be used to detect those who are overworked or disengaged, says Simon Lucey, director of the Australian Institute of Machine Learning at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fantastic application base to flag early signs of people who are stressed,‚Äù says Lucey. Researchers are also exploring how emotion AI could detect signs of depression and anxiety.Research on emotion AI has grown rapidly. According to the Dimensions database, the number of publications that mention ‚Äòemotion AI‚Äô, ‚Äòsentiment analysis‚Äô and ‚Äòopinion mining‚Äô has increased almost tenfold between 2011 and 2019, from 1,225 publications to 11,926.Companies such as Affectiva, founded by researchers from the MIT Media Lab, offer products aimed at detecting consumer reactions to brands and advertisements. In South Korea, nearly one-quarter of the top 131 corporations say they are using or plan to use emotion AI in recruitment, according to the Korea Economic Research Institute. Companies selling these systems, such as Midas IT, based in Pangyo, South Korea, claim that they can determine if a candidate is more likely to have qualities such as honesty or tenacity, based on expressions and word choice during interviews.Researchers are calling for caution. They point to a lack of evidence that current emotion AI products can accurately deduce an individual‚Äôs emotional state. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, says it is also concerning that such technologies assume that certain facial movements are universally perceived as expressions of particular emotions. Her research, which includes studies conducted with small communities in the Pacific, found diversity, rather than uniformity, in how people across cultures interpret facial movements. ‚Äî by Bill Condie

Eduard Fosch-Villaronga becomes Assistant Professor at eLaw

                 10 December 2020
            
eLaw - Center for Law and Digital Technologies, has promoted Dr. Eduard Fosch-Villaronga to Assistant Professor to work on Law and Artificial Intelligence.

Dr. Eduard Fosch-Villaronga arrived at eLaw in January 2019, holding a Marie Sklodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship to work on legal and ethical issues arising from healthcare robots and AI technologies.¬†
In his new position, Dr. Fosch-Villaronga will be the coordinator of the courses Law and Artificial Intelligence, the Honors College Pre-University course on Robot Law, and the Digital Government course at the Advanced Master in Law and Digital Technologies. He will also continue investigating topics on Law and Artificial Intelligence.
Dr. Fosch-Villaronga's research addresses the legal and regulatory aspects associated with the use and development of robot and AI technologies. He investigates the interplay between various aspects of the law (privacy, transparency, responsibility, discrimination, and dignity) and different robot embodiments (social robots for therapy, physical assistants for rehabilitation, robotic avatars, or artificial intelligence). Eduard's work helps devise interdisciplinary safeguards for making robots and AI safe to use for society, including children, persons with disabilities, and older people. In this respect, he developed the Robot Impact Assessment methodology to promote responsible robot development.¬† 



                    Eduard Fosch Villaronga and Bart Custers (head of eLaw)
                

His ultimate goal is to understand the legal and societal consequences robot and AI technologies have on human nature and inform policies accordingly.¬†
His contribution to this field led the European Commission to appoint him as an Expert at the Sub-Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI), connected products and other new challenges in product safety to the Consumer Safety Network (CSN), a consultative expert group chaired by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers to revise the General Product Safety directive.
He is also the PI of LIAISON, a project that received the COVR Award, and aims to link robot development and policymaking to reduce the complexity in robot legal compliance (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program grant agreement No 779966). He is the co-leader of the Working Group on the Ethical, Legal and Societal Aspects for Wearable Robots at the H2020 COST Action CA16116 and an MC Member of the H2020 Cost Action CA19121 GoodBrother that aims to increase the awareness of the ethical, legal, and privacy issues associated with audio- and video-based monitoring and to propose privacy-aware working solutions for assisted living.¬†

Considering this advancing trend, many eCommerce businesses have begun to use different forms of artificial intelligence for understanding their customers‚Äô buying behavior, offering relevant products at the right time, and identifying competitors‚Äô strategies by enabling AI reliable analytics.¬†To add to that, competition across global eCommerce markets is at an all-time high. While eCommerce companies are standing up to these market challenges, AI brings the best results in business operations.¬†Build Your Next eCommerce Strategy With AI-based ModelsE-commerce businesses around the world are using AI to accomplish tedious tasks so they can channel their efforts towards more intelligent work. From Alexa to Google‚Äôs home devices & chatbots artificial intelligence has already been a part of our lives. Likewise, AI in eCommerce has improved the entire experience of online buying & selling and adding a personal touch to the customer experience. Companies like Amazon and  have already revolutionized their traditional practices to bring the best results in their businesses.But how are they doing this? In this article, we will see various applications of artificial intelligence in eCommerce.Personalization of Online PurchasesArtificial intelligence in eCommerce offers personalized and interactive buying experiences. With AI-enabled systems, companies can view their customers‚Äô preferences in real-time and provide them with reliable and specialized shopping experiences.¬†AI can deliver suitable product suggestions according to the preferences of the user. AI can play a big role in identifying customer behavior through personalization and, by analyzing clicks, shopping carts, purchasing history, and search queries. All these can help eCommerce brands to deliver suitable suggestions for additional purchases that make sense in the eyes of the user.¬†Warehouse AutomationAI in eCommerce is also transforming warehouse management for small businesses. AI-powered solutions help to streamline product pick-and-pack processes without taking lunch breaks. AI robots can work 24/7. Employing AI solutions in the warehouse can result in a reduction of errors as AI robots understand their placement and thus can place and retrieve them when required.¬†Warehouses can also use technologies such as IoT and AR/VR, that work in tandem with AI to improve the accuracy in warehouse operations. AI robots can monitor warehouse operations as well. And they can identify and assess the risk score of activities in the warehouse by analyzing them. The robots can also take over the high-risk tasks, and thus is beneficial for improving the safety of employees at the warehouse.Visual SearchAI-enabled visual search is the ability to use an image to search for identical or similar visual images. A product picture is worth a thousand words, visual product searchability can undoubtedly solve the issue of inaccurate search queries.¬†When purchasing online a customer should have a simple search process but in many cases the journey from ‚Äòsearching‚Äô to ‚Äòseeing‚Äô a product is a path filled with hassles that often leads to no-purchase at all. AI-enabled visual search eases the way consumers see a product. AI in eCommerce has improved the visual search capabilities and helps in finding products that match close to your search.¬†AI ChatbotsAnother popular example of AI in eCommerce is Chatbot. These are systems that interact either through text or voice interface. With AI chatbots in eCommerce, consumers can speak to a device rather than typing on a keyboard. Some of the best examples of AI chatbots are Facebook Messenger and Slack. They can adapt to any language and respond depending on the region.¬†AI chatbots can benefit eCommerce businesses especially those who receive international requests in a multitude of languages. The chatbots understand the dialect and languages including past behavior of a user and customer chat statistics to provide the best possible solution. Popular eCommerce websites such as Amazon and eBay have implemented AI chatbot applications to deliver convenient order placing and customer service experience to the users.Superior User ExperienceWith AI in eCommerce, certain advanced systems are being used by companies such as facial recognition, recommendation engine, and voice interfaces. These systems help in understanding customer behavior when buying a particular product or service. The AI-enabled programs assist eCommerce in creating a better user experience for different circumstances. If you‚Äôre not already using these AI eCommerce systems, you should begin experimenting with a few and watch the results.¬†eCommerce Catalog ManagementNowadays retailers need to create a convenient and user-friendly process of online shopping to satisfy the needs of shoppers. So, it‚Äôs important for online retailers to have good catalog management for a better user experience. An online eCommerce catalog provides product names, descriptions, prices, supplier details, and other related information. Within those thousands of product categories, small details like color, texture, pattern, style, sleeve, length, bottom type, and fit need to be accurately mentioned in the catalog to help customers get the right product information.The use of AI in eCommerce catalogs can now help in obtaining accurate and consistent data for getting deeper catalog insights. Similarly, automated product tagging by AI improves business operation efficiency and gives retailers the ability to track or tag manually. Automated product tagging tailored by AI increases business operation efficiency and ensures a better shopping experience. For example, a catalog can have 10,000 products in different colors, shapes, sizes, and they all need to be tagged correctly. AI-enabled automatic tagging organizes and tags the product catalog based on their characteristics. This is the reason why a lot of eCommerce companies have adopted this technology, making it an essential part of their online selling strategy.¬†Automated Pricing ManagementApart from managing catalogs, inventory, and taking care of customer purchase preferences, as an online retailer, you must also know the best price for your products. Thanks to AI, eCommerce companies are able to provide them with the smallest detail possible that helps them to improve their business operations. In a nutshell, with AI in eCommerce pricing, you have analytics software for price analysis that uses a certain statistical model, machine learning, and a number of other AI models to create algorithms that automatically identify pricing patterns from the data and predict prices based on that information.¬†Automated AI pricing solutions in eCommerce can help reduce the manual work regarding tracking the prices of your competition. This way, businesses have the ability to determine product prices based on data from both internal and external sources.¬†TakeawaysIn this post, we‚Äôve looked at how businesses can use artificial intelligence in eCommerce to increase overall profit margins.Today, the use of artificial intelligence in eCommerce is booming and more and more businesses are adapting to this trend.

What's more? Well, recently drones again hit the headlines, owing to their new ability to help people, hikers lost in woods. In their paper published in the journal¬†Nature Machine Intelligence, researchers, David Schedl, Indrajit Kurmi and Oliver Bimber, from Johannes Kepler University,¬†share how artificial intelligence to improve thermal imaging camera searches for people lost in woods..When hikers, trekkers or commoners are lost in woods, rescue team rely on binoculars, and thermal imagers installed on camera and in chopper sensors, to find the missing. Generally, the thermal imaging devices highlight differences in body temperature of people on the ground versus their surroundings, making them easier to spot.¬† However, the problem with these forms of devices is that they fail to work efficiently due to dense vegetation covering the soil and preventing wide or long-range view searches. Additionally, in the case of thermal imaging, heat signage from external factors like the sun, ambient heat from trees, fauna and other humans' body heat also interfere with the search process. Further, these existing tools used in such search and rescue operations¬†are not sufficient nor speed up the mission..The trio team of researchers hence focused on surmounting these problems by using a deep learning application to improve the images that are made. They engineered drones which can be particularly adept at recognizing humans from everything that surrounds them. They aimed to show how automated person detection under occlusion conditions can be notably improved by combining multi-perspective images before classification..They employed image integration by airborne optical sectioning (AOS). AOS is a synthetic aperture imaging technique that uses camera drones to capture unstructured thermal light fields. In simpler terms, they used AI application to process multiple images of a specific area.¬†This is interesting because comparing and processing of data from different cameras allow several thermal imagers to work as one large telescope..After processing the artificial intelligence ‚Äã‚Äãimages, the final terrain images produced have a higher depth of field, i.e. the footage shows how the tops of the trees appear blurry, while the outlines of people on the ground were more recognizable..For training the artificial intelligence system, the researchers had to create their own image database. They used drones to photograph volunteers on the ground in a variety of positions. The system test results showed that the accuracy of this solution ranged from 87%-95% when compared to 25% of traditional thermal imaging images.¬†Also, using AOS helped researchers achieve a precision and recall of 96% and 93%, respectively..&quot;In the future, rescuing lost, ill or injured persons will increasingly be carried out by autonomous drones. However, discovering humans in densely forested terrain is challenging because of occlusion, and robust detection mechanisms are required. We show that automated person detection under occlusion conditions can be notably improved by combining multi-perspective images before classification,&quot; say the researchers. They also revealed that their system is ready for use by search and rescue crews and could also be used by¬†law enforcement, the military, or wildlife management teams. Moreover, these findings can lay the foundation for effective future search-and-rescue technologies that can be applied in combination with autonomous or human-crewed aircraft..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Building the better battery may be too big a job for humans alone, according to researchers at the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, so the researchers are enlisting the help of artificial intelligence and robots.


In 2016, JCESR Director George Crabtree announced the group had settled on an organic flow battery to provide energy storage on the grid longer and cheaper than lithium-ion can. Such a battery would rely on a combination of molecules made from earth-abundant, low-cost elements like carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

The question is, which combination?

‚ÄúThere are thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of candidates out there,‚Äù Crabtree said this month during Stanford University‚Äôs StorageX Symposium. ‚ÄúWe just haven't found the right one yet.‚Äù

PROMOTED
That search could take years if researchers did it the traditional way. During most of human history, researchers employed direct design, Crabtree said, by thinking of candidate molecules, making them, putting them in a battery and seeing if it works.
‚ÄúThat was dramatically changed when we started to do computational screening.‚Äù
Using computational screening, researchers could simulate hundreds or thousands of molecules on a computer much faster than synthesizing and testing them in a laboratory.

But JCESR researchers need the process to be quicker still, so they have turned to what Crabtree calls a self-driving laboratory, using artificial intelligence to find molecular structures that might satisfy the multitude of performance requirements needed for a battery, things like solubility, stability, voltage crossover, or multi-electron transfer.

‚ÄúThis is a new feature,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo with AI, instead of simulating hundreds or thousands of molecules you go immediately to the most promising five or ten and consider only those.‚Äù
That‚Äôs when the robots take over.

‚ÄúYou could then have automatic synthesis. So the laboratory, using a robot, would make the material‚Äîautomatic characterization, run it through lots of machines, send that information back to the artificial-intelligence brain here to score the material. Did it actually work? If it failed I wonder why it failed; let's try something else. So it actively learns from every cycle of this synthesis route. And this is what's coming to the fore.‚Äù
JCESR is in the ninth year of what was originally a five-year project to develop much better batteries for grid storage and transportation.
‚ÄúIf you want to have a completely carbon-free grid, you're going to have to have somewhere between 500 and 1,000 hours of continuous storage discharge,‚Äù Crabtree said, ‚Äúand this, of course, is well beyond what lithium-ion can do.‚Äù
The organic redox-flow candidate for grid storage would contain liquids infused with organic molecules that carry a charge. The organic molecules should be inexpensive, recyclable, and harmless to the environment.
""The big advantage of this so-called flow battery is that it's scalable, so if I make that tank of active ions 10 times larger I can store 10 times the energy density,"" Crabtree said at an earlier talk. ""You can't do that with a lithium-ion battery.""

IN THE run up to the match, Lee Sedol was feeling confident. He was about to play an artificial intelligence that had been trained to play the board game Go. But as one of the world‚Äôs best players of the game himself, Lee thought he would easily win. ‚ÄúI thought AlphaGo was based on probability calculation and it was merely a machine,‚Äù he said at the time. Even after he lost the first game of the match, Lee believed it was just because AlphaGo had made no mistakes. Then, in the now infamous move 37 of the second game, the AI seemed to be rewriting the rules of Go and played a move no human would have dreamed of. Lee, who ultimately lost the match 4-1, was dumbstruck: ‚ÄúThis move was really creative and beautiful,‚Äù he said.
This contest marked a pivotal moment in the development of AI, and Demis Hassabis was one of the main people responsible for it. In 2010, he co-founded the research company DeepMind and began working on AIs that could play games better than people. At the time, Go was considered too hard for artificial intelligence to master. It has more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe. Yet the win over Lee in 2016 catapulted DeepMind ‚Äì and Hassabis ‚Äì to worldwide fame. AlphaGo‚Äôs victory was the biggest moment in AI since IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
Since then, Hassabis‚Äôs firm, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, has been honing its algorithms and looking beyond games. In November, its new AI, AlphaFold, ‚Ä¶

How Is Artificial Intelligence Shaping Patient Engagement Tools?


Artificial intelligence is finding its place with patient engagement tools, helping to personalize an efficient patient experience.

Published: 31 Dec 2020


 
Although patient engagement principles are rooted in timeless concepts like good interpersonal skills and patient motivation, the technologies used to push engagement are indeed at the cutting edge. Most recently, healthcare organizations have tapped patient engagement tools that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to drive a personalized and convenient healthcare experience.







As the medical industry continues to embrace the patient as a healthcare consumer, providers and technology developers alike have sought to create a personalized healthcare experience. AI has proven to fill that gap, helping to make sense of patient data and needs and generate action items that can ideally activate the patient.
And patients are primed for this new type of technology, research has shown. In 2018, Accenture‚Äôs Consumer Survey on Digital Health showed that patients are welcoming of AI technology in healthcare. And again in 2019, patients expressed a strong interest in AI for helping to manage their own health and drive convenient care.
Healthcare organizations are beginning to respond to that need, implementing tools that leverage AI, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to aid in not just clinical operations, but in patient engagement efforts, as well.

Using chatbots for automated communication
Chatbots have begun to emerge as essential tools for providing convenient access to care. As in other service sectors, healthcare consumers want medicine that is easy to access, seamless, and frictionless. They want it to be easy to book an appointment, simple to get to their provider offices, and intuitive to engage in and manage their own care.
Except healthcare has proven anything but simple.
Medical providers have begun to adopt AI chatbots to begin to streamline the patient experience. Healthcare organizations want to create the same experience consumers have in other service sectors, even if that feels next to impossible.
‚ÄúI've often said, we need that Disney-like experience,‚Äù Kevin Pawl, MS, FACMPE, senior director of Patient Access at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, said in a previous interview.
Patients want to access their medical care quickly and easily, have all of the relevant information for getting to the hospital, and have a good interaction with their providers all in one.
‚ÄúYou're not calling a hospital with the joy of going on vacation or going on a trip or staying in a hotel,‚Äù Pawl acknowledged. ‚ÄúBut it would be awful nice if the service and the experience were similar. That's what we were trying to achieve as we tap into artificial intelligence.‚Äù
AI chatbots work on the frontlines of the patient experience. For Pawl, and many other organizations, chatbots help filter out patient phone calls and refer patients to relevant resources. A patient might call the hospital looking for parking information, and instead of being placed on hold for several minutes to an hour, they will get the answer right from a chatbot.
More recently, healthcare organizations and technology developers have put AI chatbots to work to sift through patients‚Äô clinical needs. The chatbot might field some patient symptoms and produce recommendations for care.
Other organizations, like Intermountain Healthcare, utilized AI in a similar fashion as a COVID-19 symptom checker.
Simply installing a chatbot isn‚Äôt a patient experience cure-all, however. Patients may get fed-up with the technology, which could actually have a negative impact on satisfaction, most experts agree.
In 2020, as more organizations began deploying the tools as part of their COVID-19 hotlines, evidence emerged that chatbots that seemed human-like, competent, and referred patients to resources that actually answered their questions were rated more highly.
Organizations should thus be judicious about which AI chatbots they implement. Additionally, they should test which functions are well-served by a chatbot and which require human interaction. This may vary based on typical call center requests, community needs, and patient demographics.


Tapping risk assessments for patient outreach
Similar to the artificial intelligence used as part of symptom checkers, the tools can also work for improving patient outreach. Healthcare organizations conduct patient outreach based on health data and key risk factors. Patients who fit certain risk factors may warrant outreach about chronic disease management plans or referrals to social determinants of health services.
But again, sifting through that patient data can prove a daunting task, leaving room for AI. Some organizations are deploying the technology to first risk stratify patients and then push out automated patient outreach messages either via text message, email, telephone, or a combination of the three.
CommonSpirit Health, for example, recently adopted AI to identify high-risk patients, predict their healthcare needs, and push out targeted text message outreach. The tool from Docent Health will help address medical needs outside the four walls of the hospital, according to CommonSpirit‚Äôs System Vice President of Population Health and Innovation Policy Alisahah Cole, MD.
‚ÄúIt initially started out as a pilot in one of our markets that had a pretty significant amount of patients with Medicaid as well as Medicare, and was really looking at how we help patients navigate through different clinical episodes of care,‚Äù Cole previously told¬†PatientEngagementHIT.
‚ÄúIf someone was coming in for a right knee replacement or somebody was pregnant and having a baby those are considered episodes of care. So how do we help patients navigate through not just our own healthcare system, but also through all of the resources that they may need in order to have a successful clinical outcome?‚Äù
In Illinois, similar AI technology helped Medical Home Network, a managed care organization, identify members who were high-risk for COVID-19 infection and refer them to testing sources.
For both organizations, understanding the right risk factors, medium for patient outreach, and messaging proved crucial. According to Cole, text message outreach was preferable because most Americans own a cell phone, although not everyone has a phone that lets them download apps.
Additionally, offering patient outreach in multiple languages and incorporating considerations for social determinants of health also made patient messaging more actionable for both organizations.


Utilizing NLP for patient health literacy, patient portal use
As more patients gain access to their patient portals and clinical notes‚Äîsomething mandated by the 21st Century Cures Act and going into effect come April‚Äîmedical providers have expressed concern about patients understanding that data.
Those concerns are not entirely unfounded. Patient health literacy is generally low, so it might be hard for a patient to see her clinical notes and know exactly what they mean. Natural language processing, a form of artificial intelligence, may be able to fill in that gap.
In 2017, researchers wrote in the Journal of Medical Internet Research indicated that NLP could sift through the medical language in a clinical note or patient portal and give a patient a layperson translation.
In a follow-up 2018 report, researchers found that NLP programs need to offer a good display for patients and improve the way they define medical terms that vary depending on the context. Additionally, NLP systems need to account for clinicians who use abbreviations, misspell words, or have illegible handwriting.
As medicine becomes more digitized‚Äîand as it answers calls for more personalization‚ÄîAI and related technologies will become more important. This technology allows providers to not just understand more about a patient‚Äôs health, but to target interventions and outreach to drive patient engagement.

These machines can learn through experience and perform tasks similar to humans..Like other emerging innovations in the past, AI has the ability to make employees more efficient, improve economic growth, and make life easier for millions of people. Governments at all levels must debate policies that help maximize the advantages of AI and reduce their risks..AI would reshape government in two ways, according to the Centre for Public Impact. First, the speed, reliability, and consistency of government results will be improved. Secondly, it will allow us to reconsider the structure of the government itself. As the world shifts rapidly around it, the government now needs to think about these challenges or it risks losing out on the major benefits that this technology provides..Artificial intelligence is now helping to run the government with intelligent apps doing everything we can't easily do on our own, from eliminating backlogs and reducing costs to managing duties, such as predicting fraudulent transactions and recognizing criminal suspects through facial recognition. Even so, while we anticipate AI-based technology to radically change in the years ahead, the nature of many occupations is already evolving and the aspects of government operations are revolutionizing..Risks and challenges often emerge with advantages. Some important challenges for AI are bias, protection, transparency, awareness of employees, and federal budgets and procurement. However, unemployment is the most frightening aspect of artificial intelligence when we ignore the hypothetical AI takeover scenario. As public service providers, governments should be worried about the effect of AI on human employment in government. Governments need to ensure that workers concentrate on higher value-added tasks, or migrate into the private sector to mitigate the effect of possible unemployment due to automation..Indeed, the introduction of AI in company and government entails risks and challenges. But, much like the two opposite faces of a coin, there are many possibilities for AI as well. It could facilitate more informed and customized products &amp; services, internal process efficiencies, improved cybersecurity, and reduced risks due to AI-related opportunities..The government's use of artificial and augmented intelligence (AI) grows as the use of these technologies and techniques continues to evolve. Building better governance requires difficult change management and consideration of people's desires and concerns for a brighter future..It is most important to note that AI has the power to influence almost any area of government. If the private and public sectors could work together and both contribute to an ethical AI regulatory framework, we have a chance to prevent mistakes of the past and to create a better future..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

And although a few years ago this might seem like an aphorism taken from one of Asimov's works, it is a reality that has ended up reaching us as humans and that no longer belongs to the field of science fiction and speculation..Within the world of video games, we could summarize and define artificial intelligence as the techniques used by developers to design the behavior of famous NPCs (Non Playable Characters). However, this is a definition that has become increasingly concise in the face of a technology that has been growing along with the video game industry itself, and that now not only focuses on determining the behavior of adversaries, but which is capable of designing increasingly demanding maps, levels and challenges for players. In some online casino list, they offer some games equipped with AI technology..The first steps.The origin of Artificial Intelligence in video games occurs before the industry itself became an essential part of popular culture worldwide. One of the best known precedents for the use of this technology in a game dates back to the 1950s, with computer chess titles that were developed based on the MiniMax algorithm. This software had the ability to analyze the position of the pieces on the board to choose the best possible move. Starting in the seventies, with video games revolutionizing the market and the entertainment experiences of users, Artificial Intelligence began to play a key role in the conception and development of the titles of major brands..In 1972 Pong, your opponent was already able to move based on the movement of the ball you hit to return the impact, while Space Invaders gave clear signs of how the enemies evolved and were increasingly intelligent, challenging the players who they spent hours in the arcade trying to pass each of the levels..For its part, in the eighties Pac-Man took another step, since it was the first video game that featured a route search system for enemies, who were able to more easily decipher the path that the player took under certain circumstances. In the same years, Donkey Kong boasted how much Artificial Intelligence had advanced, with a level of difficulty that pushed gamers of the time to the limit of their abilities. However, Artificial Intelligence was still precarious enough to realize that the machine was not capable of learning from its mistakes, nor of adapting to the behavior of the player, so the latter had to decipher certain patterns in order to get ahead of the most demanding challenges..A big jump.A big jump Artificial Intelligence in video games continued to evolve alongside products that increasingly had a more avid consumer base, and therefore, more demanding. It was thus that new possibilities began to be explored and in 1987 the Golden Ax video game innovated by allowing enemies to run after the player with the intention of attacking him from behind, something surprising if we take into account that at the time the adversaries did not stand out for their mobility..Little by little, the big developers began to explore more complex terrain, and by 2011, the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence generated simple but unique missions by randomly configuring places, enemies and objectives in the ARPG, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, thus taking a huge workload off the title designers..Designing video games, the future of AI The role of Artificial Intelligence in the world of video games is increasingly decisive, and has gone from providing a higher level of realism to them, to designing them completely from scratch..What is the most challenging Artificial Intelligence you have faced in all these years of evolution in video games?.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
