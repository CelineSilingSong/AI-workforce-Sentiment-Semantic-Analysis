Just as manufacturing has seen huge benefits from Lean, automation and advanced IT, Artificial Intelligence promises to be the next breakthrough in productivity improvement.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance and extend the capabilities of humans, and help businesses achieve more, faster and more efficiently.
Though by no means a new concept, several more recent developments have enabled AI to cross into the mainstream: namely, cloud computing, big data, and improved machine learning algorithms.
AI-driven analytics and real-time insights have already begun to help businesses grow their revenues and market shares faster than their peers in industries as diverse as healthcare, finance, utilities and ecommerce.
The Manufacturer’s Annual Manufacturing Report 2018 found that 92% of senior manufacturing executives believe that ‘Smart Factory’ digital technologies – including Artificial Intelligence – will enable them to increase their productivity levels and empower staff to work smarter.
A positive outlook for the future, perhaps, but uncertainty still exists. A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group found that a significant gap lies between an organisation’s ‘ambition and execution’, with only one in five companies incorporating AI into one or more of their processes.
Similarly, global research firm, Forrester says that 58% of business and technology professionals are researching AI systems, yet only 12% are actively using them.
So, to learn more about the opportunities Artificial Intelligence holds for manufacturing organisations, The Manufacturer spoke with Jamie Hall, senior solutions specialist for Microsoft.
How much and how fast will AI transform the manufacturing industry?
Jamie Hall: Manufacturers around the world are rapidly investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) to create new products and services, while driving down production costs over the longer term.
This transformation is changing the way companies think about how they engage their customers, empower their employees and optimise their operations.
However, delivering IoT is only part of the journey to achieving manufacturing excellence. For companies to realise the full potential of IoT, they need to combine the data collected from connected devices with rapidly advancing Artificial Intelligence to enable ‘smart machines’.
These will, in turn, simulate intelligent behaviour with little or no human intervention.
Predominantly, the AI in smart machines currently manages the more traditional repetitive tasks; however, this is advancing very quickly. The ability of AI to adapt to continuously changing tasks will move quickly into the mainstream, I expect.
This will be a paradigm shift from assisted intelligence swinging all the way across to full autonomous intelligence where machines are able to learn enough to make recommendations that humans can trust.
Besides smart machines on the shop floor, the use of AI and big data will be huge over the coming five years with dependable algorithms being used in all areas of an operation from weather prediction for the shipping of raw materials through to predictive maintenance of the resulting product.
How do you think that disruption will affect business operations and strategy?
Applying AI to manufacturing requires some key foundational technologies to be in place. A smart factory will need to be networked, taking data from production lines, design & engineering teams, and quality control to form an integrated, intelligent operation.
If manufacturers don’t have the right smart machines and the right data collection points, it’s just data with little or no insight, and insight is what creates world class optimised operations.
Industrial companies will need to become digital companies to survive as the asset and customer become increasingly more centric to their operations.
The days of a linear journey form sourcing product through to the on-going support have gone. Creating a 360-degree view of the customer and being able to bring the product to the centre of the operations and understanding intimately how a product is used brings huge benefits from new product development through to improved go to market models.
Each of these will, of course, add data collection points for AI, machine learning and cognitive services to advance the operation and ultimately the customer experience.
What are the key benefits AI offers to a manufacturing organisation?
With the right foundations in place manufacturers will see AI make many more informed decisions at each stage in the production process in real time.
In the case of production, we will see sensors spotting defects on the production line. The data is then fed to the cloud to verify, which will immediately remove the defective part
from the line and order a replacement all while calculating in real-time just-in-time schedules.
With real-time problem-solving, manufacturers can potentially save millions of pounds in recalls, repairs and lost business.
As use cases continue to evolve, AI will be pivotal in all areas of an organisation from fraud prevention to predictive ordering and opportunity assessment; all of which bring time, productivity and cost benefits which can be passed onto the customer.
Each one of these intelligent insights will turn information into tangible outcomes.
What are the future AI trends and/or developments manufacturers should be aware of?
As AI becomes more mainstream within organisations, a trust and dependability will surface which brings a level of intelligence that becomes mission critical to organisations.
As businesses build their own technology foundations through the use of technology, the advancement to de-centralised AI – where AI solutions can speak at every level of the supply chain from customers through to vendors, data sharing and decision-making will be performed immediately where it would have taken teams of people days and weeks to replicate.
As more emerging technologies come to the fore including Blockchain, Augmented Reality and AI, the inevitable convergence of these trends will happen quickly, and manufacturers should look to embrace and invest now.
Disrupters stand to gain the most from these new and exciting technologies.
Key takeaway for leaders in manufacturing to think about:
With data being the core ingredient for AI, big data and machine learning, more considered thought needs to be made on who owns the data, whether it is collected from IoT-enabled devices or not.
This is often overlooked, yet the outcomes can only occur with lots of it and therefore holds the biggest value for all manufacturers. The decision we make now will have a profound impact on the future.

MIT and SenseTime today announced that SenseTime, a leading artificial intelligence (AI) company, is joining MIT's efforts to define the next frontier of human and machine intelligence.
SenseTime was founded by MIT alumnus Xiao’ou Tang PhD ’96 and specializes in computer vision and deep learning technologies. The MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence aims to open up new avenues of discovery across MIT in areas such as computer vision, human-intelligence-inspired algorithms, medical imaging, and robotics; drive technological breakthroughs in AI that have the potential to confront some of the world’s greatest challenges; and empower MIT faculty and students to pursue interdisciplinary projects at the vanguard of intelligence research. 
SenseTime is the first company to join a new Institute-wide initiative, the MIT Intelligence Quest, since its launch earlier this month. The MIT Intelligence Quest seeks to leverage the Institute’s strengths in brain and cognitive science and computer science to advance research into human and machine intelligence in service to all humanity. It will apply the fruits of its discoveries to diverse fields — from materials design to finance to early disease diagnosis — while considering deeply the economic, cultural, and ethical implications of AI. 
An essential element of the new initiative is forging connections with innovative companies and individuals who share MIT’s passion for work in intelligence. 
""As an MIT alumnus, I’m grateful to have this opportunity to collaborate with my alma mater, especially on something that is dear to my heart — to advance research on artificial intelligence,” says Tang, who is also a professor of information engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “SenseTime is committed to innovating in the fields of computer vision and deep learning. With the creation of the MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence, I’m confident that we will bring together the world’s best and brightest talent to further advance the state of the art for AI to the benefit of society.”
Li Xu, CEO and co-founder of SenseTime, adds, “MIT has long been at the forefront of research into artificial intelligence. As the largest provider of AI algorithms in China, SenseTime has worked with more than 400 leading customers and partners to solve hard, real-world problems. We are very excited to join hands with MIT to lead global AI research into the next frontier.”
The alliance emerges from a longstanding connection between MIT and Tang, who conducted his PhD research in underwater robotics and computer vision at the Institute more than 25 years ago, applying computer vision to the study and classification of underwater imagery. One of his advisors was W. Eric L. Grimson PhD ’80, now the chancellor for academic advancement at MIT and the Bernard M. Gordon Professor of Medical Engineering.
“Xiao’ou has used the same practical approach to computation and artificial intelligence that he displayed at MIT to build a highly successful academic and applied research career and a tremendously successful, technologically impressive startup company in SenseTime,” Grimson says. “He has become well known throughout China and the world as a leader in the field of AI, and especially computer vision and deep learning. Xiao’ou has always kept MIT front of mind, both as a professor and an entrepreneur. He has shared intellectual ideas and is ever on the lookout for impressive young talent whom he encourages to apply to the Institute. I personally am proud of Xiao’ou’s success and the impact he is making on the world, and look forward to a deepened, mutually beneficial relationship between MIT and SenseTime.”
Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, who recently helped to lead the development of the MIT Intelligence Quest, says, “I am thrilled that SenseTime has chosen to join us as we embark on our quest to achieve a deeper understanding of the science and engineering of intelligence and to harness that understanding to create a better world. Dr. Tang is no stranger to innovative research, and the MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence will facilitate boundary-pushing research in intelligence across the Institute and give faculty and students opportunities to unlock new thinking through intense collaboration. This is an exciting moment for both MIT and SenseTime.”
MIT has been on the frontier of intelligence research since the 1950s, when pioneers Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy helped establish the field of artificial intelligence. MIT pushed several major advances in the subsequent decades — from neural networks to data encryption to quantum computing to crowdsourcing — and the Institute now has more than 200 principal investigators whose research bears directly on intelligence. Currently, the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT Media Lab, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, and MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society serve as connected hubs for AI and related research at MIT.
Considered China’s leading AI “unicorn” valued at more than $3 billion, SenseTime has developed a sophisticated proprietary deep learning platform and built applications for multiple industries. The company has applied its core computer vision technologies, including face recognition, video analysis, text recognition, and autonomous driving, across industries such as automobile, finance, mobile Internet, robotics, security, and smartphones.
SenseTime is currently working on developing autonomous driving, intelligent medical treatment, and deep learning hardware optimization. It is also strengthening its technology platform and attracting leading talent from around the world to open up greater applications scenarios and a SenseTime-driven AI commercial ecosystem. The company has offices in Beijing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, Kyoto, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore, and Tokyo.

But despite almost 12,000 kilometres separating the two, tech groups in the United States are beginning to pay attention to the Australian coastal city's explorations in artificial intelligence (AI). ""Our work has caused a bit of interest in those circles,"" says Derel Wust, the managing director of software company 4Tel.For the past two years, 4Tel has been collaborating with a university robotics lab to develop AI in trains. ""This stuff is not years and years away at all,"" Mr Wust says.In fact, he says AI could be used in trains within Australia as early as this year.""The technology certainly has the potential to create autonomous trains, and that will happen in tunnels or closed systems,"" he says. Thousands of passengers in Sydney were left stranded by a two-day disruption earlier this year.(AAP: Glenn Campbell)Automated trains already exist in some metro cities around the world, but Mr Wust says they are either remotely controlled or pre-programmed — AI technology is not currently being used to drive trains.""We see that the most immediate application is to make the driver's work safer and help the driver, not replace the driver,"" he says. ""For the travelling public, the future AI agents will improve the safety of the system because they will not get tired or distracted.""As for running on time … the ability to get on the train and know that it's going to get to the destination when promised is fundamentally what a lot of people are after, and any improvements in the processes to enable that to happen are going to be appreciated by the public.""Going into the future, these types of technologies are going to make the job easier, and they are coming."" Will AI trains be safer? Derel Wust says AI could be used in trains in Australia as early as this year.(ABC RN: Sophie Kesteven )Mr Wust says the technology his company is working on is similar to what's being used in the autonomous car industry. It involves attaching radars and lidars — a detection device used for measuring distances — and various cameras and acoustic sensors to trains. He says the use of AI could ""result in a safer and more efficient industry"".""[The AI will] look around and access what is going on such as operating conditions, speed and weather. Those things will become routinely calculated through an AI agent,"" he says. ""And while we won't be able to stop all accidents by any means — because sometimes things go wrong — we are hopeful that we will be able to intervene a lot quicker, sooner and effectively than what has happened in the past.""Australia has a good safety record, but if I can generalise that to look around the world, a lot of the accidents come about by staff being distracted, obstacles on the track, or something going wrong in the infrastructure … and most of those items are candidates to be detected by artificial intelligence.""Tapping into young minds University of Newcastle students are applying their knowledge of deep learning to improve train safety.(ABC RN: Sophie Kesteven )Students at the University of Newcastle are helping to develop the AI used by Mr Wust's company.Inside the university's Robotics and Brain Architecture Laboratory, students can occasionally be found modifying a small robot, NUgus.Its large, black beady eyes recognises faces, and it can also detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and signals in everyday environments. This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.The students draw on the skills they learn from programming such robots to help develop innovative software for train safety.Once a week, they step off campus to apply their various skillsets at 4Tel. There, they work alongside engineering and technical staff to apply deep learning to problems that occur in train safety. ""One of the PhD students has developed some new software engineering and computer vision approaches. He has applied it in various aspects of robotics, and now as an industrial application with 4Tel,"" says Associate Professor Stephan Chalup, who leads the robotics lab.""A lot of it is about visual recognition of signs and tracks and objects on the track, and behaviour of humans that pass the track. ""Another topic is localisation where the trains are on the track, and there's a lot of visual pattern recognition.""'AI is our friend, not our foe'He thinks Australia could be a world leader on AI in trains.""I think there's a great opportunity right now for Australia to become leaders in AI on trains using deep learning because nobody else is doing it, and we already have a great collaboration here,"" he says.Mr Wust agrees, and says it's now up to the industry to take up the new technology.The driverless car revolutionSoon, you'll be able to do all the things you'd rather be doing while driving. Read more""The rail industry is universally similar. It has lights, signals, tracks, points and all the same sort of infrastructure, and yet AI is going to impact it everywhere in the world,"" he says.""And if Australia can create technology that's competitive in that market, now's the time to do it, because over time that window will close.""Mr Wust says there's an opportunity for AI to be used in many other modes of transport in Australia, such as trams, trucks, and buses. It's part of the reason why he's been invited to present a paper on his work at an AI and deep learning conference in California next month.  He says we are going to be advantaged as a society by having computers assisting us more intensely, rather than relying on the techniques of the past.""I'm a firm believer that AI is our friend, and it's not our foe,"" he says. ""One of my observations in this is that in Australia … there is a bit of a disconnect between expertise and industry, and our collaboration with the University of Newcastle shows what can be achieved when you have a common domain interest and mutually supporting arrangements.""Posted 26 Feb 201826 Feb 2018Mon 26 Feb 2018 at 4:00pm, updated 26 Feb 201826 Feb 2018Mon 26 Feb 2018 at 6:46pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesMore delays could be ahead for Sydney's 'tangled' train network10 predictions about the AI revolutionAI set to affect every Australian worker within 15 years: reportMore on:NewcastleRoboticsSydneyTransport IndustryUniversitiesTop StoriesThe red flags at the centre of AFP's suspicions about the couple charged with spying for RussiaPicasso estate responds to MONA's faked artworksAnalysisVice-President Trump and President Putin of Ukraine — Joe Biden's gaffes keep coming, but he says he's not budgingSeven stand-out moments from Joe Biden's high-pressure press conferenceCFMEU boss John Setka steps down 'Time is running out': Collingwood's premiership defence on thin ice after loss to Geelong in crucial clashBritish man sentenced to life in prison for attempted kidnap and murder of UK presenter Holly WilloughbyWhy Shelley Duvall disappeared from HollywoodBenji apologises to fans after the Tigers are smashed 58-6 by CronullaVenice's debated tourist fee expected to increase 'in coming years', says tourism councillorAussie killed in Ukraine among many 'lulled' to fight war without military trainingRussian-Australian woman charged with spying offences was well-travelled, made lifestyle videosPhilippines police open special investigation into suspected murder of Australian couple as hunt for suspect continuesDubbed the 'Star Wars Project', South Korea plans to use drone-melting lasers against North Korea'All they took was two pies', says Gippsland bakery owner after armed robbers tie up staff in early morning raidPopular NowDon't miss news that matters to you.

Ken Mulvany left his CEO post at Proximagen to found artificial intelligence firm BenevolentAI (originally known as Stratified Medical) in 2013. Now, having successfully grown the business into a bioinformatics unicorn, he has gone back and bought up part of his former employer.BenevolentAI bought Proximagen’s U.K. operations—a drug discovery and development facility on the Babraham Research Campus in Cambridge—for an undisclosed sum. It allows BenevolentAI to cover the entire drug R&D process, the first time an AI company is able to do so, said the company.“The acquisition has expanded our scale and capability overnight and created something that previously did not exist—an AI company truly integrated across every stage of the drug development process,” said Mulvany in a statement.One of the largest AI enterprises in the world, BenevolentAI has built an AI-powered platform that mines scientific data to draw meaningful insights for drug discovery, either for designing new drugs or potentially repurposing drugs for other diseases. But prior to this acquisition, the company could only deal with discovery in-house and had to rely on CROs to clinically develop drug programs.Mulvany and several colleagues are no strangers to Proximagen; after all, it was he who sold Proximagen to Upsher-Smith Laboratories for $553 million in 2012.Home to a team of 44 scientists, the Cambridge site has expertise across areas including assay development and screening; medicinal and synthetic chemistry; drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics; in vivo pharmacology; as well as preclinical and clinical development.Adding those capabilities to its portfolio means the company can generate biological hypotheses at scale, significantly reduce hypotheses validation time and diversify its range of projects and therapeutic areas, a company spokesperson told FierceBiotech.RELATED: BenevolentAI poaches drug discovery executive from GlaxoSmithKline The U.K. site’s current research activity centers around a wide breadth of areas including pain, cognition and inflammation. The two companies' shared interest in those therapeutic areas could also mean a smooth team integration process.Since spinning its bioscience-focused capabilities into BenevolentBio, the company has expanded its pipeline to include 19 programs, and it expects the amount and diversity of research programs to grow significantly with the Proximagen deal.In November 2016, it in-licensed several clinical small-molecule compounds from Janssen to further develop their potentials in hard-to-treat diseases. The company pushed one of the candidates licensed, bavisant, in a phase 2b in Parkinson’s patients with excessive daytime sleepiness.Working with the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, it made a breakthrough in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2017, having validated that a drug candidate discovered by its AI platform could work.

Paul Allen is pouring more money into artificial intelligence research.
The Microsoft co-founder on Wednesday announced Project Alexandria, a new initiative that aims to help develop “common sense AI.” Allen is committing $125 million over the next three years to the project, housed at the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). The money will go toward Project Alexandria, as well as other work being done at AI2.
AI research has seen exponential advancements over the past decade, but machines are still incapable of certain types of problem solving or dealing with unpredictable situations.
“When I founded AI2, I wanted to expand the capabilities of artificial intelligence through high-impact research,” Allen said in a statement. “Early in AI research, there was a great deal of focus on common sense, but that work stalled. AI still lacks what most 10-year-olds possess: ordinary common sense. We want to jump start that research to achieve major breakthroughs in the field.”

Allen added that “this is an extremely complicated challenge.”
“If we want AI to approach human abilities and have the broadest possible impact in research, medicine and business, we need to fundamentally advance AI’s common sense abilities,” he said in a statement.

Project Alexandria, named after the ancient library in Alexandria, Egypt, will pull from AI2’s existing projects in machine learning and reasoning; natural language and understanding; and computer vision.
“Despite the recent AI successes, common sense — which is trivially easy for people — is remarkably difficult for AI,” Oren Etzioni, CEO of AI2, said in a statement. “No AI system currently deployed can reliably answer a broad range of simple questions such as: ‘If I put my socks in a drawer, will they still be in there tomorrow?’ or ‘How can you tell if a milk carton is full?’ For example, when AlphaGo beat the number one Go player in the world in 2016, the program did not know that Go is a board game.”
The New York Times reported that Allen’s new investment will double AI2’s budget over the next three years.
Founded in 2014 by Allen and Etzioni, a longtime computer science researcher and entrepreneur, AI2 is now the largest nonprofit AI research center in North America and has gained credibility around the globe for its performance in AI contests, research papers, ability to attract top AI talent, and two spinout companies, Kitt.ai and Xnor.ai.

The beehive of activities for the sixth edition of Social Media Week Lagos kicked off on Monday, February 26 with various interactive sessions, speeches, workshops, master classes, presentations and networking.
One of the interactive sessions was a conversation with the Chairman and CEO of Channels Media group, John Momoh (OON), where social media enthusiast had the opportunity to ask questions bordering on use of social media in Nigeria media.
The veteran broadcaster and media entrepreneur during the session which was titled Future of Media: A Conversation with John Momoh went down memorable lane digging out lessons learnt on his career journey.
Explaining how he started out as a presenter in 1977, he revealed how he worked as a radio presenter for five years, to later work in Television Station. As a young broadcaster, John Momoh was not only hard working; he was restless and curious making him garner a wealth of experience in different departments.

“After five years, I crossed to Television. I joined National Television Authority of Africa (NTA). I was reporting, directing, editing and even worked in engineering,” he said.
The interactive session with the media mogul was not only about learning from his life experience. Mr Momoh also seized the opportunity to talk to the attendants on digital disruption and leveraging on artificial intelligence.
“The biggest disruption to media landscape is that now, you have to go after the consumers. To ensure they get what they want. We have to cast our contents on all mobile devices. Because the world is changing, you cannot do things same way,” he said.

On how to avoid the spread of fake news, Mr Momoh said the responsibility is on the great number of people who mean well for Nigeria media space, adding that consumers should lookout for trustworthy media outlet.
“Fake news is not news. The onus is on the great number of people who mean well. Lookout for brands you can trust. Networks built on trust.”
Artificial intelligence according to Mr Momoh needs to be maximised to  improve broadcasting and journalism and not necessarily render people jobless. He said there is the need to breed young and creative Nigerian broadcasters coupled with the use of artificial intelligence to increase quality.
“Artificial intelligence is to improve our work and not to add to the problem of unemployment,” he said.

photo by Bryce VickmarkArtificial intelligence is increasingly affecting our lives in ways most of us haven’t even thought about. Even if we don’t have emotional androids plotting revenge on humankind (yet), we’re surrounded more and more by computers trained to look us over and make life-changing decisions about us. Some of the brightest minds in technology—including a hive of them clustered around Boston—are tinkering with machines designed to decide what kinds of ads we see, whether we get flagged by the police, whether we get a job, or even how long we spend behind bars.But they have a very big problem: Many of these systems don’t work properly, or at all, for people with dark skin.AdChoicesADVERTISINGIn a newly published report, MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini says she’s found that face-analyzing AI works significantly better for white faces than black ones. She and co-author Timnit Gebru tested software from Microsoft, IBM, and the Chinese company Megvii to see how well each of their face-scanning systems did at figuring out whether a person in a picture was a man or a woman—a task all three are supposed to be able to perform. If the person in the photo was a white man, her study found, the systems guessed correctly more than 99 percent of the time. For black women, though, the systems messed up between 20 and 34 percent of the time—which, if you consider that guessing at random would mean being right 50 percent of the time, means they came close to not working at all.How could that be? Buolamwini says the problem lies out of sight, buried deep in the code that runs this technology. Face-analysis programs, she says, are trained and tested using databases of hundreds of pictures, which research has found are overwhelmingly white and male. So a developer might not notice that their software doesn’t work for someone who isn’t white or male. To prove this, Buolamwini decided to test the systems by using a database of her own, which she made using the headshots of hundreds of world leaders, including many from African countries with dark skin. Then she asked the AI systems to identify whether each headshot was of a man or a woman. That’s when the disparity began to show itself: The systems repeatedly misidentified the black faces, even though they had almost no trouble at all recognizing the white ones. Not that it’s exactly a surprise. “Being that I’m a dark-skinned woman,” she tells me, “I’m running into these issues all over the place.”The findings were compiled into a project called Gender Shades and will be presented at the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency at New York University, which kicks off on Friday.We should all be concerned about what she found.“People of color are in fact the global majority. The majority of the world, who I like to call the under-sampled majority, aren’t being represented within the training data or the benchmark data used to validate artificial intelligence systems,” Buolamwini says. “We’re fooling ourselves about how much progress we’ve made.”Imagine if your skin tone could trigger glitches in services like HireVue, which analyzes the facial expressions of job applicants; or in surveillance systems that use AI to identify people in crowds (like the one used on unwitting Boston Calling concertgoers in 2014); or the face-recognition system currently being test-run at Logan Airport; or in the systems used by law enforcement to trawl through Massachusetts drivers’ license photos.Frankly, it’s not clear whether any of these systems should exist at all. How good do we really want robots to be at tracking our every move? But at the very least, if these things are going to be part of our lives, they’d better work. If not, the consequences could be severe.“You’re in a situation where the community most likely to be targeted by law enforcement are least represented [in face-recognition code]. This puts people at higher risk of being misidentified as a criminal suspect,” Buolamwini says. “Because we live in a society that reflects historical biases that are continuing to this day, we have to confront the kind of data we’re generating, the kind of data we’re collecting, how we’re analyzing it. And we need to do it with diverse eyes in the room, diverse experiences, and more gender parity.”Last year, the ACLU identified “algorithmic bias” as an area of particular concern for civil liberties advocates in the future. “This is not remotely the first time that we’ve seen a product developed using machine learning or a risk assessment tool that has different impacts on people, depending on who they are: their race, their class,” says Kade Crockford, director of the ACLU of Massachusetts’ Technology for Liberty program. “Civil rights, civil liberties, and freedom of speech, and privacy tend to be afterthoughts when systems like this are being developed. What we really need to see is an ethical, civil rights and civil liberties approach to building these systems from the ground up.” The group’s local chapter has also pushed for Community Control of Police Surveillance ordinances in Massachusetts cities that would require that any new surveillance tools get public approval before they are implemented.There are other impacts of technology that only works correctly for white people. By now you’ve probably seen the videos and heard the stories about soap dispensers that won’t dispense soap into dark-skinned hands, or artificial intelligence that tries to identify African-American faces and yields some deeply unfortunate results. Examples of this problem also predate AI, Buolamwini says. Photography for most of its history has been optimized for white skin. It wan’t until backlash from manufacturers of chocolate and dark wooden furniture in the 1970s and 1980s that Kodak, which basically ran the photography industry, updated its film, and we’re still making progress on this front in the era of digital cameras and selfies (just ask interracial couples). Movies with properly lit black actors are still a relatively new phenomenon.Buolamwini knows this problem well. She still remembers when, as an undergrad at Georgia Tech, she couldn’t complete her work with a new face-tracking robot because it couldn’t make sense of her face. She was forced to ask her light-skinned roommate, who the robot could see, to step in. It wasn’t the last time this happened, and eventually she made the disheartening discovery that many face-recognizing systems would only work if she wore a featureless white mask. The poetry of that wasn’t lost on her, and she’s turned that mask into a symbol of what she’s dubbed the “coded gaze” baked into AI. The mask was a centerpiece of her popular TED Talk (which has been viewed nearly a million times) and is featured in the logo for a group she founded to call attention to the issue, the Algorithmic Justice League (you can see it next to her in the above photo).Meanwhile, Buolamwini says she’s been encouraged by some of the reactions her study has gotten. IBM, she says, reached out almost immediately after her results were published and invited her to meet with some of its senior researchers. The tech giant tells her that in the newest update of its software, it improved its ability to recognize black women’s faces by a factor of 10. Microsoft has also responded to the Gender Shades research, saying it has “taken steps to improve the accuracy of our facial recognition technology and we’re continuing to invest in research to recognize, understand and remove bias.”There’s a long way to go. So she’s focused on getting us to think twice about what’s going on in the rapidly advancing brains that power artificial intelligence, before it’s too late.“We have blind faith in these systems,” she says. “We risk perpetuating inequality in the guise of machine neutrality if we’re not paying attention.”Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the college Buolamwini attended for her undergraduate degree. It was Georgia Tech, not MIT.

Feb 21, 2018, 11:57 AM ESTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Photo by Mark Brake/Getty ImagesTech billionaire Elon Musk is leaving the board of OpenAI, the nonprofit research group he co-founded with Y Combinator president Sam Altman to study the ethics and safety of artificial intelligence. The move was announced in a short blog post, explaining that Musk is leaving in order to avoid a conflict of interest between OpenAI’s work and the machine learning research done by Telsa to develop autonomous driving. “As Tesla continues to become more focused on AI, this will eliminate a potential future conflict for Elon,” says the post. Musk will stay on as a donator to OpenAI and will continue to advise the group. The blog post also announced a number of new donors, including video game developer Gabe Newell, Skype founder Jaan Tallinn, and the former US and Canadian Olympians Ashton Eaton and Brianne Theisen-Eaton. OpenAI said it was broadening its base of funders in order to ramp up investments in “our people and the compute resources necessary to make consequential breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.” For those concerned about the near-term impact of AI on areas like surveillance and propaganda, this work is crucial. OpenAI was founded just two years ago, but has fast become a significant voice in the global machine learning community. Its research has been wide-ranging, including teaching computers to control robots with minimal instruction (known as “one-shot learning”) and the creation of AI agents to play popular video game Dota (a more daunting challenge than board games like chess). Just this week, the institute contributed to a multi-disciplinary report outlining the ways AI could be used maliciously over the next five years. (A different and much realer set of concerns than the specter of evil superintelligent AI sometimes raised by figures including Musk himself.) But for an organization concerned with keeping advances in artificial intelligence safe, OpenAI certainly has its work cut out.

The move was announced in a short blog post, explaining that Musk is leaving in order to avoid a conflict of interest between OpenAI’s work and the machine learning research done by Telsa to develop autonomous driving. “As Tesla continues to become more focused on AI, this will eliminate a potential future conflict for Elon,” says the post. Musk will stay on as a donator to OpenAI and will continue to advise the group. 

The blog post also announced a number of new donors, including video game developer Gabe Newell, Skype founder Jaan Tallinn, and the former US and Canadian Olympians Ashton Eaton and Brianne Theisen-Eaton. OpenAI said it was broadening its base of funders in order to ramp up investments in “our people and the compute resources necessary to make consequential breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.” For those concerned about the near-term impact of AI on areas like surveillance and propaganda, this work is crucial. 

OpenAI was founded just two years ago, but has fast become a significant voice in the global machine learning community. Its research has been wide-ranging, including teaching computers to control robots with minimal instruction (known as “one-shot learning”) and the creation of AI agents to play popular video game Dota (a more daunting challenge than board games like chess). 

Just this week, the institute contributed to a multi-disciplinary report outlining the ways AI could be used maliciously over the next five years. (A different and much realer set of concerns than the specter of evil superintelligent AI sometimes raised by figures including Musk himself.) But for an organization concerned with keeping advances in artificial intelligence safe, OpenAI certainly has its work cut out.

Why the benefits of AI and robotics outweigh the harm

David Tuffley, Griffith University
We have all heard the dire predictions about robots coming to steal our jobs. Some would even have us believe these silicon bogeymen are coming to kill us. It plays straight into people’s darkest fears about technology.
When futurists talk about things that haven’t happened yet, they are free to parade educated guesses as fact. But before we take their word for it, we might remember the old adage:
… in God we trust, all others bring data.
In a recent article, the MIT Technology Review tabulated the results of “every study we could find on what automation will do to jobs”. The results show that the expected impacts depend on what you measure.
Many predictions, little agreement
Of the 19 reports considered in the review, there was enormous variation. Some predicted that a few million jobs would be replaced, while others spoke portentously of tens or hundreds of millions over similar time frames. Some were decidedly upbeat, others quite gloomy.
One futurist went so far as to forecast that a billion jobs will be lost to automation by 2022. Contrast this with the more sober prediction from the research and advisory group Gartner of 1.8 million jobs lost by 2020, but with 2.3 million created in the same period – a net increase of 500,000 over the next two years.
Why such a big difference? In truth, no one knows how many jobs will be lost and found in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The situation is too complex for simple answers.
Variations in predictions can be likened to the parable of the five blind men encountering an elephant. By touching different parts of the elephant’s body, each came to a different conclusion as to what the beast is.
Technology anxiety is nothing new
Worries about the impact of technology on society have a long history.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the rapid expansion of disruptive technologies during the Industrial Revolution gave rise to the same anxieties as those being expressed today.
Trades were automated to produce greater economies of scale, but job losses were more than offset by the new jobs subsequently created. Meanwhile, trades like pottery, weaving and metalwork that were “lost” to automation 200 years ago are still being done by skilled craftspeople today.
More recently, when personal computers found their way onto people’s desks in the 1980s, the typing pool became redundant. I recall the lamentations then of the newspapers, TV and talkback radio.
But in time, the overall number of jobs went up because of the new jobs created in the fledgling IT industry. Today there are dozens of technology job categories, none of which existed in the typing pool days – jobs in computer hardware, programming, content production, web design, security, big data, sales and marketing, and artificial intelligence to name a few.



And the former typists? Their skills were in more demand than ever, because keyboards are still the way humans communicate with computers.
AI is only an extension of us
AI is often spoken of as a separate entity from people, and sometimes seen as a dangerous adversary. The reality is that it is merely a tool created by humans – it only does what we tell it to do and nothing more.
What we have is “narrow AI”, only suited to very particular tasks. Autonomous “general AI” that is superior to the spectrum of human intelligence is many decades away.
The “narrow AI” GPS on my smartphone is much better at navigating than I am. It extends my ability to go places almost miraculously. But there’s no reason to feel threatened. It is only smarter than me in that one ability. And it is not at all likely to say “I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that” like Hal refusing to open the pod bay doors in film 2001: A Space Odyssey.
2001: A Space Odyssey.
Likewise, AI can greatly improve people’s competence in the workplace. In the first recorded case of an AI saving someone’s life, it was the combination of human doctors and a diagnostic AI that succeeded where the human doctors alone had failed.
The obvious advantages of enhancing human intelligence with AI have given rise to the hybrid known as a modern centaur.
The concept was illustrated by chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, who observed that the best players are not computers alone, but human intelligence augmented with AI.
Benefits out-weigh the harm
Historically, fears about technology have largely proven unfounded, at least in terms of the benefits outweighing the harm, if not in other ways. Our challenge is to maximise the benefits and minimise the harm.
What skills will we need for future employment? These would be the same skills that humans have always excelled at – critical thinking and problem solving, good communication and teamwork, leadership, initiative, creativity. And of course, the willingness to leverage the current technology.
Futurists tend to assume that if a job can be automated, it will be automated. But that is certainly not true.
AI will automate some jobs, particularly the dirty, dull or dangerous ones that people don’t want to do – everything from sewer reconnaissance to repetitive factory work. Manual welding, for example, can produce highly toxic fumes – a prime candidate for automation.
But some jobs will always be done by people and the reasons can vary greatly, from economic, social and nostalgic reasons, to the fact that some jobs are simply not practical for robots to do.
When I go to the doctor, I want a human sitting across from me. I don’t want a holographic doctor who demands to know the nature of my medical emergency.

        Investment in AI research is growing in Canada, but there’s little thought about ethics, privacy and governance issues.

Canada’s research expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to significant recent investment. But far fewer resources have been dedicated to the governance, ethics or social responsibilities of this new technology, leaving many different local initiatives to try to fill the gap.
AI already affects our everyday lives. With each like, swipe and comment on social media, most of us are already contributing data   — to improve AI applications that recommend videos online or help us manage our email. 
Our ability to ask a smartphone a question results from a long history of research into how we can use computers to automate human labour and improve decision making. Better processors, advances in algorithms, as well as big data, often gathered from our online interactions, have driven major advances in deep learning, a branch of AI. 
Advances in these fields have been heralded as a net benefit to all humankind.
But treating AI as inherently good overlooks the important research and development needed for ethical, safe and inclusive applications. Poor data, inexplicable code or rushed deployment can easily lead to AI systems that are not worth celebrating. 
For example, automated systems can be programmed with bias. A ProPublica investigation revealed that the COMPAS program, used to assess criminal risk scores in the United States, was inherently biased against African Americans.
Discoveries like this reveal an important reality: First, the impacts of AI are very real and affect real lives and families. Second, this is taking place right now  — these are not far-fetched scenarios that might happen in the future. 
Assessing the consequences
Despite these risks, interest in AI in Canada — and around the world   — has not slowed.
In Canada, the federal government invested dramatically in artificial intelligence research in the past year. The 2017 budget included $125 million for a pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy that will be administered by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. A Quebec-based proposal for research on AI and supply chains won a share of the $950 million federal “superclusters fund” in February.

But without proper outreach to sectors with expertise in the social, cultural and political consequences of new technologies, these initiatives will likely widen the gap between technology firms and the public interest and disconnect research from critical reflection.
Fortunately, the social implications of AI are beginning to appear on the federal government’s radar. 
The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) of Canada is finalising the first round of public consultation around the responsible use of AI in government. It has worked closely with the AI community by piloting an open online consultation that has allowed us and others to collaborate on the ensuing guidelines.
That report reviews many potential applications of AI, such as chatbots to help users navigate government services and programs to create website content. The initiative demonstrates how the federal government can lead by adopting strong guidelines for its own use of AI. 
These concrete, narrow applications are a sign the government understands the risks of automation in its own work. We hope the final report will result in strong guidelines that guarantee transparency, accountability and fairness.
In addition, Global Affairs Canada is leading a multi-university collaboration on artificial intelligence and human rights. For example, graduate students in Fenwick McKelvey’s Media Policy seminar at Concordia University are contributing to a broad scan of AI’s policy implications for human rights. McKelvey aims to link debates around AI to the expertise in communication and cultural studies that have long been questioning the cultural, social and political dimensions of media and technology.
McKelvey’s research connects with these initiatives by exploring the implications of algorithms and AI on internet governance and broadband performance. 
Abhishek Gupta is evaluating the impacts of AI-enabled automation in the financial services industry and how to tweak university curricula to better train practitioners to meet evolving job needs.
Gupta also founded the Montreal AI Ethics group, where conversations have focused on developing the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence. This document provides clear principles for how AI will respect well-being, autonomy, justice, privacy, knowledge, democracy and for its own responsible development.
AI as a data policy
An AI strategy does not need to develop in isolation. 
A national approach to AI should learn from the philanthropic and nonprofit sectors’ emerging discussions around data. Montreal’s Powered by Data has helped lead important conversations on how philanthropic organisations and nonprofits can become more data driven and serve as models for the inclusive and ethical use of data.
Data is just one of the ways the sector is integrating digital innovation into operations and developing digital strategies to help focus on missions. 
Part of this shift requires reassessing questions of inequality and discrimination in light of digital automation. The Brookfield Institute, a policy institute for innovation and entrepreneurship, has studied the potential benefits and threats of automation to the labour market. Their assessment indicates these effects will not be shared evenly across Canada, with some communities more susceptible to job reduction.



Artificial intelligence and automation will displace workers and create new jobs, but the impacts will not be felt equally across the country.

But these initiatives lack the size and scope of interventions elsewhere. 
In the United States, the Ford Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation fund the AI Now Institute, hosted at New York University. The group has released two major reports on AI governance, leading to an international debate about how AI should be developed and used   — and demonstrating that these sectors can play an important role. 
AI Now’s success demonstrates that the philanthropic and nonprofit sectors can inform the development and application of AI. By creating an institute or a commitment to long-term initiatives, these sectors could ensure the development of an AI strategy that connects with important discussions about rising equity, precarious labour, data discrimination and reconciliation.
Putting Canada in the lead
Canada has a clear choice. Either it embraces the potential of being a leader in responsible AI, or it risks legitimating a race to the bottom where ethics, equity and justice are absent. 
Better guidance for researchers on how the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms relates to AI research and development is a good first step. From there, Canada can create a just, equitable and stable foundation for a research agenda that situates the new technology within longstanding social institutions. 
Canada also needs a more coordinated, inclusive national effort that prioritizes otherwise marginalized voices. These consultations will be key to positioning Canada as a beacon in this field.
Without these measures, Canada could lag behind. Europe is already drafting important new approaches to data protection. New York City launched a task force this fall to become a global leader on governing automated decision making. We hope this leads to active consultation with city agencies, academics across the sciences and the humanities as well as community groups, from Data for Black Lives to Picture the Homeless, and consideration of algorithmic impact assessments. 
These initiatives should provide a helpful context as Canada develops its own governance strategy and works out how to include Indigenous knowledge within that.
If Canada develops a strong national strategy approach to AI governance that works across sectors and disciplines, it can lead at the global level.

Humans ignore the coming AI revolution at their peril.Artificial intelligence aims to replace the human mind, not simply make industry more efficient.Modern civilization needs employment — not simply for our livelihoods, but for our emotional wellbeing.monsitj / Getty ImagesFeb. 7, 2018, 9:44 AM ESTBy Subhash KakRobots have transformed industrial manufacturing, and now they are being rolled out for food production and restaurant kitchens. Already, artificial intelligence (AI) machines can do many tasks where learning and judgment is required, including self-driving cars, insurance assessment, stock trading, accounting, HR and many tasks in healthcare. So are we approaching a jobless future, or will new jobs replace the ones that are lost?According to the optimistic view, our current phase of increasing automation will create new kinds of employment for those who have been made redundant. There is some historical precedent for this: Over a hundred years ago, people feared that the automobile revolution would be bad for workers. But while jobs related to horse-drawn carriages disappeared, the invention of the car lead to a need for automobile mechanics; the internal combustion engine soon found applications in mining, airplanes and other new fields.The difference, however, is that today’s AI technology aims to replace the human mind, not simply make industry more efficient. This will have unprecedented consequences not predicted by the advent of the car, or the automated knitting machine.The effects of AI technology on society cannot be measured purely based on productivity.The effects of AI technology on society cannot be measured purely based on productivity. Modern civilization needs employment — not simply for our livelihoods, but for our emotional wellbeing. If AI increases to the point that a significant portion of workers are suddenly unemployed, this research suggests this could have a profound impact on our social well-being — even with the guaranteed minimum income that is being proposed by leading economists as a way to soften the effects of an increasingly jobless society.So let’s see where we stand. Automation technologies are already impacting many different aspects of the restaurant industry, and it is anticipated that they will put pressures on job availabilities for the food system workers. Self-driving cars will perhaps have an even greater impact on general employment, although they have a greater challenge in winning public trust. Still, many companies have already received permits to test self-driving car technology. General Motors has announced that it is ready to mass produce self-driving cars.So delivery and truck drivers, professors, brokers in the investment business, and accountants will likely become redundant, but so will lawyers, if a new start-up has its way. Meanwhile, information technology is already having a great impact on the education industry. Due to the challenges from online courses, and the high costs of running centralized campuses with expensive infrastructure, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has suggested that half the colleges and universities in the U.S. will close in the next couple decades. (And it’s not just in the U.S. either: The Indian Council for Technical Education (ICTE), which regulates engineering colleges in one of the world’s fastest growing economies, recently announced that 800 colleges will be shut down.)      A November 2017 report from global management consulting firm McKinsey on the effects of automation on jobs, skills and wages for the period ending in 2030 estimates that fully 50% of current work activities are automatable by technologies that have already been tested and found effective. The report predicts that in 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of activities could be automated. The report expects 400 million to 800 million people could be displaced by automation in the next 12 years, creating a challenge potentially greater than past historic shifts, at least in the modern era.One way of meeting the challenge of automation is by retraining the workforce. But this retraining will not simply be the replacing of one set of skills for another. It used to be that users of a technology needed to know how it worked; now many consumer machines are too complex to be repaired.RecommendedOpinionOpinion'Alice, Darling' isn't your average thriller OpinionOpinionMy new co-worker George Santos is a liar, a disgrace — and a danger to democracyIndeed, very few people need to know how the computer systems in a robot work; they just need to be able to interpret sensor readings and error messages. Even a car mechanic uses a computer to identify what system is not working properly and needs replacement.In other words, the number of jobs involving routine skills — both physical and cognitive — is shrinking. Increasing automation at factories is rapidly replacing workers at factories, even in low-wage countries like China. With robots and AI machines doing most of the work, the demand for specialized training related to the tasks where humans have been made redundant will go down. We will still need engineers, but not as many as in the past.Tech advances can be spurned by a society at its peril — rival nations with less to lose will press ahead.The remaining jobs will likely involve fewer routine tasks. We would need more generalized education so that it is possible for workers to be trained in short order for different tasks in in a highly automated labor market. Given that colleges and universities have institutional inertia, this challenge is not being addressed with any priority.We live in an age of unprecedented worldwide migration, where most migrants are finding employment in unskilled jobs. Since these jobs will likely become most at risk as the use of automation advances, societies must also prepare for the challenges of retraining and educating this unique segment of the workforce.Some scientists and tech titans are calling for the regulation of artificial intelligence machines. But the evolution of technology has its own momentum and technological advances can be spurned by a society only at its peril — rival nations with less to lose will press ahead. As a result, machines will continue to replace humans at jobs. The challenge is to be cognizant of the costs and risks, so that one can develop strategies to meet the future with resilience.Subhash KakSubhash Kak is Regents Professor of electrical and computer engineering at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater.

I glance around for the security guard, then reach towards the apple and broccoli superfood puffs. After dropping them into my empty shopping cart, I put them right back. “Did you get it?” I ask my coworker filming on his iPhone. It’s my first paid acting gig. I’m helping teach software the skills needed for future robots to help people with their shopping.Whole Foods was an unwitting participant in this program, a project of German-Canadian startup Twenty Billion Neurons. I quietly perform nine other brief actions, including opening freezers, and pushing a cart from right to left, then left to right. Then I walk out without buying a thing. Later, it takes me around 30 minutes to edit the clips to the required 2 to 5 seconds, and upload them to Amazon’s crowdsourcing website Mechanical Turk. A few days later I am paid $3.50. If Twenty Billion ever creates software for a shopping assistant robot, it will make much more.In sneaking around Whole Foods, I joined an invisible workforce being paid very little to do odd things in the name of advancing artificial intelligence.

My editor snaps a photo. After uploading it to Mechanical Turk, I get paid 7 cents by an eight-person startup in Berkeley called Safely You. When I call CEO George Netscher to say thanks, he erupts in a surprised laugh, then turns mock serious. “Does that mean there’s a conflict of interest?” (The $6.30 I made reporting this article has been donated to the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics.)Netscher’s startup makes software that monitors video feeds from elderly-care homes, to detect when a resident has fallen. People with dementia often can’t remember why or how they ended up on the floor. In 11 facilities around California, Safely You’s algorithms help staff quickly find the place in a video that will unseal the mystery.Safely You was soliciting faked falls like mine to test how broad a view its system has of what a toppled human looks like. The company’s software has mostly been trained with video of elderly residents from care facilities, annotated by staff or contractors. Mixing in photos of 34-year-old journalists and anyone else willing to lay down for 7 cents should force the machine-learning algorithms to widen their understanding. “We’re trying to see how well we can generalize to arbitrary incidents or rooms or clothing,” says Netscher.The startup that paid for my Whole Foods performance, Twenty Billion Neurons, is a bolder bet on the idea of paying people to perform for an audience of algorithms. Roland Memisevic, cofounder and CEO, is in the process of trademarking a term for what I did to earn my $3.50—crowd acting. He argues that it is the only practical path to give machines a dash of common sense about the physical world, a longstanding quest in AI. The company is gathering millions of crowd-acting videos, and using them to train software it hopes to sell clients in industries such as automobiles, retail, and home appliances.Games like chess and Go, with their finite, regimented boards and well-defined rules, are well-suited to computers. The physical and spatial common sense we learn intuitively as children to navigate the real world is mostly beyond them. To pour a cup of coffee, you effortlessly grasp and balance cup and carafe, and control the arc of the pouring fluid. You draw on the same deep-seated knowledge, and a sense for the motivations of other humans, to interpret what you see in the world around you.How to give some version of that to machines is a major challenge in AI. Some researchers think that the techniques that are so effective for recognizing speech or images won’t be much help, arguing new techniques are needed. Memisevic took leave from the prestigious Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms to start Twenty Billion because he believes that existing techniques can do much more for us if trained properly. “They work incredibly well,” he says. “Why not extend them to more subtle aspects of reality by forcing them to learn things about the real world?”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThis Is the Moment RFK Jr. Has Been Waiting ForBy Vittoria Elliott, WIREDGearAI's Energy Demands Are Out of Control. Welcome to the Internet's Hyper-Consumption EraBy Reece RogersGearSemaglutide for the PeopleBy Michael Calore, WIREDTo do that, the startup is amassing giant collections of clips in which crowd actors perform different physical actions. The hope is that algorithms trained to distinguish them will “learn” the essence of the physical world and human actions. It’s why when crowd acting in Whole Foods I not only took items from shelves and refrigerators, but also made near identical clips in which I only pretended to grab the product.Twenty Billion’s first dataset, now released as open source, is physical reality 101. Its more than 100,000 clips depict simple manipulations of everyday objects. Disembodied hands pick up shoes, place a remote control inside a cardboard box, and push a green chili along a table until it falls off. Memisevic deflects questions about the client behind the casting call that I answered, which declared, “We want to build a robot that assists you while shopping in the supermarket.” He will say that automotive applications are a big area of interest; the company has worked with BMW. I see jobs posted to Mechanical Turk that describe a project, with only Twenty Billion's name attached, aimed at allowing a car to identify what people are doing inside a vehicle. Workers were asked to feign snacking, dozing off, or reading in chairs. Software that can detect those actions might help semi-automated vehicles know when a human isn’t ready to take over the driving, or pop open a cupholder when you enter holding a drink.Who are the crowd actors doing this work? One is Uğur Büyükşahin, a third-year geological engineering student in Ankara, Turkey, and star of hundreds of videos in Twenty Billion’s collection. He estimates spending about 7 to 10 hours a week on Mechanical Turk, earning roughly as much as he did in a shift with good tips at the restaurant where he used to work. Büyükşahin says Twenty Billion is one of his favorites, because it pays well, and promptly. Their sometimes odd assignments don’t bother him. “Some people may be shy about taking hundreds of videos in the supermarket, but I’m not,” Büyükşahin says. His girlfriend, by nature less outgoing, was initially wary of the project, but has come around after seeing his earnings, some of which have translated into gifts, such as a new set of curling tongs.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThis Is the Moment RFK Jr. Has Been Waiting ForBy Vittoria Elliott, WIREDGearAI's Energy Demands Are Out of Control. Welcome to the Internet's Hyper-Consumption EraBy Reece RogersGearSemaglutide for the PeopleBy Michael Calore, WIREDBüyükşahin and another Turker I speak with, Casey Cowden, a 31-year-old in Johnson City, Tennessee, tell me I’ve been doing crowd acting all wrong. All in, my 10 videos earned me an hourly rate of around $4.60. They achieve much higher rates by staying in the supermarket for as long as hours, binging on Twenty Billion’s tasks.Büyükşahin says his personal record is 110 supermarket videos in a single hour. He uses a gimbal for higher-quality shots, batting away inquisitive store employees when necessary by bluffing about a university research project in AI. Cowden calculates that he and a friend each earned an hourly rate of $11.75 during two and half hours of crowd acting in a local Walmart. That’s more than Walmart’s $11 starting wage, or the $7.75 or so Cowden’s fiancee earns at Burger King.Cowden seems to have more fun than Walmart employees, too. He began Turking early last year, after the construction company he was working for folded. Working from home means he can be around to care for his fiancee’s mother, who has Alzheimer’s. He says he was initially drawn to Twenty Billion’s assignments because, with the right strategy, they pay better than the data-entry work that dominates Mechanical Turk. But he also warmed to the idea of working on a technological frontier. Cowden tells me he tries to vary the backdrop, and even the clothing he wears, in different shoots. “You can’t train a robot to shop in a supermarket if the videos you have are all the same,” Cowden tells me. “I try to go the whole nine yards so the programming can get a diverse view.”Mechanical Turk has often been called a modern-day sweatshop. A recent study found that median pay was around $2 an hour. But it lacks the communal atmosphere of a workhouse. The site’s labor is atomized into individuals working from homes or phones around the world.Crowd acting sometimes give workers a chance to look each other in the face. Twenty Billion employs contract workers who review crowd-acting videos. But in a tactic common on Mechanical Turk, the startup sometimes uses crowd workers to review other crowd workers. I am paid 10 cents to review 50 clips of crowd actors working on the startup’s automotive project. I click to indicate if a worker stuck to the script—“falling asleep while sitting,” “drinking something from a cup or can,” or “holding something in both hands.”A video from Twenty Billion Neurons describing its work.

Welcome to the Internet's Hyper-Consumption EraBy Reece RogersGearSemaglutide for the PeopleBy Michael Calore, WIREDThe task transports me to bedrooms, lounges, and bathrooms. Many appear to be in places where 10 cents goes further than in San Francisco. I begin to appreciate different styles of acting. To fake falling asleep, a shirtless man in a darkened room leans gently backwards with a meditative look; a woman who appears to be inside a closet lets her head snap forward like a puppet with a cut string.Some of the crowd actors are children—a breach of Amazon’s terms, which require workers to be at least 18. One Asian boy of around 9 in school uniform looks out from a grubby plastic chair in front of a chipped whitewashed wall, then feigns sleep. Another Asian boy, slightly older, performs “drinking from a cup or a can” while another child lies on a bed behind him. Twenty Billion’s CTO Ingo Bax tells me the company screens out such videos from its final datasets, but can’t rule out having paid out money for clips of child crowd actors before they were filtered. Memisevic says the company has protocols to prevent systematic payment for such material.Children also appear in a trove of crowd-acting videos I discover on YouTube. In dozens of clips apparently made public by accident, people act out scripts like “One person runs down the stairs laughing holding a cup of coffee, while another person is fixing the doorknob.” Most appear to have been shot on the Indian subcontinent. Some have been captured by a crowd actor holding a phone to his or her forehead, for a first-person view.I find the videos while trying to unmask the person behind crowd-acting jobs on Mechanical Turk from the “AI Indoors Project.” Forums where crowd workers gather to gripe and swap tips reveal that it’s a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle. Like Twenty Billion, they are gathering crowd-acted videos by the thousand to try and improve algorithms’ understanding of the physical world and what we do in it. Nearly 10,000 clips have already been released for other researchers to play with in a collection aptly named Charades.Gunnar Atli Sigurdsson, a grad student on the project, echoes Memisevic when I ask why he’s paying strangers to pour drinks or run down stairs with a phone held to their head. He wants algorithms to understand us. “We’ve been seeing AI systems getting very impressive at some very narrow, well-defined tasks like chess and Go,” Sigurdsson says. “But we want to have an AI butler in our apartment and have it understand our lives, not the stuff we’re posting on Facebook, the really boring stuff.”If tech companies conquer that quotidian frontier of AI, it will likely be seen as the latest triumph of machine-learning experts. If Twenty Billion's approach works out the truth will be messier and more interesting. If you ever get help from a robot in a supermarket, or ride in a car that understands what its occupants are doing, think of the crowd actors who may have trained it. Cowden, the Tennessean, says he liked Twenty Billion’s tasks in part because his mother is fighting bone cancer. Robots and software able to understand and intervene in our world could help address the growing shortage of nurses and home-health aides. If the projects they contribute to are successful, crowd actors could change the world—although they may be among the last to benefit.Street SmartsGoogle's Geoff Hinton, whose work launched artificial intelligence into the mainstream, is developing new approaches to the field.Here are the projects that artificial-intelligence researchers are tackling this year.Read WIRED's Guide to Artificial Intelligence.",https://schema.org/,,BreadcrumbList,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Tom Simonite', 'sameAs': 'https://www.wired.com/author/tom-simonite/'}]",2018-02-09T07:00:00.000-05:00,2018-02-09T07:00:00.000-05:00,Behind Artificial Intelligence Lurk Oddball Low-Paid Tasks,"['https://media.wired.com/photos/5a7b8e1b3a589d6b2bd0a409/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/InvisibleWorkforce-FINAL.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/5a7b8e1b3a589d6b2bd0a409/4:3/w_2400,h_1800,c_limit/InvisibleWorkforce-FINAL.jpg', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/5a7b8e1b3a589d6b2bd0a409/1:1/w_1800,h_1800,c_limit/InvisibleWorkforce-FINAL.jpg']","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.wired.com/story/behind-artificial-intelligence-lurk-oddball-low-paid-tasks/'}","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'WIRED', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/newsletter-signup-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '100px'}, 'url': 'https://www.wired.com'}",,https://www.wired.com/story/behind-artificial-intelligence-lurk-oddball-low-paid-tasks/,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Business', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/business/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'artificial intelligence', 'item': 'https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'To Make AI Smarter, Humans Perform Oddball Low-Paid Tasks'}]",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",,"As researchers attempt to apply artificial intelligence to daily life, they're paying ""crowd actors"" to film themselves performing routine tasks.",,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5a7b8e1b3a589d6b2bd0a409/1:1/w_1800,h_1800,c_limit/InvisibleWorkforce-FINAL.jpg",,,,,,,business,,,"Whole Foods was an unwitting participant in this program, a project of German-Canadian startup Twenty Billion Neurons.

Disembodied hands pick up shoes, place a remote control inside a cardboard box, and push a green chili along a table until it falls off. Memisevic deflects questions about the client behind the casting call that I answered, which declared, “We want to build a robot that assists you while shopping in the supermarket.” He will say that automotive applications are a big area of interest; the company has worked with BMW. I see jobs posted to Mechanical Turk that describe a project, with only Twenty Billion's name attached, aimed at allowing a car to identify what people are doing inside a vehicle. Workers were asked to feign snacking, dozing off, or reading in chairs. Software that can detect those actions might help semi-automated vehicles know when a human isn’t ready to take over the driving, or pop open a cupholder when you enter holding a drink.
Who are the crowd actors doing this work? One is Uğur Büyükşahin, a third-year geological engineering student in Ankara, Turkey, and star of hundreds of videos in Twenty Billion’s collection. He estimates spending about 7 to 10 hours a week on Mechanical Turk, earning roughly as much as he did in a shift with good tips at the restaurant where he used to work. Büyükşahin says Twenty Billion is one of his favorites, because it pays well, and promptly. Their sometimes odd assignments don’t bother him. “Some people may be shy about taking hundreds of videos in the supermarket, but I’m not,” Büyükşahin says. His girlfriend, by nature less outgoing, was initially wary of the project, but has come around after seeing his earnings, some of which have translated into gifts, such as a new set of curling tongs.
Büyükşahin and another Turker I speak with, Casey Cowden, a 31-year-old in Johnson City, Tennessee, tell me I’ve been doing crowd acting all wrong. All in, my 10 videos earned me an hourly rate of around $4.60. They achieve much higher rates by staying in the supermarket for as long as hours, binging on Twenty Billion’s tasks.
Büyükşahin says his personal record is 110 supermarket videos in a single hour. He uses a gimbal for higher-quality shots, batting away inquisitive store employees when necessary by bluffing about a university research project in AI. Cowden calculates that he and a friend each earned an hourly rate of $11.75 during two and half hours of crowd acting in a local Walmart. That’s more than Walmart’s $11 starting wage, or the $7.75 or so Cowden’s fiancee earns at Burger King.
Cowden seems to have more fun than Walmart employees, too. He began Turking early last year, after the construction company he was working for folded. Working from home means he can be around to care for his fiancee’s mother, who has Alzheimer’s. He says he was initially drawn to Twenty Billion’s assignments because, with the right strategy, they pay better than the data-entry work that dominates Mechanical Turk. But he also warmed to the idea of working on a technological frontier. Cowden tells me he tries to vary the backdrop, and even the clothing he wears, in different shoots. “You can’t train a robot to shop in a supermarket if the videos you have are all the same,” Cowden tells me. “I try to go the whole nine yards so the programming can get a diverse view.”
Mechanical Turk has often been called a modern-day sweatshop. A recent study found that median pay was around $2 an hour. But it lacks the communal atmosphere of a workhouse. The site’s labor is atomized into individuals working from homes or phones around the world.
Crowd acting sometimes give workers a chance to look each other in the face. Twenty Billion employs contract workers who review crowd-acting videos. But in a tactic common on Mechanical Turk, the startup sometimes uses crowd workers to review other crowd workers. I am paid 10 cents to review 50 clips of crowd actors working on the startup’s automotive project. I click to indicate if a worker stuck to the script—“falling asleep while sitting,” “drinking something from a cup or can,” or “holding something in both hands.”
The task transports me to bedrooms, lounges, and bathrooms. Many appear to be in places where 10 cents goes further than in San Francisco. I begin to appreciate different styles of acting. To fake falling asleep, a shirtless man in a darkened room leans gently backwards with a meditative look; a woman who appears to be inside a closet lets her head snap forward like a puppet with a cut string.
Some of the crowd actors are children—a breach of Amazon’s terms, which require workers to be at least 18. One Asian boy of around 9 in school uniform looks out from a grubby plastic chair in front of a chipped whitewashed wall, then feigns sleep. Another Asian boy, slightly older, performs “drinking from a cup or a can” while another child lies on a bed behind him. Twenty Billion’s CTO Ingo Bax tells me the company screens out such videos from its final datasets, but can’t rule out having paid out money for clips of child crowd actors before they were filtered. Memisevic says the company has protocols to prevent systematic payment for such material.
Children also appear in a trove of crowd-acting videos I discover on YouTube. In dozens of clips apparently made public by accident, people act out scripts like “One person runs down the stairs laughing holding a cup of coffee, while another person is fixing the doorknob.” Most appear to have been shot on the Indian subcontinent. Some have been captured by a crowd actor holding a phone to his or her forehead, for a first-person view.
I find the videos while trying to unmask the person behind crowd-acting jobs on Mechanical Turk from the “AI Indoors Project.” Forums where crowd workers gather to gripe and swap tips reveal that it’s a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle. Like Twenty Billion, they are gathering crowd-acted videos by the thousand to try and improve algorithms’ understanding of the physical world and what we do in it. Nearly 10,000 clips have already been released for other researchers to play with in a collection aptly named Charades.
Gunnar Atli Sigurdsson, a grad student on the project, echoes Memisevic when I ask why he’s paying strangers to pour drinks or run down stairs with a phone held to their head. He wants algorithms to understand us. “We’ve been seeing AI systems getting very impressive at some very narrow, well-defined tasks like chess and Go,” Sigurdsson says. “But we want to have an AI butler in our apartment and have it understand our lives, not the stuff we’re posting on Facebook, the really boring stuff.”
If tech companies conquer that quotidian frontier of AI, it will likely be seen as the latest triumph of machine-learning experts. If Twenty Billion's approach works out the truth will be messier and more interesting. If you ever get help from a robot in a supermarket, or ride in a car that understands what its occupants are doing, think of the crowd actors who may have trained it. Cowden, the Tennessean, says he liked Twenty Billion’s tasks in part because his mother is fighting bone cancer. Robots and software able to understand and intervene in our world could help address the growing shortage of nurses and home-health aides. If the projects they contribute to are successful, crowd actors could change the world—although they may be among the last to benefit.

Google's Geoff Hinton, whose work launched artificial intelligence into the mainstream, is developing new approaches to the field.
Here are the projects that artificial-intelligence researchers are tackling this year.

In addition to human-like flute and drum players, the collection contained a golden duck, standing on a pedestal, quacking and defecating. It was, in fact, a digesting duck. When offered pellets by the exhibitor, it would pick them out of his hand and consume them with a gulp. Later, it would excrete a gritty green waste from its back end, to the amazement of audience members. Vaucanson died in 1782 with his reputation as a trailblazer in artificial digestion intact. Sixty years later, the French magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin gained possession of the famous duck and set about repairing it. Taking it apart, however, he realised that the duck had no digestive tract. Rather than breaking down the food, the pellets the duck was fed went into one container, and pre-loaded green-dyed breadcrumbs came out of another. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently exploding, with computers able to perform at near- or above-human level on tasks as diverse as video games, language translation, trivia and facial identification. Like the French exhibit-goers, any observer would be correctly impressed by these results. What might be less clear, however, is how these results are being achieved. Does modern AI reach these feats by functioning the way that biological brains do, and how can we know? In the realm of replication, definitions are important. An intuitive response to hearing about Vaucanson’s cheat is not to say that the duck is doing digestion differently but rather that it’s not doing digestion at all. But a similar trend appears in AI. Checkers? Chess? Go? All were considered formidable tests of intelligence until they were solved by increasingly more complex algorithms. Learning how a magic trick works makes it no longer magic, and discovering how a test of intelligence can be solved makes it no longer a test of intelligence. So let’s look to a well-defined task: identifying objects in an image. Our ability to recognise, for example, a school bus, feels simple and immediate. But given the infinite combinations of individual school buses, lighting conditions and angles from which they can be viewed, turning the information that enters our retina into an object label is an incredibly complex task – one out of reach for computers for decades. In recent years, however, computers have come to identify certain objects with up to 95 per cent accuracy, higher than the average individual human. Like many areas of modern AI, the success of computer vision can be attributed to artificial neural networks. As their name suggests, these algorithms are inspired by how the brain works. They use as their base unit a simple formula meant to replicate what a neuron does. This formula takes in a set of numbers as inputs, multiplies them by another set of numbers (the ‘weights’, which determine how much influence a given input has) and sums them all up. That sum determines how active the artificial neuron is, in the same way that a real neuron’s activity is determined by the activity of other neurons that connect to it. Modern artificial neural networks gain abilities by connecting such units together and learning the right weight for each. The networks used for visual object recognition were inspired by the mammalian visual system, a structure whose basic components were discovered in cats nearly 60 years ago. The first important component of the brain’s visual system is its spatial map: neurons are active only when something is in their preferred spatial location, and different neurons have different preferred locations. Different neurons also tend to respond to different types of objects. In brain areas closer to the retina, neurons respond to simple dots and lines. As the signal gets processed through more and more brain areas, neurons start to prefer more complex objects such as clocks, houses and faces. The first of these properties – the spatial map – is replicated in artificial networks by constraining the inputs that an artificial neuron can get. For example, a neuron in the first layer of a network might receive input only from the top left corner of an image. A neuron in the second layer gets input only from those top-left-corner neurons in the first layer, and so on. The second property – representing increasingly complex objects – comes from stacking layers in a ‘deep’ network. Neurons in the first layer respond to simple patterns, while those in the second layer – getting input from those in the first – respond to more complex patterns, and so on. These networks clearly aren’t cheating in the way that the digesting duck was. But does all this biological inspiration mean that they work like the brain? One way to approach this question is to look more closely at their performance. To this end, scientists are studying ‘adversarial examples’ – real images that programmers alter so that the machine makes a mistake. Very small tweaks to images can be catastrophic: changing a few pixels on an image of a teapot, for example, can make the network label it an ostrich. It’s a mistake a human would never make, and suggests that something about these networks is functioning differently from the human brain. Studying networks this way, however, is akin to the early days of psychology. Measuring only environment and behaviour – in other words, input and output – is limited without direct measurements of the brain connecting them. But neural-network algorithms are frequently criticised (especially among watchdog groups concerned about their widespread use in the real world) for being impenetrable black boxes. To overcome the limitations of this techno-behaviourism, we need a way to understand these networks and compare them with the brain. An ever-growing population of scientists is tackling this problem. In one approach, researchers presented the same images to a monkey and to an artificial network. They found that the activity of the real neurons could be predicted by the activity of the artificial ones, with deeper layers in the network more similar to later areas of the visual system. But, while these predictions are better than those made by other models, they are still not 100 per cent accurate. This is leading researchers to explore what other biological details can be added to the models to make them more similar to the brain. There are limits to this approach. At a recent conference for neuroscientists and AI researchers, Yann LeCun – director of AI research at Facebook, and professor of computer science at the New York University – warned the audience not to become ‘hypnotised by the details of the brain’, implying that not all of what the brain does necessarily needs to be replicated for intelligent behaviour to be achieved. But the question of what counts as a mere detail, like the question of what is needed for true digestion, is an open one. For example, by training artificial networks to be more ‘biological’, researchers have found computational purpose in, for example, the physical anatomy of neurons. Some correspondence between AI and the brain is necessary for these biological insights to be of value. Otherwise, the study of neurons would be only as useful for AI as wing-flapping is for modern airplanes. In 2000, the Belgian conceptual artist Wim Delvoye unveiled Cloaca at a museum in Belgium. Over eight years of research on human digestion, he created the device – consisting of a blender, tubes, pumps and various jars of acids and enzymes – that successfully turns food into faeces. The machine is a true feat of engineering, a testament to our powers of replicating the natural world. Its purpose might be more questionable. One art critic was left with the thought: ‘There is enough dung as it is. Why make more?’ Intelligence doesn’t face this problem. ",True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predicting Our Future is a podcast about the next revolutions in technology, as seen through the eyes of a serial entrepreneur. Below is an edited transcript excerpt from ""Episode 16: How Homes Powered By Artificial Intelligence Will Know You And Take Care Of You"" — the final episode in a 7-part series on the future of the smart home.

In this episode of Predicting Our Future, I’ll paint a picture of what life in our future homes might look like and explore how smart homes will use personas and Artificial Intelligence to fulfill our needs before we’re even aware of them.
Drowning In To-Do Lists
For my smart home podcast series, I’ve been interviewing my friends to find out what tools they use to manage their list of to-do’s. “I keep them in a Google doc,” one friend told me. “I keep it multiple Google Docs,” said another friend. “Each one is dated, and I when I think I’m no longer serious about following a list, I simply create another one with a new date.” One guy used Evernote. Best of all was a friend of mine who explained how his to-do lists are memorialized with stickies on his bedroom wall, much to the chagrin of his wife.
PROMOTED
While the tools were all different, the one thing that everyone seemed to have in common was a general feeling of failure when it came to crossing enough things off their list and an abiding belief that there was too much to do in too little time. Everyone seemed to be searching for a magic elixir that would save them more time

I often wonder how technology can improve our lives. One area in particular that fascinates me is identifying tasks that technology can handle so that they don’t need to appear on my to-do list, and just as importantly, so that they won't occupy space in my mind. I read once about the dressing habits of people like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg who seemingly wear the same outfit everyday. Upon closer inspection, it turns out that both men have multiple identical pants and identical shirts. The reason for wearing the same outfit every day? If you always wear the same thing, then there is no decision to make. You can then turn to more important decisions and lead a more productive life.
How, you might ask, are to-do lists and clothes connected to the smart home? I've explored how technology like the smart thermostat or smart lighting could save me money if they only turned on when I was in a room in need of heat or air conditioning or light. That’s interesting, but what’s infinitely more exciting to me is if the smart home could offload my decisions and work by completing tasks independently of me. Fewer decisions that I need to make means more time for me to focus on the things that really matter.

A Smart Home Driven By Artificial Intelligence
In many industries, when you interview an ambitious leader, he or she will talk with you about how they will reinvent factory-built housing or the fitness space or retail. However, in some, people will talk about how they are part of an ecosystem and how their success is in large part predicated on the success of other companies in the ecosystem. In the case of the smart home, almost all of the players I interviewed talked about a future where the holy grail was a home driven by Artificial Intelligence. 
Think of Artificial Intelligence as computing power that is able to perform particularly complex tasks that would otherwise require a human brain to perform. A motion sensor might trigger a light to turn on. But if a home had Artificial Intelligence, it might consider the time of day, the person walking around the home, and where she was walking in deciding which light to turn on and how long to keep it on for. Not every person I spoke to used the words “Artificial Intelligence.” A hot phrase you’ll hear again and again from experts is that a house needs to be “aware” or “contextually aware” before you can bring Artificial Intelligence into the home.  
Let’s imagine the universe of things a house can be aware of: it can be aware of the presence of the people who live in the house (along with their personas); it can be aware of what they’re doing; it can even be aware of what every device in the house is doing. If you want the house to think like a human, the house needs to be able to analyze the data a human would analyze before making a decision.

Your Home As Your Personal Caretaker
How would it work for a smart home to free me of some of my decision-making? How could it lighten the load for me, literally and figuratively? Let’s imagine a day together. You wake up in the morning and your alarm goes off. It’s not a buzzer. You want to discover new music on Spotify and this song is on your suggested Discover Weekly list. What’s really interesting, though, is not the song. It’s the fact that you didn’t have to set the alarm the night before. 
That’s because there is some level of intelligence in the cloud that’s watching over you and trying to simplify your life. It knows that today you have a spin class because it checked your workout goals, which then checked availability for a class at SoulCycle, which then purchased the class, which then put it on your calendar. The system was smart enough to calculate travel time and set the alarm appropriately. 
You stagger out of bed and walk down the stairs to the kitchen. The coffee just finished brewing. You have your smart home to thank for that. Your yogurt and granola is ready in the exact proportions you want inside the refrigerator. The refrigerator knew earlier in the week that you were running low on breakfast foods and placed an order online. You’re in a rush, so you walk out the door and leave for the gym. 
There’s no time to set the alarm or draw the blinds (which is something you do when you leave the house so that people can’t look in while you’re away). You don’t think to turn off the music or the lights or lower the heat, as you won’t need to heat the house to 72 degrees while you’re away. It’s not that you forget to do all of those things. You just don’t have to think about them, because the house knows that you left. It knows to lock the door behind you, to turn off the coffee maker, to pull the blinds, to reduce the heat, to shut off the music, and to turn off the lights.
Today is shopping today. Really, every day is shopping day. The sensors in your drawers measure the toilet paper that is left, and the sensors in the closet monitor cleaning supplies and laundry detergent. You’re running low on a few things. The online order is placed. When it arrives, the cameras at your front door will recognize the FedEx truck and coordinate with the lock to pop open your front door. The delivery man’s picture will be taken and a gentle voice will come on over your speakers, asking him to set down the packages just inside the house. Cameras will be watching him from beginning to end, and the door will close on its own behind him when he leaves. Your home’s robot then proceeds to unpack the items and place them where they belong.

After a long day at work, it’s time to return home. As you leave the office and get in your car, your home is alerted that you’re on your way. The house begins to heat up. When you pull into the driveway and walk up your stoop to the front door, you pause briefly for a retinal scan. It’s you. The house knows and opens the front door. You are represented by a persona to the smart home that you partially configured and that the house has partially developed on you, based upon patterns it was able to recognize through sensors and cameras. This is Artificial Intelligence in the cloud at work in your home. 
There are a couple of big objectives you’ve set for yourself this past New Year’s. You want to eat healthier and lose some weight. You are also hoping find a routine at night that might help with your anxiety and sleep. Your sleep has been uneven for quite some time. The diet, the anxiety-reducing routine, and the sleep hygiene are all associated with your persona in the cloud that the house is now relying on to welcome you home. 
Your wife isn’t home just yet, so the lights in the entryway are adjusted to a calming setting as the music comes on, which is so faint and melodic that it fades into the background. Dinner tonight will be fresh salmon and steamed vegetables — selected for you by the cloud, based on your objectives and tastes (which are all part of the persona). The ingredients are there in the refrigerator, which were delivered and put there a day earlier. You start cooking so that when your wife arrives, dinner will be ready. After dinner, you retire to the den while your wife goes to the office. The smart home has created a different persona for your wife and would have greeted her differently if she had come home from work before you. 
A gentle chime comes on over the speakers, followed by a voice telling you that the big game starts in 10 minutes. For your wife, a voice announces it’s time for her to begin the 90 minutes of work she wanted to do before going to bed. The blinds are pulled, lights are dimmed, and TV is turned on for you, while your wife has different background music and lighting in the office. For both of you, your watches read your internal temperatures and blood pressures, signaling the house to adjust the temperature, fans, and lighting accordingly. 
You don’t have to particularly worry about cleaning up. In the morning after you both leave for work, your home robot will pick up after you and then the vacuum cleaner will vacuum the house. You both like listening to a meditative app before sleep. Wind down begins promptly at 10PM. 15 minutes later, with the breathing exercises finished, you both go to bed. Lights out.

                            The Swiss food and beverage giant and the Dublin-based biotech company are to work together on discovering bioactive peptide networks in target high-value areas.
        








The collaboration will make use of Nuritas’ innovative technology platform, which uses DNA analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict, unlock and validate bioactive peptide compounds from food sources.Nestlé will further develop and validate the efficacy of the new discoveries within the target application areas. “At Nuritas our mission is to positively impact billions of lives worldwide and we therefore are delighted to be collaborating with Nestlé, the world’s largest food and beverage company on such an important project. We are really looking forward to beginning this impactful journey together,”​ said Nora Khaldi, Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Nuritas.“The fruition of our collaboration carries the promise to be truly industry-changing,”​ added Emmet Browne CEO at Nuritas, formerly of Nestlé. “We are very excited to partner with Nestlé as they look to continue their own admirable purpose to help shape a better and healthier world.”​Hinting at the depth of impact the partnership would have on the industry, Browne told NutraIngredients, “The power and accuracy of the Nuritas approach is so, that it makes sense to apply it to the areas of greatest consumer need or industries toughest problems. In our collaboration with Nestlé we are looking to do just that”. ​The collaboration is also a good fit for Nestlé’s objectives.“As our understanding of food and nutrition continues to grow, our global research and development network is looking ahead to discover how we can help enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future for everyone. Research partnerships such as that with Nuritas help us achieve that goal​,” commented Richard Stadler at the Nestlé Research Centre.Rapid growth​Nuritas’ new tie-up with Nestlé comes on the back of another collaboration with German giant BASF announced in early 2017 and a successful round of funding later in the year. Nuritas is in the process of rapidly growing the workforce and scaling up the business to take advantage of the expansion opportunities that its internationally recognised, award-winning platform appears to provide.Additional collaborations are likely to be revealed in the future which will continue to drive this expansion, suggested Browne.“We are incredibly proud of all our partnerships to date, both those that are publicly disclosed and those that are not yet. We aim to partner with the world’s most innovative and far-reaching leaders in health and nutrition, a description that is perfectly embodied by both Nestlé and BASF.​“In addition to the obvious validation that both these agreements provide, working in partnership with such great companies also affords us tremendous opportunities to learn from the best,” ​he added. ​AI – the future?​The use of AI, together with DNA analysis, in the discovery of new bioactive compounds has the potential to revolutionise the speed of product development.“The traditional approach to finding new active molecules is close to random, it’s like searching the ocean for a treasure chest without a map. It usually takes years and millions,” ​Khaldi said. “What the Nuritas technology does is create a map​.”Despite the impressive science underlying AI-based bioactive molecule discovery, the bottom-line was still the commercial end product, emphasised Browne.“We are very much a commercial business not an academic institution. For us a project is not a success until an ingredient that works in the end application exists. ​“Our data-driven approach powered by machine learning enables us to progress through the development cycle at incredibly fast rates at all stages from in vitro to as far as scaling of ingredient production,” ​ he concluded.

Believe it or not, great minds have been thinking about artificial intelligence long before Hanna-Barbera brought us Rosie, the Jetsons' domestic wonder-bot.For tens of thousands of years, humans and our ancestors have been trying to figure out how to make the world work for us. Twigs for fire. Wheels for transportation. We get there; some discoveries just take longer than others. Modern innovations have come in fits and starts. There are four big leaps, to be exact.UBS lays them out. In 1784, the first industrial revolution with mechanical production, leading to steam-based energy powering hulking machines like trains.Related StoryVoice-Sensitive Tech Dominated CES — Even With Its Security DrawbacksSkip ahead almost 100 years to 1870: the second revolution with mass production in factories and harnessing electrical energy, lighting homes and businesses. During WWII, engineer Alan Turing created a powerful German-code-breaking computer and developed the ""Turing test"" in 1950.Wired describes the test as ""a benchmark to determine a machine's ability to 'think' like a human. Though his ideas were ridiculed at the time, they set the wheels in motion, and the term 'artificial intelligence' entered popular awareness in the mid-1950s.""What began in Turing’s lab became part of the third revolution in 1969: computing power. Computers have since become interwoven into just about every part of our daily lives. Dishwashers. DVRs. Cash registers. Cellphones.We are now living in the middle of the fourth revolution: A.I.Check out this rapid-fire timeline published by Oxford and Yale professors looking at when experts in the field predict A.I. will outperform humans in certain tasks: — Translating languages: 2024. — Writing high-school essays: 2026. — Driving a truck: 2027 (this accounts for almost 2 million jobs). — Working in retail: 2031 (nearly 5 million jobs). — Writing a bestselling book: 2049.Economists foresee upheavals ahead as industries reorient themselves to the age of A.I. Some developments will be painful, inevitably introducing automation and job loss, but possibly creating new fields as a byproduct.Other developments will make life easier — like having Rosie to flip the pancakes and a smart car to get Judy and Elroy to school on time.

Most U.S. Workers Unafraid of Losing Their Jobs to Robots
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

23% of employed Americans worry they will lose their jobs to AI
Fear of job loss varies by education
Manufacturing and construction sectors seen as most vulnerable


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Nearly three in four working Americans (73%) say the rising use of artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate more jobs than it creates across the country. However, a far smaller percentage of these workers (23%) say they are ""very"" or ""somewhat"" worried that they will lose their own jobs to this new technology.


American Workers' Fears of Job Loss From New Technology

Northeastern University/Gallup survey, Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017





These data come from a Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward AI and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults, including 2,871 who are employed, was conducted Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017.
Employed Americans with less than a bachelor's degree are almost twice as likely to feel their jobs are at risk as are those with a four-year degree or more, 28% vs. 15%. Americans with less than a bachelor's degree are also less optimistic about the impact of AI in general and may feel that their own lower education levels leave them vulnerable to job loss attributable to the new technology.
There is a smaller gap in fear of job loss between employed Americans with blue-collar jobs (those working in industries largely composed of hourly wage earners) and those with white-collar positions (those working in largely salaried industries ), 26% vs. 19%, respectively. Similar to the gap in overall optimism seen in educational attainment, white-collar workers also tend to be more positive than blue-collar workers about the overall impact of AI.
Among American workers in their prime years of work -- those aged 18 to 65 -- worry varies modestly, ranging from 21% among those aged 36 to 50, to 27% among workers 51 to 65 years of age.

Construction and Manufacturing Seen as Most Vulnerable to AI
Americans who say AI will result in a net loss of jobs were asked to indicate which of a series of 12 economic sectors they believe would see jobs eliminated first by the new technology. More than six in 10 Americans (62%) who believe AI will result in a net job loss say the construction or manufacturing industries are the most likely to be eliminated by AI first. More than half also say the retail (55%) and transportation (52%) sectors are particularly vulnerable to replacement of jobs by new technology.


 

Americans who see AI adoption resulting in net job loss say the legal and public policy sector is the least vulnerable to replacement from this new technology, with 9% saying cuts in jobs related to AI will occur first in these fields. Additionally, jobs in the fields of arts, entertainment and sports, as well as those in community and social services, are seen as safe from AI -- with 15% and 16%, respectively, saying these positions will be eliminated first.
Implications
Although many Americans believe AI adoption will result in a net loss of jobs, about three in four are not worried about losing their own positions. This is reaffirmed in separate Gallup research on the issue, which found that a similar level of Americans (72%) thought it was ""not too likely"" or ""not likely at all"" that they would lose their jobs to new technology in the next 20 years. However, anxiety about job loss to new technology is substantially higher than the 8% of employed Americans who say they are ""very"" or ""fairly"" likely to be laid off in the next year.
Americans who expect AI to lead to job losses in the U.S. identify the construction and manufacturing sectors as particularly vulnerable to new technology. This may be because of the long association of the introduction of robotics with job loss in the manufacturing sector. Additionally, retail may be seen as vulnerable because of the increasing popularity of online retail and changes such as self-checkout lines, which many Americans already use. Finally, transportation may stick out in Americans' minds because of extensive media coverage about self-driving vehicles.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University/Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.

Mr. Yang, a former tech executive who started the nonprofit organization Venture for America, believes that automation and advanced artificial intelligence will soon make millions of jobs obsolete — yours, mine, those of our accountants and radiologists and grocery store cashiers. He says America needs to take radical steps to prevent Great Depression-level unemployment and a total societal meltdown, including handing out trillions of dollars in cash.“All you need is self-driving cars to destabilize society,” Mr. Yang, 43, said over lunch at a Thai restaurant in Manhattan last month, in his first interview about his campaign. In just a few years, he said, “we’re going to have a million truck drivers out of work who are 94 percent male, with an average level of education of high school or one year of college.”“That one innovation,” he continued, “will be enough to create riots in the street. And we’re about to do the same thing to retail workers, call center workers, fast-food workers, insurance companies, accounting firms.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAlarmist? Sure. But Mr. Yang’s doomsday prophecy echoes the concerns of a growing number of labor economists and tech experts who are worried about the coming economic consequences of automation. A 2017 report by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, concluded that by 2030 — three presidential terms from now — as many as one-third of American jobs may disappear because of automation. (Other studies have given cheerier forecasts, predicting that new jobs will replace most of the lost ones.)Perhaps it was inevitable that a tech-skeptic candidate would try to seize the moment. Scrutiny of tech companies like Facebook and Google has increased in recent years, and worries about monopolistic behavior, malicious exploitation of social media and the addictive effects of smartphones have made a once-bulletproof industry politically vulnerable. Even industry insiders have begun to join the backlash.To fend off the coming robots, Mr. Yang is pushing what he calls a “Freedom Dividend,” a monthly check for $1,000 that would be sent to every American from age 18 to 64, regardless of income or employment status. These payments, he says, would bring everyone in America up to approximately the poverty line, even if they were directly hit by automation. Medicare and Medicaid would be unaffected under Mr. Yang’s plan, but people receiving government benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could choose to continue receiving those benefits, or take the $1,000 monthly payments instead.The Freedom Dividend isn’t a new idea. It’s a rebranding of universal basic income, a policy that has been popular in academic and think-tank circles for decades, was favored by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the economist Milton Friedman, and has more recently caught the eye of Silicon Valley technologists. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have all expressed support for the idea of a universal basic income. Y Combinator, the influential start-up incubator, is running a basic income experiment with 3,000 participants in two states.Despite its popularity among left-leaning academics and executives, universal basic income is still a leaderless movement that has yet to break into mainstream politics. Mr. Yang thinks he can sell the idea in Washington by framing it as a pro-business policy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’m a capitalist,” he said, “and I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.”Mr. Yang, a married father of two boys, is a fast-talking extrovert who wears the nu-executive uniform of a blazer and jeans without a tie. He keeps a daily journal of things he’s grateful for, and peppers conversations with business-world catchphrases like “core competency.” After graduating from Brown University and Columbia Law School, he quit his job at a big law firm and began working in tech. He ran an internet start-up that failed during the first dot-com bust, worked as an executive at a health care start-up and helped build a test-prep business that was acquired by Kaplan in 2009, netting him a modest fortune.He caught the political bug after starting Venture for America, an organization modeled after Teach for America that connects recent college graduates with start-up businesses. During his travels to Midwestern cities, he began to connect the growth of anti-establishment populism with the rise of workplace automation.“The reason Donald Trump was elected was that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,” he said. “If you look at the voter data, it shows that the higher the level of concentration of manufacturing robots in a district, the more that district voted for Trump.”ImageMr. Yang has proposed monthly payments of $1,000 for every American from age 18 to 64. “I’m a capitalist,” he said, “and I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.”Credit...Guerin Blask for The New York TimesMr. Yang’s skepticism of technology extends beyond factory robots. In his campaign book, “The War on Normal People,” he writes that he wants to establish a Department of the Attention Economy in order to regulate social media companies like Facebook and Twitter. He also proposes appointing a cabinet-level secretary of technology, based in Silicon Valley, to study the effects of emerging technologies.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTCritics may dismiss Mr. Yang’s campaign (slogan: “Humanity First”) as a futurist vanity stunt. The Democratic pipeline is already stuffed with would-be 2020 contenders, most of whom already have the public profile and political experience that Mr. Yang lacks — and at least one of whom, Senator Bernie Sanders, has already hinted at support for a universal basic income.Opponents of universal basic income have also pointed to its steep price tag — an annual outlay of $12,000 per American adult would cost approximately $2 trillion, equivalent to roughly half of the current federal budget — and the possibility that giving out free money could encourage people not to work. These reasons, among others, are why Hillary Clinton, who considered adding universal basic income to her 2016 platform, concluded it was “exciting but not realistic.”

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.“In our political culture, there are formidable political obstacles to providing cash to working-age people who aren’t employed, and it’s unlikely that U.B.I. could surmount them,” Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, wrote last year.But Mr. Yang thinks he can make the case. He has proposed paying for a basic income with a value-added tax, a consumption-based levy that he says would raise money from companies that profit from automation. A recent study by the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning policy think-tank, suggested that such a plan, paid for by a progressive tax plan, could grow the economy by more than 2 percent and provide jobs for 1.1 million more people.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Universal basic income is an old idea,” Mr. Yang said, “but it’s an old idea that right now is uniquely relevant because of what we’re experiencing in society.”Mr. Yang’s prominent supporters include Andy Stern, a former leader of Service Employees International Union, who credited him with “opening up a discussion that the country’s afraid to have.” His campaign has also attracted some of Silicon Valley’s elites. Tony Hsieh, the chief executive of Zappos, is an early donor to Mr. Yang’s campaign, as are several venture capitalists and high-ranking alumni of Facebook and Google.Mr. Yang, who has raised roughly $130,000 since filing his official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission in November, says he will ultimately raise millions from supporters in the tech industry and elsewhere to supplement his own money.Mr. Yang has other radical ideas, too. He wants to appoint a White House psychologist, “make taxes fun” by turning April 15 into a national holiday and put into effect “digital social credits,” a kind of gamified reward system to encourage socially productive behavior. To stem corruption, he suggests increasing the president’s salary to $4 million from its current $400,000, and sharply raising the pay of other federal regulators, while barring them from accepting paid speaking gigs or lucrative private-sector jobs after leaving office.And although he said he was socially liberal, he admitted that he hadn’t fully developed all his positions. (On most social issues, Mr. Yang said, “I believe what you probably think I believe.”)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe likelihood, of course, is that Mr. Yang’s candidacy won’t end with a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Still, experts I spoke with were glad to have him talking about the long-term risks of automation, at a time when much of Washington is consumed with the immediate and visible.Erik Brynjolfsson, the director of M.I.T.’s Initiative on the Digital Economy and a co-author of “The Second Machine Age,” praised Mr. Yang for bringing automation’s economic effects into the conversation.“This is a serious problem, and it’s going to get a lot worse,” Mr. Brynjolfsson said. “In every election for the next 10 or 20 years, this will become a more salient issue, and the candidates who can speak to it effectively will do well.”Mr. Yang knows he could sound the automation alarm without running for president. But he feels a sense of urgency. In his view, there’s no time to mess around with think-tank papers and “super PACs,” because the clock is ticking.“We have five to 10 years before truckers lose their jobs,” he said, “and all hell breaks loose.” Email Kevin Roose at kevin.roose@nytimes.com, or follow him on Facebook at facebook.com/kevinroose and on Twitter: @kevinroose.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 11, 2018, Section BU, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: His 2020 Slogan: Beware of Robots.

But 7.30 has discovered just two physician assistants are employed in Queensland's public health system.Both work in the emergency department at Townsville Hospital.This year the university suspended all new student enrolments, but 16 students are continuing with their studies.7.30 understands three students have made official complaints about the course, but JCU refused to confirm this, citing ""policy and privacy considerations"".Do you know more about this story? Email 7.30@abc.net.au'We knew we were going to be pioneers'Sorry, this video is not yet available or has expired Some physician assistants like Judith Beneke have found work in private practice.Hoping to leave his career as a paramedic, Derek Greaves enrolled in the physician assistant course at JCU.He graduated in 2017 but has been unable to find a job, and has returned to work as a paramedic.""It's soul-sapping. This has actually damaged my family [and] they've actually damaged me,"" he said.""Why have a course where there's no outcome?""The degrees cost $27,000 and many students quit full-time employment in their final year of study to complete clinical placements. ""I would say if you really want to do the course, go to America or England,"" Mr Greaves said.""Both of those countries actually have physician assistants and they're actually working in the health system."" David Ashard has returned to work as a paramedic after failing to find work as a physician assistant.(ABC News: Michael Atkin)David Ashard left his job as a paramedic six years ago to study at the University of Queensland to become one of the first physician assistants in Australia.""Lifestyle, employability, monetary factors — it was just a really good job,"" he said.""I thought, 'Well, if this is going to be anything like it is in America this is going to be fantastic.'""""I personally was pretty naive about what was going to be required to introduce the new position into Australia.""

Three commercially released facial-analysis programs from major technology companies demonstrate both skin-type and gender biases, according to a new paper researchers from MIT and Stanford University will present later this month at the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency.In the researchers’ experiments, the three programs’ error rates in determining the gender of light-skinned men were never worse than 0.8 percent. For darker-skinned women, however, the error rates ballooned — to more than 20 percent in one case and more than 34 percent in the other two.The findings raise questions about how today’s neural networks, which learn to perform computational tasks by looking for patterns in huge data sets, are trained and evaluated. For instance, according to the paper, researchers at a major U.S. technology company claimed an accuracy rate of more than 97 percent for a face-recognition system they’d designed. But the data set used to assess its performance was more than 77 percent male and more than 83 percent white.










“What’s really important here is the method and how that method applies to other applications,” says Joy Buolamwini, a researcher in the MIT Media Lab’s Civic Media group and first author on the new paper. “The same data-centric techniques that can be used to try to determine somebody’s gender are also used to identify a person when you’re looking for a criminal suspect or to unlock your phone. And it’s not just about computer vision. I’m really hopeful that this will spur more work into looking at [other] disparities.”Buolamwini is joined on the paper by Timnit Gebru, who was a graduate student at Stanford when the work was done and is now a postdoc at Microsoft Research.Chance discoveriesThe three programs that Buolamwini and Gebru investigated were general-purpose facial-analysis systems, which could be used to match faces in different photos as well as to assess characteristics such as gender, age, and mood. All three systems treated gender classification as a binary decision — male or female — which made their performance on that task particularly easy to assess statistically. But the same types of bias probably afflict the programs’ performance on other tasks, too.Indeed, it was the chance discovery of apparent bias in face-tracking by one of the programs that prompted Buolamwini’s investigation in the first place.Several years ago, as a graduate student at the Media Lab, Buolamwini was working on a system she called Upbeat Walls, an interactive, multimedia art installation that allowed users to control colorful patterns projected on a reflective surface by moving their heads. To track the user’s movements, the system used a commercial facial-analysis program.The team that Buolamwini assembled to work on the project was ethnically diverse, but the researchers found that, when it came time to present the device in public, they had to rely on one of the lighter-skinned team members to demonstrate it. The system just didn’t seem to work reliably with darker-skinned users.Curious, Buolamwini, who is black, began submitting photos of herself to commercial facial-recognition programs. In several cases, the programs failed to recognize the photos as featuring a human face at all. When they did, they consistently misclassified Buolamwini’s gender.Quantitative standardsTo begin investigating the programs’ biases systematically, Buolamwini first assembled a set of images in which women and people with dark skin are much better-represented than they are in the data sets typically used to evaluate face-analysis systems. The final set contained more than 1,200 images.Next, she worked with a dermatologic surgeon to code the images according to the Fitzpatrick scale of skin tones, a six-point scale, from light to dark, originally developed by dermatologists as a means of assessing risk of sunburn.Then she applied three commercial facial-analysis systems from major technology companies to her newly constructed data set. Across all three, the error rates for gender classification were consistently higher for females than they were for males, and for darker-skinned subjects than for lighter-skinned subjects.For darker-skinned women — those assigned scores of IV, V, or VI on the Fitzpatrick scale — the error rates were 20.8 percent, 34.5 percent, and 34.7. But with two of the systems, the error rates for the darkest-skinned women in the data set — those assigned a score of VI — were worse still: 46.5 percent and 46.8 percent. Essentially, for those women, the system might as well have been guessing gender at random.“To fail on one in three, in a commercial system, on something that’s been reduced to a binary classification task, you have to ask, would that have been permitted if those failure rates were in a different subgroup?” Buolamwini says. “The other big lesson ... is that our benchmarks, the standards by which we measure success, themselves can give us a false sense of progress.”“This is an area where the data sets have a large influence on what happens to the model,” says Ruchir Puri, chief architect of IBM’s Watson artificial-intelligence system. “We have a new model now that we brought out that is much more balanced in terms of accuracy across the benchmark that Joy was looking at. It has a half a million images with balanced types, and we have a different underlying neural network that is much more robust.”“It takes time for us to do these things,” he adds. “We’ve been working on this roughly eight to nine months. The model isn’t specifically a response to her paper, but we took it upon ourselves to address the questions she had raised directly, including her benchmark. She was bringing up some very important points, and we should look at how our new work stands up to them.”

Let’s look at 6 definitions of artificial intelligence and see how some of the industry’s leaders are focusing their AI research efforts.

John McCarthy first coined the term artificial intelligence in 1956 when he invited a group of researchers from a variety of disciplines including language simulation, neuron nets, complexity theory and more to a summer workshop called the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence to discuss what would ultimately become the field of AI. At that time, the researchers came together to clarify and develop the concepts around “thinking machines” which up to this point had been quite divergent. McCarthy is said to have picked the name artificial intelligence for its neutrality; to avoid highlighting one of the tracks being pursued at the time for the field of “thinking machines” that included cybernetics, automata theory and complex information processing. The proposal for the conference said, “The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”
Today, modern dictionary definitions focus on AI being a sub-field of computer science and how machines can imitate human intelligence (being human-like rather than becoming human). The English Oxford Living Dictionary gives this definition: “The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.”
PROMOTED
Merriam-Webster defines artificial intelligence this way:

      A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers.
      The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.

The Encyclopedia Britannica states, “artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.” Intelligent beings are those that can adapt to changing circumstances.

Definitions of artificial intelligence begin to shift based upon the goals that are trying to be achieved with an AI system. Generally, people invest in AI development for one of these three objectives:

      Build systems that think exactly like humans do (“strong AI”)
      Just get systems to work without figuring out how human reasoning works (“weak AI”)
      Use human reasoning as a model but not necessarily the end goal

Turns out that the bulk of the AI development happening today by industry leaders falls under the third objective and uses human reasoning as a guide to provide better services or create better products rather trying to achieve a perfect replica of the human mind.
Amazon builds a lot of its business on machine-learning systems (as a subset of AI) and defines AI as “the field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, and pattern recognition.” Machine learning is so important to Amazon, they stated, “Without ML, Amazon.com couldn’t grow its business, improve its customer experience and selection, and optimize its logistic speed and quality.”
While some of the major tech companies haven’t published a dictionary-type definition for AI, we can extrapolate how they define the importance of AI by reviewing their research areas.
Machine and deep learning are the priority for Google AI and its tools to “create smarter, more useful technology and help as many people as possible” from translations to healthcare to making our smartphones even smarter. Facebook AI Research is committed to “advancing the file of machine intelligence and are creating new technologies to give people better ways to communicate.” IBM’s three areas of focus include AI Engineering, building scalable AI models and tools; AI Tech where the core capabilities of AI such as natural language processing, speech and image recognition and reasoning are explored and AI Science, where expanding the frontiers of AI is the focus.
In 2016, several industry leaders including Amazon, Apple, DeepMind, Google, IBM and Microsoft joined together to create Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society to develop and share best practices, advance public understanding, provide an open platform for discussion and to identify aspirational effort in AI for socially beneficial purposes.
Those working with AI today make it a priority to define the field for the problems it will solve and the benefits the technology can have for society. It’s no longer a primary objective for most to get to AI that operates just like a human brain, but to use its unique capabilities to enhance our world.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

“Whatever your job is, the chances are that one of these machines can do it faster or better than you can.”

No, this is not a 2018 headline about self-driving cars or one of IBM’s new supercomputers. Instead, it was published by the Daily Mirror in 1955, when a computer took as much space as a large kitchen and had less power than a pocket calculator. They were called “electronic brains” back then, and evoked both hope and fear. And more than 20 years later, little had changed: In a 1978 BBC documentary about silicon chips, one commentator argued that “They are the reason why Japan is abandoning its shipbuilding and why our children will grow up without jobs to go to”.
Artificial intelligence hype is not new
If one types “artificial intelligence” (AI) on Google Books’ Ngram Viewer – a tool that allows us to check how often a term was printed in a book between 1800 and 2008 – we can clearly see that our modern-day hype, optimism and deep concern about AI are by no means a novelty.

The history of AI is a long series of booms and busts. The first “AI spring” took place between 1956 and 1974, with pioneers such as the young Marvin Minsky. This was followed by the “first AI winter” (1974-1980), when disillusion with the gap between machine learning and human cognitive capacities first led to disinvestment and disinterest in the topic. A second boom (1980-1987) was followed by another “winter” (1987-2001). Since the 2000s we’ve been surfing the third “AI spring”.
There’s plenty of reasons to believe this latest wave of interest for AI is going to be more durable. According to Gartner Research, technologies typically go from a “peak of inflated expectations” through a “trough of disillusionment” until they finally reach a “plateau of productivity”. AI-intensive technologies such as virtual assistants, the Internet of Things, smart robots and augmented data discovery are about to reach the peak. Deep learning, machine learning and cognitive expert advisors are expected to reach the plateau of mainstream applications in two to five years.
Narrow intelligence
We finally seem to have enough computing power to credibly develop what is called “narrow AI”, of which all the aforementioned technologies are an example. These are not to be confused with “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), which scientist and futurologist Ray Kurzweil called “strong AI”. Some of the most advanced AI systems to date, such as IBM’s Watson supercomputer or Google’s AlphaGo, are examples of narrow AI. They can be trained to perform complex tasks such as identifying cancerous skin patterns or playing the ancient Chinese strategy game of Go. They are very far, however, from being capable to do everyday general intelligence tasks such as gardening, arguing or inventing a children’s story. 
The cautionary prophecies of visionaries like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking against AI really are meant as an early warning against the dangers of AGI, but that is not something our children will be confronted with. Their immediate partners will be of the narrow AI kind. The future of labour depends on how well we equip them to use computers as cognitive partners .



Hype cycle for emerging technologies.
Gartner Research


Better together
Garry Kasparov – the chess grandmaster who was defeated by IBM’s Deep Blue computer in 1997 – calls this human-machine cooperation “augmented intelligence”. He compares this “augmentation” to the mythic image of a centaur: combine a quadruped’s horsepower with the intuition of a human mind. To illustrate the potential of centaurs, he describes a freestyle chess tournament in 2005 in which any combination of human-machine teams was possible. In his words:

“The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and ‘coaching’ their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grand-master opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process. Human strategic guidance combined with the tactical acuity of a computer was overwhelming.”

Human-machine cognitive partnerships can amplify what each partner does best: humans are great at making intuitive and creative decisions based on knowledge while computers are good at sifting through large amounts of data to produce information that will feed into human knowledge and decision making. We use this combination of narrow AI and human unique cognitive and motor skills every day, often without realising it. A few examples:

Using Internet search engines to find content (videos, images, articles) that will be helpful in preparing for a school assignment. Then combining them in creative ways in a multimedia slide presentation. 
Using a translation algorithm to produce a first draft of a document in a different language, then manually improving the style and grammar of the final document.
Driving a car to an unknown destination using a smartphone GPS application to navigate through alternative routes based on real-time traffic information;
Relying on a movie-streaming platform to shortlist films you are going to appreciate based on your recent history; making the final choice based on mood, social context, serendipity.

Netflix is a great example of this collaboration at its best. By using machine-learning algorithms to analyse how often and how long people watch their content, they can determine how engaging each story component is to certain audiences. This information is used by screenwriters, producers and directors to better understand what and how to create new content. Virtual-reality technology allows content creators to experiment with different storytelling perspectives before they ever shoot a single scene. 
Likewise, architects can rely on computers to adjust the functional aspects of their work. Software engineers can focus on the overall systems structure while machines provide ready-to-use code snippets and libraries to speed up the process. Marketers rely on big data and visualisation tools to determine how to better understand customer needs and develop better products and services. None of these tasks could be accomplished by AI without human guidance. Conversely, human creativity and productivity have been enormously leveraged by this AI support, allowing to achieve better quality solutions at lower costs.
Losses and gains
As innovation accelerates, thousands of jobs will disappear, just as it has happened in the previous cycles of industrial revolutions. Machines powered by narrow AI algorithms can already perform certain 3D tasks (“dull, dirty and dangerous”) much better than humans. This may create enormous pain for those who are losing their jobs over the next few years, particularly if they don’t acquire the computer-related skills that would enable them to find more creative opportunities. We must learn from the previous waves of creative destruction if we are to mitigate human suffering and increasing inequality. 
For example, some statistics indicate that as much as 3% of the population in developed countries work as drivers. When automated cars become a reality in the next 15 to 25 years, we must offer people who will be “structurally unemployed” some sort of compensation income, training and re-positioning opportunities.
Fortunately, the Schumpeterian waves of destructive innovation also create jobs. History has shown that disruptive innovations are not always a zero-sum game. On the long run, the loss of low-added-value jobs to machines can have a positive impact in the overall quality of life of most workers. The ATM paradox is a good example of this. As the use of automatic teller machines spread in the 1980s and ‘90s, many predicted massive unemployment in the banking sector. Instead, ATMs created more jobs as the cost of opening new agencies decreased. The number of agencies multiplied, as did the portfolio of banking products. Thanks to automation, going to the bank offers a much better customer experience than in previous decades. And the jobs in the industry became better paid and were of better quality. 
A similar phenomenon happened with the textile industry in the 19th century. Better human-machine coordination leveraged productivity and created customer value, increasing the overall market size and creating new employment opportunities. Likewise, we may predict that as low-quality jobs continue to disappear, AI-assisted jobs will emerge to fulfil the increasing demand for more productive, ecological and creative products. More productivity may mean shorter work weeks and more time for family and entertainment, which may lead to more sustainable forms of value creation and, ultimately, more jobs. 
Adapting to the future
This optimist scenario assumes, however, that education systems will do a better job of preparing our children to become good at what humans do best: creative and critical thinking. Less learning-by-heart (after all, most information is one Google search away) and more learning-by-doing. Fewer clerical skills and more philosophical insights about human nature and how to cater to its infinite needs for art and culture. As Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs famously said:

“What made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.” 




Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs.


To become creative and critical thinkers, our children will need knowledge and wisdom more than raw data points. They need to ask “why?”, “how?” and “what if?” more often than “what?”, who?“ and ""when?”  And they must construct this knowledge by relying on databases as cognitive partners as soon as they learn how to read and write. Constructivist methods such as the “flipped classroom” approach are a good step in that direction. In flipped classrooms, students are told to search for specific contents on the web at home and to come to class ready to apply what they learned in a collaborative project supervised by the teacher. Thus they do their “homework” (exercise) in class and they have web “lectures” at home, optimising class time to do what computers cannot help them to do: create, develop and apply complex ideas collaboratively with their peers.
Thus, the future of human-machine collaboration looks less like the scenario in the Terminator movies and more like a Minority Report-style of “augmented intelligence”. There will be jobs if we adapt the education system to equip our children to do what humans are good at: to think critically and creatively, to develop knowledge and wisdom, to appreciate and create beautiful works of art. That does not mean it will be a painless transition. Machines and automation will likely take away millions of low-quality jobs as it has happened in the past. But better-quality jobs will likely replace them, requiring less physical effort and shorter hours to deliver better results. At least until artificial general intelligence becomes a reality – then all bets are off. But this will likely be our great-grandchildren’s problem.

In a lot of cases, the A.I.s can do the work of 1,000 interns.” “A.I. is the new electricity. About 100 years ago, here in the United States, the rise of electrification transformed every major industry.” “There’s nothing artificial about it. After all, A.I. is made by humans, intended to behave like humans, and ultimately, to impact human lives and human society.” “It’s usually not true that technology change eliminates work. It changes work. So, I think our objective has to be to make sure that we have education systems that can take care of people who thought they were going to be doing one thing for a very long time, and now have to figure out how to do something else.” “I think a universal basic income is inevitable. I just don’t think it’s inevitable soon.” “A lot of emerging technologies in the U.S. are currently being powered, and continue to be powered, by artificial intelligence. And for us, it’s key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles.” “The American products are simply uncompetitive in the China market. And I mean uncompetitive both in not localized right for the local needs, and also just on a product to product, feature per feature level not competitive.” “I think from a society perspective, we have to not fight it. We have to embrace it. As Jim was talking about China, what struck me is China is investing billions of dollars a year into A.I., while the U.S. is still fighting to keep coal-fired power plants alive. There’s got to be something wrong with this picture, no, people?” “A lot of companies look to us, and the first question they ask us is do they trust us. In today’s world, especially in the tech world, I think that’s the first question that everybody asks. We’re in a crisis of trust.” “This is the most important thing we’re working on right now, which is just keeping the community safe, making sure that content that shouldn’t be on Facebook isn’t there. I honestly think if we didn’t have the advances in A.I., we’d be in — this would be hard to solve at the scale we’re operating at.” “I think that the road to making autonomous vehicles a reality might be shorter than most people think.” “And why is that?” “I think I know some things that aren’t publicly known.” “There will be speed bumps, but that can’t deter us from getting this right, because the world’s been waiting such a long time.” “So some of these big challenges that we have, climate change, things like that, now with A.I. and big data, we can put those together in a recipe that I think will have some very palpable impact in five years.”

The Future of A.I., in 3 Minutes2:38Leading innovators, investors and policymakers offered their visions for artificial intelligence at the New York Times's New Work Summit conference.CreditCredit...Mike Cohen for The New York TimesBy The New York TimesFeb. 12, 2018阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版See how this article appeared when it was originally published on NYTimes.com.In Phoenix, cars are self-navigating the streets. In many homes, people are barking commands at tiny machines, with the machines responding. On our smartphones, apps can now recognize faces in photos and translate from one language to another.Artificial intelligence is here — and it’s bringing new possibilities, while also raising questions. Do these gadgets and services really behave as advertised? How will they evolve in the years ahead? How quickly will they overhaul the way we live and change the way we do business?The Times is exploring these matters this week at our annual New Work Summit, featuring technology executives, A.I. researchers, investors and others. Here are some of the key moments coming out of the conference, plus a rundown of some of our recent A.I. stories. — Cade MetzHuawei still eager to do business in the United StatesA month after the Chinese electronics giant Huawei suffered a big setback in its quest to sell its high-end smartphones to Americans, the company’s chief for consumer devices, Richard Yu, said he was still optimistic about Huawei’s prospects in the United States.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We have won global consumers’ trust, in over 170 countries,” Mr. Yu said at the New Work Summit. “We very strictly protect consumers’ privacy.”Huawei is the world’s third-largest seller of smartphones and one of the planet’s biggest suppliers of telecommunications equipment. But it has struggled for years to break into the United States.A 2012 congressional report said that Huawei’s network gear could be used by Beijing to spy on Americans, effectively cutting the company off from big buyers in the United States. In January, after lawmakers reiterated those concerns in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, AT&T and Verizon walked away from deals to sell Huawei’s latest phones.At the conference on Tuesday, Mr. Yu said that Huawei had no ties to the Chinese government. “We are a globalized company, just headquartered in China,” he said. “We are not part of any government. We have to be a company that is independent from every country.”Huawei would not be able to do business in so many places around the world without that independence, he said. “If we do something for one government, we will lose the trust of all governments.” — Raymond ZhongAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow Facebook is using A.I. to fight troublemakersMike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, offered a glimpse of how the social network is applying artificial intelligence to ward off bad actors and keep its platform free of toxicity.Calling the fight against rules violators a “cat and mouse game,” Mr. Schroepfer said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that Facebook’s A.I. efforts had succeeded at certain types of content moderation, such as image classifier algorithms that find and automatically remove nude photos and videos.Now on Facebook, he said, “the vast majority of nudity and pornography reporting is automatic.”But what about using A.I. to curb the spread of fake news? Facebook’s director of artificial intelligence, Yann LeCun, said in 2016 that machine learning algorithms would one day be able to weed out false news on Facebook.But the company has since added thousands of human content moderators and struck partnerships with human fact-checking organizations. Mr. Schroepfer implied Facebook has learned that A.I. alone would not do the trick, given the sophistication of bad actors who find ways around the platform’s filters.Mr. Schroepfer also said that human judgment would be required in certain situations, like a comment (“nice jacket”) that could be either an earnest compliment or a sarcastic insult, depending on the context. And when it comes to some of Facebook’s thornier problems, like trying to enforce consistent hate speech policies, human intervention may always be necessary.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Whenever you are debating what your policy is, you’re unlikely to build an A.I. that works well for that,” he said. — Kevin RooseA call for regulators to stand downMichael Kratsios, a deputy chief technology officer at the White House, said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that regulators should get out of the way of advances in emerging technologies.He cited progress toward a repeal of some regulations on commercial drones, such as rules prohibiting them from flying at night.“For us, it’s key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles,” said Mr. Kratsios, who previously worked as chief of staff to Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist. These regulations, he said, are “putting us at a disadvantage.”Unlike some experts who believe China is poised to dominate the A.I. age, Mr. Kratsios said he wasn’t worried about overseas competition. The United States, he said, has a “30-year head start” in A.I. development.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnd despite the White House’s reputation for chaos and tumult, he maintained that it was “a great place to work.” — Kevin RooseImageMarc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, speaking Tuesday at The New York Times’s New Work Summit. His discussion, at the Ritz-Carlton in Half Moon Bay, Calif., was conducted by Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor at The Times.Credit...Mike Cohen for The New York TimesTech giants face a ‘crisis of trust’Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, blasted companies like Facebook on Tuesday for addicting children to their products and renewed his calls for more government regulation of the tech industry.Mr. Benioff compared a new Facebook Messenger product for children to candy cigarettes, which he used to pretend to smoke as a boy.“What do you think they were trying to get us to do with those?” Mr. Benioff asked onstage at the New Work Summit. “I don’t think this is any different now. They’re focused on the addictive nature of these user interfaces. At some point, we have to say, ‘Hold on.’”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSilicon Valley is nearing the point where moral lines will have to be drawn by the government since the industry is not regulating itself and does not seem to be guided by a “strong hand of ethics,” he said.There is a “crisis of trust,” he added, that will become a “tidal wave” among American consumers who are growing wary of tech giants.“I’m trying to protect our industry,” said Mr. Benioff, whose company sells access to business software over the internet. “If companies aren’t able to regulate themselves, they should have external regulations.”One of the solutions he suggested was to move decision-making away from algorithms and back toward humans. He cited Facebook’s decision to disband its trending news curation team as an example.“Facebook had a team promoting, sorting and focusing stories, 100 curators that they removed and put an algorithm in their place, and that started the downward spiral that they’re in today,” Mr. Benioff said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe also spoke about the recent ban on kegs of beer at Salesforce offices after he recently stumbled across one while visiting a company he had acquired.“I view alcohol as a drug,” he said. “The keg is not there anymore — well, actually who knows, but I hope it’s not. I took a photo of the keg and put it on our social network and said, ‘This is not who we are.’” — Nellie BowlesImageFei-Fei Li, a chief scientist at Google, stressed at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that artificial intelligence needed to enhance, not undercut, humanity.Credit...Mike Cohen for The New York TimesShould A.I. be more ‘human’?Fei-Fei Li, a chief scientist at Google and a Stanford professor, has called on technologists to take a more “human centered” approach to the creation of artificial intelligence. On Tuesday at the New Work Summit, Ms. Li said that researchers must work to ensure that A.I. embodied human qualities and that it would ultimately operate alongside humans, not replace them.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I often tell my students not to be misled by the name ‘artificial intelligence’ — there is nothing artificial about it,” she said. “A.I. is made by humans, intended to behave by humans and, ultimately, to impact humans lives and human society.”At Stanford, Ms. Li was instrumental in the recent rise of “computer vision” systems that can recognize people and objects entirely on their own. At Google, she is working to package and sell these and other systems as cloud computing services, delivering the latest A.I. technology to a wide range of businesses.But she said that as Google and other internet giants pushed these techniques forward, academia and the government must help ensure that A.I. evolved into something that enhanced our humanity, created as many jobs as it replaced and operated in safe and predictable ways.In particular, Ms. Li said, academic institutions can help ensure that computer scientists work alongside social scientists in building this new breed of technology.“A.I. has outgrown its origin in computer science,” she said.Ultimately, said Ms. Li, who was born in China, A.I. reflects the people who build it more than other technologies do. For that reason and others, she said, A.I. researchers must work in a way that spans not only many industries but many cultures as well.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I really believe there are no borders for science,” she said. — Cade MetzWhy American tech companies struggle in ChinaTuesday’s first speaker at the New Work Summit was Kai-Fu Lee, who used to lead Google in China and knows a thing or two about American tech giants in China. His prognosis about whether companies like Facebook will ever be able to crack the world’s largest internet market?“The American products are simply uncompetitive in the China market,” said Mr. Lee, who is now chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on Chinese technology. Even if internet titans from the United States could operate in China, he said, the local competition means they would have a hard time thriving.“Messenger is a much worse product than WeChat,” he said, referring to Facebook’s messaging app and Tencent’s ubiquitous app for chatting, social networking, making payments and other tasks.ImageA health care robot on display during the IFlyTek conference on A.I., held in Beijing in November.Credit...Giulia Marchi for The New York Times“Amazon in China is substantially worse than Taobao, JD and Tmall,” he said, referring to three leading Chinese e-commerce sites. And, he said, “Apple Pay is much narrower and much harder to use than WeChat or Alipay.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Lee sees other issues that augur against a big Facebook or Google renaissance in China. Multinational companies tend not to hire local managers to lead their China operations. “They’re not concerned about winning in the local market,” he said.Also, young Chinese these days would rather work for national champions like Alibaba or Tencent. Pitted against Chinese start-ups and big companies, where the hours tend to be long and the work culture cutthroat, the leading lights of American tech would get “get eaten for lunch.” — Raymond ZhongTrump administration silent on A.I.Last year, the Chinese government unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, vowing to create a domestic industry worth $150 billion. This manifesto read like a challenge to the United States, and in many ways it echoed policies laid down by the Obama administration in 2016.But as China pushes ahead in this area, many experts are concerned that the Trump administration is not doing enough to keep the United States ahead in the future. Although the big United States internet giants are leading the A.I. race, these experts believe the country as a whole could fall behind if does not do more to nurture research inside universities and government labs. — Cade MetzWaymo C.E.O. ‘really happy’ with Uber settlementJohn Krafcik, chief executive of the self-driving car company Waymo, took the stage at the New Work Summit on Monday night and spoke out for the first time since his company reached a settlement last week with Uber in a lawsuit over trade secrets that riveted Silicon Valley.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We were really happy with the outcome that we engineered,” Mr. Krafcik said. “We spent a lot of time in that case talking about the hardware, but the extra benefit we got from that suit was the ability to understand and ensure that Uber wasn’t using any of our software.”He called the software Waymo’s “secret sauce.”Waymo and Uber spent only four days at trial last week before settling, with Uber agreeing to provide Waymo 0.34 percent of its stock, worth about $245 million. The dispute between the companies started in 2016 when Uber bought Otto, a start-up founded by Anthony Levandowski, an early member of Google’s self-driving car program. Waymo, which was spun out of Google, accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing technology before leaving and accused Uber of using the misappropriated knowledge.“This was a really special case with a really special set of circumstances,” Mr. Krafcik said. “For us, this was always about, and really just about, the fact that we needed to ensure Uber wasn’t using our trade secrets.” He added that he did not foresee Waymo suing other former employees.Mr. Krafcik also discussed how Waymo was looking to start a ride-hailing service, which it is testing in Phoenix with thousands of driverless Pacifica minivans.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We have a plan to move from city to city,” he said. “We’re not going to be launching with a 25 mile-per-hour product. We’re talking about a full-speed service that will serve a very large geographic area with essentially unlimited pickup and drop-off points.” — Nellie BowlesNo, Amazon isn’t using A.I. to cut jobsJeff Wilke, Amazon’s chief executive of its consumer business, which includes its e-commerce operations, doesn’t often make public appearances. But on Monday night, he joined the New Work Summit to discuss the internet retailer’s move into artificial intelligence.His key message: A.I. is everywhere, but that doesn’t mean it will take our jobs.“If you look at the evolution of technology over the course of decades, tech doesn’t eliminate work; it changes work,” Mr. Wilke said.ImageJeff Wilke, the chief executive of Amazon’s consumer business, talked with Ms. Blumenstein on Monday about Amazon’s move into artificial intelligence.Credit...Mike Cohen for The New York TimesHe said that over the last five years, since Amazon bought a robot maker called Kiva Systems, it had built 100,000 of the robots — and also hired 300,000 people. “We still need human judgment,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmazon has also embedded A.I. throughout the company, he added, with technologists working together with people who run businesses. The company is using machine learning and deep learnings, which are different flavors of A.I., to upgrade internal algorithms, he said.As to how Amazon might use A.I. at Whole Foods, the grocery store chain that it said it would acquire last year, Mr. Wilke said little. When asked whether Amazon would integrate its cashier-less and A.I.-driven convenience store concept, called Amazon Go, with Whole Foods, he said, “I don’t foresee the format of Whole Foods changing very much.” — Pui-Wing TamA.I. has become a campaign issueAs A.I. technology barrels ahead in Silicon Valley, it’s also starting to pick up steam as a political issue in Washington.Over the weekend, I wrote about Andrew Yang, a former tech executive who has decided to run for president in 2020 as a Democrat on a “beware the robots” platform. He thinks that with innovations like self-driving cars and grocery stores without cashiers just around the corner, we’re about to move into a frightening new era of mass unemployment and social unrest.So he’s proposing a universal basic income plan called the “Freedom Dividend,” which would give every American adult $1,000 a month to guarantee them a minimum standard of living while they retrain themselves for new kinds of work.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Yang’s campaign is a long shot, and there are significant hurdles to making universal basic income politically feasible. But the conversation about automation’s social and economic consequences is long overdue. Even if he doesn’t win the election, Mr. Yang may have hit on the next big political wedge issue. — Kevin RooseArtificial intelligence may be biasedIn modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it, as Steve Lohr recently wrote, and that means that some of the biases in the real world can seep into A.I.ImageJoy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, found that a subject’s race and sex can affect the success of facial recognition software.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesIf there are many more white men than black women in the system, for example, it will be worse at identifying the black women. That appears to be the case with some popular commercial facial recognition software.Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, found that the software can now tell if a white man in a photograph is male or female 99 percent of the time.

In a lot of cases, the A.I.s can do the work of 1,000 interns.” “A.I. is the new electricity. About 100 years ago, here in the United States, the rise of electrification transformed every major industry.” “There’s nothing artificial about it. After all, A.I. is made by humans, intended to behave like humans, and ultimately, to impact human lives and human society.” “It’s usually not true that technology change eliminates work.

Getty ImagesChina consumers more than 40 million tonnes of pork a yearFor now, the trial is limited to the country's Sichuan province.Alibaba teamed up with local feed provider Sichuan Tequ and the farming group Dekon to develop the solution.It claims that it should on average lead a sow to rear three additional offspring a year, and reduce the death rate by 3%.The system is designed to maintain a profile of each animal, including details of their weight, age, food intake and exercise, among other details.Vision recognition software - which relies on a number tattooed onto each swine's side - is used to keep track of each pig.  The sounds of their squeals are analysed to try to determine if any of the young ones are at risk of being suffocated under their mothers' weight.The AI tech also listens out for coughs, which along with infrared temperature readings are used to act as an early warning system for disease outbreaks. This should help farmers know when to provide specialised vaccinations.Getty ImagesThe AI system can supposedly increase a piglet's chance of survival in its early weeksAnd when the technology detects a sow's productivity rate has fallen below the norm it suggests she is slaughtered.As China's meat consumption continues to rise, Tequ said the tech was necessary to help farmers keep track of their livestock.""If you have 10 million pigs to raise, you can barely count how many piglets were born on a daily basis when the due date comes,"" said chief information officer, Zhang Haifeng.Tag-freeChina's Synced Review news site has reported that tens of millions of pounds-worth of investment has been committed to the project, and a promotional campaign is already underway.

While the Twitter-sphere panics about a robot dog being able to open a door this week, we became fascinated with the idea of how graphic design can visualise artificial intelligence stylistically, particularly through the work of Prague-based designer Cindy Kutikova.
Cindy’s work regularly encompasses research and technology, combining her brilliant eye for layouts and a knack for typography. Her portfolio also regularly picks upon other areas of the creative industry, creating a graphic look that showcases the practice at hand. This approach is the case for her latest work, a visual identity for an exhibition by Umprum’s fashion design studio run by Pavel Ivančic (at the Academy of Arts in Prague), on the theme of AI. “Fashion design has always been a very interesting field to me, and I enjoyed my cooperation with the designers immensely,” Cindy tells It’s Nice That.
Umprum’s exhibition covers a range of thoughts around the topic of AI “from the perspective of millennials, a native digital generation that is naturally driven by responsibility and sustainability,” looking at multiple interests including “digital therapy, healthcare, gaming, wellbeing, social mapping, augmented reality and mixed reality”. In considering these different parts of AI, the exhibition serves as an opportunity for the students to display their “unique creative vision supported with relevant visual project descriptions including original methods, techniques and applications,” Cindy explains.
As a result, the designer’s visual identity for the exhibition incorporates particular students work displaying photographic visions or illustrated digital renders made by Jan Kolsky and Vojtěch Rada, of artificial intelligence. In terms of Cindy’s design choices, a futuristic graphic approach is applied in a colour palette of green, black and grey and blocked, impactful sans serif fonts in a contrasting white. By showcasing the student’s work featured on the posters advertising the exhibition, Cindy not only entices possible visitors but recognises “AI as a tool that can augment human perception and creativity and help us to become more human”.
Fashion is increasingly becoming a part of Cindy’s portfolio too, branching into editorial design for fashion designer Adam Kost and working with the Umprum students again on the visual identity for a curators choice of the best work. This year the exhibition will be hosted at the Applied Arts Museum in Prague and Cindy is excitingly working with another brilliant designer, Jiri Mocek, on the project too.AboveCindy Kutikova: Artificial IntelligenceAboveCindy Kutikova: Artificial IntelligenceAboveCindy Kutikova: Artificial IntelligenceAboveCindy Kutikova: Artificial IntelligenceAboveCindy Kutikova: Artificial IntelligenceAboveJak kolskyAbovePetr FaboAboveCindy KutikovaAboveCindy Kutikova: Adam KostThe LatestView more fromGraphic DesignThe View From LA: exploring the cultural impact of Boyz n the Hood, and its iconic title graphicsHow Figma built the identity for its mammoth design conference, ConfigStudio Chris Bolton’s identity for a Finnish shop is all about circlesHow do you craft a typeface that reflects a design studio?

To manufacture medicines, chemists must find the right combinations of chemicals to make the necessary chemical structures. This is more complicated than it sounds, as typical chemical reactions employ several different components, and each chemical involved adds another dimension to the calculations.
Derek Ahneman, a 2017 Ph.D. graduate, proposed using machine learning to model reaction yield while modifying four different reaction components, an exponentially more difficult endeavor than modifying one variable at a time. “At the outset, we knew there would be many challenges to overcome,” he said. “We weren’t sure it was even possible.”Photo byC. Todd Reichart, Department of Chemistry
In an ideal world, chemists would like to predict which combination of chemicals would deliver the highest yield of product and avoid unintended by-products or other losses, but predicting the outcome of these multi-dimensional reactions has proven challenging.

A group of researchers led by Abigail Doyle(link is external), the A. Barton Hepburn Professor of Chemistry(link is external) at Princeton University, and Spencer Dreher of Merck Research Laboratories, has found a way to predict reaction yields accurately while varying up to four reaction components by using an application of artificial intelligence known as machine learning. They have turned their method into software that they have made available to other chemists. They published their research Feb. 15(link is external) in the journal Science.
“The software that we developed is designed to accommodate any reaction or substrate type,” said Doyle. “The idea was to let someone apply this tool and hopefully build on it with other reactions.”
Vast resources and time are expended to make synthetic molecules, often in a largely ad hoc manner, she said. Using this new software, chemists can identify high-yielding combinations of chemicals and substrates more cheaply and efficiently. 
“We hope this will be a valuable tool in expediting the synthesis of new medicines,” said Derek Ahneman, who completed his chemistry Ph.D. in Doyle’s lab in 2017 and works for IBM.
“Many of these machine learning algorithms have been around for quite some time,” said Jesús Estrada(link is external), a graduate student in Doyle’s lab who contributed to the research and the paper. “However, within the synthetic organic chemistry community, we really haven’t tapped into the exciting opportunities that machine learning offers.”
“As chemists, we’ve traditionally veered away from multi-dimensional analysis,” said Doyle. “We only look at one variable at a time, or a single set of conditions for a range of substrates.”
When Ahneman told Doyle that he wanted to use machine learning to tackle the multi-dimensional problem, she encouraged him. “I always — especially for my most talented students — try to give them free rein in the last year of their Ph.D.,” she said. “This is the project he proposed to me.”
Doyle and Ahneman set out to model reaction yield while modifying four reaction components, an exponentially more difficult endeavor than modifying one variable at a time.
“At the outset, we knew there would be many challenges to overcome,” Ahneman said. “We weren’t sure it was even possible.”
Historically, one obstacle to developing multi-dimensional models has been collecting enough data on reaction yields to build an effective “training set,” he said. But recently, Merck has invented robotic systems that can run thousands of reactions on the order of days.
“I’m thrilled that the data we generated together was of very high quality, and they were able to create effective models,” said Dreher, a principal scientist with Merck’s Chemistry Capabilities and Screening division. “Hopefully we can continue to develop this approach and can reduce our dependence on screening to make the designed molecules we need to make much faster.”
Another challenge has been calculating quantitative descriptors for each chemical to use as inputs for the model. These descriptors have typically been calculated one by one, which would have been impractical for the large number of chemical combinations they wanted to use.
They overcame this limitation by writing code that used an existing program, Spartan, to calculate and then extract descriptors for each chemical used in the model.
Once they had their quantitative descriptors, they tried several statistical approaches. First, they used linear regression, the industry standard, but found that it failed to accurately predict reaction yield. They then explored multiple common machine learning models and found that one called “random forest” delivered startlingly accurate yield predictions.
A random forest model works by randomly selecting small samples from the training data set and using that sample to build a decision tree. Each individual decision tree then predicts the yield for a given reaction, and then the result is averaged across the trees to generate an overall yield prediction.
Another breakthrough came when the researchers discovered that with random forests, “reaction yields can be accurately predicted using the results of ‘only’ hundreds of reactions (instead of thousands), a number that chemists without robots can perform themselves,” Ahneman said.
“Professor Doyle and her collaborators have applied artificial intelligence in a clever way to solve a problem that is poorly handled by simple linear models,” said Julie Mitchell, a professor of mathematics and biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the research. “In chemical space, small changes can have dramatic results, and such phenomena are better captured by their random forest model.”
Doyle’s team also found that random forest models can predict yields for chemical compounds not included in the training set.
“The techniques used are completely state-of-the-art,” said Chloé-Agathe Azencott, a machine learning researcher at the Centre for Computational Biology of Paris Science and Letters University, who was not involved in this research. “The correlation plots in the paper are good enough that I think we can envision relying on these predictions in the future, which will limit the need for costly laboratory experiments.”
“These results are exciting, because they suggest that this method can be used to predict the yield for reactions where the starting material has never been made, which would help minimize the consumption of chemicals that are time-consuming to make,” Ahneman said. “Overall, this methodology holds promise for (1) predicting the yield for reactions using as-yet-unmade starting materials and (2) predicting the optimal conditions for a reaction with a known starting material and product.”
After Ahneman finished his degree, Estrada continued the research. The goal was to create software that was accessible not only to computer experts like Ahneman and Estrada but the broader synthetic chemistry community, said Doyle.
She explained how the software works: “You draw out the structures — the starting materials, catalysts, bases — and the software will figure out shared descriptors between all of them. That’s your input. The outcome is the yields of the reactions. The machine learning matches all those descriptors to the yields, with the goal that you can put in any structure and it will tell you the outcome of the reaction.
“The idea is to help people navigate the multi-dimensional space where you can’t intuit the outcomes,” said Doyle.
The paper, “Predicting reaction performance in C–N cross-coupling using machine learning(link is external)” by Derek Ahneman, Jesús Estrada, Shishi Lin, Spencer Dreher and Abigail Doyle, was published Feb. 15 in the journal Science. Financial support was provided by Princeton University, an Amgen Young Investigator Award and a Camille-Dreyfus Teacher Scholar Award.

Artificial Intelligence
Learning AI to stop the Terminator from taking your job

Tuesday, February 13, 2018










Richard Harris







Learning AI (artificial intelligence), machine learning, and other skills can help you as a programmer while technology marches into the 21st century.




For me the mention of AI and machine learning shoots my thoughts right into the “Terminator” movies, and the great struggle to maintain human existence in the year 2029. The film series is based around a giant AI computing superintelligence named “Skynet”, which is essentially in control of the entire Earth, and a legion of robots that want to destroy anything that threatens it’s existence.While it’s easy to toss AI and other tech into film imagination and the world of tomorrow, it’s equally as frightening to realize the ramifications it’s actually going to have on our every day lives. What it might look like to go to work in the morning, and how we spend our time earning a living. AI makes way for machine automation, which opens the door to a machine taking your job. But as a programmer, it’s easy to bunker yourself into the mindset of “I can’t be replaced”. To which I offer that in 2017 a Microsoft AI was able to write code on its own by stealing from other programs. And Google's Deepmind was able to mirror the way the human brain learns. It’s coming my fellow programmers, so you need to be ready.There has always been a lag in what we can learn, and what is trending in technology that’s already been applied somewhere, this week, or even this year. The curriculum and training just can’t keep up with the emergence of spectacular discoveries and uses for technology that seems to evolve overnight. They call this a “skills gap”, and it’s just a polite way of saying “I don’t know how to do that yet”.Companies are experiencing an acute skills gap in tech fields and are struggling to find qualified candidates that can not only provide the technical insights they need, but also have communications skills and high levels of creative problem-solving. Ongoing learning is necessary to keep from becoming irrelevant as the pace of change continues to accelerate. We recently had a conversation with P.K. Agarwal, who serves as the Dean and CEO of Northeastern University–Silicon Valley. He gives us some insight into the skills gap and AI, how machine automation is going to change the workforce, and what skills you likely need to be preparing for now to stay relevant.ADM: What type of skills gaps are you seeing in the workforce when it comes to AI?Agarwal: Finding enough qualified people to handle the new technological challenges of data science, machine learning/AI presents a data issue at its core. First, data must be handled ethically and in a socially meaningful context that understands the humanity of us all. However, to accomplish this you must be a change agent. Secondly, you need to hire candidates that possess the latest skills for AI programming. Therefore, hiring data scientists and experts in machine learning/AI presents a special challenge of unearthing an individual with a hard STEM exterior, yet also with a soft relational center.ADM: How do you think machine automation and AI will change the way we need to educate the workforce?Agarwal: The elimination of repeatable and predicable tasks due to AI and machine learning presents an opportunity for us in the education business. We are also on the cusp of a major change in our workforce. The elimination of many job classes means that we have the possibility to reshape our workloads and potentially shift to a more rewarding work/life balance moving forward. Every challenge also presents an opportunity for growth and re-invention. As today’s workers meet these challenges, it is refreshing that industry leaders are re-imagining the role of education within the workplace, rather than apart from it.ADM: In what ways can we help employees to ensure that they won’t lose their jobs to automation?Agarwal: We can’t guarantee that any one particular job title won’t be lost to automation, but we can teach skills that are transferable to other occupations. By focusing on skills like critical thinking, communication, and collaboration, we can ensure that for dedicated employees, when one door closes, another will surely be open to them.ADM: What opportunities are out there for highly skilled professionals to sharpen their skills or learn a new skill set?Agarwal: There are many new opportunities for employees looking to bolster their skills. Boot camps, advanced degrees and micro-credential programs are all great ways for professionals to enhance their knowledge and learn the latest new developments. Many of these programs are offered online or during the evening so that full-time employees can participate on their own time.P.K. Agarwal, Dean and CEO of Northeastern University-Silicon ValleyADM: What skills are most important for the 21st century workforce?Agarwal: We’re seeing today that transferable skills are even more in-demand than many technical skills. In a Northeastern University-Silicon Valley survey last summer, we found remarkable insights about the skills gap challenge. 38% of those surveyed stated that data aggregation and analysis ranked as the biggest challenge. Surprisingly, the career strength chosen as most relevant for success was the need for communications skills, including an ability to explain ideas or concepts clearly and effectively. As technical jobs rapidly change, the ability to learn new skills and adapt tend to be more important than specific technical know-how. Emotional intelligence, people management, negotiation skills and creativity are becoming more important as we embrace new technological changes.ADM: Do you think recent graduates are being well prepared for the new reality that is AI?Agarwal: Some students are obviously being better prepared than others. Clearly having an up-to-date curriculum on the latest technologies is a big differentiator, however, the ones who will be successful in this disruptive transition are those who are genuinely curious and have learned how to learn, i.e., adapted a lifelong learning model. Combine this lifelong learning attitude with a good dose of soft skills, you have a student who most employable students in the future. About P.K. AgarwalP.K. Agarwal serves as the Dean and CEO of Northeastern University–Silicon Valley. He also serves as the Chairman of Future 500, a Bay Area-based pioneer in the area of global sustainability. Formerly, he was the CEO of TiE Global, an organization dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship across 61 cities in 18 countries. Prior to TiE, P.K served as Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Chief Technology Officer for the State of California. He has also been in executive and management roles with ACS (now Xerox), NIC Inc., and EDS (now HP). PK helped pioneer the use of Internet in government and shaped the national and state policy in this area, dating back to Al Gore’s National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council in 1995. He had the unique distinction of having a U.S. national annual award named as the “P.K. Agarwal Award for Leadership in Electronic Government.” He also served as the president of the National Association of State CIOs and the National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council (ec3). He is a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration and an adjunct faculty at USC and USF.

Chinese iPhone manufacturer Foxconn plans to slash more than 10,000 jobs this year as part of an aggressive robot takeover. Innolux, Foxconn’s LCD-display arm is said to bear the brunt of the lost jobs. According to Honorary Chairman Tuan Hsing-Chien:
We will reduce our total workforce to less than 50,000 people by the end of this year, from the 60,000 staff at the end of 2017.
This just days after Foxconn Chairmain Terry Gou reported the company would invest some $342 million into processes and equipment to make better use of artificial intelligence in its manufacturing process.
Innolux doesn’t supply Apple with LCD displays, but the cuts would affect a number of customers, including Samsung, Dell, HP, LG, Hitachi, and Sharp (among others).
While manufacturing in China has grown more expensive in recent years, it’s still one of the cheapest places to manufacture and assemble hardware. Workers at Foxconn, on average, earn about $400 a month and often work 12 hour shifts. The idea that robots can serve as a cost-effective replacement for some of the cheapest human labor on the planet just goes to show the impact AI will have on laborers in the coming years.

It outlined the Chinese government’s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country’s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission — an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.The manifesto was also remarkably similar to several reports on the future of artificial intelligence released by the Obama administration at the end of 2016.“It is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,” said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China’s work on artificial intelligence. “The U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China’s national A.I. strategy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut six months after China seemed to mimic that Obama-era road map, A.I. experts in industry and academia in the United States say that the Trump White House has done little to follow through on the previous administration’s economic call to arms.“We are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction” on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.China’s embrace of A.I. comes at a crucial time in the development of the technology and just as the lead long enjoyed by the United States has started to dwindle.For decades, artificial intelligence was more fiction than science. In the past few years, however, dramatic improvements have prompted some of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit — and China — to invest billions on everything from self-driving cars to home appliances that can have a conversation with a human.A.I. has also become a significant part of national defense policy as military leaders and ethicists debate how much autonomy we should give to weapons that can think for themselves.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmerican companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.ImageDoctors at the radiology department of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital in China use an A.I. system to view CT scans as a way to diagnose lung cancers early on.Credit...Yue Wu for The New York TimesTo China’s growing tech community, driving the industry’s next big thing — a mantra of Silicon Valley — is becoming a tantalizing possibility.“Thanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful — if not the most powerful — A.I. countries in the world,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump’s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration’s approach to A.I. were unfounded.“Artificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,” he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios’s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.“The key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,” he said. “The White House is a convener and a coordinator.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China’s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to “train” A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.ImageGeoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist and leading expert in artificial intelligence, has helped make the University of Toronto a center of innovation in A.I. technology.Credit...Aaron Vincent Elkaim for The New York TimesArtificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of “deep learning,” the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.“We may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don’t have a central national strategy,” said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive. “It is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.”The Trump administration’s budget for 2018 aims to cut science and technology research funding across the government by 15 percent, according to a report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“They are headed in precisely the wrong direction,” said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P’s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. “That is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.”Over the past five years, much of the progress in A.I. technology has been led by American companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. But these companies don’t need A.I. technologists to work in the United States in order to employ them.Take Geoffrey Hinton, a major figure in the rise of A.I. at Google and across the tech industry. He recently moved back to Toronto, where he was a professor for many years. He now runs a new Google lab in that city. Last year, he took on an Iranian researcher who was denied a visa by the United States government.Google operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris. And Amazon is opening a lab in Germany.Inside these facilities, researchers still create technology for their American employers. As the labs grow and the products get better, some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle’s and Microsoft’s work in China has already led to Chinese start-ups like Malong, which is building image recognition systems, and a major A.I. investment fund run by Mr. Lee.“When it is close to you, something like Microsoft Research has real economic value,” said Mr. Clark, of OpenAI.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 13, 2018, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: China’s Blitz to Dominate A.I..

During the 2018 World Government Summit in Dubai this week, Google X co-founder Sebastian Thurn stated that artificial intelligence innovations would usher in an era of “superhuman” workers who are capable of doing far more work than what is conventionally possible. 
Thurn asserted that AI-based solutions, no matter how advanced, are tools designed to augment the productivity of humans. Thus, instead of rendering human workers obsolete, AI would likely help humans achieve greater work efficiency. 
“AI is a tool and what AI can do really, really well is getting rid of repetitive work. So, if you are a worker, say a medical doctor or a lawyer who spends day in and day out doing the same thing, then having AI look over your shoulder and learn those skills from you will make you a superhuman, a more powerful person,” he said, according to a Futurism report. 

Thurn, however, did admit that some trades in the workforce are bound to be adversely affected by the incoming AI revolution. The Google X executive believes that this change would present an opportunity for humanity to transition into a creative society. 
“Now, that means that some jobs will go away, very repetitive work, of course. But it will be replaced by created work, so we have to move from a repetitive working society into a creative society where we invent new things,” he said. 
The Google X co-founder’s optimistic outlook mirrors that of futurist Ray Kurzweil, who issued equally optimistic expectations for AI during a discussion held at the Council of Foreign Relations last November. During his talk, Kurzweil stated that artificial intelligence has the potential to “enhance” humanity. 
“My view is not that AI is going to displace us. It’s going to enhance us. It does already,” Kurzweil said. 
The idea of AI-powered technologies becoming mainstream has become a particularly tricky issue among many notable voices in the scientific field, with individuals such as physicist Stephen Hawking and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk issuing warnings about the dangers of unregulated AI solutions. For Musk, the race towards AI superiority among the world’s superpowers would likely be the trigger for a global armed conflict. Other critics of AI believe that intelligent technologies would be the end of entry-level jobs as we know it. 
If the Google X co-founder’s viewpoints are proven right, however, a lot of these reservations and fears are unwarranted. 
Considering that artificial intelligence has the potential to be both beneficial and detrimental to society, a number of AI-based initiatives have been started over the past few years. Among these is OpenAI, a research firm co-founded by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk that aims to ensure that bleeding edge AI is used for the benefit of society as a whole. As we stated in a previous report, OpenAI has recently increased its hiring efforts, seemingly as a way to further its push to build safe, intelligent solutions.

AI will foster an era of ‘superhuman’ workers, says Google X founder

Finding a new job can be a job unto itself: perfecting a resume, scanning career websites, networking among friends and acquaintances—the dizzying amount of work can turn the excitement of a new career chapter into anxiety. Job searches of the future are going to be a completely different experience, with technology doing most of the heavy lifting.

Conversations with several figures in the field of job search and recruitment—representing behemoths in the industry and smaller players—revealed a job-hunt landscape that will look very different just a few years from now. Though their approaches to matching worker and employer may differ, all agreed that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning would streamline the complexity of matching work to talent and that the job search and recruiting experience of the future will involve more face time and less resume spamming.
The Job Board
About 65% of people look for new jobs within 91 days of being hired at a job—which suggests matchmaking in the search for work may be less than perfect, says Raj Mukherjee, senior vice president of product for Indeed.com, the job search platform that operates in more than 50 countries and has about 200 million visitors to its site per month.
PROMOTED
Those imperfections can only be fixed with data—and lots of it. The sheer amount of information on job skills, salaries and user tendencies makes matching people to positions simply impossible without using AI to crunch the numbers. “We’re generating roughly 25 terabytes of data every single day,” says Mukherjee, “and as we do that the data becomes the foundation of how we use AI and machine learning to improve the experience that job seekers get.”

AI and machine-learning allow services like Indeed to make predictive assessments of factors such as what a salary should be. Calculations hone in on what wages would be appropriate for a particular job, in a specific location, or at a specific company. Exact job title also comes into play.
Indeed’s AI also pulls information from resumes for recruiters using something called natural-language processing, which involves extracting relevant words and phrases from text using computer programs. This is tricky because text data can be relatively unstructured. “It would look at a sentence and try to make sense of that sentence,” says Mukherjee. “It would sort things that the sentence implies.” Listed skills on a job seeker’s resume would be recognized and set aside, he explained, as would companies worked for, years of experience and other elements. This information would then be compiled to make it easier for recruiters to evaluate.

As for the future, Mukherjee says job seekers will likely see a reduction in their research time while looking for work. As AI and machine-learning develop in the field, a service like Indeed should be able to suggest new, much more compatible opportunities based on a job seekers’ work experience, skills, salary, interests and location. A career-focused AI should also tell job seekers whether they are being paid fairly at their current job, with a high degree of accuracy, compared to others in their line of work.
For recruiters, says Mukherjee, weeding out incompatible talent is key. That means gauging skills at the outset, which would require testing on a job search platform—saving time for both recruiter and job seeker.
Skills Above All
Skills testing is also the centerpiece for CodeFights, a four-year-old San Francisco-based firm that offers tech workers a platform on which to practice their coding skills and to use those skills—which are scored and rated on the CodeFights platform. They can connect with prospective employers, who also use the company specifically to find prospective hires. This system of skills-based recruiting opens doors for programmers based largely on their proven talents and offers recruiters a definitive look at what a prospective hire can actually do.
For Tigran Sloyan, CodeFights’ co-founder and CEO, looking for work is a classic matchmaking scenario, similar to ones being facilitated in the transportation market by Uber and in the hotel and short-term rental space by Airbnb. But in the effort to connect workers and employers, complexities abound. There are so many data points to consider: skills, salaries, location, personality, experience, company culture, inaccuracies in resumes or job descriptions. “The more objective data we introduce in technical recruiting—and in recruiting overall—the better all of us will be,” says Sloyan.

Sloyan foresees that job search platforms or services will ultimately become education hubs, offering skills-building services that also rate proficiency, making it easier for job-seekers to prove their quality to recruiters, with whom they would be matched. “Eventually there will be a company that’s teaching the entire world,” says Sloyan. “A company that’s teaching the entire world is doing assessments on a vast scale, and you cannot compete with that kind of company as purely a recruiting company.”
A Layer Of Testing
Assessing skills specific to various industries is the name of the game for Harver, a five-year-old firm based in Amsterdam. Its specialty is having job applicants go through a testing process—chosen by hiring companies—that gauges whether they are a good match for a given position. The firm has made deals with Netflix, Booking.com, OpenTable and Zappos.

Harver, Barend Raaff





“A lot of people apply for jobs and they don’t have any clue what the job is really like,” says Barend Raaff, Harver’s founder and CEO. It’s also impossible to predict whether someone would stay in the job and do it proficiently, he added. The firm designs algorithms and testing processes with recruiting clients to predict a good match for a job. Harver began by focusing on high-volume job sectors like call centers and customer-facing roles, and has now begun catering to smaller companies’ recruitment needs. Through the application and testing process, job applicants get a sense of what to expect from a job, and Raaff says that in the future if an applicant is rejected for a job, Harver will suggest positions at other organizations for which he or she is better suited.
Raaff also says the role of recruiter will become easier as the means to gauge talent will be far more robust. The human element, he noted, will still be needed to make the final decision on hiring. “Surgeons 50 years ago had an X-ray picture, and based on an X-ray picture they decided if they would operate,” he explained. Today they have the means to gather greater levels of data on what ails their patients, but the big decisions are still made by humans. “They make the call whether they will operate or not. In recruitment we are heading in the same direction.”
A Deeper Knowledge Equals Efficiency 
At Linkedin, AI is used to sift through job-seeker and recruiter data alike, as well as information on the company’s 500 million-plus registered users, says John Jersin, senior director of product management for the company. “We’ve seen efficiency improvements upwards of 50% in our core products for recruiting already—the number of interactions that it takes to find a candidate that engages in the process, or reaches a certain stage, or find a candidate that gets hired.”
Still, today job and talent search is inefficient, says Jersin: seekers must send out many applications to find a position and recruiters must sort through a high volume of candidates before finding one that is a fit. “The work on AI that we’re doing helps us better understand what ‘fit’ actually means in a way that we can predict it,” notes Jersin. “If we can predict it, we can make the right matches faster and the wrong matches less often.”
In the future, says Jersin, job seekers and recruiters will spend less time on the drudgery of the job market and more time in face-to-face meetings—that is, on both sides, the ideal outcome—largely because AI and machine learning will make matching more efficient. But, says Jersin, there are elements to a job search that are simply incalculable by artificial intelligence. “The thing that will always matter is whether that place clicks for them on an emotional level, whether that job gives them the feeling that they are fulfilled, and whether the people there are the kind of people that they want to work with.”Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Send me a secure tip. Karsten StraussI am a New York City-based journalist and staff writer for Forbes Magazine and Forbes.com covering entrepreneurship and franchising.

In 2020, artificial intelligence will create 2.3 million jobs and eliminate 1.8 million jobs, according to Gartner.The number of jobs affected by AI will vary by industry, and 2019 will see a growing demand for jobs in healthcare, the public sector and education, while manufacturing will be hit with job losses. By 2020, AI-related job creation will cross into positive territory, reaching two million net-new jobs in 2025, the analyst's Predicts 2018: AI and the Future of Work report found.Alibaba CEO declares artificial intelligence and robots 'will kill our jobs' What is AI?Warnings about AI's impact on the economy are constantly in the news, and University of Oxford researchers have predicted that 35% of UK jobs are at risk of automation over the next two decades. But Gartner's findings suggest that AI could also improve the productivity of many roles.""Many significant innovations in the past have been associated with a transition period of temporary job loss, followed by recovery ... business transformation and AI will likely follow this route,"" said Svetlana Sicular, research vice president at Gartner.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITPro""Unfortunately, most calamitous warnings of job losses confuse AI with automation. That overshadows the greatest AI benefit: AI augmentation - a combination of human and artificial intelligence, where both complement each other.""For IT leaders, however, the focus shouldn't simply be on the potential increase in jobs. When considering investment in AI-enabled technologies, they must also consider which jobs will be lost, which will be created and how the technology will transform how employees work on a day-to-day basis. Gartner has previously underlined that CIOs will be responsible for choosing which tasks AI perform, and how it can help human workers.The analyst firm has also predicted that by 2022, one in five workers engaged in non-routine tasks will rely on AI to perform certain jobs. AI has already been applied to highly repeatable tasks, where large volumes of data can be analysed for patterns. But applying AI to less routine work that is more varied will soon start yielding benefits.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

K. Daron Acemoglu, the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics at MIT, is a leading thinker on the labor market implications of artificial intelligence, robotics, automation, and new technologies. His innovative work challenges the way people think about how these technologies intersect with the world of work. In 2005, he won the John Bates Clark Medal, an honor shared by a number of Nobel Prize recipients and luminaries in the field of economics. 
Acemoglu holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from University of York. His master’s degree in mathematical economics and econometrics and doctorate in economics are from the London School of Economics. With political scientist James Robinson, Acemoglu co-authored the much discussed book “Why Nations Fail” (Crown Business, 2012) and “Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy” (Cambridge University Press, 2006). He also wrote the book, “Introduction to Modern Economic Growth” (Princeton University Press, 2008). Acemoglu recently answered a few questions about technology and work.
Q: How do we begin to understand the rise of artificial intelligence and its future impact on society?
A: We need to look to the past in the face of modern innovations in machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, and beyond. The process of machines replacing labor in the production process is not a new one. It's been going on pretty much continuously since the Industrial Revolution. Spinning and weaving machines took jobs away from spinners and weavers. One innovation would follow another, and people would be thrown out of work by a machine performing the job in a cheaper way.
But at the end of the day, the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath created much better opportunities for people. For much of the 20th century in the U.S., workers’ wages and employment kept growing. New occupations and new tasks and new jobs were generated within the framework of new technological knowledge. A huge number of occupations in the American economy today did not exist 50 years ago — radiologists, management consultants, software developers, and so on. Go back a century and most of the white-collar jobs today did not exist.
Q:  Do you think public fears about the future of work are just?
A: The way we live continuously changes in significant ways — how we learn, how we acquire food, what we emphasize, our social organizations.
Our adjustments to technology — especially transformative technologies — are not a walk in the park. It is not going to be easy and seamless and just sort itself out. A lot of historical evidence shows the process is a painful one. The mechanization of agriculture is one of the greatest achievement of the American economy but it was hugely disruptive for millions of people who suffered joblessness.
At the same time, we are capable technologically and socially of creating many new jobs that will take people to new horizons in terms of productivity and freedom from the hardest types of manual labor. There are great opportunities with artificial intelligence but whether or not we exploit them is a different question. I think you should never be too optimistic but neither should you be too pessimistic.
Q: How do you suggest people prepare for the future job market?
A: We are very much in the midst of understanding what sort of process we are going through. We don’t even necessarily know what skills are needed for the jobs of the future.
Imagine one scenario. Artificial intelligence removes the need for seasoned accountants to fulfill numeracy-related tasks. But we need tax professionals, for instance, to inform clients about their choices and options in some sort of empathetic human way. They will have to become the interface between the machines and the customers. The jobs of the future, in this instance and many others, would require communications, flexibility, and social skills.
However, I don't know if my hypothesis is true because we haven't tested it. We haven't lived through it. I see the biggest void in our knowledge. People at institutions like MIT must learn more about what is going on so that we are better prepared to understand the future.

The EconomistWhile examining the impact of aging societies on growth, The Economist cites a new study co-authored by Prof. Daron Acemoglu, which shows that “when young workers are sufficiently scarce, manufacturers invest in more automation, and experience faster productivity growth as a result.”











Full story via The Economist →
QuartzIn a new working paper, Prof. Daron Acemoglu and his co-author argue that the rise in automation is linked to the aging of the blue-collar population. “The study shows that workers feeling the brunt of automation in lost jobs and lower wages are between the ages of 36 and 55. Those findings should make it easier for policy makers to track down the most affected workers—and help them survive the robot rush,” writes Ana Campoy for Quartz.

It is estimated 236m jobs in China, 120m in India and 73m in the US are going to be eliminated by 2030 (McKinsey Global Institute, 2017) due to the rise of automated activities. Indeed, artificial intelligence and internet of things combined will inevitably eliminate many workforces around the world whereas technology develops. However, there are also plenty of new opportunities being created out of it, data labeling is just one of them.Data labeling is the manual curation of data by humans on machine learning and AI applications. Labeling data is essential because computers have innumerable limitations, and some of them cannot be simply solved without human intervention. Actually, a computer can be programmed to perform hard calculations and automate activities that would be too burdensome to be done manually by us, however the same is unable to tell the difference between a car from a dog in a picture without proper training. In summary, computers use an algorithm to learn based in a dataset, what usually requires the supervision of someone. Roughly we call it supervised machine learning because computers need human supervision to get trained to execute tasks that are tricky for machines, but definitely easy for humans such as image recognition. Hence the need for a data labeler.The workload to train a machine can be endless. Imagine you want to train a model to detect dogs on the street but since dogs can vary greatly in size, color, and shape depending on their breed, you need first of all to make sure that your model will neither present high incidence of false positives nor false negatives. Get in mind, when working in complex real-life projects involving supervised machine learning, it can take weeks or even months to achieve the desired outcome.As programming skills aren’t a requirement initially, pretty much everyone can be a data labeler as far as the candidate enjoys technology and is willing to learn new tools. On top of that, the number of Data Labelers are expected to increase greatly in the upcoming years following the rise of AI and machine learning. Companies like IBM, Google, Facebook and many in the game industry and marketing are already recruiting new people to start immediately.Have you heard about data labeling before?

And",,,"The advancement that propelled artificial intelligence forward was to make it work more like human intelligence, through the use of neural networks. And deeper understanding of squishy brains could offer a lot more lessons for improving silicon brains, say MIT researchers. That’s the concept behind a new project called the MIT Intelligence Quest, which the university announced today.Intriguing is that it brings together researchers who study both human intelligence and artificial intelligence. The hope is that better understanding both of them will help develop new algorithms and techniques that can be used broadly. The mandate encompasses pretty much everything, including “disease diagnosis, drug discovery, materials and manufacturing design, automated systems, synthetic biology, and finance,” per a statement from the university. As per many big AI initiatives, curing cancer is also on the list of goals.Rather than a separate institute, Intelligence Quest will be a collaboration of researchers from across the university, such as the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines. It also includes not-so-usual suspects, such as the Sloan School of Management and the School of Architecture and Planning. This all builds on MIT’s collaboration with IBM Watson, announced in September 2017, says the university. IBM is known for overhyping and overpromising, especially in medicine. What’s unclear is whether an over-reliance on Watson-based technologies will close off others that might be better for some circumstances.advertisementRecognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

Artificial intelligence is the way of the future, and visiting lawyer KayFirth-Butterfield is helping shape that future through her work at the World Economic Forum. Mike Houlahan reports.
Artificial intelligence is hard to define, but it is affecting everyone’s lives already and will shape the world’s future, a visiting world leader in the field says.
""I think a lot of people don’t realise what we call narrow AI is already in their homes and computers,"" Ms Kay Firth-Butterfield said.
""I always say that AI is the engine of the fourth industrial revolution. For example, people talk a lot about the changes autonomous vehicles will bring, but you wouldn’t have autonomous vehicles without the underpinning of artificial intelligence.""
An English lawyer, Ms Firth-Butterfield has a background in both law and international relations.
In the United States she became a professor and helped set up AI Austin, a non-profit organisation which encourages practical and responsible design, development and use of Artificial Intelligence — machines which can learn and make decisions without human guidance.
Last September she was headhunted by the World Economic Forum, and now heads its artificial intelligence and machine learning project.
In that capacity she advises world leaders and business executives on AI issues; last week she was in Davos for the WEF’s annual winter meeting.
""It is an amazing privilege to be able to actually create projects that will hopefully make a difference,"" Ms Firth-Butterfield said.
""I’ve moved from thinking about things academically, to the non-profit and trying to make a difference on the ground, and now to actually be able to make a difference by running projects at a national and international level is a huge privilege and I’m delighted to be able to do it.""
Ms Firth-Butterfield calls her part of the WEF a ""do tank, not a think tank"".
It works with together with organisations and governments on AI regulation projects. Three months are spent on planning and scoping and nine months on creating the project.
""If we are working with a country there will also be six months of piloting the regulation or governance structure we have come up with, and if that works well we hope it will serve as a model for other governments.""
At the WEF’s San Francisco Centre of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Ms Firth-Butterfield’s AI and machine-learning team sits alongside seven other AI portfolios — blockchain, drones, autonomous vehicles, medicine, the environment, e-commerce and cross-border data flow, and the internet of things.
""All of us have our specific subject areas, but the cross-cutting themes of the work we are all doing is ethics and values and social inclusion,"" she said.Ads by Scroll Media0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemSeek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00 
""Whenever I look at a project I look at its impact on those three things.""
Like many thinkers in this area, Ms Firth-Butterfield and her team find themselves battling to keep up with developments in such a fast-moving field, and how to ensure accountability, transparency, bias and privacy concerns are considered as the use of AI expands.
Those creating these new technologies might not have thought of the ethical and legal implications of their work, and governments might not have considered how best to regulate the field.
Greater education about AI and its implications was needed at all levels, Ms Firth-Butterfield said.
""One of our concerns is that the average citizen doesn’t understand enough about artificial intelligence to actually play a proper part in regulation or governance of the technology,"" she said.
""I think we see that also among business leaders who don’t know enough about the way AI could impact their business, and also how it may impact the brand if they do their artificial intelligence incorrectly — by which I mean irresponsibly and not ethically.""
The regulation framework for artificial intelligence is pretty much a blank slate, with tools such as codes of conduct, protocols or global conventions few and far between.
""Not even around lethal autonomous weapons,"" Ms Firth-Butterfield said.
""I think AI will be of huge  benefit to humanity, but I absolutely believe the time is now for us to be mitigating the negative consequences.
""We need to go forward, but also understand the challenges as well.""
While in New Zealand Ms Firth-Butterfield paid a visit to the University of Otago’s AI project.
The Dunedin-based, Law Foundation-funded initiative might seem light years away from the presidents, prime ministers and CEOs Ms Firth-Butterfield usually deals with, but she said national projects such as the one in Otago were vital for the development of a worldwide framework for the implementation of ethical AI.
""AI has its own specific challenges and benefits, and countries need to analyse those and say how will this work for us.
""Each country  needs to create its own artificial intelligence strategy ... and create its own centres of AI excellence, because at that point it will be possible to join in the global conversation.""

Ms Firth - Butterfield is a thinker. Al do not, and will not, think. They are programmed and initiated by human beings. The quality of human intelligence, or lack of it, will determine the future.

""It is often the case that AI systems don't merely reach human levels of performance but significantly surpass it.  ""It is troubling, but necessary, to consider the implications of superhuman hacking, surveillance, persuasion, and physical target identification, as well as AI capabilities that are subhuman but nevertheless much more scalable than human labour.""Dr Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh, executive director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and one of the co-authors, added: ""Artificial intelligence is a game changer and this report has imagined what the world could look like in the next five to 10 years. ""We live in a world that could become fraught with day-to-day hazards from the misuse of AI and we need to take ownership of the problems - because the risks are real. ""There are choices that we need to make now, and our report is a call to action for governments, institutions and individuals across the globe.""For many decades hype outstripped fact in terms of AI and machine learning. No longer. This report looks at the practices that just don't work anymore - and suggests broad approaches that might help: for example, how to design software and hardware to make it less hackable - and what type of laws and international regulations might work in tandem with this.""The 100-page report identified three areas - digital, physical and political - in which the malicious use of AI is most likely to be exploited.Contributors included OpenAI, a non-profit research firm, digital rights group The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for a New American Security, a national security think-tank.Would you care if this feature had been written by a robot?",http://schema.org,,ReportageNewsArticle,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Jane Wakefield'}]",2018-02-21T00:19:13.000Z,2018-02-21T00:19:13.000Z,"AI ripe for exploitation, experts warn","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/104C8/production/_100106766_robotai.gif'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43127533,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43127533,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/104C8/production/_100106766_robotai.gif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

saving, according to a PwC India report * 68% of Indian business decision-makers believe AI will help their business in various ways such as boosting productivity, generating growth and addressing societal issues * 65% of participants agreed that AI is likely to have a severe impact on employment in India TO OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES A majority believed the benefits outweigh any employment concerns, as AI will open up opportunities for people to do more value-added work, apart from allowing for greater flexibility and work-life balance FOCUS AREAS * Given that AI integration requires significant time and investment, organisations would do well to prioritise those areas that could be automated with relative ease and with ready availability of data * Companies should also focus on areas which would provide the most tangible and immediate returns in terms of improved efficiency, cost savings and customer reach COST CHALLENGES * AI growth and adoption are wholly dependent on overcoming challenges related to reducing costs, securing the right talent and data, and addressing concerns around privacy and trust * The market reality we exist in currently demands that we not only work towards upskilling our people, but also produce the smartest machines that can work with us * The government is studying the use of AI through different platforms. In the Budget 2018-19, finance minister Arun Jaitley said that Niti Aayog would set up a national programme to direct efforts in research and development of different AI applications.

A change that is creating more productive and efficient work environments but is also causing professions and career models to morph, talent gaps to widen, and making it more difficult to find and retain right-fit employees. As advances in artificial intelligence (AI), automation, mobility and the nature of work evolve at the workplace, talent acquisition and retention — already one of the biggest challenges companies face — will become more important than ever.The good news is many of these technologies, especially AI, are also transforming the way we identify and hire talent, making the process more productive, efficient, and diverse.Though in its early stages, AI is already able to match job seekers with jobs, and in the near future, AI assistance will be crucial in helping companies retain employees and in helping individuals grow and meet their career aspirations.Impact of AI on the hiring processJob descriptions:In my last post, I commented on the prehistoric nature of job descriptions and resumes — how they are difficult to understand, one dimensional and often infused with human biases.Going forward, job descriptions and resumes will become more personalised and augmented with time-saving features. Job descriptions will highlight the elements of a job that are most interesting to a candidate’s personal preferences, promoting skill sets and experiences that will help attract the candidate’s attention. Then conversational “agents” — likely bots or automated systems that use human and machine input — will allow job seekers and employers to engage with each other earlier so they can rapidly understand each other’s needs.Sign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsThink about the opportunity afforded by having a chat button attached to a job description that allows a candidate to immediately ask questions about a job. Or one that allows an employer to ask detailed questions about a candidate’s experience. Not only will many questions be resolved at this stage, those that cannot will be routed to hiring managers for answers, and more importantly, be used to train the system for the future.Streamlining candidate skill evaluations:It is difficult to evaluate thousands of applications fairly and efficiently. Today, recruiters and hiring managers use schools, employers and work history on a candidate’s resume as indicators of fit and future performance.While there is value in knowing someone has spent years working on something that is relevant to the job at hand, the best way to demonstrate job competency or credibility is to be able to translate that experience into real life scenarios. This allows potential employers to see if a candidate can perform the duties of a position in a simulated work evaluation. Some examples:A software developer undertakes a graded coding exercise while interacting with future (or virtual) coworkers.A financial analyst develops a financial model and gets graded on a conversation about financial regulations and best practices.A bilingual technical support analyst is evaluated for speaking fluency, handling upset customers, and their ability to learn unfamiliar systems.These are typical situations in today’s interview processes but they currently use a lot of resources and are dependent on the interviewer’s skills. AI can augment resumes by automating these types of assessments. In doing so they can give hiring managers an unbiased ranking of potential candidates’ qualifications. Imagine a library of tens of thousands of assessments where a hiring manager can select a customised set of job competency simulations for a needed role. These customised evaluations can provide both parties with the transparency needed to find the right fit, while saving time for higher level human connections that can build trust between both parties and result in a high-confidence hire.Post-hire career planning:AI’s role doesn’t end when a job seeker accepts a job. Today’s workers expect to switch jobs at least several times over the course of a career.Studies show the newest generation in the workforce, millennials, switch jobs more frequently than previous generations. Companies would prefer those job changes be internal. AI can help employers map out an individual’s career path to ensure employees stay at their company. And AI algorithms, when given skill sets, performance, and desires, can even help employers know what to do to keep employees growing within their organisation.Likewise, AI can help the employee understand what to do now to ensure future career success. Imagine AI that notifies you when you should ask for a raise, clue you in to take a training course, or connect you with the right people to make your career aspirations come true.The future of job matching Matching technology is continuing to evolve — becoming more personalised, seamless and automated. However, accepting a job still requires the decision of the job seeker — a decision that is influenced by relationships, goals, and an individual’s definition of meaningful work. AI technology gives recruiters, companies and job seekers more time to focus on the human connections that build trust and inspire career development. In this way, AI is rapidly transforming the way we identify and hire talent and is headlong on the path towards becoming your career companion.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)Advertise with usartificialintelligenceWorkforcejob seekershiring processAI technologyAdvertise with usMOST VIEWED STORIES1NewsSimple Viral Games raises Rs 4 crore from WEH Ventures, PointOne Capital, others2In-focusInteligen wants to turn math fear into math love through games and activities 3FundingIdeaForge acquires non-controlling stake in spacetech startup GalaxEye

Imagine a library of tens of thousands of assessments where a hiring manager can select a customised set of job competency simulations for a needed role. These customised evaluations can provide both parties with the transparency needed to find the right fit, while saving time for higher level human connections that can build trust between both parties and result in a high-confidence hire.Post-hire career planning:> AI’s role doesn’t end when a job seeker accepts a job. Today’s workers expect to switch jobs at least several times over the course of a career.Studies show the newest generation in the workforce, millennials, switch jobs more frequently than previous generations. Companies would prefer those job changes be internal. AI can help employers map out an individual’s career path to ensure employees stay at their company. And AI algorithms, when given skill sets, performance, and desires, can even help employers know what to do to keep employees growing within their organisation.Likewise, AI can help the employee understand what to do now to ensure future career success. Imagine AI that notifies you when you should ask for a raise, clue you in to take a training course, or connect you with the right people to make your career aspirations come true.THE FUTURE OF JOB MATCHING Matching technology is continuing to evolve — becoming more personalised, seamless and automated. However, accepting a job still requires the decision of the job seeker — a decision that is influenced by relationships, goals, and an individual’s definition of meaningful work. AI technology gives recruiters, companies and job seekers more time to focus on the human connections that build trust and inspire career development. In this way, AI is rapidly transforming the way we identify and hire talent and is headlong on the path towards becoming your career companion.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YourStory Media Pvt.

Inside, green light glows faintly from a collection of lenses, brackets, and cables that resemble an exploded telescope. It’s a prototype computer that processes data using light, not electricity, and it’s learning to recognize handwritten digits. In other experiments the device learned to generate sentences in text.Right now, this embryonic optical computer is good, not great: on its best run it read 90 percent of scrawled numbers correctly. But Andregg, who cofounded Fathom late in 2014 with his brother Michael, sees it as a breakthrough. “We opened the champagne when it was only at about 30 percent,” he says with a laugh.Andregg claims this is the first time such complex machine-learning software has been trained using circuits that pulse with laser light, not electricity. The company is working to shrink its exploded telescope, which covers a few square feet of workbench, to fit into a standard cloud server. Fathom hopes the technology will become one of the shovels of the artificial-intelligence gold rush.Trending NowRobots & Us: A Brief History of Our Robotic FutureTech companies, particularly large cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft, spend heavily on computer chips to power machine-learning algorithms. The current AI-crazed moment began when researchers found that chips marketed for graphics were well-suited to power so-called artificial neural networks for tasks such as recognizing speech or images. The stock price of leading graphics-chip supplier Nvidia has grown more than 10-fold in the past three years, and Google and many other companies are now making or developing specialized machine-learning chips of their own.A visualization showing Fathom's prototype computer multiplying matrices—an operation crucial to artificial neural networks.
Fathom ComputingAdvertisementFathom’s founders are betting this hunger for more powerful machine learning will outstrip the capabilities of purely electronic computers. “Optics has fundamental advantages over electronics that no amount of design will overcome,” says William Andregg. He and his brother’s 11-person company is backed by Playground Global, the venture firm led by Andy Rubin, who coinvented the Android operating system now owned by Google. Fathom operates out of Playground’s combined offices and workshops in Palo Alto, California.

Telecommunications companies move our web pages and selfies over long distances by shooting lasers down optical fiber, because light signals travel much farther, using a fraction of the energy, than electrical pulses in a metal cable. A single cable can house many parallel streams of data at once, carried by light of different colors.Using light to crunch data, as well as transport it, should also offer significant performance gains. Light inside optical circuits travels more or less for free. By contrast, electrical signals must battle resistance, producing waste heat. A combination of capacity gains and energy savings could be tempting to companies running big machine-learning projects. A single experiment at Google, for example, can now use hundreds of powerful graphics chips for solid weeks at a time, according to some of the firm’s research papers.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceOptical processors aren’t a new idea. They were a feature of some 1960s military radar systems. But the idea fell by the wayside when the semiconductor industry hit its stride, delivering decades of exponential increases in the density of chips that came to be known as Moore’s Law. Fathom is part of a nascent optical computing renaissance sparked by a realization that Moore’s Law appears to be running out of steam. The trend’s demise was cited in a recent report by 14 Berkeley researchers on the technical challenges to making AI systems ever smarter. “Our historically rapidly improving hardware technology is coming to a grinding halt,” they wrote.Optical computers aren’t likely to power your laptop or smartphone any time soon. Fathom’s prototype is still too bulky, for one thing. But the technology does look to be a decent match for the main work that chips perform in AI projects based on artificial neural networks, says Pierre-Alexandre Blanche, a professor at the University of Arizona. Siri’s speech recognition, and Alphabet’s conquest of the boardgame Go, are built on huge volumes of one particular mathematical operation, multiplying grids of numbers known as matrices.Fathom’s prototype performs those operations by encoding numbers into beams of light. The beams are passed through a sequence of lenses and other optical components. Reading how the beams have been changed by their ordeal reveals the result of a calculation. Optical circuits like this can effectively perform the work of both the memory and processor in conventional computers. The time and energy costs of moving data between those components is a bottleneck on the performance of systems in use today.Fathom isn’t alone in thinking AI systems need to trip the light fantastic. Paris-based startup LightOn announced Friday that it has begun testing its own technology in a data center. Startups Lightmatter and Lightelligence spun out of MIT last year, raising a total of $21 million in funding, including from China’s search giant Baidu. The pair originate in an MIT project that ran neural networks for speech recognition on an optical computer, although unlike Fathom’s device the system didn’t play host to the training of that software. “As soon as we posted our research paper on that project online we received multiple calls from investors,” says Yichen Shen, CEO and cofounder of Lightelligence. “There’s recognition this is a big opportunity.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThis Is the Moment RFK Jr. Has Been Waiting ForBy Vittoria Elliott, WIREDGearAI's Energy Demands Are Out of Control.

Is Jerry ready for art made by algorithms?

Thanks to great advances in artificial intelligence, humans aren’t the only ones making art anymore. As computers get in on the creative action, art critic Jerry Saltz has taken their efforts to task, offering some fairly savage reviews of works of art generated by various algorithms.
In a segment on HBO’s VICE News Tonight, Saltz was asked to judge a series of works made by AI rather than by human hands. “I’m looking for humanity, dignity, horror, originality,” he said, laying out his criterion for a successful piece.
Jerry Saltz wasn’t impressed with this work of art created by Artificial Intelligence. Screen shot via YouTube.
Saltz slammed a Google Deep Dream work—made by enhancing patterns in existing images—for selecting a banal dog for its subject matter, but he admitted: “I don’t hate this.” He compared the image’s horror vacui—a lack empty space, with details filling every section of the work—to Northwest Coast American Indian art. Another piece by the algorithm was faintly praised as “a good knockoff Shepard Fairey.”
An untitled painting by GAN algorithm from Mario Klingemann, which has been trained on female selfies and historical portraits of men, got mixed reviews. Saltz likened it to the work of Lisa Yuskavage, known for her colorful paintings of women. Ultimately, however, the computer’s effort lacked depth and was more akin to “bad album cover from the 1970s.”
Jerry Saltz compared this work of art created by Artificial Intelligence to Native American art. Screen shot via YouTube.
Saltz declined to compare Palimpsest by AICON, an algorithm that has been trained to replicate Western art, to the work of any specific artist, “because I don’t think any artist was this boring.” But he praised Portrait of Elle Reeve, saying “this is the first image I’ve seen that doesn’t look like a computer made it.”
The piece was made by Pindar Van Arman using Cloud Painter, a robot controlled by multiple creative algorithms. But while Saltz acknowledged the robot’s “good taste” in Post-Impressionist art and admitted he might have been fooled into thinking a human made it, he insisted that even the best effort of today’s AI technology “doesn’t come close to art.”

About Bidgely 









The United States is the single most privileged country on the face of this planet by far, yet inexplicably some of her citizens believe that they’re somehow oppressed. As they bask in the safe glow of their temperature controlled homes, spewing froth vitriol over the Internet using their expensive laptops and smartphones, they fail to realize that the mere fact that they have electricity with close to a 99.99% availability is nothing short of a miracle. The massive amounts of infrastructure that were engineered and built to provide sustained electricity, the men that go out in the freezing cold and blazing sun to repair said infrastructure, and the efficiency and dependability at which the whole thing operates, is taken for granted by nearly everyone. At least once a month though, we’re all given a chance to complain about it when the energy bill arrives.
To be fair, your bog standard energy bill is still fairly archaic. It shows some dollar amount that usually goes up or down depending on the season, along with a rudimentary graph that shows your energy usage over time. It looks something like this:

If you’re looking to understand a bit more about how much energy you use in your household, that piece of paper isn’t very insightful. Wouldn’t it be great if you could receive an itemized bill which showed exactly what appliances consumed that energy that you’re paying for? That may soon become a reality thanks to the wonders of artificial intelligence.
We’ve talked before about how Google used their own artificial intelligence creation, Deepmind, to cut their power bills by up to 40%. Other companies have followed suite like Verdigris Technologies which helps commercial buildings cut their energy bills. Now we’re going to take a look at another company that just took in a pretty meaningful funding round last month in the pursuit of using machine learning to help you better understand your energy consumption.
About Bidgely
If you’re feeling oppressed, try spending some time in India where the trains are so packed that people often get killed on their way to work at extremely competitive jobs with long hours and little reward for which they are extremely grateful for the opportunity. While you’re spending time in India, you may also come away with a newly found appreciation for dependable bidgley (that’s the Hindi word for electricity). It’s also the name of a Sunnyvalle, California startup which was founded in 2010 and has since taken in close to $52 million in funding to develop software that uses artificial intelligence to itemize household energy bills. So how does it work?
What Bidgely does is referred to as “energy disaggregation” and it involves itemizing consumers’ energy data into individual appliances using machine learning algorithms without any hardware needing to be installed. That’s right. Bidgely performs its disaggregation through meter data alone without the customer needing to install any hardware whatsoever. They claim to be the industry leader in “disaggregation technology” which works for both smart meters and monthly-read meters. If you’re unfamiliar with what a smart meter is, it simply allows for two-way communication between the meter and the power company. It’s these smart meters that allow Bidgely to do what they do.

Bidgely’s patented energy disaggregation technology detects and extracts appliance fingerprints from smart meter data. The data is converted into itemized energy bills and useful insights. Leveraging a database of over 50B meter readings from smart meters, Bidgely’s machine learning models extend itemization to non Smart Meter homes using a “matched peer” or a “matched region” approach.

That’s pretty remarkable that they can perform actual itemization without installing any hardware. It’s not just statistical models that provide “typical usage” either. Bidgely says that if the consumer goes on vacation or upgrades an appliance, the itemization will reflect the change. One of the examples they provide is when a utility company offers a new air conditioning unit and claims that it will offer energy savings. Using a statistical model, energy consumption will be reduced, but the percentage attributed to “cooling” will not change. Using proper “energy disaggregation” will show the change so the customer can actually see the impact:

They claim to offer this solution at a fraction of the cost that hardware-based solutions would incur and they can reach 100% of homes out there, regardless of the types of meters being used. Well, only those homes that are lucky enough to have electricity in the first place of course, which is a market of 5.6 billion people at the moment. At the moment they’ve only captured 10 million homes, thus the need for their latest funding round to scale the solution as quick as possible. They’re working in 10 countries at the moment, which shows that borders won’t present any barriers to their future expansion plans.
The platform is cloud-based which means that utilities can simply plug in to it and begin offering the solution under their own brand name. In addition to telling people which appliances are consuming the energy they’re paying for, there are also other ways to engage customers such as through gamification. The proof is in the pudding as they say, and a look at their customer list shows some big name utilities have signed on:

Two of the energy names seen above are also investors in Bidgely. German company E.ON is one of the world’s largest investor-owned electric utility service providers with more than 56,000 employees and 2015 revenues of $144 billion. The second large utility invested in Bidgely is Exelon (NYSE:EXC), a publicly traded utility that generates revenues of approximately $34.5 billion and employs approximately 34,000 people. Utilities have more interest in just conserving energy since all that big data that Bidgely is capturing will be useful to aggregate and analyze for additional insights. That’s one of the goals that Bidgely has alongside their latest funding round – “business intelligence applied to broader decision-making within utilities and energy retailers“. It’s only a matter of time before we all have itemized electricity bills arriving in our inboxes thanks to the wonders of artificial intelligence. Well, those of us that are fortunate enough to have electricity that is.

At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.These days, artificial intelligence (or AI) is rarely out of the headlines. Each day — or so it seems — new advances are made and new uses found for this technology.For instance, according to recent reports, Facebook is using AI to identify and remove terrorist content, and even prevent suicide. Google’s AI DeepMind became a master of the ancient Chinese game of Go by repeatedly playing against itself.Meanwhile, one self-driving car pioneer has reportedly established a nonprofit religious organisation to “…develop and promote the realisation of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence.”Phew! Those are some big claims, and whether they will all bear fruit remains to be seen.But it’s undeniable that AI has left the realm of science fiction and is today science fact — and recruiting is no exception. When it comes to the world of work, AI is already changing the way people hire and search for jobs. At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.Let’s take a look at how and where it’s already making a positive difference.Machines as matchmakersSign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsIt’s understandable if you’re a little unsettled at the thought of AI changing the way you recruit talent. Maybe you’re picturing your clients receiving messages and answers from a cold, impersonal machine. Or worse, perhaps you’re worried that a humanoid robot will plot to take over your position (and then your company . . . and then the world!)But the truth is, AI is a tool that serves us.Every recruiter wants to create the best possible match between a job seeker and the right job opening. And with greater access to relevant data than ever before, recruiters are (theoretically) in a better position than ever to make this happen.The problem is that too much data is indigestible for humans. We’re not always sure what to do with it, or where to get the data we need, and this applies to recruiting as much as any field.AI technology can improve the odds of creating a great match — even right at the beginning of the process — by applying algorithms and making predictions that select only the most relevant jobs before showing them to job seekers.Let’s say a job description is unclear or contains gaps. Algorithms can step in to estimate salaries or classify unusual or eccentric job titles that nobody actually searches for (“Digital Overlord”, anyone?).Using natural language processing abilities, AI can also comb through what are often text-heavy and unstructured resumes to pinpoint critical information and paint a more accurate picture of the ideal job for a particular candidate.The result? Job seekers see the jobs they need to see, and are provided with the information essential to making an informed decision — meaning less wasted time and better matches for recruiter and job seeker alike.Using AI to reduce unconscious biasBut that’s not all. AI can also carry out a wide range of recruiting and HR-related tasks. Keeping the job seeker safe from scams and protecting personal data is an important requirement in today’s world. AI helps manage this process, using signals to identify and eliminate poor-quality sites, posts and scams.It can also help reduce human bias. Take the new technology of automated assessments, for example, which gives HR and recruiting professionals insight into how a candidate would perform certain job tasks.Here’s an example of how it works: A large contact centre in the EU needed to source seven different languages in one location. Now typically, a recruiter might typically have that person speak with a language specialist as part of the application process.But doing evaluations with so many candidates and multiple different language specialists not only places a strain on resources, it also introduces a lot of subjectivity into the process.Instead, the employer used AI-powered language proficiency assessments. This may sound like science fiction but it isn’t: Each candidate had a 10-minute phone conversation with the AI agent in that assigned language. During those conversations, the AI technology automatically evaluated the candidates’ fluency and communications skills.The result? A far more efficient, less stressful process. Not bad for a cold, impersonal machine — and this is just the tip of the iceberg.Liberating employers to focus on the human side of hiringEven as AI continues to make significant advances, it is never going to replace human recruiters. Rather it will enhance and improve our work.The current capabilities rely on human beings to apply and use that technology and ensure that everything runs smoothly. But there’s more to it than that: no matter how advanced the technology gets, recruiting will remain a fundamentally human activity.When job seekers and employers interact with great recruiters, they build trust, loyalty and a sense of teamwork — and this cannot be replicated by machines. The role of AI is to free up more time for recruiters, so they can place more focus on the human relationships that make them great at what they do. AI may be able to beat us at a game of “Go” but it will never beat us at that.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)Advertise with usrecruitmentartificialintelligencehuman resourcehiring processAI technologyAdvertise with usMOST VIEWED STORIES1NewsSimple Viral Games raises Rs 4 crore from WEH Ventures, PointOne Capital, others2In-focusInteligen wants to turn math fear into math love through games and activities 3FundingIdeaForge acquires non-controlling stake in spacetech startup GalaxEye

At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.These days, artificial intelligence (or AI) is rarely out of the headlines. Each day — or so it seems — new advances are made and new uses found for this technology.For instance, according to recent reports, Facebook is using AI to identify and remove terrorist content, and even prevent suicide. Google’s AI DeepMind became a master of the ancient Chinese game of Go by repeatedly playing against itself.Meanwhile, one self-driving car pioneer has reportedly established a nonprofit religious organisation to “…develop and promote the realisation of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence.”Phew! Those are some big claims, and whether they will all bear fruit remains to be seen.But it’s undeniable that AI has left the realm of science fiction and is today science fact — and recruiting is no exception. When it comes to the world of work, AI is already changing the way people hire and search for jobs. At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.Let’s take a look at how and where it’s already making a positive difference.MACHINES AS MATCHMAKERSIt’s understandable if you’re a little unsettled at the thought of AI changing the way you recruit talent. Maybe you’re picturing your clients receiving messages and answers from a cold, impersonal machine. Or worse, perhaps you’re worried that a humanoid robot will plot to take over your position (and then your company . . . and then the world!)But the truth is, AI is a tool that serves us.Every recruiter wants to create the best possible match between a job seeker and the right job opening. And with greater access to relevant data than ever before, recruiters are (theoretically) in a better position than ever to make this happen.> The problem is that too much data is indigestible for humans. We’re not always sure what to do with it, or where to get the data we need, and this applies to recruiting as much as any field.AI technology can improve the odds of creating a great match — even right at the beginning of the process — by applying algorithms and making predictions that select only the most relevant jobs before showing them to job seekers.Let’s say a job description is unclear or contains gaps. Algorithms can step in to estimate salaries or classify unusual or eccentric job titles that nobody actually searches for (“Digital Overlord”, anyone?).Using natural language processing abilities, AI can also comb through what are often text-heavy and unstructured resumes to pinpoint critical information and paint a more accurate picture of the ideal job for a particular candidate.The result? Job seekers see the jobs they need to see, and are provided with the information essential to making an informed decision — meaning less wasted time and better matches for recruiter and job seeker alike.USING AI TO REDUCE UNCONSCIOUS BIASBut that’s not all. AI can also carry out a wide range of recruiting and HR-related tasks. Keeping the job seeker safe from scams and protecting personal data is an important requirement in today’s world. AI helps manage this process, using signals to identify and eliminate poor-quality sites, posts and scams.It can also help reduce human bias. Take the new technology of automated assessments, for example, which gives HR and recruiting professionals insight into how a candidate would perform certain job tasks.> Here’s an example of how it works: A large contact centre in the EU needed to source seven different languages in one location. Now typically, a recruiter might typically have that person speak with a language specialist as part of the application process.But doing evaluations with so many candidates and multiple different language specialists not only places a strain on resources, it also introduces a lot of subjectivity into the process.Instead, the employer used AI-powered language proficiency assessments. This may sound like science fiction but it isn’t: Each candidate had a 10-minute phone conversation with the AI agent in that assigned language. During those conversations, the AI technology automatically evaluated the candidates’ fluency and communications skills.The result? A far more efficient, less stressful process. Not bad for a cold, impersonal machine — and this is just the tip of the iceberg.LIBERATING EMPLOYERS TO FOCUS ON THE HUMAN SIDE OF HIRINGEven as AI continues to make significant advances, it is never going to replace human recruiters. Rather it will enhance and improve our work.The current capabilities rely on human beings to apply and use that technology and ensure that everything runs smoothly. But there’s more to it than that: no matter how advanced the technology gets, recruiting will remain a fundamentally human activity.When job seekers and employers interact with great recruiters, they build trust, loyalty and a sense of teamwork — and this cannot be replicated by machines. The role of AI is to free up more time for recruiters, so they can place more focus on the human relationships that make them great at what they do. AI may be able to beat us at a game of “Go” but it will never beat us at that.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YourStory Media Pvt.
