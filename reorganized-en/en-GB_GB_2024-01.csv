Advances in technology often generate headlines about how they will change the way we work. In this regard, generative AI has made more impact than most – with OpenAI’s ChatGPT quickly becoming the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users just two months after launch. It’s no surprise that most organisations today are exploring the potential benefits generative AI can deliver, and the significant impact it could have on productivity, creativity, employee wellbeing and the future of work. HR leaders have a crucial role to play in helping to empower their executive teams, dispelling the myths and preparing the organisation for what the future holds.  Harnessing the potential Generative AI is a standout development, promising to revolutionise the future of work by streamlining and automating routine and repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on the more creative or complex aspects of their jobs. In turn, this can enhance efficiency, productivity and be more rewarding for people across a multitude of functions within every organisation.  One of the findings of Finastra’s recent Financial Services State of the Nation Survey highlights the excitement about the pace of technological change happening within the financial services industry today (and no doubt other industries are evolving in similar ways). We asked 956 professionals at managerial level in financial institutions across nine countries what they felt about advances in technology and an overwhelming 87 per cent of respondents expressed their personal enthusiasm about the opportunities ahead.  
It’s imperative that HR professionals work closely with senior leadership to harness this excitement, helping to empower their organisations to leverage the new technology and the more productive ways of working, allaying any fears people may have and helping them adapt. At Finastra the CHRO partners with the CTIO to co-sponsor the AI steering group.In times of technological transformation, it’s essential to balance creativity and excitement with guidance and governance, moving as slowly as required, to adhere to high standards of ethics and responsibility. Recognising that successful generative AI integration requires a robust framework of internal policies and oversight; employees must be placed at the centre of all activity, with robust security measures put in place.  Sponsors overseeing AI implementations and generative AI labs will play a pivotal role in managing governance and mitigating risks and in fostering a culture of responsibility. By providing skills, safe tools and a secure environment, alongside a holistic governance model, companies can use generative AI tools to unlock the potential of their people, as well as boosting productivity and wellbeing.  Prioritising upskilling Finastra is actively investing in generative AI to unlock the potential of our ~8,000 people. We’ve made a conscious effort to be at the forefront but ensuring we are getting the foundations right, such as security, compliance and testing, is critical. This is paving the way for us to progress at scale and pace. We’ve ensured that all employees have access to a comprehensive generative AI skills training programme, as well as a comprehensive set of policies for usage, including legal and compliance. Knowing that it can be natural for people to resist or to fear change, we also have a variety of internal channels and communities in place that enable our teams to interact with experts, ask questions and share knowledge in a safe and supportive environment.  In addition, we are actively investigating HR-specific use cases to improve efficiencies across our operations, including a generative AI-enabled virtual assistant to support the 2,000+ queries and transactions that we receive monthly to our people portal.  Strategic HR leaders should be mindful of the potential downsides of reducing routine work tasks in the workplace. While this shift may improve productivity and efficiency, it could also lead to increased stress levels as the proportion of highly complex tasks leaders need to process during the working day significantly accelerates. To mitigate these risks, leaders should educate line managers about the importance of understanding their own physiology, including circadian rhythms, chronotypes, sleep and nutrition.By creating a culture of self awareness and balance, organisations can leverage the power of AI to drive business growth while also supporting employee wellbeing. This holistic approach to workforce management can become a critical differentiator for organisations that prioritise the health and wellbeing of their employees, leading to a more engaged and motivated workforce.Looking to the future The future of work is on the brink of a transformative era driven by generative AI. We recognise its potential to transform our organisation, our operations and our products, but it must be used responsibly and with understanding. Ensuring our people are able to explore generative AI in a safe and compliant way has been a fundamental consideration and shaped our usage policy.We are always exploring ways to attract and retain the best people and believe that it is our responsibility to provide access to the tools and training that improves their everyday life and unlocks their potential. We believe fluency in generative AI is a requisite life skill, not just a Finastra skill. For that reason, we are investing in a robust training programme, secure tools and a compliant operating environment for our people, our developers and our customers. The take up of these skilling modules from all parts of our organisation has been outstanding with first-class content curated by our skills centre of expertise.  Our flagship three-day ‘Gen AI (X)po’ that ran in October saw the entire organisation coalesce around AI. In these few short days we saw more than 16,000 hours of learning take place. HR has been under immense pressure in recent years. But now is the time to embrace change and innovation rather than yearn for the former status quo. HR leaders have a unique opportunity to partner with peers to shape the future of organisations and be at the forefront as AI and human capability become interdependent. Helen Cook is chief people and communications officer at Finastra

A little over a year ago, no one was talking about generative AI. Now, it’s the dominant topic of top-level events like CES and the World Economic Forum.

A lot has changed in that year, of course, driven by the collective enthusiasm for tools like ChatGPT and Dall-E. Millions of us are now using it in our daily lives – as evidenced by some of the statistics I highlight below. New products and services built around large language models, as well as image, sound, and video generation, are appearing every day.


Let's take a look at some facts and figures, focusing on those that I feel tell the story of generative AI’s breakthrough year.

The most mind-blowing thing, though, is that with investment (and hype) continuing to flow into the sector, the only way I can see these numbers going over the next year is up!

75% of professionals expect that generative AI will cause “significant or disruptive change in the nature of their industry’s competition” over the next three years, according to McKinsey’s research.
PROMOTED
This is interesting because it shows lots of us believe generative AI can be useful beyond the more obvious use cases, like automating routine marketing and admin processes, and used to create new business opportunities.
70% of Generation Z use the technology and 52% of them trust it to help them make decisions, according to Salesforce.

This fits with findings in the same research that 68% of those who never use generative AI are members of the Gen X or Baby Boomer generations. It’s no surprise that younger people are quicker to understand new technology and adopt it into their lives. For more mature members of the workforce, it creates an opportunity to stay relevant rather than start slipping behind!

This statistic was given at the end of 2023. At the start of the year, it was reported that the generative AI tool that kicked off the current gold rush was attracting the same number of monthly users. The website of the parent company, OpenAI, attracts 1.5 million monthly visits.
86 percent of IT leaders expect generative AI to soon play a prominent role in their organizations, says Salesforce.
With its ability to write code, troubleshoot complex technical issues and change the way we think about data, IT workers are among those who are most exposed to the potential benefits and challenges of AI. If this is your field, continuous learning and adaptability are key to staying ahead.
Two million developers are working on apps built on OpenAI’s platform
This includes most Fortune 500 companies, according to the company’s own data. Building apps on OpenAI involves creating services that access its tools, like GPT-4 or Dall-E 2, through the company’s APIs. A popular use case is creating custom ChatGPT-like chatbots to respond to customer queries.
The value of the generative AI market will increase by $180 billion in the next eight years.
Research by Brainy Insights estimates that the revenue generated from generative AI services will hit $188 billion by 2032, driven by increased AI adoption across all industries and the desire by businesses to leverage data for decision-making.
80 percent of women are employed in fields vulnerable to automation by generative AI.
Many jobs will be affected by automation, but when more than 25% of the functions of your role can be automated, your role is classified as vulnerable, according to research by the Kenan Institute. It finds that women are disproportionately affected by this, with just 58 percent of men working in similarly vulnerable roles.
89.2% of artists believe that current copyright laws are inadequate in the age of generative AI
This comes from research by the job site Book An Artist, which found that the vast majority of artists it spoke to don’t think that current laws protect them from having their work exploited by generative AI. It’s an area that we can expect to see addressed by lawmakers in the near future, as several lawsuits are already being brought by writers and artists who claim AI providers have effectively stolen their work.
Marketers believe generative AI will save them an average of five hours of work per week.
This works out to over a month in a year! Most commonly, they believe that AI will help by taking over “busy work” while allowing them to focus on more strategic aspects of their job. The Salesforce survey Generative AI Snapshot found that 55 percent of those working in marketing are already using generative AI, with another 22 percent planning on adopting it in the near future.
90 percent of online content could be generated by AI by the end of next year
According to a report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency, 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated by 2026. It predicts this will lead to new law enforcement challenges around disinformation, propaganda, fraud and deception.

The view from the expertsThe rise of artificial intelligence is making workers nervous — but it could help themILLUSTRATION BY NINA KRAUSELinda DalySunday January 28 2024, 12.01am GMT, The Sunday TimesGordon Smith, a self- employed business content writer, has a suspicion that he has lost some clients to a relatively new competitor in the market: generative ­artificial intelligence (AI). “My brother-in-law, who works in software, is convinced that AI is coming for my job,” he says. Smith should not be overly worried about business drying up. Content ­writers do not appear on a list recently produced by the World Economic Forum showing the top ten fastest-declining jobs. That honour went to bank clerks, cashiers, legal secretaries and bookkeepers, many of whom are seeing their roles being replaced by AI. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is being seen as a disruptor. Tech companies, keen to forge a path in the emerging world, are restructuring, sometimes making thousands of ­redundancies as they shift their focus to the new ­technology. Last week SAP, a German software firm, announced a €2 billion restructuring programme in which 8,000 roles would be affected through voluntary redundancies or reskilling for AI roles. The company said it expected generative AI to alter its business fundamentally. AdvertisementConversely, AI is driving the revenues of some of the world’s biggest companies. Microsoft’s ascension into the $3 trillion valuation bracket last week was put down to its focus on artificial intelligence. A report published this month by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that almost 40 per cent of the global workforce is exposed to AI. SAP, the German software firm, says it expects generative AI to alter its business fundamentallyBENOIT TESSIER/REUTERSLast year, McKinsey, a management consulting firm, predicted that by 2030 “up to 30 per cent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated — a trend accelerated by generative AI”. The emergence of generative AI into the marketplace has sparked an international debate and countless studies about whether AI will be the destroyer of millions of jobs. Brad Mallard, chief technology officer at the digital transformation company ­Version 1, called this “scaremongering”. “There’s a lot of doom and gloom and I don’t necessarily buy into it. The key word is not redundancies, the key word is impact,” he said. AdvertisementVersion 1 has been running AI initiatives for up to two dozen of its clients. However, no customer has indicated that the AI would replace human workers, according to Mallard. “A lot of them are relatively small projects­, testing the ­technology to see if it will make a difference,” he said. The Irish government has also waded into the AI debate. John McCarthy, chief economist at the Department of Finance, told a recent Institute of Public Administration conference that the emerging technology carried a “risk of large job losses in some sectors”.However, at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this month, Leo Varadkar, the ­taoiseach, said AI could be a ­significant job creator. “History tells us that any time there’s technological advancement, ­people believe it will eliminate jobs,” he said. “What usually happens is jobs change, and some jobs become obsolete and new forms of employment are ­created.”Varadkar’s views seem to be in line with the general view of experts and the market. A survey last year by the World Economic Forum found that of companies expecting to adopt AI, half expected jobs to be created as a result, while a quarter expected job reductions. Research by the Organisation for ­Economic Co-operation and Development in 2023 showed that job reorganisation was more prevalent than job displacement.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Leo Varadkar, the ­taoiseach, said AI could be a ­significant job creatorGIAN EHRENZELLER/EPAAdvertisementBobby Healy, the tech entrepreneur behind drone delivery company Manna, sees AI as a “massive job creator”. “When we consider the impact of AI on jobs, we only have to let history guide us. Across time, the industrial revolution, the internet, smartphones, renewable energy and — of course — drones for logistics have all massively increased the productivity of the human race,” Healy said.Cian Ó Maidín of NearForm, the company behind the Covid tracking app, also believes AI will create jobs. “AI is great at taking repetitive manual tasks and ­making them far easier, such as searching for flights, transcribing data or doing research on a topic online. It is an efficiency optimiser, so if a job comprises spending all day transcribing data manually, then yes, eventually these jobs will become ­irrelevant.” Where bodies such as McKinsey and the International Monetary Fund differ­ in their view is where those displaced­ jobs are likely to be. The IMF has said that unlike previous revolutions, which mostly affected ­lower-skilled and middle-skilled jobs, AI could affect high-skilled roles. In ­addition, it has said that advanced economies face greater risks from AI than emerging economies. McKinsey says people in the lowest wage categories are up to ten times more likely to change occupations — not just jobs — by the end of the decade.AdvertisementFor now, many Irish business leaders are unconcerned about job displacement — though one might imagine that they would welcome a reduction in wage bills. At a recent AI conference held by the legal firm Mason Hayes & Curran, a survey of the 500 in attendance found that while half of them said quality and accuracy were the biggest risks with using generative AI, only 8 per cent said job displacement was a concern. Brian McElligott, partner and head of AI at Mason Hayes & Curran, said that it was not a case of “roles being replaced but tasks within roles being replaced”. “When I started my career in ­intellectual property, I did trademark searches. These days a lot of software does that job,” he said. “The benefit to the client is they get things quicker, more standardised, more formalised.” McElligott also sees AI as a net job ­creator. The World Economic Forum has predicted a 40 per cent increase in the number of AI and machine learning specialists­ by 2027.Trayc Keevans, global foreign direct investment manager at the recruitment firm Morgan McKinley, has witnessed an increase in demand for AI developers and engineers, AI ethicists­ and robotics specialists. “AI displaces­ those roles that can be automated such as certain accounting and bookkeeping roles and telemarketers,” she said. AdvertisementColm O’Cuinneain, general manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Greenhouse Software, which provides recruitment software as a service, said AI “must be used as an assistance to and not a replacement of humans”.In November Greenhouse published the results of a survey of 1,700 HR managers and found that nine in ten of them were using AI tools in their HR departments. While 44 per cent of respondents said that AI would make hiring decisions for humans in the future, 47 per cent said that they could not fully trust AI hiring tools. “That being said, AI makes recruiters more effective. Our approach is to focus on empowering recruiters with AI tools while at the same time keeping human oversight,” O’Cuinneain said.At Davos, Varadkar held an event attended by Sam ­Altman, the boss of OpenAI. The ChatGPT developer has set up an office in ­Ireland. Lawrence Vesey, a partner in the digital transformation practice at consulting firm Sia Partners, said OpenAI’s arrival could pave the way for more AI firms to set up here. “It is likely to attract technology talent from across the wider tech sector to ­Ireland,” he added. Erik O’Donovan, head of digital economy policy at Ibec, the business lobby group, wants the government to take a “strategic approach to addressing the immediate skills needs of Irish business including digital and AI skills”.“There will be new businesses arising based directly on AI — some of which we can’t anticipate at the moment. So AI will create jobs,” he said.The government published its national artificial intelligence strategy in 2021, aimed at building AI skills and attracting and retaining talent in the field. Mark Jordan, chief strategy officer of Skillnet Ireland, said that there had been a “lot of progress made in terms of skill provision to address AI”. “There’s a number of certification ­programmes, leading all the way up to graduate programmes dedicated to AI,” he said. Technological University Dublin, for example, has introduced a degree in computing with machine learning and AI. A new six-month AI accelerator programme for start-ups at University College Dublin will support entrepreneurs who are developing disruptive AI solutions for a global market, and will offer mentoring, networking events and access to a co-working space. The utopian view of the big AI replacement is that workers will have more time to do more meaningful tasks — or, even better, do less work. In November a study by Autonomy, a think tank, found that more than a quarter of the working population in the UK and US could benefit from productivity gains provided by AI and see their working week reduce from 40 to 32 hours — while maintaining their pay. Barry O’Sullivan, director of the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at University College Cork and a member of the ­government’s AI advisory council, said administrations must learn from mistakes of the past, such as when automation was introduced in the 1970s in the US. “What happened there was there was lots of profitability but the worker didn’t benefit from it very much,” he said.“Over the many years since, great disaffection has been created in society because of that. We have to make sure in the context of AI that the technology is something that raises all boats.”Unions are wary. Niall Shanahan, communications officer with the public union Forsa, said “any AI application is only as good as the human being who gives it direction”. “If AI was to be deployed in any part of the public sector it would have to be absolutely fit for purpose. There would have to be a judgment made as to what degree it will replace roles,” Shanahan added. Many commentators say generative AI, in particular, has at least a decade to go before it is good enough to do the role of humans. This month the parcel company DPD disabled its AI online chatbot after a ­customer made the bot swear and write a poem criticising the company.Last week the radio presenter Dave Fanning launched defamation proceedings against a Hong Kong news site and Microsoft over the publication of his photo alongside an article stating that a different Irish broadcaster had gone on trial for alleged sexual misconduct. ­Fanning’s lawyers told the court that they believed his photo might have been chosen by an AI program. Gordon Smith argues that companies replacing human copywriters for AI tools such as ChatGPT are “saying goodbye to originality”. “I urge them to read the copy that AI produces and realise it is a reheated mash-up of ideas that belongs to someone else and there is nothing terribly original about it,” he said.WorldRelated articlesTHE BIG QUESTIONShould workers replaced by AI get compensation?November 30 2023, 12.00pm GMTLily Russell-Jones | Mick Whitley | Gali ArnonLEADING ARTICLEYear of AIDecember 27 2023, 9.00pm GMTThe Times Leading ArticleJAMES MARRIOTTWhen AI kills jobs, expect a white-collar revoltMay 17 2023, 5.00pm BSTJames MarriottSponsored",https://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://www.thetimes.com/world/ireland-world/article/will-ai-take-my-job-expert-view-artificial-intelligence-explained-9zfpf3knd,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Ffaf7dfae-01d8-4f75-b4be-7bd46f647275.jpg?crop=1498%2C843%2C0%2C0&resize=1200', 'caption': None}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Linda Daly', 'jobTitle': 'Business reporter, Sunday Times Ireland', 'sameAs': ['https://www.thetimes.com/profile/linda-daly', 'https://twitter.com/LindaDaly19']}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Sunday Times', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject'}}",Will AI take my job?

Generative AI can assist with document processing and classification for a wide range of matters, including due diligence, document and contract review, compliance, contract management, knowledge management and deal analysis.By automating these tasks using intelligent technology, significant workflow benefits can be achieved, particularly with improved efficiency and productivity as well as greater accuracy.The use of AI at law firms has transitioned from a mere desire to an essential requirement. It is changing the way we do business, much the same way as email did in the 1990s. As digital transformation continues to advance, AI will become ubiquitous and an indispensable assistant to practically every attorney and legal professional, freeing up time for tasks that add greater value such as thinking and advising.“Legal generative AI is supposed to augment what a lawyer does. It’s not going to do legal reasoning, not going to door case strategy. What it’s supposed to do is do repeatable rote tasks much more quickly and efficiently.”– Zach Warren, Manager, Technology and Innovation, Thomson Reuters Institute  White paperGenerative AI for legal professionals: What to know and what to do right nowAccess white paper  AI for faster data synthesis and analysisCreating, reviewing and sending various documents forms a large part of an attorney’s daily tasks. While important, these are repetitive and manual processes and are typically prone to human error, which can introduce an unnecessary element of risk. AI tools  backed by expert human oversight give you a competitive edge by improving accuracy and thus reducing risk.  With the power of AI in your legal tech tools, you can sort files rapidly and seamlessly without needing to manually examine them. The range of assistance offered by legal-focused generative AI improves the legal firm’s or department’s output by facilitating the legal professional’s ability to apply their higher-level expertise to the work at hand. Efficient legal research and draftingConsider the value of AI-enhanced legal research technology.Generative AI provides a jumpstart on legal research by reducing the time legal professionals must spend shifting through and summarizing content. These tools can produce in moments an informative version of research that would have previously taken hours or days. Learn more about AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel Lawyers can then apply their expertise to refining the results to ensure that the research output is high quality, thorough, and accurate.  “For any of the tasks that lawyers do on a regular basis or that administrative professionals supporting the legal industry do on a regular basis, this technology allows them to do those things faster and to create a starting point much earlier in the process.”—Zena Applebaum, Global VP, Product Marketing for Research Products for Thomson Reuters Streamlined M&A due diligenceM&A due diligence is a tedious task that limits your time and ability to innovate and creatively problem-solve.Using AI tools for analysis and review of documents saves time and allows you to focus on more valuable pursuits, which facilitates enhanced creativity and allows you to focus exclusively on the tasks that only a person can handle – the job you were trained to do and the job you are passionate about. Improved knowledge managementGenerative AI can help legal teams stay organized and share information via cross-functional tools. Better and faster methods of saving, indexing, identifying, and disseminating lawyers’ prior work and collective expertise helps legal firms and departments solve legal and business problems more effectively. Enhanced onboarding and learningLegal-focused generative AI tools help users get up to speed quickly without extensive training, whether they are new to a firm or gaining knowledge about an unfamiliar area of law.These tools also help users learn new skills in a hands-on way as they work, reducing the need for as many formalized skill-development interventions, saving time and money. Plain-language prompting to navigate complexityThose unfamiliar with a given area of law may struggle to know where to start or which language is most applicable in searching for resources.Generative AI tools that can be prompted using plain-language queries allow users to access faster answers to complicated legal questions, and rapidly organize information and precedent that can help them develop successful arguments.  Ask Practical Law AIQuickly get answers to your questions from the trusted sources Practical Law is known forRequest free demo  Trustworthy security and privacyA professional tool licensed to a particular institution or firm provides a far more secure work ecosystem than a public-facing tool with few or no data controls. While legal professionals must always use caution regarding what data they use with AI tools, they can input a range of proprietary data with far less risk in a professional, licensed tool.Additionally, since legal-specific generative AI tools are trained on high-quality legal content, legal organizations can be confident that their output will be more trustworthy and accurate than other large language models.Originally published August 30, 2023. AI @ Thomson ReutersMonthly e-newsletter for insights and updatesStay up to date  Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceCollaborationEfficiencyTechnology",http://schema.org,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,https://play.vidyard.com/PphDwBYVYhT5ToE1tHVnaE.jpg,,,,PphDwBYVYhT5ToE1tHVnaE,"(upbeat music)

RichardsonSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTShare full articleRead in appBy Stephen MarcheStephen Marche is the author, most recently, of “The Last Election,” a political thriller written with Andrew Yang.Jan. 31, 2024Much of the current discourse about artificial intelligence sucks. A.I. is one of those subjects that seem to appear out of nowhere, blotting out everything else — like the sun rising over the desert — and a mixture of ludicrous hype and vacuous panic has rushed in to shade the blinding dazzle. A.I. is going to transform every industry, or it’s going to end the world, or both, and you need to know which now. Meanwhile, accurate answers to basic questions — What even is it? How does it work? Where did it come from? Where is it going? — tend to be tucked away in dry technical language that borders on the incomprehensible.Before the launch of ChatGPT, a little more than a year ago, it was difficult to get readers to care about A.I. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, would tell anybody who would listen that A.I. needed regulation, but few in power were listening. Editors sniffed. Readers yawned.After the launch of ChatGPT, everybody had an opinion, and nobody knew what they were talking about. The novelty and the urgency provoked the usual grift that accompanies any glut of public ignorance. The movies, with their predilection for wild visions of the artificial intelligence future (A.I. will start nuclear war, enslave humanity or teach us the nature of love), didn’t help. And, after a decade during which Silicon Valley has demonstrated that it lacks any sense of social responsibility, it has become impossible to trust the creators of A.I. Then there is the confounding nature of the technology itself, which often eludes the understanding even of the people who invented it. It’s amazing that anything good about A.I. ever gets written.Such books tend to come in two principal flavors: “We’re all going to die” and “How to get rich.” You can easily judge them by their covers. Ignore them. The good news is that there are some terrific books about A.I. once you weed out the grifters.ImageThe Alignment Problem, by Brian Christian (2020)If you’re going to read one book on artificial intelligence, this is the one. Though it was published in 2020, which in terms of A.I. is practically prehistory, I still think it’s fairer and more illuminating than almost anything published since. Its chief value is its close examination of the computer scientists, cognitive psychologists and philosophers who were present at its birth. You just can’t beat dense reporting.The problem with A.I. isn’t that it’s going to end the world, Christian says. The problem is determining how to “align” machine behavior with human values, a conundrum we have been trying and mostly failing to solve since the invention of the cotton gin. “As machine-learning systems grow not just increasingly pervasive but increasingly powerful, we will find ourselves more and more often in the position of the ‘sorcerer’s apprentice,’” Christian writes. “We conjure a force, autonomous but totally compliant, give it a set of instructions, then scramble like mad to stop it once we realize our instructions are imprecise or incomplete — lest we get, in some clever, horrible way, precisely what we asked for.”Christian, the author of two previous books about the intersection of humans and computers, is admirably clear: The trouble isn’t only the machines; it’s the people. To align machines with human values, we have to know what human values are, and that knowledge is hazy at best. We cling to theories of fairness and transparency, which grow vaguer and vaguer when we try to put them into practice. While Christian is hopeful — this is a book that celebrates A.I. as a victory for scientific progress and doubles as a manifesto for A.I. safety — he is also realistic. “Alignment will be messy,” he concludes. “How could it be otherwise?”ImageArtificial Intelligence, by Melanie Mitchell (2019)This is the Honda Civic of A.I. books; I mean that as a compliment. It’s reliable, it’s durable; it gets you where you need to go without a lot of fuss. Its author, a professor now at the Santa Fe Institute, is a longtime specialist in computer science and complex systems; the number of people who have worked in A.I. and can string together a coherent sentence is perishingly small, which is one reason her book is so useful.“Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans” provides the necessary history of the development of the technology, from the psychologist Frank Rosenblatt and his perceptron (a simple neural network) in the 1950s to the Stanford computer scientist Fei-Fei Li and her ImageNet (a landmark visual database used for training intelligent machines). The story Mitchell tells is chronological and detailed, encompassing the intellectual breakthroughs of the Dartmouth College group that coined the term artificial intelligence in the mid-1950s as well as the advent of natural processing language in the 2010s. She answers essential questions about artificial intelligence simply and elegantly.Moreover, Mitchell doesn’t hide the confusion that any honest encounter with artificial intelligence occasions. “The field of A.I. is in turmoil,” she writes. “Either a huge amount of progress has been made, or almost none at all. Either we are within spitting distance of ‘true’ A.I., or it is centuries away. A.I. will solve all our problems, put us all out of a job, destroy the human race or cheapen our humanity.” That’s not the simplistic take you’ll find on the opinion pages, but after reading Mitchell’s guide, you’ll know what you don’t know and what other people don’t know, even though they claim to know it. And that’s invaluable.ImageThe Algorithm, by Hilke Schellmann (2024)Terrible title, right? I mean, at this point a book called “The Algorithm” could be about anything. I imagine the title is so vague because the book’s subject might seem unappealing on its face. What could be drearier than a book about the use of artificial intelligence by human resource departments? But if you want to know the nitty-gritty of the alignment problem — how people are actually responding to it — “The Algorithm” is the best available case study.Human resources makes an excellent point of entry into the problems of artificial intelligence, because it involves so many different practices: hiring, evaluating, surveilling and retaining employees. The theoretical benefits of A.I. are obvious: increasing efficiency and reducing human bias. Equally obvious are the potential abuses. Schellmann, an investigative reporter and journalism professor, describes both, searchingly and steadily. The great strength of her book is that it treats A.I. as a tool used by people, avoiding grand theories and wild speculations in favor of close attention to detail.She begins her investigation with a great deal of hope for this new technology, given how inept human beings are at dealing with people. “I was so excited when I started this journey researching A.I. in the world of work,” she writes. “‘Finally,’ I thought, ‘a solution to biased human hiring.’” By the end, however, her enthusiasm had waned: “At least some of the tools people and companies use to make employment decisions do not work. At least some companies are basing high-stakes employment decisions on biased and junk algorithms, which cause real harm and prevent qualified people from getting jobs.” Human beings aren’t very good at making decisions in the first place, but A.I. does not liberate us from our human limitations; it chains us to them.The nightmares Schellmann describes — the use of facial recognition software in hiring decisions and the drive toward total employee surveillance — are more chilling than any apocalyptic scenario because they are actually happening. At times, “The Algorithm” reminded me of a digital version of Charlie Chaplin’s ordeal in “Modern Times,” with our minds rather than our bodies pulled and twisted through elaborate gears.ImageProgressive Capitalism, by Ro Khanna (2022)The alignment problem is fundamentally political. Any meaningful response to artificial intelligence will have to be collective. But who will the collective be? The idea that Silicon Valley can self-regulate is by now a sick joke, yet the American government doesn’t seem much better positioned to do the job. Fortunately, Khanna, a Democrat representing California’s 17th Congressional District, offers some hints of what a serious political response to A.I. might look like.“Progressive Capitalism” is a book written by a politician, and therefore filled with the politician’s standard scenes (visits to coal mining towns you’ve never heard of) and rhetorical devices (digestible five-point plans about issues of unimaginable complexity). But if you skip over the filler, Khanna offers one of the strongest prescriptions around for how to deal with the economic and social upheaval inevitable in a transition to new technologies. “While we allowed the internet to emerge without a strong ethical or legal framework in place, we should not make the same mistake when it comes to the emergence of artificial intelligence,” he writes. He cites a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that concludes that by 2030, A.I. will add over $15 trillion to the global G.D.P., but notes that almost all that value will go to a sliver of the population. (At the moment, he adds, only 0.0006 percent of venture capital in the United States goes to Black women.)Khanna proposes “technology hubs” in the Midwest and South to spread the benefits — by supporting research and career training — while remaining pro-growth. He is particularly strong on preventing data discrimination, potentially the most socially disruptive element of artificial intelligence. “Ultimately, there must be clear rules that impose liability on institutions that use personal data in discriminatory ways or that rely on algorithms that further disparities based on race, gender or other demographic considerations,” he writes. Without such protections, algorithms will exacerbate the human failings that already pervade the tech industry.These days, almost nobody turns to American political institutions to figure out what’s going on or what to do about it. Trust in Congress is in collapse, and even at the best of times its members have demonstrated a limited understanding of technological change. (Remember Senator Ted Stevens’s description of the internet as “a series of tubes”?) But Khanna knows what he’s talking about, and it’s comforting to realize there’s at least one person in Congress who does.ImageAI 2041, by Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Qiufan (2021)Anyone who writes about artificial intelligence has to speculate; it’s the nature of the subject. But A.I. has a way of humiliating predictions. (In 2018, Lee predicted Chinese domination of the field, which the advent of ChatGPT instantly disproved.) But it’s too fun not to speculate, and “AI 2041” is self-aware fun.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLee, a Taiwanese-born, American-educated venture capitalist who is a prominent figure in China’s A.I. scene and a former president of Google China, provides the intellectual foundation for the book, but he was smart enough to join forces with a proper writer, Chen, a leading author of realistic science fiction, to articulate the visions of the future. Each chapter consists of a story by Chen followed by explanations of key concepts by Lee. The approach separates fantasy from verifiable information, which serves both sides well. The nonfiction isn’t lying. The fiction is backed up by facts.The range of the speculation is impressive, too, spanning continents as well as technologies. A Nigerian video producer generates deep fakes. Korean orphans learn from cartoonish A.I. tutors. In Sri Lanka, autonomous vehicles have unintended consequences. Lee's commentary tackles whichever technological innovation has inspired the story: computer vision, natural language processing, bitcoin security, etc.In other books, explanations of the mechanics of artificial intelligence tend to be either drearily technical or childishly reductive; “AI 2041” has found a clever way of avoiding both dangers. In recognizing that the deeper consequences of the A.I. revolution are fundamentally unknowable, it upholds Amara’s Law: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”There is so much more to artificial intelligence than the fear and greed that have dominated the discussion so far. Artificial intelligence is magical, mysterious and profound — and not at all easy to understand. The more definitive or absolute a writer purports to be, the less you should trust their work.These five books have the necessary humility to deal with the glamorous uncertainties. And they all uncover the strangest aspect of A.I.: Its problems are people problems. This is the ultimate irony of the new technology. The true gift of A.I. may be what it reveals about human limitations and failings, not those of machines.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 18, 2024, Page 12 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: The 5 Best Books About Artificial Intelligence.

						Generative AI Will Save  Us, Not Destroy Us

Comments 















During the past year, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with enthusiasts projecting that it will solve everything from world hunger to climate change, and detractors warning that it threatens humanity’s very existence—and probably your job. But what exactly is generative AI? In his new book, Generative Artificial Intelligence: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford University Press, Feb.), Silicon Valley veteran Jerry Kaplan explores the vast potential—and risks—of a tool that enables us to tap into the accumulated wisdom of humankind.Kaplan, an entrepreneur and inventor, teaches at Stanford University about the social and economic impacts of artificial intelligence. In his book, he explains why generative AI is a completely different animal.“Just a few years ago, most AI systems were tuned for specific tasks, such as recognizing pictures of cats or steering a car,” Kaplan says. “Generative AI is quite different, in that it’s much more general. The same system that can draft a college essay can compose a sonnet, explain how to change a flat tire on a car, plan a Thanksgiving meal, or offer love advice. It can also diagnose medical conditions, write a legal brief, summarize documents and meetings, and perform many other tasks that previously required human expertise and intelligence. This is a major advance that will yield innumerable benefits for society.”It also creates many new risks. “Any technology this powerful is potentially very dangerous in the wrong hands,” he says. “Authoritarians can use it to spread disinformation and suppress dissent; frightening new weapons will change the nature of war; and criminals can use it to steal, cheat, and swindle people on a previously unimaginable scale.” Kaplan is encouraged by the extensive work on creating protocols and procedures to mitigate these risks. In his own life, he has developed precautions, such as establishing a “safe word” with his wife to authentic each other and protect themselves from voice clones asking for, say, banking PINs.And he has good news: The robots aren’t plotting against us. Generative AI systems can seem human—for example, they can show empathy or lie to cover up their mistakes. “But they are not nascent beings with their own independent thoughts, feelings, and desires,” Kaplan says. “We don’t have to worry about them rising up and taking over, because they don’t want anything. There is no ‘they,’ so ‘they’ are not coming for ‘us.’ A robotic generative AI is not going to suddenly wake up, realize it’s being exploited, inexplicably grow its own goals, take over the world, and possibly wipe out humanity, as you often see in movies.”Well, that’s a relief! But what about our jobs? On this front, Kaplan advises readers to see generative AI as a career-enhancing tool, rather than a threat to their livelihoods. For example, as he wrote the book, Kaplan used generative AI as a copy editor that could suggest illuminating analogies or interesting turns of phrase. He also used it to create a short summary to begin each chapter, as he discloses in the book. He sees publishers using generative AI throughout the acquisition and production process—for example, to compare and contrast new book proposals with a publisher’s entire catalog. It will also help us manage our daily lives. Kaplan sees many of us using generative AI as a personal assistant that can renew driver's licenses, prepare travel itineraries, draft wedding toasts, and even tackle sticky interpersonal situations like dodging social obligations. “Your electronic agent will be at your service without judgment or disdain,” he says.Navigating this new world requires adopting a new mindset about what machines can do. “As during the Copernican revolution, when we accepted the idea that we weren’t at the center of the universe, we need to get comfortable with sharing our world with highly intelligent and perceptive machines,” he says. “I, for one, am looking forward to it!”

				A poll has found many university students use generative AI for their studies

More than half of UK university students have used generative artificial intelligence to help them with their studies, a survey suggests.A poll of 1,250 undergraduate students through the Ucas admissions service suggests that 53 per cent of students have used generative AI to help them prepare assessments.Of these students, the most popular use is as an “AI private tutor” with 36 per cent reporting that they used AI to explain concepts to them.Other popular uses of AI include suggesting ideas for research and summarising articles, the report found.More than one in eight undergraduate students (13 per cent) said they have used AI to generate text for assessment but they edited the content themselves before submitting it, according to the report from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) think tank.

The rise of generative AI tools - such as ChatGPT and Google Bard - has sparked concerns about cheating among students in the education sector.But the report by Hepi suggests that only 5 per cent of students surveyed admitted incorporating AI-generated text into assessments without editing it personally.The study, which was carried out in partnership with EdTech company Kortext, suggests a “digital divide” in AI use may be emerging.The survey, which was carried out in November 2023, found that nearly three fifths of students (58 per cent) from the most privileged backgrounds reported using generative AI to help prepare assessments, compared with just over half (51 per cent) from the least privileged backgrounds.Those with Asian ethnic backgrounds are also much more likely to have used generative AI than white or black students, and male students use it more than female students.The report calls on institutions to provide AI tools for those who cannot afford them - when they have been identified as benefiting learning - to prevent the “digital divide” from growing,It adds that institutions should develop clear policies on what AI use is acceptable and what is unacceptable.Nearly two in three students believe their institution has a “clear” policy on AI use (63 per cent) and their institution could spot work produced by AI (65 per cent), the survey suggests.Josh Freeman, policy manager at Hepi and author of the report, said: “Students trust institutions to spot the use of AI tools and they feel staff understand how AI works.

“As a result, rather than having AI chatbots write their essays, students are using AI in more limited ways: to help them study but not to do all the work.“However, action is urgently needed to stop a new ‘digital divide’ from growing. “AI tools are still new and often unknown. For every student who uses generative AI every day, there is another who has never opened ChatGPT or Google Bard, which gives some students a huge advantage.“The divide will only grow larger as generative AI tools become more powerful. “Rather than merely adopting a punitive approach, institutions should educate students in the effective use of generative AI - and be prepared to provide AI tools where they can aid learning.”A spokesman for Universities UK said: “The findings in this study highlight the importance of crystal-clear policies surrounding the use of AI and we know universities are increasingly focusing on this.“The potential risks and benefits posed by AI to higher education have been known to the sector for some time, and any new developments are closely monitored.“Currently, all universities have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own and engage with students from day one to underline the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided.”

The adoption of artificial intelligence has the potential to create millions of new jobs. (Getty Images/PinkNews)

 

Artificial intelligence (AI) will revolutionise our lives, and while AI may take some jobs, it will also create thousands of careers.
Thanks to the notoriety of ChatGPT, the concept of artificial intelligence is no longer some sort of abstract notion. While AI has been used quietly in the background on most social platforms, it is now accessible to everyone. From writing code to CVs and everything in between, people are using AI to make their lives easier. 
Many tech visionaries believe AI will have the same impact as the internet, smartphones and the mobile web. Rather than taking a Luddite approach and writing off the benefits that AI can bring to life, now is the time to adopt the technology – including work.
Along with machine learning, artificial intelligence is one of the fastest-growing fields in technology, and there are plenty of exciting career opportunities for those looking to future-proof their career. There are predictions that AI will create 97 million new jobs by 2025 – and many businesses are struggling to find qualified people that can create, train and maintain AI and ML systems. 
For those considering a career change, we’ve curated a handful of roles within AI that will be in high demand in the coming years. While these roles do require previous knowledge of computer science and maths, online courses and new certifications in the field are popping up just as quickly as tech advances. 
So if you are thinking about reskilling yourself for a career in artificial intelligence, consider these exciting opportunities.

There is little doubt that the emergence of generative artificial intelligence models will massively disrupt the future of the entertainment industry. This week, a new report outlined just how devastating the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) could be to artists over the next three years.
The report (downloadable here as a PDF) warns that GenAI “signifies a large-scale transition from existing techniques into new processes” and it will “likely rebalance the demand for labor and capital across the entertainment industries.”
For creative workers, this means they will be “facing an era of disruption, defined by the consolidation of some job roles, the replacement of existing job roles with new ones, and the elimination of many jobs entirely.” 
The survey was conducted by consulting firm CVL Economics and co-commissioned by The Animation Guild IATSE Local 839, the Concept Art Association, the Human Artistry Campaign, and the National Cartoonists Society Foundation. It polled 300 bosses from six entertainment industries, including C-suite executives, senior executives, and mid-level managers. It was conducted between November 17 and December 22, 2023.
GenAI Is Not A Future Technology – It Is Here Today
Easily the most alarming takeaway from the study: GenAI is not a hypothetical technology that could impact film, gaming, and vfx artists at some distant date in the future. It is available right now and it is upending the entertainment industry today. In fact, two-thirds of the 300 business leaders who were surveyed expect GenAI to play a role in consolidating or replacing existing job titles in the coming three years (2024-2026).
An estimated 204,000 entertainment industry jobs will be significantly disrupted by generative AI over the next three years. This figure doesn’t include freelancer and contract workers, so the actual number of disrupted jobs is likely to be even greater than the scope of the survey. (The report considers a job disrupted when a sufficient number of tasks are either “consolidated, replaced, or eliminated by GenAI.”)

Of the 204,000 affected jobs, 118,500 of them are in the film, television, and animation industries, which represents 21.4% of the 555,000 jobs in the three areas. An additional 52,400 disrupted jobs are in the gaming industry, representing 13.4% of the 390,500 employed in the sector. 
The most affected state is California, the hub of the American entertainment industry, which will see 62,000 creative jobs impacted, followed by New York (26,000 jobs) and Georgia (7,800 jobs).
How Open Are Entertainment Companies To Using AI?
Entertainment executives are literally frothing at the mouth to start implementing GenAI into their pipelines. Ninety-nine per cent of the people who took the survey said they plan to implement AI in the next three years. In fact, a quarter of companies surveyed indicated that they already had one or more GenAI program(s) in place, while 15% said they had concerns about GenAI programs and would only implement once those issues were resolved. 
One percent of the survey takers said they weren’t planning to use GenAI within the next three years. 
Who’ll Be Affected First?
Certain jobs in the animation and vfx industries will be more impacted than others. For example, among the one-quarter of companies that have already implemented GenAI programs, 44% of them are using the tech to assist in generating 3d models while 39% are generating character and environment design tasks. 

Further, 33% of the survey takers predict that 3d modelers will be affected in the next three years, while 25% believed that compositors were vulnerable over the same time period. Only 15% said that storyboarders, animators, illustrators, and look/surface/material artists woulds experience job displacement by 2026.  
Equally revealing is how entertainment firms are planning to use GenAI. Nearly half of respondents (47%) expect to use it for developing 3D assets, while 38% will use it for 2d concept art and storyboards.  Thirty-five percent want to use it for creating animated characters (synthetic actors, in their terminology) for film/tv, while 31% want to use it for writing scripts. 

More Takeaways And Conclusion
For its part, The Animation Guild issued a list of key findings from the report that included some eyebrow-raising responses:

Three-fourths of respondents said that GenAI tools, software, and/or models have already supported the elimination, reduction, or consolidation of jobs in their business division.
Over 90% of respondents believe GenAI will play a larger role in the entertainment industry, though only 26% of surveytakers felt that their company was fully prepared for the integration of GenAI into their workflows.

The report ends with this suggestion for entertainment industry decision-makers:
The future is not yet written, and it needn’t be generated by AI. It is important to remember that GenAI output is constrained by its inputs. If the responsibility to generate content shifts away from humans to machines, which can currently only formulate output based on previously created content, the availability and uniqueness of new content brought into the world will become more limited. It is critical that those in leadership positions, especially in entertainment industries, keep this top of mind and ideate on ways that new technologies can expand human creativity, not replace it

(Michael Dwyer / Associated Press)       By Christi CarrasStaff Writer    Jan. 30, 2024 9 AM PT      Share       Share via Close extra sharing options    Email     Facebook    X    LinkedIn    Threads    Reddit    WhatsApp    Copy Link URLCopied!   Print        An estimated 62,000 entertainment jobs in California spanning film, TV, music and gaming will be disrupted by the rise of artificial intelligence within the next three years, a new study says.Published Monday, the report further estimates that 204,000 entertainment jobs across the United States will be  affected by AI during the same time frame. A job is considered disrupted when a significant amount of tasks within that role are consolidated, replaced or eliminated as a result of AI, the study explains.Consulting firm CVL Economics surveyed 300 entertainment-industry leaders — including C-Suite executives, senior executives and mid-level managers and producers — for the study, which analyzes the impact and implications of generative AI usage in the business. The report was commissioned by the Animation Guild, the Concept Art Assn., the Human Artistry Campaign and the National Cartoonists Society Foundation. Advertisement    After a number of Animation Guild members expressed concerns about the threat of AI, the union intends to use the results of this study to inform its bargaining strategy and goals, said Brandon Jarratt, who serves on the Animation Guild’s executive board and AI task force. The data is a window into the attitudes and intentions of the most powerful people in the industry when it comes to AI, which Jarratt hopes will prove invaluable — “especially when it comes to shoring up our own contract language around technological change.”“The tool itself is almost never the issue,” Jarratt said. “The studios are always looking for ways to spend less money. And if they feel like they’re going to be able to cut budgets in order to meet shareholder projections or whatever, then they’re going to try to exploit that in any way they can — and that’s where the fear comes from.”            Hollywood Inc.   Actors and writers aren’t the only ones worried about AI, new polling shows  Concerns about AI are central to the current Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes, but Americans in other industries also are worried, according to a new poll for the Los Angeles Times.Aug. 6, 2023          Business   These filmmakers use AI. And they’re not ashamed to admit it  In Culver City, a gathering of indie filmmakers who used AI software to make short films takes place amid a broader Hollywood reckoning with automation.Nov. 7, 2023  In an industry already brought to its knees by the COVID-19 pandemic, overspending during the streaming wars, overlapping labor disputes and mass layoff-inducing corporate mergers, AI is just one more wrench to worry about for entertainment workers.The growing prevalence of AI has recently emerged as a source of tension in Hollywood, especially during last year’s writers’ and actors’ strikes, which culminated with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA securing limitations and protections surrounding the use of the modern technology in their contracts with the studios. However, those surveyed expressed less concern about the potential fallout for writers and actors than for other crafts. Adam Fowler, founding partner of CVL Economics, suspects that the gains made by writers and actors in those contracts influenced  what kinds of jobs survey participants viewed as susceptible to AI. Advertisement    “In terms of the specific jobs and roles that we ended up talking about in the report, questions about acting and writing were really much lower overall,” Fowler observed.According to the study, the job tasks most likely to be impacted by AI in the film and TV industry are 3-D modeling, character and environment design, voice generation and cloning and compositing, followed by sound design, tools programming, script writing, animation and rigging, concept art/visual development and light/texture generation. About a third of respondents predicted that AI would displace 3-D modelers, sound editors, re-recording mixers and broadcast, audio and video technicians by 2026, while a quarter expected sound designers, compositors and graphic designers to be affected as well. Only 15% flagged storyboard artists, illustrators, animators and look, surface and material artists as vulnerable to AI.“I was really surprised at the 3-D modeling being so high,” said Nicole Hendrix, co-founder of the Concept Art Assn., who called the results of the study “chilling.”“There’s obviously so much talk in the news about ChatGPT and programs like Stable Diffusion, so we were expecting to see anything with those platforms the most disrupted,” added Concept Art Assn.  co-founder Rachel Meinerding. “It was interesting to see some of these other positions that we thought were maybe a little further away from being displaced be so high up.”        Awards   Strikes, streaming and AI: Hollywood executives debate the issues that defined a wild 2023  The Times spoke to Nicole Brown of TriStar Pictures; Sam Register of Warner Bros. Animation; Jonathan Glickman of Panoramic Media Co.; Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment; FredAnthony Smith of SMAC Entertainment and Chris Hart of United Talent AgencyJan. 2, 2024  In the music and sound-recording industry, the tasks most likely to be affected by AI are voice generation and cloning, music generation and recording and lyrics composition,  followed by mastering, mixing and tools programming, according to the study.More than 50% of survey participants anticipated that AI would displace sound designers in the next three years, while more than 40% saw AI coming for music editors, audio technicians and sound engineers. Roughly a third of respondents predicted a similar fate for songwriters, composers and studio engineers.Meanwhile in the gaming industry, 3-D modeling and concept art/visual developing are the tasks most vulnerable to AI, followed by character and environment design, sound design, tools programming and voice generation and cloning, the report states.About a third of the industry leaders surveyed said that software developers, sound editors, special effects artists and software analysts and testers were at risk of AI displacement, while 20% thought 3-D artists, game designers, UI/UX designers and video game testers would be displaced.        Hollywood Inc.   Is AI the future of Hollywood? How the hype squares with reality  At SXSW, the annual summit of tech boosters, all eyes turned to A.I. — and, in particular, what the emerging sector means for entertainment.March 18, 2023  Overall, the study concludes that entry-level positions in the entertainment industry will be disproportionately impacted by the ascent of AI — a detail that particularly worries Hendrix.“When you’re looking at any technology that’s essentially replacing [or consolidating] a junior or entry-level role ... it is harming the ecosystem,” she said. “What does that mean if nobody’s really entering in and the bar is now this immovable wall?”Furthermore, the report identifies 72% of the entertainment companies surveyed as early adopters of generative AI, while 75% of respondents reported that AI had already facilitated the elimination, reduction or consolidation of jobs in their business division.         Entertainment & Arts   AI is Hollywood’s ‘Napster 2001 moment,’ entertainment lawyers warn   Actors fear artificial intelligence will replace them. Entertainment lawyers predict the future is more complicated than that.July 11, 2023  Though most survey participants noted that AI has also created and will continue to create new job opportunities, it’s unclear whether those new jobs will be accessible to workers displaced by the technology.“It’s not like the [workers in] roles that are consolidated and lost are going to be automatically eligible for those new roles,” Hendrix explained. “Those are different skill sets. It’s not ... a one-to-one conversion.”Jarratt, a technical director at Disney Animation, said he isn’t looking to dismiss AI “wholesale.” He believes there are ways that AI can be used to improve working conditions and allow animation staffers to focus on the more rewarding, artistic aspects of their jobs by eliminating some of the more rote tasks,  such as manually painting a brick texture on a wall.Ultimately, Jarratt said the Animation Guild hopes to “help set the industry standard for what kind of tools are appropriate and ... going to help artists, and which ones are going to hurt them and hurt their livelihoods.”   More to Read               Video game performers move closer to strike as SAG-AFTRA negotiations stall over AI   2 hours ago                What’s in the new IATSE deal?

","AI officer,Artificial intelligence jobs,AI jobs","Advertising giant Publicis Groupe SA made an unusual executive hire in mid-2022 - a lion-headed digital avatar named Leon who would serve as ""chief metaverse officer,"" guiding clients through the virtual realm that had seized real-world attention.","Advertising giant Publicis Groupe SA made an unusual executive hire in mid-2022 - a lion-headed digital avatar named Leon who would serve as ""chief metaverse officer,"" guiding clients through the virtual realm that had seized real-world attention.",,,"Advertising giant Publicis Groupe SA made an unusual executive hire in mid-2022 - a lion-headed digital avatar named Leon who would serve as ""chief metaverse officer,"" guiding clients through the virtual realm that had seized real-world attention.His moment in the spotlight didn't last long.Five months later, ChatGPT debuted, and the buzz that had surrounded the metaverse ever since Mark Zuckerberg rebranded Facebook as Meta Platforms Inc. shifted to artificial intelligence. Leon and other, human officers focused on the metaverse - an immersive digital reality where people can interact with one another - quickly became an endangered species.Executives spearheading metaverse efforts at Walt Disney Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and Creative Artists Agency left. Leon's LinkedIn profile (yes, he had one), no longer exists, and there's no mention of him on the company's website, other than his introductory press release. Publicis Groupe declined to comment on the record.Instead, businesses are scrambling to appoint AI leaders, with Accenture and GE HealthCare making recent hires. A few metaverse executives have even reinvented themselves as AI experts, deftly switching from one hot technology to the next. Compensation packages average well above $1 million, according to a survey from executive-search and leadership advisory firm Heidrick & Struggles. Last week, Publicis said it would invest 300 million euros ($327 million) over the next three years on artificial intelligence technology and talent.""It's been a long time since I have had a conversation with a client about the metaverse,"" said Fawad Bajwa, the global AI practice leader at the Russell Reynolds Associates executive search and advisory firm. ""The metaverse might still be there, but it's a lonely place.""The C-suite reshuffle illustrates the fickle nature of technology trends - and the difficulty corporations face distinguishing hype from reality.Most companies have largely moved on from the metaverse. The word was uttered just twice on earnings calls at S&P 500 businesses last quarter, compared with 63 times in 2022's first quarter, according to Bloomberg transcript data. That year, eight out of ten CEOs said they were either hiring dedicated talent with expertise in the space or expanding the responsibilities of their leadership teams to cover it, according to Russell Reynolds. All were chasing a piece of a global business opportunity that McKinsey & Co. consultants at the time optimistically estimated could be worth $5 trillion by 2030.Apple's decision to refer to its new mixed-reality headset Vision Pro as a ""spatial computing"" device, with no meta-mentions whatsoever, is another sign that ""the focus has definitely shifted,"" according to Nada Usina, chief executive officer and co-founder of NU Advisory Partners, an executive search and advisory firm focused on boards and the c-suite. Microsoft Corp. this month overtook Apple as the world's most valuable public company, largely thanks to investors' enthusiasm for its aggressive investment in AI. Even Meta's Zuckerberg - who once proclaimed the metaverse ""the next frontier"" - has recently focused instead on generative AI after spending billions on metaverse initiatives that have borne little fruit.All that has left some meta-mavens seeking new pastures or rejiggering their roles. Joanna Popper, CAA's chief metaverse officer, left the talent agency after just over a year and then served a stint as a ""board observer"" at entertainment-focused AI startup Metaphysic.ai, which has a partnership with CAA. (Popper did not respond to a request for comment.) Pratik Thakar, who spearheaded Coca-Cola's metaverse efforts with its interactive ""Real Magic"" marketing campaign in 2021, is now global head of generative AI for the beverage giant.But not every metaverse guru can follow suit. The skill sets of artificial intelligence leaders ""are quite different,"" Bajwa said. ""You don't just want to repurpose somebody. You will not get the deep expertise you want.""At least one metaverse executive fell victim to a corporate coup. Disney's Michael White left after Bob Iger returned to run the Mouse House and axed White's metaverse department amid a broader overhaul. He's now chief product officer at the self-driving car business Zoox, owned by Amazon.com Inc. Typically, there's less palace intrigue: P&G's Ioana Matei quietly left the Pampers maker last summer and is now running innovation at a global agricultural firm. White did not respond to Bloomberg interview requests, and Matei declined to comment.Some metaverse chiefs remain, including Yaiza Rubio at Spanish telecom Telefonica and Nelly Mensah at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. But their expertise spans several emerging technologies, such as digital ledger blockchain. And even companies that want to explore the metaverse's uses may opt for a consultant now, said Aliceson Robinson with Heidrick & Struggles. ""There is still interest in engaging with consumers in the metaverse, but not as a C-suite hire,"" said Robinson, the executive search firm's global sector leader for consumer, technology, entertainment and media.Jeff Wong, global chief innovation officer at professional services giant Ernst & Young LLP, said his department has probably halved its metaverse investment over the past year or so. ""Some folks are making a joke out of it, like it's done and dusted,"" he said, although he's not one of them. ""There's a ton of promise in what the metaverse can deliver,"" Wong said.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com

Risks come in many forms – consistency, compliance, security, and infringement. The last threat, infringement, is on the minds of many leaders. What if the model builder trains its model on content to which it does not have sufficient IP rights? And what if the model generates content that is seemingly distinct and substantially different from the original work?

Indeed, many content creators are pursuing legal action against Generative AI providers. In 2023, artists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz filed a class action lawsuit alleging that Stability AI used their copyrighted work without their permission in training Stable Diffusion. Later last year, a judge issued a written decision dismissing all but one claim for direct copyright infringement on behalf of just one plaintiff but provided the plaintiffs with leave to amend the dismissed claims. Stock photo provider Getty Images has also sued Stability AI, accusing it of misusing more than 12 million Getty photos to train its Stable Diffusion AI image-generation system. On Dec 27, 2023, The New York Times sued Microsoft and OpenAI in a copyright infringement complaint that alleges the companies used the newspaper’s content to train large language models. In early January, two nonfiction book authors filed a class-action complaint against Microsoft and Open AI, alleging that they “simply stole” their work. These complaints may take a while to clear the legal system, and the first lawsuit above may indicate how the judges will rule in future cases.


While the resolution of these claims is unclear, are there any ways to mitigate risk in the interim? For example, one simple way of reducing the copyright infringement risk is for end users to avoid making specific references to known and famous works, authors, or painters when drafting prompts. While such prompt engineering may not eliminate the risk, it reduces the likelihood that the generated output would resample a copyright-protected work.

Here are a few other tactics that various organizations have proposed.

They simply indemnify you
PROMOTED
When sued for copyright infringement, Microsoft indemnifies commercial customers of its Copilot tools, which provide generative AI assistance as part of Office, GitHub, and other products. Microsoft calls this the Customer Copyright Commitment, and they require that customers implement their guardrails and commitments to qualify. For example, for text generation such as “journalistic content, writing assistance, or other open text generation scenarios,” Microsoft requires specific content filter settings. “The protected material text model must be configured in filter mode. The jailbreak model must be configured in filter mode.” Like Microsoft, OpenAI offers the indemnifying “Copyright Shield,” but requires users to meet some limitations and expectations to qualify for that protection — as do Amazon, Google, and IBM. As Generative AI providers are in a much better position to know the content on which their models are trained, indemnification provides one level of protection to the users. These indemnifications may cover damages and legal costs up to a certain dollar limit. But could the user still be stuck with hefty fees?
They secure sufficient IP rights in the content they use for training or delivery of their models
Generative AI providers use three different approaches to secure the necessary IP rights in the training content. Providers may (i) negotiate with content providers to use copyrighted material, (ii) train the models on material they own, (iii) or pay content providers whenever their content or likeness is used.

Some generative AI providers are trying to negotiate deals with content creators so that content may be used to train models without fear of infringement action. Open AI reportedly had months of negotiations with NYT and others. According to numerous reports, OpenAI has offered between $1 million and $5 million yearly to license copyrighted news articles to train its AI models.

In some instances, content creators — more aptly called content distributors — are building their own generative AI. Getty Images launched Generative AI by iStock for a segment of their customers, including small businesses, designers, and marketers. These generative AI models were trained exclusively using proprietary data from Getty Images’ creative libraries. Getty Images wants its customers to be confident in the content they are generating. Similarly, Adobe launched Adobe Firefly, its generative AI tool trained on Adobe stock images and other licensed content.

As another example, a training company that uses Avatars to deliver training programs hired human actors (most AI avatars are based on real people) with the explicit idea that when a client uses an actor’s likeness to provide training, the actor will get paid for such use.
Will Open Source protect you?
Using open-source models does not limit copyright infringement risk in all instances. AI-generated content produced by open-source models may still be subject to copyright infringement actions. The AI model itself doesn't determine whether the output infringes on anyone’s copyright; instead, the copyright infringement risk arises from the use of copyright-protected content as part of training data and its relationship to model output. But does the risk increase because none of the major players have negotiated agreements with content providers?
Given where we are, what would it take for organizations to use generative AI in content generation? Are the assurances from Big Tech enough, or would organizations want more assurances? Would they naturally limit the scope of their content generation workstreams?

SINGAPORE: Like many other nurses in Southeast Asia, Mr Muhammad Asyraaf bears the brunt of the perennial manpower crunch in the healthcare industry. 
“Nurses have so much to do. We are always running around … and just rushing for time,” said the 25-year-old senior staff nurse, who works in a Singapore hospital.Advertisement 












The shortage of doctors and nurses in the region is well documented. In Java, Indonesia, for example, there are approximately only 22 medical specialists for every 100,000 residents, according to state news agency Antara.
Meanwhile, Thailand reportedly sees up to 7,000 nurse resignations at state-run hospitals annually despite a yearly increase of 10,000 new nursing graduates.
The typical result is a heavier burden for healthcare workers who stay on as they hold the fort.
This is where artificial intelligence (AI) can lighten the load - and it’s already being put into action, be it handling administrative tasks or expediting health screenings.
But even as AI shapes up to be a remedy for the overworked, concern is also growing over its rapid advance. A key worry often voiced is: “Will AI steal our jobs?”Advertisement 












To Mr Asyraaf, the answer is no. “AI can never take over what we're doing because our work as nurses involves feelings; it involves a human touch. These are things that AI can never do,” he stressed.

This sentiment is shared by call centre agents in the Philippines, even as worries mount that generative AI will replace the roughly 1.6 million workers in the wider business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. 
Currently, jobs around the world are enhanced rather than threatened by AI, said Dr Pranpreya Sriwannawit Lundberg - the Director of International Policy Partnership at the Office of National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council (NXPO) in Thailand. 
But this could change by 2040, when the capabilities of AI become equivalent to those of humans, she warned.
“Within these two decades, we have to learn how to live with and utilise AI so that it benefits rather than controls us,” said Dr Lundberg.  Advertisement 












HIGH-TECH HELP FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS
After more than three years of working as a nurse in the fast-paced general surgical high-dependency unit, Mr Asyraaf told CNA that his compassion in nursing is slowly dwindling. 
He cited the various administrative tasks that nurses must do, such as drafting shift handover notes and writing up patient risk assessments, all taking up time which could be better spent tending to patients.
“There’s no sincerity sometimes when we are doing our work because we are just rushing. There's always no time for us to sit down with the patient and talk to them. I guess that's not a nurse’s role anymore,” said Mr Asyraaf. 
He hopes AI can eventually handle all the administrative and routine tasks, so nurses like him can do more to help patients emotionally and psychologically.
Many AI tools developed for the industry are precisely aimed at taking on such “tedious tasks” so as to ease the heavy workload of health workers, said Dr Feng Mengling, an assistant professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in Singapore.Advertisement 












“(This is) so they can have more time to provide personal care for the patients,” he added.
In the region, healthcare institutions like the Siloam Sri Wijaya Hospital in Palembang, Indonesia and the National Kidney Transplant Institute (NKTI) in Manila, Philippines have incorporated an AI chat assistant in their daily operations.

Dr Romina Danguilan, the Deputy Executive Director for Medical Services at NKTI, told CNA the high-tech tool has replaced about 80 per cent of the work of contacting patients and doing follow-ups in the hospital’s peritoneal dialysis division.
“(Through weekly checkups with patients), the bot has prompts to ask the patients how they're doing and how they're feeling. A lot of manpower has been freed now. 
“The wonderful thing is that the medical personnel can still evaluate by reading through the answers that patients give and act on it if needed,” said Dr Danguilan.

At Siloam Sri Wijaya Hospital, the AI chat assistant does the work of sending out reminders to parents about their babies’ vaccination appointments.
“We have a lot of babies born in the hospital. Probably more than 100 babies in a month so it’s really hard for us to keep track of each and every one of them,” said hospital chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Bona Fernando. 
“In Indonesia, we have a strict vaccination schedule every month for babies (until they are) two years of age. So we just copy that calendar and put it into the AI, (which will then) automatically send the reminders.”

The AI chat assistant in question is the creation of Singapore-based company Bot MD. It’s used by some of the largest public and private hospital and clinic groups globally and in the region, including Singapore General Hospital, Siloam Hospitals, and Philippines General Hospital. 
Another AI tool called FxMammo - created by Singapore-based company FathomX - hopes to address the shortage of radiologists in the region and ease their workload. 
FxMammo utilises AI to detect breast cancer based on mammography images. “Our AI reads (the mammography scans) and tells you … the probability of cancer and exactly where to find it,” said FathomX CEO Stephen Lim. 
He pointed out that AI is desperately needed for radiologists, especially in dealing with breast cancer. 
“For example, for every 100,000 women, Singapore has 6.5 radiologists while Malaysia has 1.9 radiologists. 
“The fact of the matter is that there's not enough radiologists. We need AI to come and help; they are not meant to take over the radiologists,” said Mr Lim. 
With the help of FxMammo to screen the mammograms, the radiologists improved in their detection of breast cancer, he said, leading to about a fifth of time saved on average.

AI NOT SET TO FLATLINE HEALTHCARE CAREERS
Although AI can and has already taken on some tasks of healthcare workers, experts told CNA these workers are not in danger of losing their jobs anytime soon. 
“We are looking at a shortage of healthcare workers globally. This is the phenomenon, rather than physicians and healthcare workers losing their jobs,” said Dr Feng from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
He added that the COVID-19 pandemic further emphasised the labour crunch. “Even Singapore, a very well-off country, just can’t train or hire enough nurses or doctors for such a crisis.”
In the case of radiologists, Dr Feng told CNA greater demand for them in the region is to be expected in the next 10 years, especially in the face of an ageing population.
“I work with a lot of radiologists and the common feedback is that they are worried their workload is going to increase dramatically and that they won’t be able to handle it anymore.”
“There will be an even greater demand for them (in the future). I just don’t see them being in danger of losing their jobs,” he said. 
FathomX CEO Mr Lim said that while AI can do certain base tasks, it can never surpass a healthcare worker’s know-how, views, passion and critical thinking skills - all of which are crucial to quality nursing and doctoring. 
Similarly, Bot MD founder Ms Koh said AI can never truly replace the art of doctoring. 
“For example, reading a patient’s body language or the subtle cues - these are things (that are) hard for a computer to learn but a doctor can recognise them immediately.  
“We have seen many instances where patients prefer to call or speak to a human doctor or a nurse because that lends more comfort or builds more confidence in trusting the diagnosis or treatment being presented to them,” she told CNA.

WHAT ABOUT CALL CENTRE WORKERS?
While AI looks set to help rather than replace healthcare workers, the same can’t be said for other industries.
In the Philippines, the rise of generative AI has sparked worries that AI chatbots will displace call centre workers.
With generative AI, issues previously encountered - such as the perceived lack of empathy of automated chatbots - are being resolved. 
In May last year, one senator called for an inquiry into the uses of AI and the potential displacement of workers, especially in the BPO and original equipment manufacturing industries. 
Ms Imee Marcos cited an Oxford Economics and Cisco study, which found that digital automation could render approximately 1.1 million jobs in the Philippines obsolete by 2028.
Despite such worries, call centre workers told CNA they are not concerned about AI taking over their jobs, at least in the near future. 
Ms Andie, 33, has been working as a call centre agent for 12 years in the Philippines. She noted that customers still prefer to speak to a live agent instead of an AI chatbot, especially when it comes to more complex issues like billing or technical issues.
“They want a detailed explanation regarding their bills or they want to be walked through on certain technical issues,” explained Ms Andie.

People who are looking to enter the BPO industry are also unfazed by AI.
“As far as I know, the job becomes easier when it is done by chatbots or AI technology,” said Ms Angeline Panerio, 19, who has been job hunting since August last year.
India-based AI chatbot company Haptik said that it views the BPO market “through a lens of complementarity rather than replacement”. 
“AI tools in Haptik's vision are designed to work … with human agents (by) handling routine tasks, thereby allowing human representatives to focus on more complex … interactions that require a personal touch,” said Haptik’s director of growth, Ms Nameer Khan. 
She added that there is also significant potential for collaboration between BPO call centres and enterprise AI assistants like Haptik. 
Ms Khan noted that one possibility is by using generative AI to interpret the customer’s text, tone, and voice in order to analyse real-time customer sentiment and help contact centres identify and address customer concerns. 
BPO firms themselves have also incorporated AI into their businesses. Among them is Concentrix, one of the biggest BPO companies in the Philippines.

Mr Amit Jagga, senior vice president and country leader of Concentrix Philippines, told CNA it uses AI to improve its advisors’ accuracy and productivity as well as to create more personalised and meaningful customer experiences.
He brought up an example where a technology company’s support advisors were struggling to navigate a complex landscape of products.
“We developed a generative AI application in just three weeks that allowed them to swiftly tackle technical queries with AI assistance. 
“Advisor productivity soared by 65 per cent and query response times were slashed by four minutes, resulting in better customer experience as well as substantial cost savings,” he said. 
When asked if Concentrix has had to hire fewer people over the years due to the rise of AI chatbots, Mr Jagga said this was not the case, adding that Concentrix in the Philippines continues to grow. 
“The human touch remains invaluable, especially in complex and emotionally sensitive situations. It is the combination of AI and the human touch that results in superior customer experience,” he said. 
Mr John Maczynski, the co-CEO of BPO advisory firm PITON Global, told CNA that human workers remain invaluable as they can offer empathy, which is something that AI can’t do.
“This human ability to genuinely understand and share the feelings of another person is something AI hasn't been able to achieve. 
“AI might be getting better at many things, but when it comes to the complex, and often messy, world of human emotions and subtleties, it still has a long way to go,” he said.

JOBS COULD BE AT RISK BY 2040: EXPERT 
As it stands, AI does not pose an imminent threat to workers’ livelihoods - at least in Southeast Asia’s healthcare and BPO industries.
But this could change by 2040, one expert warns.
Dr Lundberg noted that the world is currently at the first stage of AI - known as weak AI - where humans have more logic than AI. At this stage, AI is able to enhance the work of human workers and acts as an aid, she said. 
However, at the second stage - known as strong AI - where AI has a human level of cognition, jobs will be at risk. 
“There is already strong prediction that the second stage will arrive in two decades,” said Dr Lundberg.
As AI rapidly evolves, the race for regulation is on, with action being taken at global and national levels to avert the risks while hopefully reaping the rewards.
When asked if the development of AI should be regulated in favour of the livelihoods of human workers, Dr Lundberg noted that while this is an ideal scenario, the rapid growth of AI has outpaced the setting of rules.
“Regulation has to go hand in hand with technological progress but the private sector, where technological progress occurs, will not wait.
“What we could do is to accelerate the government side (so that it catches up with the private sector). We cannot slow down the private sector; it’s opposite from development,” said Dr Lundberg.
To survive in the strong AI phase, workers should also constantly upskill, reskill, and gain basic digital literacy.
For those already proficient with basic technology, they need to focus on upskilling and reskilling, said Dr Lundberg, noting that there are already various government-led initiatives in the region. 
Singapore launched an updated version of its national AI strategy last month. Among its plans - a tripling of its AI talent pool, and significant investments in adult education and training to reskill and upskill workers.
In Thailand, the government has introduced a tax subsidy programme for companies that offer upskilling and reskilling courses.

PITON Global co-CEO Mr Maczynski strongly supports the idea of the government stepping in with measures to build a tech-inclusive workforce in the Philippines.
“Initiatives like tech training programmes, motivating companies to maintain a balance between AI and human staff, and policies that encourage continuous learning and skill development are essential,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Dr Feng noted that many AI applications, like ChatGPT, are relatively accessible and should be used by workers to familiarise themselves with AI. 
“A lot of the solutions are free. Others may (cost) about S$20 a month, so you could just pay … and try it for a month so that you know and experience firsthand how the AI behaves, what it feels like when the AI gets something right or wrong, and how impressive it is. 
“We feel scared of things that are unknown but once you interact with it, then … you are no longer so fearful of the technology,” said Dr Feng. 
He also highly recommends that AI technology be part of the regular curriculum in schools. 
“Some training is required but not to a level where (they should) … suddenly become a programmer (and) start developing AI solutions. 
“I foresee by the time they graduate that it’ll be part of everyone's life,” Dr Feng said.
“It’ll be a common technology that in many scenarios, they will have to use.”

“Generative AI is likely the most significant change to work since the agricultural and industrial revolutions.”

Well, hold that thought, please. This statement out of Accenture’s latest report on the workforce in 2024 may be just a tad over the top, since we’ve been hearing similar pronouncements about work since the dawn of the information revolution in the early 1980s. But there’s little doubt that AI will substantially alter and assist the way work is performed and delivered. Call it the latest phase in the ongoing information revolution.


The question is how exactly AI will transform work as we’ve known it, and how people will be affected. For starters, AI, as with all other technologies to come along over the decades, is seen as something being pushed down the throats of workers.

Just the opposite is true with generative AI, however. Just about all workers Accenture surveyed, 95%, see value in working with the technology.

But employees don’t trust the way their organizations will handle AI — for example, 60% are concerned about job loss, stress and burnout associated with the technology.
PROMOTED
In contrast, fewer than one-third of C-suite executives, 29%, feel job displacement is a worry for their people. There is “a disconnect between workers and C-suite leaders as organizations look to capitalize on the promise of generative AI,” according to Ellyn Shook and Paul Daugherty, the report’s authors.
Both executives and employees need to prepare for the broader sweep AI will take in the near future—and again, its ultimate impact on work is an unknown. All the business leaders surveyed—100%—anticipate changes to their workforce such as growing or reducing headcount and implementing plans to reskill, the survey confirms.

Things have been moving fast—perhaps too fast for business leaders. “Gen AI took a few hours at most to capture the world’s attention,” Shook and Daugherty stated. “Gen AI’s swift adoption by enterprises and individuals alike underscores its ability to reinvent work, reshape the workforce and prepare people for a future that unfolds in real time.”

While the current generation of AI has addressed relatively narrow tasks and roles, the next phase will focus on “redesigning processes across organizations, as well as how people experience work,” Shook and Daugherty stated. However, two-thirds of executives admit they do not yet have the right skills and capabilities needed to carry out such reinvention.
Plus, executives don’t trust that their workers are ready for AI—36% believe workers will not fully embrace generative AI due to a lack of technological understanding, the survey shows. Yet most workers (82%) believe they grasp the technology, and 94% are confident they can develop the needed skills.
In addition, while more than half of workers, 53%, are concerned about the quality of output of generative AI, only 21% of C-suite leaders say trusting the quality of output is a concern for their people.
The growth of AI needs to be a collaborative, user-guided, human-guided process. Companies in the survey successfully taking the lead with generative AI—9% of the sample—“are breaking out of silos and building trust among their people by actively involving them in redesigning their work and roles.” Plus, these leaders who put people first—supported by AI—could create $10.3 trillion in global economic value.
Accenture based its insights on economic modeling of data related to gen AI, along with surveys of more than 7,000 C-suite executives and 5,000 workers at large organizations.
A people-first approach has yet to percolate through corporate ranks. While 95% of workers are ready and willing to embrace generative AI, only 5% of organizations are providing training at scale. The emphasis needs to be on “increasing people’s proficiency, and level of comfort, with the technology,” Shook and Daugherty urged.
Three likely scenarios are now emerging that may determine AI’s ultimate impact on work in the latter half of the 2020s decade:


The aggressive adoption scenario: Organizations will focus “entirely on cutting costs through gen AI, adopting the technology quickly (full adoption within five years), and displacing talent at a high rate. Displaced talent would transition to jobs similar to the ones they held, roles of equal likelihood for displacement, resulting in increased unemployment.”
The cautious adoption scenario: Organizations will focus on “automating and augmenting work with gen AI, adopting the technology slowly and cautiously to avoid displacing talent (full adoption within the next 15 years), but without a focus on creating people-centric approaches and organizations.”
The people-centric adoption scenario: Organizations will focus on “augmenting work with gen AI, while also leveraging automation use cases effectively. As they adopt the technology at a moderate pace (fully within 10 years), talent displacement is ultimately low because effort is placed on creating people-centric approaches and organizations to support both existing workers whose jobs are changing, and new workers displaced due to automation and moving into new roles.”


More than half of the forward-looking leaders in the survey—who ascribe to the people-centric scenario—are taking action to reshape the workforce by redesigning jobs and roles around generative AI. Three-quarters are enabling their workers to help shape these new ways of working.
These leading companies are twice as likely to invest in growing people’s soft skills, along with tech skills, and twice as likely to anticipate workforce productivity gains of 20% or more in the next three years, Accenture predicted.

Quantifying humanity’s impact on global warming – and establishing measurable goals to reduce that impact – often seems like the easy part. Understanding where and how to take action can prove more challenging. Through AI (Artificial Intelligence) and innovation, organizations are transforming the way we solve the climate crisis, radically changing the way we design, deliver and deploy the things that humans create – buildings, infrastructure, machinery, consumer products and more. However, for organizations to truly benefit from the value of AI, we need people with the right skills to harness its value and bring it to bear against the climate crisis. And we must bring the industry along, showing the value of AI through repeatable outcomes that lower emissions and lower costs. AI reinforces the criticality of upskilling, reskilling and training the future global workforce. Just as the pandemic changed how we work, AI is disrupting how we view the workforce.Have you read?Why a digital and AI-first approach is the fastest path to net-zero buildingsAI will be a hot topic at Davos 2024 – here’s what the experts are sayingThe promise of AIAs part of a broader ecosystem of innovation, AI delivers significant possibilities for carbon-reduction and sustainability applications. It can unlock more meaningful and business-specific insights and trend analysis. It can create — through generative applications that produce content such as designs, reports and forecasts. And it can do real work — autonomously executing business processes and controlling systems while learning and adding to its own intelligence. All these capabilities will be essential for creating and operating more sustainable buildings and other human-made environments – for helping us take more intelligent action and to do so more efficiently and effectively. But AI alone cannot create a net zero world and solve the climate crisis. Humans will need to combine AI with other technology to move the needle faster. We will need to integrate it with IoT (Internet of Things), digital twin, metaverse technologies and other emerging applications to create a deeper impact and accelerate action. Bringing together all these technologies requires new insights and action on multiple fronts. But the real need in the future will be reskilling and upskilling our workforce. From software engineers to field technicians, generative AI is becoming a core part of Johnson Controls’ operation — it’s being used in everything from developing new technology to predicting and preventing system failures or aiding those in the office to work more efficiently. Develop use cases for today and tomorrowWith AI, the applications for sustainability and carbon-neutrality are significant. Buildings represent 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve decarbonization goals, making our buildings smarter and more efficient should be the largest area of focus for the entire value chain, from C-suites to government leaders, to building owners and operators. It’s where they can get the most value for their investment — it’s good for the planet and the bottom line. The question is how we get there. A majority (52%) of workers believe that working with AI will accelerate their career growth; however, only 13% of the same cohort said they’ve been offered AI training. This is a huge opportunity for employers to lean in and assess the skills that their workforce needs. Research also shows that organizations continue to see returns in the business areas in which they are using AI, and they plan to increase investment in the years ahead.Despite these numbers, employees are increasingly educating themselves, as organizations start to contend with different rates of adoption. Moving forward, businesses will need to align capabilities with expectations for every role across companies and provide guardrails for the eager and risk-free opportunities for others. This period of learning and trial and error is crucial during this early phase of handling generative AI. Leveraging insights learned from experimentation will help build a culture of responsible usage and illuminate unseen impacts on the future of work.7 principles for human-centric AIGovernance and ethics are imperative to the future of sustainability-focused AI applications and the use of other emerging technologies. Johnson Controls has anchored its AI ambitions in a tailored and robust code of ethics that will guide the company as it works to make the world smarter, healthier and more sustainable — and the principles are a good starting point for any organization that seeks to ensure its usage of AI is as responsible as possible.Rather than being set in stone, these guidelines are open to evolving alongside the technology.Empower humans in buildings: Design AI to augment and elevate human intelligence and human work.Fairness and inclusion: Develop and use AI in a manner that minimizes the creation or reinforcement of unfair, biased and discriminatory impacts.Privacy by design: Develop and use AI within a privacy by design framework.Robustness, safety and security: Apply strong testing, safety and security practices to minimize unintended results or outputs from AI systems and to include appropriate human oversight capabilities.Accountability: Be accountable for how AI systems impact the world.Transparency: Be clear about when, why and how AI systems are deployed and help customers and partners do the same.Sustainability: Develop AI with sustainability as a focal point to help buildings and communities become more sustainable.Human-centricity is at the core of that AI ethics code, and sustainability is one of its key pillars. Ultimately, it helps ensure that AI-enabled solutions allow some of the largest and most complex buildings in the world to become more sustainable.Leaders: act now on AI, or risk being left behindThe future is coming fast, with AI and other emerging solutions continuing to evolve. As the urgency of climate change accelerates, organizations will have to accelerate their adoption of game-changing technologies. The hard part of climate action is getting easier, and we can expect it to become even easier as technologies improve and as more organizations successfully adopt these technologies.For many leaders, it may feel as if the future of the planet is out of your control. Just as the invention of the internet, smartphones and video streaming were disruptive, companies that do not innovate get left behind. Leaders must prepare for the future. Seek out training; consult with experts. In the end, the answer to harnessing AI is found within people, not machines.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Artificial IntelligenceSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesForum InstitutionalShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are evolving quickly, as is their adoption in organizations in every industry. During our recent virtual summit, Insights in Action: Unlocking the Data-Driven Potential of People at Work, a panel of HR, data and technology experts discussed the considerations and ramifications of how organizations implement generative AI and the risks business leaders need to mitigate along the way.
During the recent ADP virtual summit, Insights in Action: Unlocking the Data-Driven Potential of People at Work, experts and leaders from various industries weighed in on key trends affecting work today, tomorrow and beyond.
One of the most engaging discussions of the event is a topic that has captured the attention of many people recently: generative AI. This technology is defined as AI that's capable of using a history of input and using models and algorithms to create all-new text, images and other content.
In a session called Generative AI and the Workplace of Tomorrow, a panel of HR, data and technology experts — Lyndsey Benson, vice president of HR; Steve Madden; Amin Venjara, chief data officer, ADP; and Jason Albert, global chief privacy officer, ADP — along with host Chip Cutter from The Wall Street Journal explore the relationship between this new technology and the future of work as we know it. Here are some key takeaways from the discussion.

5 Ways to Support Gen Z Employees in the Workplace


Most organizations are considering how best to use generative AI
Exploration and education are at the heart of the current state of generative AI in the business world.
""Companies are trying to get a sense of what's really real with generative AI and where they can create tangible value for their customers and within their organizations,"" Venjara said.
Venjara added that business leaders today are prioritizing educational webinars and training, running pilot programs and exploring new vendor relationships. But introducing AI without guardrails could have some risks, so they're also creating policy frameworks that aim to ensure they're using this new technology in ways that are appropriate to their brands and safe for customers and associates.
""Education, pilots, and policy frameworks are all coming together to take the potential of generative AI and turn it into reality,"" Venjara said.
While the speed of adoption may be partly attributed to the excitement around new technology fueled by viral media attention, organizations using generative AI tools still need to recognize the unique responsibilities that come with early adoption.
Albert suggested some questions leaders should ask to guide their decisions around generative AI.
""First, ask: What use cases might this really help with? Where can it help me make things more efficient? Where can it help me generate content? Where can it help me sift through data and provide a more personalized human experience to my customers?""
Efficiency and customer experience, though, aren't the only priorities. Albert recommends that business leaders exploring potential AI use also ask, ""How do I make sure I use this in a way that protects my company's data and individuals' privacy? How do I make sure that I protect my intellectual property and put in place the governance structure to allow me to take advantage of those benefits while still having those appropriate protections?"" (Read: Generative AI at Work: Addressing Your Top Concerns)
Generative AI can offer multiple advantages in the workplace
The benefits of generative AI in the workplace are numerous. Organizations are continuously coming up with new use cases for the developing technology. Here are some of the potential key advantages:
Speed and efficiency
Generative AI tools offer ways to streamline processes, reduce administrative work and obtain data-informed insights faster than ever possible before. Saving time and effort can help teams do more with less, which is a crucial benefit for organizations with workers who can be freed up for other tasks that demand particular knowledge, creativity and innovation.
Data collection and analysis
Generative AI can help leaders gain insight into everything from buyer motivation to employee engagement. At Steve Madden, Benson said, team members are exploring how generative AI tools can improve the recruiting process by sorting high volumes of resumes. These tools can also help summarize and synthesize feedback from departing associates' exit interviews.
""There [are] capabilities with generative AI now where it could sift through some of the writing,"" Benson said, ""where people put their comments about why they're leaving, and [generative AI can] give you the three key reasons why people are leaving.""
She added that directly conversing with people remains a crucial element so that you don't lose the human touch, but generative AI can help you shape those conversations.
Streamlined processes and relief from repetitive tasks
Because these tools can help shoulder manual tasks, people become freer to invest time and energy in creativity and innovation.
""The goal is to make things easier,"" Venjara said. ""Remove manual tasks and make the system proactive – knowing what needs to be done and doing it.
When you have this kind of virtual assistant that takes care of rote tasks and then gives you reports and reminders when you need to act, you can start at the next step and build on it.
Say the system flags for you that an employee has reached a milestone that deserves recognition. You can take that AI prompt and turn it into a more human acknowledgment.
""You can do the job that HR is meant to do,"" Venjara said, ""which is to connect people, drive engagement, and foster a vibrant workplace culture.""
Ethics are a prime focus for early adopters
Organizations that have already adopted generative AI tools in the workplace are on the frontline in ensuring this new technology is used in alignment with their mission and values. The session panelists agree that organizations can benefit from supplementing an existing legal team by bringing in an AI ethicist or a lawyer with an AI specialty.
""AI is all about helping humans make better decisions and better predictions so we can take more impactful action,"" Albert said. ""That's the first part. The second part is having thoughts about ethics and compliance and having a transparent ethics program where we're going to be transparent about where AI is going to be used.""
The goal, Albert added, is to provide guidance to people so they understand how it works, where it's appropriate, where it isn't and the limitations of the system as well as having a security program in place to protect the data.
""The foundation of meaningful results,"" he said, ""is having compliance, explainability and transparency so that clients have confidence in the overall approach that's taken in the development and operation of the systems.""

It offers a certification program to identify AI companies that license their training data. The AI industry now has its own version of those “fair trade” certification labels you see on coffee.Featured VideoThe Police's Stewart Copeland Answers Drumming Questions From Twitter | Tech SupportTo earn Fairly Trained’s certification label, which it calls L Certification, a company must prove that its training data was either explicitly licensed for training purposes, in the public domain, offered under an appropriate open license, or already belonged to the company.So far, nine companies have received the certification, including image generator Bria AI, which trains exclusively on data licensed from sources like Getty Images, and music generation platform LifeScore Music, which licenses work from all the major record labels. Several others are close to completing their certification. The nonprofit charges a fee of $500 to $6,000, depending on the size of the applicant’s business.OpenAI— the world’s leading generative AI company—recently argued that it is impossible to create generative AI services like ChatGPT without using unlicensed data. Newton-Rex and the first companies to get Fairly Certified’s stamp of approval disagree. “We already think of it as a mandatory thing to do,” Bria CEO Yair Adato says of licensing data. He compares AI models built on unlicensed data to Napster and the Pirate Bay, and his own company to Spotify. “It’s really easy for us to be compliant,” says Lifescore Music’s cofounder Tom Gruber, who is also an adviser to Fairly Certified. “The music business really cares about provenance and rights.”AdvertisementNewton-Rex says it has support from trade groups like the Association of American Publishers and the Association of Independent Music Publishers, as well as companies like Universal Music Group. But the movement to overturn the AI industry’s standard approach of scraping training data at will is still very much in its infancy. And Fairly Trained is a one-man operation. Not that Newton-Rex minds; he still has a startup founder’s mindset. “I believe in shipping things early,” he says.The nonprofit is also not the only one trying to standardize the idea of labeling AI products with information about their ingredients.

Right now, many are weighing both their talent acquisition and talent development needs when it comes to AI skills within their workforce.Deloitte surveyed more than 2,800 director- to C-suite-level leaders from different industries and countries to inform its State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report. Because of the rapid development and deployment of AI at work, the company announced a move to conduct this survey as a quarterly pulse rather than annually.“The technology is unfolding so rapidly, you know, there is constant change in the constant best practices and lessons that’s coming out,” said Beena Ammanath, who leads Deloitte’s global AI Institute.More than three-quarters of respondents said they expect generative AI to drive substantial organizational change in the next few years, but only 47% of respondents say their organization is “sufficiently educating employees on the capabilities, benefits, and value of generative AI,” according to the report.“If you’re looking at completely new ways of doing business or new product ideas, you need a workforce that can talk the AI language, that understands the language, to have productive discussions,” Ammanath said.Right now, much of the AI-powered progress has been in the realm of efficiency and productivity, she said. More skilling is needed to really see how the tech could upend the workplace.Ammanth said that no matter the role at an organization, every employee needs to have a base-level knowledge of AI, and how to use it on the job.“Why does an executive assistant need to know AI? It’s not necessarily to build the AI, to design the AI, but how to use it in a most effective manner,” she said, as an example. “How to make sure…he or she is using the AI tools [in] the optimum way. Balancing the work between what he or she can do—or needs to do—from a human perspective versus…[using] the tools that might be available.”Ammanth said more employee training is also needed for knowing when to use publicly available large language models, such as ChatGPT, and when to use internal AI tools only available within an organization.Zoom out. 2024 is set to be a big year for AI upskilling. Companies like EdX, Coursera, and Microsoft are developing tools for individual learners and enterprise organizations to understand what skills may be needed to best work in the new AI-empowered economy.HR pros can help their organizations line up their people policies with best practices and ethical considerations for deploying AI at work.CopyYou might also like...TechHR pros drawn to good data analytics and training platformsAdam DeRose / 07.8.2024Total Rewards (Comp & Benefits)How one lactation company is advising employers seeking to comply with the PUMP Act Courtney Vinopal / 07.16.2024DE&IThis DE&I leader uses ERGs to make sure employee voices can impact company decisionsAdam DeRose / 07.16.2024Quick-to-read HR news & insightsFrom recruiting and retention to company culture and the latest in HR tech, HR Brew delivers up-to-date industry news and tips to help HR pros stay nimble in today’s fast-changing business environment.Try it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the introduction of ChatGPT, the healthcare industry has been fascinated by the potential of AI models to generate new content. While the average person might be awed by how AI can create new images or re-imagine voices, healthcare is focused on how large language models can be used in their organizations. However, the effort to build, train, and evaluate this modeling is only a small fraction of what is needed to reap the vast benefits of generative AI technology.
Consider the iceberg analogy. The LLMs, algorithms, and structures that a healthcare payer or provider interacts with represent the visible part of the iceberg. But as we all know, what is below the surface and not visible is significantly larger and more important. For healthcare organizations, what’s below is data—vast amounts of data that LLMs will have to be trained on.
This is where the healthcare industry has a distinct advantage because payers and providers are sitting on an enormous amount of existing data. In fact, the average hospital produces 50 petabytes of data a year. That amount of data is more than twice the data currently housed in the U.S. Library of Congress. Nearly 80% of hospital data is unstructured and most of it has been underutilized until now.
To build effective and scalable generative AI solutions, healthcare organizations will have to think beyond the models that are visible at the surface. Payers and providers will need to create a data foundation that addresses elements such as bringing in the right data, how to classify it, and how to create a data lineage so data sources can be tracked to address potential AI hallucinations.
Key elements of this foundation are data strategy, data governance, and data engineering. A healthcare payer or provider must establish a data strategy to define its vision, goals, and roadmap for the organization to manage its data. This is the overarching guidance that drives digital transformation. Next is governance; the rules, policies, and processes to ensure data quality and integrity. Data engineering is the process of collecting and acquiring the right data in the right format from multiple sources.
All of this data management work must be completed with intention and planning so your generative AI solution will perform as expected. Additionally, healthcare organizations will need to look at existing workflows, problems that they are trying to solve, and applications that need to be launched. For any healthcare payer or provider, your strongest business asset will become your data and your model, especially when unstructured data becomes fully integrated.
The need for generative AI data management may seem daunting. The good news is that what once was an underwater mountain of unstructured data that was inaccessible can now be surfaced with generative AI. Organizations will be able to access information from sources such as claims, eligibility forms, enrollment data from providers, and policies, along with utilization management data, clinical data, medical records, and contracts.
Today, data scientists and business analysts are the end users of generative AI. One day soon, generative AI functionality will become mainstream and will be integral to healthcare delivery. Every part of the patient’s journey has the potential to benefit from this transformative technology, from finding the right provider to improving the hospital administration process to discovering insights into managing chronic conditions.
Generative AI has the potential to transform how healthcare is delivered, managed, and paid.

                                            Ammaar Reshi
                                          




Ammaar Reshi, who works as a product design manager at the financial tech company Brex, used ChatGPT and Midjourney to write and illustrate a children's book titled Alice and Sparkle in 72 hours.   The book is available on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Walmart. Reshi told Insider he's already sold over 1,300 copies since Alice and Sparkle went on sale in December and has generated $2,600 so far, noting that Amazon takes a significant cut of the royalties. Meagan Loyst, the founder of an online community of young investors called Gen Z VCs, used ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 to self-publish a children's book in less than two hours. Her book ""Show Me What AI Can Do!"" is available on Amazon for $2.99.

AI tools are making it easier to overdub videos in other languages, which is a pretty lucrative freelance gig.











Content creators like MrBeast spend a lot of money on dubbing their videos into other languages.

Streaming companies like Netflix and content creators on YouTube and TikTok spend hefty sums on voice dubbers, who help them translate their content into more languages and reach a global audience.But AI tools are making it easier to outsource that task to freelancers. When YouTuber Kris McCauley wanted to launch a translation of his videos to Spanish, he initially turned to translations.com, a go-to among YouTubers, he said in a video. But the company quoted him $4,000 for dubbing 100 minutes of footage. Then he came across Nova A.I., a software that can translate and add subtitles to videos. Nova A.I.'s ""Pro"" plan — priced at $18 a month — allows users to translate 300 minutes of footage into 75 different languages, according to its site.McCauley mentioned he's saving hundreds of dollars with this new approach — though he's still relying on external dubbers as well. And he noted that an enterprising freelancer could easily turn dubbing into a profitable side hustle with a tool like Nova A.I.

Henry Williams, a freelance writer based in London, used the bot to generate a marketing article. To his ""horror,"" he said ChatGPT put together a 600-word article in less than 30 seconds.Williams noted that the bot's tone was inhuman and the structure wasn't particularly sophisticated, but the ""key points, the grammar, and the syntax were all spot on.""After a few tweaks, he said it was something he would have charged at least $615 to write.

""ChatGPT can write better cover letters and résumés than almost any person,"" said Brianne Kimmel, a venture capitalist who founded the firm Worklife Ventures.As the only general partner at what Kimmel calls a ""lean firm,"" Kimmel said that she and her team work with a lot of freelancers, and she pointed to freelancer platforms like Upwork, where résumé writers are charging anywhere between $25 to $65 an hour for their services.""I'm really excited about AI because I feel like finally there's this new technology that really helps anyone learn a new skill quickly,"" she said. ""And then there's new technologies where people can actually monetize those skills.""

Aspiring filmmakers with busy day jobs are finding it easier to pursue their passions with generative AI tools.











Generative AI tools are helping people put together movie pitches and animated shorts.
 
                                            Maryna Terletska/Getty Images
                                          




 Jordan Poblete, a corporate strategist with a penchant for movie-making, is using ChatGPT and Dall-E 2 to put together a pitch for an independent movie. ""Our particular fim includes magical realism or aspects of magical realism that can't be created in a real world,"" he said, adding that Dall-E 2 has been especially helpful in achieving the right feel.Poblete said he plans to pitch the movie to producers later this month. Though he said he's not sure exactly how much money the movie might generate, he's certainly hoping for a hit. Reshi used ChatGPT, MidJourney, among other AI tools to make an animated short within six hours. Since it was uploaded to Twitter last month, the video has already amassed more than 7 million views.
 —Ammaar Reshi  (@ammaar) January 16, 2023  
 While Reshi told Insider he doesn't have plans to launch into animated shorts right now, he said, ""If there's an idea that's inspiring enough that is worth monetizing (and I manage to find more time after my day job haha) then definitely!""

Tools like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have made it significantly easier to code via natural language.











AI has made coding easier for people who aren't super-familiar with complicated programming languages.
 
                                            GettyImages/ Hero Images
                                          




That opens up a host of lucrative side hustles for people who don't have direct experience coding in languages like JavaScript or Python.Ammaar Reshi, who wrote a children's book with ChatGPT, also managed to code two computer games almost entirely with GPT-4. 
 —Ammaar Reshi  (@ammaar) March 14, 2023  Reshi said he would type a prompt into GPT-4 like ""Add a high-score label that tracks the amount you've eaten"" and GPT-4 would provide the requisite line of code in JavaScript. Reshi admitted that, at least for now, GPT-4 doesn't generate the most flawless code. However, he does think the tool will make it easier for novice programmers to build out their ideas — and earn money for them.

Generative AI tools like Midjourney, Dall-E 2, and Tome have been game-changers in the world of graphic design.











AI also has helped lend a ""professional"" look to amateur graphic designs.
 
                                            OpenAI
                                          




Aspiring graphic designers and seasoned ones alike are now using these tools to quickly generate images for presentations, pitches, and marketing campaigns. For those looking for help getting started, Worklife Venture's Kimmel had a suggestion:""You can go on Upwork and bid on graphic design jobs. Then use DALL-E 2 to generate the original graphics."" Kimmel added graphic designers and logo designers can make hundreds or thousands of dollars per job this way.

For anyone who has a side hustle creating content, whether it's for a blog or social media, ChatGPT can be great for inspiration or even a second opinion.











Entrepreneur Chase Dimond uses ChatGPT for inspiration for his social media posts.
 
                                            Chase Dimond
                                          




Chase Dimond, an entrepreneur who earns seven figures through multiple income streams, uses ChatGPT to find inspiration for his social media posts. And Dimond, who has 100,000 followers on Twitter, almost 180,000 followers on LinkedIn, and 10,000 on YouTube, counts on his social media brand as one of his six income streams. Samantha North, a blogger who made $115,000 running two websites last year, said she uses ChatGPT to generate themes and ideas on topics or write introductions for her blog posts. AI has helped her to create more content without the need to bring on an additional employee or outsource work to other freelancers, she said.

Creatives are using a slate of AI-tools to generate new music — and even earn royalties.











Creators can earn royalties from AI-renditions of Grimes' voice with her new AI voice software, Elf.Tech.
 
                                            Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images
                                          




And oftentimes it doesn't take more than a simple text prompt to get started. With Google's MusicLM, for example, users can generate music from text and images. Similarly, Meta's open-source MusicGen can create about 15 seconds of audio based on a simple text description. Successful musical artists have also launched tools for creators to earn royalties off of their voice. The musician Grimes unveiled a new AI voice software called Elf.Tech that lets creators upload AI-renditions of her own voice and take a 50% cut of the royalties, according to Pitchfork. The experimental musician Holly Herndon also released a tool called Holly+ that lets artists create new music with an AI-likeness of her voice. And the exciting (or unnerving) thing is that AI-generated hits are going viral — and offering the prospect of even more income. ""It's honestly kind of scary how easy these things are to do,"" said Jered Chavez, the creator of popular AI-generated songs including a viral hit of Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and Ye singing the anime theme song ""Fukashigi no Karte.""

Earn money by building customized versions of ChatGPT and sharing them on OpenAI's new GPT Store.











HaikuGPT is one of the third party chatbots on the GPT Store.
 
                                            Screenshot from GPT Store
                                          




Anyone who subscribes to ChatGPT Plus can build a custom chatbot — which OpenAI calls ""GPTs"" — and share it on the GPT Store. Builders will be paid based on user engagement with their GPTs, but OpenAI has not disclosed further specifics. And you don't need any technical expertise or coding skills to build a GPT. Users essentially prompt ChatGPT with instructions on what they want their GPT to look like, and its ChatGPT will configure a new chatbot. Business Insider's Aaron Mok managed to build a GPT in 15 minutes with pretty satisfactory results. So far, more than 3 million GPTs have been created, according to OpenAI. They range from chatbots that analyze your horoscope to bots that help students with homework to ones that only respond in haikus.

Is Generative AI the Heartbeat of the 4th Industrial Revolution?

By Jeffy Jacob -   01/17/2024      3 Minutes Read 





Insights from the World Economic Forum, 2024
Several global chief executives gathered in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum 2024 to talk about whether Generative AI is the Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. A chief point highlighted at the forefront was the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI), drawing parallels to past revolutionary technologies.
AI on Workforce Transformation
The pervasive impact of AI across all business sectors is foreseen if the companies embrace AI technology. Julie Sweet, CEO, Accenture emphasized the need for organizations to re-skill their workforce to adapt to AI-driven changes and the role of leadership in understanding and operationalizing AI effectively.
She pointed out saying, “AI is important as there has been no single technology that showed every part of the Enterprise with a material impact with credibility.”
The impact of AI on various business functions depends on the necessity for companies to focus on productivity and embrace AI technology. Arvind Krishna, CEO, IBM mentioned the importance of regulating AI use cases and holding AI model developers accountable, advocating for open ecosystems to ensure widespread economic benefits.
He noted saying, “AI will bring about 4 trillion dollars in productivity by the end of the decade. Programmers or Coders who use Generative AI can work about 30-40% much more efficiently than one who does not. Embracing AI is the key. AI may not necessarily displace jobs, it will undoubtedly transform them.”
Democratization of AI
Democratization of artificial intelligence makes AI technologies more accessible, affordable, and user-friendly for a wider range of users. The democratization of AI technology through on-device AI i.e. those devices that directly interact with the users through the role of data access and distributed computing is key to proliferating AI.
Cristiano Amon, CEO, Qualcomm talked about Qualcomm’s role in bringing AI to a range of devices, including those used in industrial environments. The deal made with BMW to partner with Qualcomm for smart, autonomous cars shows an example of promise.
He says, “The explosion of Generative AI today is enabled by the ability to access data and computing power. AI is a different way to write software and an AI processing is going to be the next way of doing computing. It started in the data centre and will continue to grow in the data centre but it’s expanding everywhere now.”
Tech that transforms the Future? 
The transformative power of AI and its role in scaling intellect and enhancing global competition cannot be reiterated. Omar Sultan Al Olama, the Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications, UAE, discussed UAE’s proactive stance on AI, emphasizing its deployment in sectors such as oil and gas, climate change, and traffic management. Al Olama also stressed the importance of international cooperation in AI development, the need for AI education starting from a young age, and the UAE’s unique data set and infrastructure for AI development.
He said, “There are certain elements of AI that is going to scale up. Intellect & the brainpower that the countries have at the global front especially developing countries. There is an urgent need to embrace AI at this junction of time.
AI is not just a fleeting trend but a cornerstone of the future and if organisation has to succeed embracing AI is not optional but essential for future success.

Unless you’ve spent the past year under a rock (in which case, welcome back!), you’ve no doubt heard of generative A.I. and its potential to change everything from coding to writing text. You might even be tempted to learn as much about it as possible; if so, we’ve assembled some handy educational resources for you.

First, What is Generative A.I.? 

As the name implies, generative A.I. can generate text, images, code, and other media in response to a user’s prompt. The tech specialists researching generative A.I. rely on machine-learning models and training datasets to “smarten up” their respective platforms; with a popular generative A.I. product like ChatGPT, you can see how the system becomes exponentially smarter with each successive version.

“Generative AI holds enormous potential to create new capabilities and value for enterprise,” reads a handy generative A.I. explainer released last year by IBM. “However, it also can introduce new risks, be they legal, financial or reputational. Many generative models, including those powering ChatGPT, can spout information that sounds authoritative but isn’t true (sometimes called ‘hallucinations’) or is objectionable and biased. Generative models can also inadvertently ingest information that’s personal or copyrighted in their training data and output it later, creating unique challenges for privacy and intellectual property laws.”

Many tech professionals fear that generative A.I. will take their jobs. For example, they envision a future in which companies cut back on hiring software developers and other specialists because a generative A.I. tool can do much of the coding work. But there’s the possibility that generative A.I. will also create new jobs; for example, A.I. prompt engineer is a growing (and lucrative) profession. 

Where Can I Learn About Generative A.I.? 

For those who leverage online learning, multiple institutions have launched generative A.I. learning courses over the past few years. Some of these courses are introductory, while others are quite advanced.

Google, for example, offers the following online tutorials, which include videos, quizzes, and short lessons:


Generative AI, explained
Introduction to Generative AI 
Introduction to Large Language Models 
Generative AI Fundamentals Skill Badge 
What is Generative AI Studio? 
Introduction to Generative AI Studio 
Introduction to Image Generation 
Introduction to Responsible AI 
Responsible AI: Applying AI Principles with Google Cloud 


As you might expect, online learning portals such as Coursera offer courses from the likes of DeepLearning.AI, IBM, Vanderbilt University, and other institutions. Udacity is also offering a generative A.I. “nanodegree” program, with a focus on skills such as the OpenAI API, image pre-processing, and more; prerequisite skills include Python, neural networks, and more. 

But which of these generative A.I. skills will actually land you a job? According to Upwork’s August 2023 analysis of the generative A.I. market, the top 10 generative A.I.-related job searches from companies included, in descending order:

ChatGPT
BERT
Stable Diffusion
TensorFlow
A.I. Chatbot
Generative A.I.
Image Processing
PyTorch
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Bard

Whatever your tech specialty, it’s clear that even a baseline knowledge of generative A.I. can prove incredibly useful. If machine learning really interests you from a career perspective, consider mastering tools and frameworks such as ChatGPT, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

        The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on work processes is growing rapidly, while there is a shortage of skilled labour in Switzerland and the EU. How will this combination affect the labour market and inflation in the long term?

No, this text was not written by an AI. But it could soon be. Artificial intelligence is making rapid progress. 
+ Why Switzerland needs more workers from abroad
Not only could journalistic texts be written by computers in the future, but many other tasks will soon no longer require humans: for example, photo editing, stocktaking and bookkeeping. 
In the SWI swissinfo.ch podcast Geldcast, we spoke to economist Jan-Egbert Sturm from the Economic Research Centre at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich and asked, among other things: will there soon be fewer jobs? 
Baby boomers retiring
In the short term, the answer is no – at least for Switzerland. Because something else is happening on the domestic labour market at the same time. Something that has never happened before in the recent past. According to calculations by Patrick Eugster, a self-employed economist and financial market expert, a net 30,000 workers will soon be leaving the Swiss labour market – every year. 
The reason: the baby boomers born between 1959 and 1964 are retiring. And these people will only be partially replaced by young and foreign workers.

The bottom line is that there is a shortfall on the labour market. There is a shortage of skilled labour – and not just in Switzerland. There is currently a similar trend in the eurozone. 
This labour shortage is reflected in unemployment figures. These are still at a very low level, despite the very sharp interest rate hikes by central banks in recent years. 
In Switzerland, the unemployment rate is currently 4.2%, according to the international definition (2% according to the Swiss definition), 3.7% in the US and 6.5% in the eurozone. This is very low by historical standards. 
The labour shortage is good news for employees: they are gaining bargaining power vis-à-vis employers. 
In the medium term, this will lead to higher wages, write economists Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, for example, in their bestselling book The Great Demographic Reversal. They expect inflationary pressure to remain high in the coming years. 
Opposing influences
However, artificial intelligence counteracts this inflationary pressure; it weakens the position of employees in the short term. 
Anyone who can be replaced by a computer will hardly expect to push through a wage increase. This makes the production of goods and services cheaper, reducing inflationary pressure. 
But which effect will dominate? Will prices continue to rise because labour is becoming scarce? Or will prices even fall in future because more and more can be done by computers? 
The answer is not that clear, says Jan-Egbert Sturm in the SWI swissinfo.ch Geldcast. In the long term, central banks will be able to keep inflation close to the target value. 
In the short and medium term, however, this task will become more difficult because even central banks will not know in real time which factor will dominate at any given time. 
AI conclusion
Conclusion: artificial intelligence is accelerating change in the world of work. At the same time, the labour market is facing a potential shortage of skilled workers. 
The entry of boomers into retirement age reinforces this challenge and strengthens the position of employees. 
At the same time, AI is increasingly taking over tasks and weakening the position of employees. However, the long-term impact on inflation remains uncertain. 
And yes, the conclusion was written by AI. But only in part: it was not (yet) possible without the author’s revision.

Every year, after the inspirational whirlwind that is the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, I sit down to reflect on the themes that emerged during the week. Last year, we discussed the radical reassessment of how we think about work and jobs — what we called “Work’s Great Reboot.”


This year, that rapid reboot has been thrown into overdrive by the tsunami that is generative AI (gen AI). It has stirred up excitement — and deep anxieties — as leaders try to understand and prepare for its impact on work, workers, and society at large. Surpassing climate change, geopolitical crises and last year’s hot topic — crypto — gen AI was the hottest topic at this year’s annual meeting by a factor of 10. And this was the topic of the 9th annual Mercer/Oliver Wyman Forum breakfast, Tapping AI’s Power to Optimize Our Working World, in Davos

Charting the rapid rise of gen AI 

The Oliver Wyman Forum’s new report, How Generative AI is Transforming Business and Society, shows a staggering pace of adoption. In less than a year, 55% of people globally are using gen AI for their work. ChatGPT reached mass adoption in ten months, while the internet took 17 years, smartphones took 21 years, and electricity took 37 years.

PROMOTED
This blazingly fast uptake is consistent across regions, industries, and roles — however, it does not inherently translate to productivity. In fact, only 61% of survey respondents report increased productivity from using gen AI.
The research also reveals a striking gap between the enthusiasm of CEOs, 69% of whom see broad benefits of gen AI, and the 59% of employees who worry it will take their jobs.
This is not entirely unwarranted, as research from the World Economic Forum shows that:

A humanistic view of automation is essential if we are to harness the benefits of AI in a sustainable and inclusive manner that reduces inequality. The WEF’s Good Work Framework is a good place to start as we redefine the human-machine compact.
Managing human-machine synergy 
The integration of human and machine intelligence and the productivity gains that might result was a theme that resonated deeply with our panel at the aforementioned breakfast. Microsoft Americas CEO Deb Cupp talked about the transformative breakthroughs that have brought humans and gen AI closer, taking technology that was once the realm of experts and making it accessible to everyone.
“What I love is that a lot of people on the ground who are doing the job every day are the ones who are surfacing the best use cases,” said Deb. “So, although it's great that executives want to do this, the true use cases are actually coming from the people who are doing the work.”
Tanuj Kapilashrami, the Chief HR Officer of Standard Chartered Bank, spoke to the potential of gen AI to ""augment performance, productivity, and the work experience”. The fear of the unknown looms large, she said, but ""as machines get better at being machines, humans can get better at being humans.""
The democratization of access 
As many know, one of the primary benefits of gen AI is how it has democratized access to AI through the use of natural language as its primary interface. For Dan Vahdat, CEO of Huma Therapeutics, the rapid adoption of generative AI holds much promise. Underscoring the democratizing power of this technology, Dan made the case that gen AI is bridging socio-economic divides. ""It's a resource for all of us to use. And probably the best thing that has happened to the world since the internet.""
The double-edged sword that is gen AI
The inherent contradictions in gen AI were an important theme. Dan noted that Huma Therapeutics has identified a potential 10x time-savings for healthcare clinicians with gen AI — a staggering leap forward in productivity and efficiency in healthcare.
But Ana Kreacic, Chief Knowledge Officer at Oliver Wyman, observed that traditionally, such productivity savings have tended to benefit companies, not workers. “On the one hand, workers would love to have some free time. But on the other hand, when you look at history, many of the productivity gains that we've seen historically have gone purely to the employer.”
Reskilling and upskilling for gen AI 
The rapid advance of gen AI is not just transforming how we work; it's catalyzing the shift from job-centric to skill-centric models within an organization. When you get beyond the job to the component activities and tasks, you see clearly where certain activities might be substituted, others augmented, and yet other bodies of work transformed.
The adoption of gen AI calls for skills that are not always present. Ana noted: “40% of executives believe their workforce needs training or retraining. 98% of workers are saying, ‘We need more.’ The disconnect is huge, and companies need to do a lot more.”
The upcoming Mercer Global Talent Trends 2024 research underscores this, as only 45% of employees said they trust that their organization will teach them the skills they will need if their job changes due to AI and/or automation.
Organizations must start with skills, agreed Tanuj. ""I do think it's going to disrupt jobs, but the real opportunity that companies have is to stop thinking of the organization as a collection of jobs and think of it as a collection of skills. If we do pivot from job to skills, I think it can be a really exciting moment for workforces across the world.”
Rethinking and redesigning work for the gen AI age
The age of gen AI is already upon us, cautioned Azeem Azhar, CEO of Exponential View, and there is only a short period of time left before the technology no longer requires a human co-pilot. The panelists agreed that it is essential for companies to proactively redesign work to incorporate gen AI and not just leave employees to grapple with the change on their own. The quantum and pace of change requires organizations to design space for learning and well-being into the flow of work as opposed to expecting the workforce to singularly bear the burden of their continued relevance for a changing world of work.
Ensuring a future-ready workforce
As I noted at the conclusion of the panel, the rapid adoption we’ve seen in gen AI — just over the course of the last year — is only the tip of the iceberg. The WEF has already quantified some of the seismic changes it is bringing to jobs, with more than 75% of companies looking to adopt these technologies over the next five years.
It is going to be pivotal that we reinvent work models to bring our customers, employees and communities on this journey to ensure an equitable and inclusive future of work that appropriately balances economics and empathy. These are table stakes for competing in the era of gen AI, and if we can get this balance right, we can ensure a future-ready workforce that will thrive in the world of work that comes next.

Generative AI will boost new job roles and can help people with limited skill levels perform higher level jobs, thus reducing the economic divide , said Vishal Talwar, Director, IMT Ghaziabad in a statement.  According to the statement, highlighting the need for robust infrastructure and special provisions in the upcoming budget for Generative AI-related innovation, IMT Ghaziabad steered a key discussion on Generative AI's role in skill development, job creation, and business education transformation earlier this month.  The deliberations concluded that major Investments in Generative AI can boost employment and reduce disparities in society.  Talwar, emphasized during the deliberation that in the wake of India's ambitious AI initiatives, including India's AI Mission, the nation is poised for a significant leap in AI-driven skill development and job opportunities..  The IMT Ghaziabad envisions a future where Generative AI acts as a catalyst, not just for technological advancements but for empowering individuals with the skills needed in a rapidly evolving job landscape, he stated.  Prof. Mohanbir Sawhney Associate Dean, Digital Innovation, McCormick Foundation Chair of Technology, Director of the Centre for Research in Technology & Innovation, Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management said that Indian companies can level the playing field in Generative AI by using the platforms and tools already created and building upon those tools to develop applications relevant for the Indian context.   We have big problems in sectors like education, healthcare, agriculture. There are massive opportunities for solving these problems with uniquely Indian AI and Generative AI-powered solutions,  he pointed out.  Given the scale of these problems, he said,  I believe they should be addressed by a collaborative effort between the private sector, the government, and NGOs. We also need to create nation-wide AI skilling initiative to ensure that we are building the talent needed for the future.  Nitin Mishra, Chief Technology Officer, ONDC, opined that Generative AI can improve the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid.  During the deliberations, Raghav Gupta, MD, India and Asia Pacific, Coursera, focused on the role of Generative AI in making learning more engaging and widening access to high-quality education.","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dutch gov't sees risks & opportunities in generative AI; Worried about job losses




The Dutch government sees both opportunities and risks in generative AI, describing it as a technology that “affects society to the core” in a letter sent to parliament on Thursday. A big concern is short-term job losses, outgoing State Secretary Alexandra van Huffelen (Digitalization) and outgoing Minister Micky Adriaansens (Economic Affairs) wrote. The impact this technology will have on society must not be underestimated, they said.
“It has many consequences for our lives: how we learn and work,” Van Huffelen and Adriaanens said in the government’s “vision” for generative AI, such as chatbot ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney. The most real threat is how the work environment will change. “The International Monetary Fund has already warned that about 40 percent of jobs are changing significantly.”
“In the legal profession, they can use it to collect case law more quickly. In healthcare, doctors can receive support to make diagnoses more easily. But it also means that sectors are changing,” Van Huffelen wrote. Several professional groups are very vulnerable to the rise of generative AI, mainly people in creative fields, data analysis, legal work, and office support.
Most economists expect total employment won’t decline due to generative AI because the new field will also create many jobs. But the government is worried about short-term disruptions - someone laid off as an executive assistant can’t immediately start working at a company that builds generative AI, for example. 
Therefore, the government asked the Social and Economic Council of the Netherlands (SER) to map out how generative AI will impact the Dutch labor market. “How can we ensure that we retain jobs in the Netherlands? Jobs that are interesting. Ensure that our productivity is used properly and that our prosperity is maintained and grows.”
Creating policy in the field of AI is a priority because it is a key technology within society, Van Huffelen and Adriaansens wrote. The government wants obligations in place on companies and governments to protect people against the risks of this technology. 
One such risk is that AI is not developed transparently, putting user privacy at stake and risking systematic discrimination. AI can also be used to create and spread disinformation. The Netherlands largely uses AI systems from non-EU countries, the Cabinet members wrote. “That can pose a risk when these models don’t comply with our European standards and values. The challenge is, therefore, to create a market in which generative AI applications are offered that comply with all Dutch and European values and laws.”
But despite the risks, the government sees many opportunities in using generative AI, for example, in earlier medical diagnoses, more productive work, and supporting the cultural sector. While the technology isn’t considered sustainable in itself - generative AI consumes an enormous amount of energy - the government believes it can contribute to the sustainability transition, for example, by having AI analyze natural ecosystems or predict climate trends.
The Dutch government wants generative AI to be developed and used safely and fairly, always serving human well-being and contributing to sustainability. To steer the development in the right direction, the Netherlands must be in the driver’s seat, Van Huffelen and Adriaansens wrote. “Within the EU, we aim to be a leader in safe and responsible generative AI.”

A new survey of thousands of game development professionals finds a near-majority saying generative AI tools are already in use at their workplace. But a significant minority of developers say their company has no interest in generative AI tools or has outright banned their use.
The Game Developers Conference's 2024 State of the Industry report, released Thursday, aggregates the thoughts of over 3,000 industry professionals as of last October. While the annual survey (conducted in conjunction with research partner Omdia) has been running for 12 years, this is the first time respondents were asked directly about their use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot, and Adobe Generative Fill.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

Forty-nine percent of the survey's developer respondents said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace. That near-majority includes 31 percent (of all respondents) that say they use those tools themselves and 18 percent that say their colleagues do.Enlarge / A majority of game developers said their workplace was at least interested in using generative AI tools.GDC 2024 industry report
The survey also found that different studio departments showed different levels of willingness to embrace AI tools. Forty-four percent of employees in business and finance said they were using AI tools, for instance, compared to just 16 percent in visual arts and 13 percent in ""narrative/writing.""
Among the 38 percent of respondents who said their company didn't use AI tools, 15 percent said their company was ""interested"" in pursuing them, while 23 percent said they had ""no interest."" In a separate question, 12 percent of respondents said their company didn't allow the use of AI tools at all, a number that went up to 21 percent for respondents working at the largest ""AAA developers."" An additional 7 percent said the use of some specific AI tools was not allowed, while 30 percent said AI tool use was ""optional"" at their company.

Worries abound
The wide embrace of AI tools hasn't seemed to lessen worries about their use among developers, though. A full 42 percent of respondents said they were ""very concerned"" about the ethics of using generative AI in game development, with an additional 42 percent being ""somewhat concerned."" Only 12 percent said they were ""not concerned at all"" about those usage ethics.
Enlarge / Developer policies on AI use varied greatly, with a plurality saying their company had no official policy.GDC 2024 industry report
Overall, respondents offered a split opinion on whether the use of AI tools would be overall positive (21 percent) or negative (18 percent) for the industry. Most respondents seemed split, with 57 percent saying the impact would be ""mixed.""
Developers cited coding assistance, content creation efficiency, and the automation of repetitive tasks as the primary uses for AI tools, according to the report.
“I’d like to see AI tools that help with the current workflows and empower individual artists with their own work,"" one anonymous respondent wrote. ""What I don’t want to see is a conglomerate of artists being enveloped in an AI that just does 99% of the work a creative is supposed to do.”
Elsewhere in the report, the survey found that only 17 percent of developers were at least somewhat interested in using blockchain technology in their upcoming projects, down significantly from 27 percent in 2022. An overwhelming 77 percent of respondents said they had no interest in blockchain technology, similar to recent years.

Despite this, only 23 percent said they were either in a union or had discussed unionization at their workplace.

With U.S. consumers and executives both expressing worries about the impact of artificial intelligence (A.I.) in the workplace, the CEO of one of America’s largest consulting firms warned about ""long-term"" disruption.

WARNS A.I. WILL IMPACT 60% OF U.S. JOBS, INCREASE INEQUALITY WORLDWIDE Additional KPMG findings show 65% of business executives believe generative AI will have a high impact on their organization in the next three to five years.  In general, generative A.I. holds the ability to generate various versions of requested text, images, audio and other media forms. IBM recognizes generative A.I. as a &quot;deep-learning model,&quot; built with the capability to learn large coding languages. Arguing that the labor market is currently facing other headwinds, Knopp remained optimistic that the economy can absorb &quot;what may be a bit of a shock&quot; to technological advancements over time. &quot;You think about all the different emerging technologies we&apos;ve put in place over the last 25 years, and yet there&apos;s been net job growth and not net job loss. And I think that with every emerging technology, we have seen that over time. And maybe the nature of some of what people do changes,&quot; the CEO noted.  &quot;That same study said that these individuals [who] took the survey, that they weren&apos;t that worried about job disruption, they thought that their mental health would actually improve,&quot; he added, &quot;meaning that more mundane tasks might be automated, allowing them to do more valuable things in their work.&quot; Also chiming in on the &quot;Mornings with Maria&quot; conversation in Davos, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva raised labor concerns that jobs may &quot;disappear&quot; with the rise of A.I. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE  A recent report from her firm estimated that 60% of global jobs may soon be impacted by A.I. &quot;The report is a wake-up call.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and the rise of Generative AI (GAI) are ushering in a transformative era in the global job market. This evolution brings both challenges and opportunities, especially for those in their 40s, 50s, and above.The Shift in Job Market Dynamics4IR, characterized by the fusion of technologies blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, is fundamentally altering the way we work. GAI, as a part of this revolution, is automating complex tasks, leading to a shift in job requirements. Traditional roles are evolving, and new positions are emerging that require an understanding of these advanced technologies.Opportunities and ChallengesFor younger professionals and those entering the workforce, this shift presents an opportunity to dive into new, tech-centric careers. However, for those in their 40s and 50s, adapting to these changes can be daunting. There’s a misconception that learning new technologies at this stage is excessively challenging, but this is not necessarily the case.Lifelong Learning as a KeyThe concept of lifelong learning is crucial. Those in their 40s and 50s can leverage their rich experience and combine it with new skills in technology. Online courses, workshops, and certifications offer avenues to gain these skills without the need for a full-fledged degree. This approach not only enhances employability but also provides a way to stay relevant and competitive.Addressing the Over-60 DemographicFor those above 60, the scenario is different. While some may choose to learn new skills, others might find it more challenging or less relevant, particularly if they are nearing or have reached retirement. However, this demographic can contribute significantly through mentorship roles, leveraging their vast experience to guide younger colleagues navigating the 4IR landscape.The Human Touch in a Digital AgeDespite the technological orientation of 4IR, the human element remains irreplaceable. Skills like critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence are as valuable as ever. In fact, with the rise of AI, these uniquely human skills may become even more important.ConclusionThe rise of 4IR and GAI is not a signal for obsolescence but an invitation to adapt and grow. For those in their 40s, 50s, and above, it is a call to blend their experience with new learning, remaining flexible and open to change. The future job market is not just about competing with machines but leveraging them to enhance human potential. Embracing lifelong learning, focusing on uniquely human skills, and fostering intergenerational collaboration are key strategies for thriving in this new era.

Hearing Wrap Up: Developing AI Literacy in the Workforce is Central to U.S. Leadership in AI









Share via Email



WASHINGTON—The Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation held a hearing titled, “Toward an AI-Ready Workforce.” Members discussed with subject matter experts how to effectively train an AI workforce to ensure economic benefits from AI are broadly distributed.. Members also discussed how to equip public sector workers with AI skills and how the government can apply best practices from private-sector AI learning programs to the federal workforce.
Key Takeaways:
Securing and strengthening America’s lead in artificial intelligence (AI) is key to maintaining national security and economic prosperity. As AI adoption accelerates, that edge will increasingly depend on the global competitiveness of our AI workforce.


Dr. William L. Scherlis—Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University—emphasized the importance of the timing of this hearing topic given the acceleration of AI across industry and society: “The charge to this hearing focuses on developing an AI workforce that enhances American strength and prosperity. This could not come at a more critical time. We see an accelerating pace of innovation in artificial intelligence and also in development of a growing range of applications. We are already seeing transformative impacts on defense and security, and on economic growth and opportunity in many sectors – and these benefits accrue at both national and regional levels, and include the delivery of diverse cost-effective services directly to our citizens.”

Experts anticipate that AI-adoption will also impact the broader workforce by changing or eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. Maintaining the nation’s global leadership in AI will require education and training pathways to train and upskill workers for AI and AI-adjacent roles.


Ms. Timi Hadra—Client Partner and Senior Executive for West Virginia at IBM—discussed what IBM is doing in the private sector to move toward a more Ai ready workforce: “As an industry leader, we have a responsibility to help prepare the American workforce to capitalize on the benefits of AI. In 2021, IBM unveiled a global commitment3 to help skill 30 million people by 2030. And most recently, we committed to train two million people in AI in the next three years through collaborations with universities and with new generative AI coursework on IBM SkillsBuild4 – our online platform with free coursework for teachers, students, and adult learners. The IBM SkillsBuild platform offers free coursework in AI fundamentals, chatbots, AI ethics, and generative AI. The coursework for generative AI includes Prompt-Writing, Getting Started with Machine Learning, Improving Customer Service with AI, and Generative AI in Action.”

Member Highlights:
Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation Chairwoman Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) examined what is holding the federal government back from developing an enhanced AI workforce and ways it can navigate this obstacle.

Rep. Mace: “Why do you think it is so hard for the federal government to or certain agencies to adopt this kind of nimble attitude towards AI?”
Ms. Hadra: “It’s a challenging topic, I think sometimes as some of my fellow panelists have mentioned, we’re not talking across agencies, we’re not talking across industry, and I think it is important for the federal government to look at what industry has done and try to implement the tools that are out there. Like [IBMs] SkillsBuild, like the other platforms that are widely available, and start getting those in use sooner.”
Rep. Mace: “You also mentioned in your testimony that federal contractors are rarely able to place an individual without a four-year degree on a technology services contract regardless of their qualifications. Are you saying that the terms of the federal contracts IBM is asked to sign prohibit the work be done by those without college degrees? Does that inhibit your ability to fill those roles?”
 Ms. Hadra: “Yes it is an issue and let me explain: In my experience with federal contracts a lot of times you have labor category descriptions or requirements that say ‘if you have a cybersecurity analyst, these are the minimum qualifications that they must meet.’ In some cases, we have seen change, it’s not that the regulations are not being implemented, it’s just not enough…our cybersecurity apprenticeship program is a 6 month curriculum. Those people don’t have four years of experience, but they are immersed in six months and they’re ready to hit the ground running on those programs. But because they don’t meet that minimum qualification, we are not able to put them on that contract.”
Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) discussed how we can prepare and train our existing workforce to be able to integrate the education and tools needed to work in the AI driven future.

Rep. Timmons: “Dr. Scherlis, how do we increase the capacity of our workforce and separate that between the government and the private sector and then how do you develop our capacity long-term to be a leader in this in the global community?”
Dr. Scherlis: “Thank you for that question, I’ll agree that there is some separation but I think the separation is largely, arguable a cultural outcome. In government, it is really important to for us to have strong programs of professional development and advancement for our technology workforce, otherwise people don’t stay current. I think that it may be that many firms in the private sector and certainly in the tech sector, that’s an active element of the employer handshake. But I think what’s going on for example in the Defense Department…the role of leadership and the ability of leadership to think in imaginative ways, to think about what kinds of risks can we safely take, that can bubble down through an organization and effect for example, who’s involved with acquisition, with engineering, with developing strategy, with planning. All those kinds of positions are going to be affected by AI. So if we create an environment where we’re receptive to change, receptive to education and learning, I think that would make a significant difference.”
Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) discussed what processes IBM undertakes to train existing members of the workforce on AI which can be used a model for the federal government.

Rep. Langworthy: “How does IBM approach the process of retraining and upscaling existing employees.?”
Ms. Hadra: “Thank you for that question. Investing in upscaling and rescaling in lifelong learning is in IBMs DNA, and as we usher in new technologies like AI, we must ensure that both our employees and our society more broadly have opportunities to gain these skills. And we do this in real time. We want our employees to remain valuable to our clients, so we employ reskilling and upscaling programs annually.”

Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) has been significant. Generative AI, which encompasses advanced algorithms capable of producing text, images and other content that simulates human creativity, has rapidly transformed the technology landscape. Within two months of its launch, ChatGPT amassed 100 million monthly active users. Today, tens of millions of new users are logging in to OpenAI’s chatbot each week as new apps and use cases emerge.
As a world of possibility is explored, it is generative AI’s potential to deliver a step-change in productivity and reduce the ever-increasing ‘digital debt’ of emails, chats, calls and meetings that is sparking the most excitement for knowledge workers and employers. New research on the earliest users of Microsoft’s generative AI productivity service, Copilot for Microsoft 365, reveals that 70 per cent of users said they were more productive and the time to complete common tasks was on average 29 per cent faster with Copilot.

Quantifying the productivity benefits of generative AI
As has been well documented, one of generative AI’s greatest strengths is automating and augmenting routine tasks – from drafting emails to organising meetings, analysing Excel spreadsheets and preparing summaries. This frees up employees’ time, allowing them to focus on the more strategic and creative aspects of their role.
For example, generative AI can expedite the document preparation process, which is of great value to knowledge workers across all industries and functions. FSI professionals can use generative AI to scan market data, generate alerts when anomalies in risk metrics arise, and summarise the root causes and impacted segments driving the change in the appropriate document formats, to shape the subsequent action plan. Similarly, marketers can summarise articles to include in newsletters or create drafts of event invitations that can be quickly refined with their own creativity.
Finding ways to measure these time improvements can be relatively straightforward. Firstly, through anecdotal feedback from users – as it’s clear that many early users are eager to share examples of time saved in their day – and even savings of an hour per week per person can greatly benefit the bottom line. Another data-driven way is for organisations with Microsoft Viva integrating with Copilot for Microsoft 365, to use the new Copilot Dashboard that surfaces changes in productivity based on meetings, chat, email and document data (with comparisons for non-Copilot users). It will provide clear data to measure the impact of generative AI on common productivity areas and will often be what leadership teams and boards will be looking for to demonstrate ROI.
But generative AI for workforce productivity is about more than just unlocking efficiencies. Its ability to reshape collaboration and improve employee fulfilment and wellbeing are other important reasons why organisations are considering solutions like Copilot. However, measuring change in these areas can be more complex than simply looking at speed to complete tasks or quality of output – organisations must dive deeper into behavioural insights to understand the true impact of AI on their workplace.

Generative AI’s influence on collaboration and wellness
Data has shown that often a high number of meetings with a high number of participants, coupled with workday hours that span into personal time, can be risk factors for burnout. Meetings typically foster collaboration, however, not all collaboration is effective and linked to high impact or fulfilling work. The more meetings we attend – particularly if many of them are with high numbers of participants – the more time we may spend catching up outside of normal business hours.
Microsoft’s latest Work Trend Index found that we are in three times more meetings than we were in 2020, while productivity signals indicated that meetings were the number one productivity inhibitor. AI has a huge role to play in rethinking meetings. From enabling fast recaps to asking questions such as, “what were my actions?” or “what was the update on the project from my peer?”, meetings are no longer a single point in time but a digital artefact that people can interact with long after the meeting takes place.
In the research, early Copilot users on average reduced the time it took to catch up on missed meetings from 43 minutes to just 11 minutes – that’s four times faster than without generative AI technology. Whether that results in more uninterrupted focus time for employees to spend on the work that drives the greatest impact, or better work life balance, will be an interesting area to explore over the coming months.  
So how would you measure this? The measure of success extends beyond whether there are less meetings taking place. It requires a deep dive into the quantity and the quality of interactions, as well as how they contribute to employee satisfaction and risk of burnout.
Leaders should look at changes in the collaboration networks across an organisation in tools like Viva Insights to uncover trends and behaviours across the workforce. It means assessing things like changes in the time spent in small meetings versus large, workday spans, as well as how regularly the workforce has uninterrupted focus time. These insights can provide a picture into how AI tools like Copilot are changing an organisation’s meeting culture and collaboration effectiveness.

Who leads the charge?
The integration of generative AI into workplace practices marks a significant cultural shift. It’s not merely about automating existing processes but strategically rethinking how work gets done. This shift demands a thoughtful approach to change management, requiring organisations to adapt and evolve in ways they haven’t before. For example, instead of being methodical and structured in training employees for a new system, early adopters of Copilot found that it was more important to adopt a notion of experimentation, as well as a culture of learning and willingness to share knowledge that’s really had the greatest impact on adoption and use.
Responsibility for generative AI’s ROI is also moving from being the sole domain of IT teams to a more inclusive, cross-divisional approach. This means closer collaboration between the HR and IT departments to understand the full impact of AI on both the technological and human aspects of the workplace. The chief human resource officer (CHRO) or HR Director plays an increasingly important role in this context, bridging the gap between people and technology. HR leaders, with their deep insights into how technology is impacting employee wellbeing and collaboration effectiveness, will be important in leading the organisation’s adoption of AI to drive meaningful change in the workplace.
As organisations look to adopt generative AI services to support productivity in their workforce, they must start firstly with the privacy, security, and governance imperatives, and then incorporate a deep understanding of how they will measure the ROI and impact. By strategically approaching this upfront, businesses can not only track the productivity gains brought by AI but also ensure that these gains translate to a healthier, more collaborative and fulfilling work environment for their employees.

Helsinki wants to test new technologies and pave the way by improving the productivity of its own operations. The experiment also aims to develop the general competence and understanding regarding AI among the city's employees as well as support the use of AI.  
The Copilot trial runs from January to October and involves a total of 1,000 employees across the city organisation. The participants of the experiment consist of teams whose work involves considerable use of M365 tools such as Teams or Word. Teams that process personal data or are in direct contact with city residents have been excluded from the experiment because the use of the new technology involves legal and data protection issues that are yet to be resolved. Artificial intelligence will also not be used in recruitment. 
— Our goal is to learn what benefits Copilot can provide to make knowledge work more efficient and what work tasks the tool is best suited to. Our Copilot experiment makes us pioneers in Finland, as we will be among the first to test the tool, says Tomas Lehtinen, Head of Data at the City of Helsinki.
The City of Helsinki adheres to the ethical principles it has determined for the use of data and artificial intelligence.  There are eight ethical principles. These are human-centredness, transparency, explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, accountability and trust, privacy, safety, and human oversight over AI operations.

For years these Unpacked shindigs have focused on the latest hardware upgrades for Galaxy phones. But Unpacked 2024 saw a major shift, with software getting top billing for the first time. And no shocker there. These days, wherever you look in the tech world, you'll see hype about large language models and AI generators. From ChatGPT to Google Bard, all the tech heavyweights want a slice of that generative AI pie. So it's no surprise Samsung decided to jump on the bandwagon too. Let's break down exactly what Galaxy AI is, what it can do, which devices get it, and why it's so rad. What is Galaxy AI? Galaxy AI refers to Samsung's initiative to leverage on-device processing power to deliver AI features and functionality. This allows users to access certain AI capabilities without needing an internet connection. Samsung first hinted at Galaxy AI in November 2023, describing it as a combination of on-device and cloud-based services aimed at enhancing the user experience. The company has since developed the platform further, with the Galaxy S24 series representing the first real showcase of its potential. Galaxy AI consists of three main sub-models focused on coding, language, and imaging: - Gauss Code - Used internally by Samsung developers to generate test cases and annotate code. Gauss Code and its derivative assistant code.i help Samsung developers improve software efficiency. - Gauss Language - Powers natural language processing for chatbot-style applications. Gauss Language is tuned specifically for summarising, translating, and generating text responses. - Gauss Image - Enables image generation and editing based on text prompts. Gauss Image can create and modify images in a similar manner to leading AI services like DALL-E, Midjourney and Adobe Firefly. By processing data locally on the device rather than in the cloud, Galaxy AI provides benefits such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy and security, and lower data costs for users. What are the features of Galaxy AI? The newly launched Galaxy S24 lineup comes loaded with a variety of AI-powered features leveraging the on-device processing of Galaxy AI. Here's a look at some of the key capabilities now available: - Live Translate - Real-time translation for conversations using the phone dialer or Interpreter mode. This feature enables smooth two-way translations for in-person chats. - Chat Assist - Helps users chat in multiple languages across messaging/social apps. Chat Assist allows adjusting the tone and fixes grammar and spelling. - Note Assist - Summarises documents and creates templates in Samsung Notes. Note Assist can intelligently summarise lengthy files or generate new document templates. - Auto Replies - Summarises incoming messages and suggests smart replies. Users can respond to messages with voice commands to send informative auto-generated replies. - Transcript Assist - Generates transcripts for voice memos with speaker tags. Transcripts are instantly created for audio recordings. - Circle to Search - Lets users circle or highlight text/images to instantly run a web search. This feature allows searching directly from visual content on screen. - Edit Suggestion - Recommends edits to enhance photos. Users get intelligent suggestions to improve their images. - Generative Edit - Allows editing photos by generating new image content. Photos can be altered by removing objects or adding new generated visuals. - Instant Slow-mo - Converts standard videos into slow motion. Any video can be turned into share-worthy slow motion content. - Android Auto tuning - Android Auto will be able to summarise incoming messages and you'll also be able to send simple voice commands to share certain information, such as ETA. Is Galaxy AI secure? Data privacy and security are critical considerations with any AI system. Since Galaxy AI runs locally on devices, it avoids privacy issues associated with cloud-based AI. Samsung states user data remains ""end-to-end secure hardware"" with threat monitoring and protection. Users uncomfortable with Galaxy AI can simply disable these features entirely through the Advanced Intelligence settings menu. For those who enable Galaxy AI, Samsung states all personal data is processed in accordance with applicable laws. What do you need to try Galaxy AI? For now, Galaxy AI is only available on the newly launched Galaxy S24 lineup - the S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra models. Samsung currently provides all Galaxy AI features for free, though notes this is only guaranteed through the end of 2025. The company has also hinted that Galaxy AI will eventually make its way to other Samsung devices. How’s Galaxy AI different from Bixby? With the arrival of Galaxy AI, how does it compare to Bixby, Samsung's existing virtual assistant? Well, Bixby is Samsung's equivalent of Alexa or Google Assistant - focused on answering questions, controlling devices, and accessing information. Galaxy AI, on the other hand, represents a new generation of on-device AI that powers features like real-time translation and image generation. As Samsung moves away from Bixby, Galaxy AI appears positioned as its replacement over time. For now, both AI systems coexist within Samsung's ecosystem.","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,,,,,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-23,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/galaxy-ai-featured.jpg', 'caption': 'Real-time translation, automated replies, and more.

The company, which had disclosed a few months ago about being engaged in 250 generative AI powered projects, is also using the intelligence gleaned from Gen AI for making its ongoing work for clients faster, he added.Talking about the transformative potential of Gen AI, Ganesan said, ""the huge transformation that we also talk about that supplements assets and augment come by"" is just around the corner. He, however, did not provide a specific timeline, preferring to adopt a ""wait and watch"" approach to observe the technology's trajectory.TCS is actively preparing for the future of AI by investing in two key areas: Workforce training and strategic partnerships. The company is rapidly upskilling its employees, with over 150,000 said to be already trained in Gen AI skills in the last seven months. Optimism mixed with cautionWhen questioned about the potential impact of readily available consumer-grade AI tools like ChatGPT, Ganesan highlighted the complexities involved in enterprise-grade Gen AI solutions. He emphasised the need for rigorous security measures, data confidentiality, and robust architecture to ensure successful implementation and value generation. Gen AI solutions require a lot of rigour and are complex ones to execute, he added.TCS' chief technology officer Harrick Vin said, ""We are very confident to create one of the world's largest AI-ready workforce for the future so that I think we can safely say that with a high degree of confidence.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/106933790'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a veteran-founded business that contracts with companies on data problems and projects. Its core product, the Semantic Knowledge Graph, is a data engineering platform that uses natural language processing. It enables machine learning and AI “for autonomous systems, financial intelligence, logistics and other data challenges,” according to a release. It will be implementing that technology on a specific Air Force problem.

AI is producing ‘fake’ Indigenous art trained on real artists’ work without permission
One Indigenous artist said the process of using their art to train AI models that competes with them for work is a ‘very colonial mindset’.

 Artificial intelligence-generated 'Indigenous art' images for sale on Adobe's stock image platform (Image: Adobe)

People are training artificial intelligence on Indigenous art without the artists’ permission to create inauthentic works, which are selling online on platforms run by companies such as Adobe and eBay. 
Indigenous artists in Australia say their work is being stolen and turned into another threat to their livelihoods and cultures while they are already struggling to compete with the tens of millions of dollars worth of fake art produced every year by non-Indigenous artists.
Among the many jobs affected by the rapid development in generative AI, few have been as directly and immediately affected as visual arts workers. Usually trained on data scraped from the internet without permission, publicly available text-to-image generators let anyone produce instantaneously new images with just a few words.

While this new technology does add to the artist’s toolbox, workers say that AI is already taking their jobs. A group of researchers from Washington University and New York University analysed data from popular freelance platform Upwork and found that freelancers are already experiencing less employment and income since the launch of ChatGPT. 
Now, AI-generated Indigenous art is appearing on online marketplaces where art and derivative products are sold — often directly competing with the work from real Indigenous artists — despite the platforms often having policies that are supposed to protect Indigenous culture.
Both Adobe and Shutterstock run popular stock image websites where people can buy AI-generated images for a variety of commercial purposes. On each of them, there are dozens of fake Indigenous art-style images for sale (that have been marked on the platform as AI-generated). 
While many images are vaguely listed as being “Aboriginal” or “Indigenous”, some are more specific, like a Shutterstock image based on a prompt “Australian Aboriginal Art showing Gwion Gwion Bradshaw figures and Wandjina rock art depictions of the Kimberley Region in Western Australia”.
Adobe allows people to upload AI images for sale and earn money every time they’re purchased. The company requires sellers to only submit images for which they own the intellectual property, but it’s not clear how this is policed. Shutterstock sells images generated by users using the company’s on-site AI model trained on their images and as a result does not have this problem.

These images are already being used commercially. Adobe Stock image “An illustration based on aboriginal style of dot painting. AI Generative Art” appears as part of a graphic for a webpage about a panel hosted by the University of Western Australia on the Voice to Parliament referendum. Another example is childcare diary business Butler Diaries using an Adobe stock image as part of its web design. (The bottom of the company’s website features an Acknowledgement of Country that calls for the “continuation of cultural, spiritual and education practices” of Indigenous peoples.) 
These stock websites also feature AI-generated images of Indigenous peoples in the style of a photograph. They’re already being used on the internet, such as by the government-funded Mining and Skills Alliance, which features a picture of a generated woman to promote its efforts to “raise the profile of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women”.

AI-generated designs are also making it into the real world through other online marketplaces such as eBay and Etsy. Etsy is filled with cheap, digital AI-generated prints intended to be printed and framed, such as a $3.43 “Aboriginal Art print Australian Aboriginal Art Aboriginal Art Print Indigenous Art Australian Art Poster Australian Dot Art” whose seller notes in the listing “The images are my representation and I do not claim that they are anatomically or biologically correct”. Over on eBay, people sell goods with AI-generated goods like an “Aboriginal Art Culture Australia Cool Case Cover Silicone / Shockproof / MagSafe”.
Some of these platforms have policies that protect Indigenous intellectual property but it’s not clear whether they apply.

Adobe, which has a reconciliation action plan outlining the company’s various initiatives and objectives for helping Indigenous peoples achieve equality, has guidelines that state any content uploaded to its Stock service relating to race and ethnicity should be “correctly represented”. A spokesperson for the company didn’t answer questions about whether AI-produced Indigenous art violates this policy, instead giving a general statement: “We are continually auditing, evaluating, and improving the Adobe Stock collections to serve our customers’ needs,” it said.
eBay policies say sellers must not “list, sell or promote materials, products or services that use Indigenous cultural and intellectual property in an unauthorised way”, according to a spokesperson. Pressed on whether AI-generated art would violate this policy, they said how an artwork is created is irrelevant and that a listing “using Indigenous art in an unauthorised way” may breach it.
Neither Etsy nor Shutterstock responded to a request for comment. Etsy has a policy that prohibits users from selling items falsely listed as being produced by Indigenous peoples — but only in Northern America, and allows “Indigenous-style” products by non-Indigenous people. 
Amy Allerton is a Gumbaynggirr and Bundjalung woman who works as an artist and runs the Indigico Creative gallery, which sells original works and goods with Indigenous designs. She said art is hugely significant to her peoples’ cultures and that generating it through AI threatens the cultural integrity of their history.
“You’ve got non-Indigenous people being given the tools to create art based on our culture, which is a big no-no,” she told Crikey.

Allerton said the images that AI produces are “quite offensive” because of the mishmash of designs it produces. Many of the “Indigenous art” images produced by AI mix distinctive styles from different Indigenous nations and artists. 
Indigenous artists in Australia already face fierce competition from people producing “fake” Indigenous art, which are designs and products imitating Indigenous artists’ distinctive styles but produced by people with no connection to or with no benefit to Indigenous communities.
A 2022 Productivity Commission report found that 75% of Indigenous-style goods were created by non-Indigenous people. Online art businesses were particularly bad. One stock image site analysed by the commission had 80% of its Indigenous-style images authored by non-Indigenous people. Similarly, 60% of listings on a print-on-demand marketplace were also produced by non-Indigenous creators. 
Anthony Wallis runs Aboriginal Artists Agency, which helps artists earn income from the reproduction of their works. He said a significant amount of his work comes after the fact — when people and organisations use an artist’s work without their permission — and said it’s surprising how often enormous companies or important institutions don’t correctly license designs. He fears that AI will make this problem even worse.
“It’s frightening because it’s so cheap. It’s really dangerous from an artist’s point of view,” he said.
Allerton said it’s upsetting how AI models are being trained on Indigenous artists’ work without their permission and then used to generate work that competes directly with the artist.
“It’s a very colonial mindset that they are entitled to the entirety of us,” she said.
“Indigenous people don’t have the power for self-determination that we so want. This adds to the weight of all that. It’s like making me redundant. I think about myself, if I were made redundant, that would be devastating.”

There is a direct correlation between using artificial intelligence and concerns about job security. The more workers leverage generative AI in their jobs, the more likely they fear that automation may replace them. According to a December CNBC SurveyMonkey Workforce survey, 60% of employees who use AI regularly reported they worry about its impact on their jobs. Seventy-two percent of respondents who use the technology recognize that automation significantly increases productivity.


Last year, Goldman Sachs published a report that estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology. The investment bank predicts that the growth in AI will mirror the trajectory of past computer and tech products. Just as the world went from giant mainframe computers to modern-day technology, there will be a similar fast-paced growth of AI reshaping the world.

Automation In Today’s Workforce
Automation is already being deployed heavily in the workforce. Seventy-eight percent of C-suite leaders have reported that their company actively uses generative AI today, according to a survey by UKG, a human resources and workforce technology company.

PROMOTED
Seven out of 10 C-suite executives say enhancing their use of AI is a central priority for their business, with 49% revealing that their organizations have benefited the most—with increased financial returns—from AI integrations.

The Benefits Of AI
AI can streamline workflows, increase efficiency and optimize resources, leading to cost savings and improved quality of work. By offloading mundane and repetitive tasks to AI systems, workers can shift their attention to higher-value activities, resulting in higher employee effectiveness and a more engaging and diverse workplace culture.

AI tools can help with decision-making in the workplace by analyzing vast amounts of data, recognizing patterns and recommending optimal solutions.
With that said, technology lacks human wisdom and discernment, so some level of personal human involvement will always be needed. The purpose of AI in decision-making is not complete automation. Instead, the goal is to help humans make quicker and better decisions through streamlined processes and improved accuracy.

“People jump to ‘all or nothing,’” said Hugo Sarrazin, chief product and technology officer at UKG, “The reality is that it’s going to automate tasks, not automate a full job in most cases.”

Some corporate software spies on workers to see whether they ever write the word “union” in their emails.As technologies grow ever more sophisticated in monitoring, surveilling and speeding up workers, many workplace experts say US businesses, labor unions and government are not doing nearly enough to protect workers from tech’s downsides.“Workers are being constantly monitored, and AI-based monitoring tools can make mistakes that can translate into unfair pay cuts or firings,” said Virginia Doellgast, a professor of employment relations at Cornell. “Workers often don’t know what monitoring tools are being used, what data the tools are collecting or how that data is used to evaluate their performance.”In Europe, unlike in the US and Canada, many unions have been pushing for years for protections against some of the more intrusive ways that AI tools track and manage workers. “This issue has yet to be put at the center of the radar for unions in North America,” said Valerio De Stefano, a labor law professor at York University in Toronto, who has written extensively on AI’s use in the workplace. “Unions in Europe are more aware of the uses of technologies from the surveillance standpoint. This is not something that unions in North America have focused on.”At some German companies, labor experts say, workers have won protections that could become models for US and Canadian workers. At Deutsche Telekom, Germany’s largest telecommunications company, workers have won a prohibition against algorithms firing workers without any human involvement as well as a ban on using data collected by digital monitoring to discipline or dismiss individual workers.“In Europe, workers have stronger rights to obtain information and participate in decision-making,” Doellgast said. “In the US, where there is a union present, workers have some information rights about AI and hopefully a voice in how it’s used. Where unions aren’t present, workers have no information rights, and all they see is the effects of the technologies on them.”Mindful of the downsides of AI and algorithmic management, US labor unions are starting to push harder for protections. For instance, at some call centers, the Communications Workers of America union has won not only requirements that managers notify workers whenever recording their calls, but also guarantees that management will only record calls for training purposes to help improve employee performance – and not for evaluating or disciplining workers.Dan Reynolds, the Communications Workers’ assistant research director, said the union has long been concerned about how new technologies affect jobs. “AI is a new technology often used to speed up the work, deskill the work, make workplaces more stressful and make jobs more demanding,” he said. “Our concern about AI isn’t just its effect on the number of jobs, but how it will affect the quality of jobs.”“Our goal is not to stop new technologies,” Reynolds continued, “but to make sure the gains of these new technologies are broadly and equitably shared.”Germany has laws requiring companies to notify their works councils about AI and other new technologies that they’re planning to adopt. Most German companies have work councils, which are worker-management committees that discuss everything from vacation schedules to the pace of work and the effects of AI.To prevent AI-based performance data from being used against individual workers, the work councils at Deutsche Telekom got the company to agree that performance data can be gathered only for groups of at least five employees. The company has also agreed not to use AI to gather certain personal information about employees, such as their political opinions or sexual orientations.Doellgast and De Stefano – who edited a recent academic journal about AI and work – say worker input about new technologies often reduces their invasiveness and other downsides for workers, while making the introduction of technologies smoother and more productive. Moreover, when workers have some say about new technologies, that often reduces employee resistance to those technologies.De Stefano pointed to some problems with using AI to hire and discipline workers. “These machines are, in many cases, unreliable,” he said. “They have certain discriminatory output, especially in hiring. These machines are basically benchmarked around a standard worker – normally white, prime-age, male workers. Anyone who doesn’t correspond to that benchmark risks being misjudged by these algorithms.”The AFL-CIO, the main US labor federation, has created a technology institute to develop expertise and policies on AI and other technologies. That institute is planning training sessions to educate union leaders and strategists about new technologies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s [scientific management] on steroids.”Ballantyne said the communications workers union, the hotel workers union, Sag-Aftra and the Writers Guild have helped lead the way on new technologies. After their recent 148-day strike, the Writers Guild won protections that require studios to disclose whether any material given to writers was developed with the help of AI.The US Chamber of Commerce says AI and analytics can have substantial benefits for workers and productivity, providing insights into worker performance and allowing for targeted coaching and training to improve performance.AI surveillance, the chamber says, can also help prevent workplace violence by, for instance, monitoring abnormal behavior in the workplace. While many workers criticize the use of “wearable” monitors, the chamber says “smart sensors and wearable devices can help” protect them, by detecting potential accidents, ergonomic risks, toxic chemicals and imminent heat stress.“While there are clear benefits” to AI, said Michael Richards, policy director of the chamber’s technology engagement center, “we understand there are legitimate concerns surrounding the use of the technology.”Employers “recognize that engaging in an inclusive dialogue about using new technologies is critical to fostering a culture of trust with employees”, he added.Annette Bernhardt, director of the technology and work program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, pointed to the home-care sector as an example where new technologies make workers’ lives more stressful. Many home-care aides must meticulously follow instructions that apps send them, while reporting back each and every task they complete.“We need strong labor standards around the use of these technologies,” Bernhardt said. “We need to support unions as they bargain around these technologies.

Read our privacy policyThe jobs safest and most at risk from Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been revealed, as experts predict AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs in the coming years. A study from investment bank Goldman Sachs found AI could take over a quarter of work tasks in the USA and Europe. As with all technological advances, AI will change the way we work, making some jobs redundant but creating others too.Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is “a major advancement”, the report said.Early last year, telecoms giant BT announced it will cut 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade, including replacing around 10,000 workers with artificial intelligence (AI), in a bid to cut costs. One of the UK’s largest trade unions, Prospect, found that workers overwhelmingly believe government should set rules around the use of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) to protect jobs, with 58% of workers supporting regulation.The UK government is also keen to promote AI investment in the UK, with Prime minister Rishi Sunak claiming AI could be the best thing that ever happened to the human race at the Bletchley Park AI summit in November last year. At the same summit, Elon Musk, Owner of X and Tesla, told the Prime Minister AI would be “the most disruptive force in the industry for jobs”, claiming that “there will come a point where no job is needed. What jobs are safest from AI?The table below shows the jobs that are safest from AI and automation, ranked by salary, according to analysts at job search engine Adzuna. They found that skilled manual jobs, such as mechanics, plumbers and carpenters have little exposure to AI, with medical professionals ranked among the highest-paid and best insulated careers. The average advertised salary for an oncologist in December was £201,243 - the highest on the list - while roles such as influencer, therapist and judge also ranked as safe from the advent of AI. There are also completely new jobs emerging since the AI boom, including machine manager, AI trainer and prompt engineer. What jobs are most at risk from AI? The Goldman Sachs report notes AI's impact will vary across different sectors - 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated but only 6% in construction 4% in maintenance. The job most at risk of being replaced by AI is data entry assistant, with an average salary £42,764, according to Adzuna. Careers in the media industry, including advertising specialists, journalists and writers also ranked highly on the list, as generative AI becomes increasingly more sosphisticated in producing long-form written content. Prior to his AI summit, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak attempted to ease people’s fears about Artificial Intelligence, saying: “It’s important to recognise that AI doesn’t just automate and take people’s jobs.“A better way to think about it is as a co-pilot.“As with all technologies, they change our labour market, I think over time of course they make our economy more prosperous, more productive.“They create more growth overall but it does mean that there are changes in the labour market.”More aboutAIartificial intelligencejobsJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies9Comments1/1Revealed: Top 20 jobs safest from AI takeover - is your job at risk?Revealed: Top 20 jobs safest from AI takeover - is your job at risk?The logo of the ChatGPT application developed by US artificial intelligence research organization OpenAI on a smartphone screen on 23 November, 2023, in Frankfurt, GermanyGetty Images

Since the arrival of Chat­G­PT, there has been con­cern that we are going to be replaced by robots. Gen­er­a­tive arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence, capa­ble of assim­i­lat­ing and cre­at­ing writ­ten, visu­al, or audio con­tent, is often described as a threat to jobs. With each new major tech­no­log­i­cal advance comes its share of debate and appre­hen­sion about impacts on the work­force. Dur­ing the indus­tri­al rev­o­lu­tion, man­u­al work­ers were at the fore­front of these major changes. Con­verse­ly, AI is now more rel­e­vant to man­agers and pro­fes­sion­als. But what will be the real impact of this technology?
Togeth­er with Pawel Gmyrek and David Bescond, Inter­na­tion­al Labour Organ­i­sa­tion econ­o­mist Janine Berg analysed the 436 occu­pa­tions list­ed in the ILO’s Inter­na­tion­al Clas­si­fi­ca­tion of Occu­pa­tions. The aim was to under­stand which types of jobs would be most affect­ed by AI on a glob­al scale. The authors used Chat­G­PT to analyse the tasks asso­ci­at­ed with the occu­pa­tions and assigned them scores cor­re­spond­ing to their poten­tial expo­sure. Some tasks are high­ly exposed to tech­nol­o­gy, oth­ers less so. The high­er the expo­sure poten­tial of an activ­i­ty, the more like­ly it is to be automated.
For econ­o­mists, the pri­ma­ry impact of arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence will not real­ly be the mas­sive destruc­tion of jobs, but rather the pro­found trans­for­ma­tion of work. For most pro­fes­sions, cer­tain tasks will indeed be car­ried out by bots, but this will leave time for oth­er, more com­plex activ­i­ties. On aver­age, 10–13% of jobs world­wide could be “aug­ment­ed” or trans­formed. The first jobs to use this tech­nol­o­gy will poten­tial­ly be ware­house­men, deliv­ery dri­vers, man­agers in the dis­tri­b­u­tion sec­tor, machine oper­a­tors and assem­blers, ser­vice and sales work­ers, dri­ving instruc­tors, dri­vers, wait­ers, archi­tects, teach­ers, musi­cians, etc. In all, 427 mil­lion jobs, or 13% of jobs world­wide, could change because of arti­fi­cial intelligence.
75 million jobs could be automated
Although the poten­tial for change is much greater than automa­tion, the risk remains very real, with 2.3% of jobs world­wide affect­ed. Admin­is­tra­tive jobs would be heav­i­ly impact­ed by automa­tion. “Call cen­tre employ­ees, sec­re­taries, data entry oper­a­tors – sim­ple, lin­ear activ­i­ties with lit­tle vari­a­tion in tasks and lit­tle inter­ac­tion with oth­ers – could be replaced by bots,” explains Janine Berg. In recent years, office work­ers have already seen their day-to-day work evolve. Accord­ing to the experts, 24% of their tasks are high­ly exposed to AI, and 58% are mod­er­ate­ly exposed. This is by far the occu­pa­tion most at risk. This means that 2.3% of jobs world­wide, or 75 mil­lion, could end up being automated.

Our study should not be read as a reas­sur­ing voice, but rather as a call to devel­op mea­sures to deal with the immi­nent tech­no­log­i­cal changes

Arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence will clear­ly not affect all pro­fes­sions in the same way. The tech­nol­o­gy is also like­ly to have dif­fer­ent con­se­quences for men and women. Women will be 2.5 times more affect­ed by automa­tion than men, not least because there are more women in low-skilled admin­is­tra­tive posi­tions. Con­verse­ly, male-dom­i­nat­ed pro­fes­sions such as secu­ri­ty, trans­port and con­struc­tion are unlike­ly to be affect­ed. As a result, 3.7% of wom­en’s jobs world­wide are at risk of being auto­mat­ed, com­pared with 1.4% of men’s jobs. This dif­fer­ence is even greater in rich coun­tries, with 7.8% of jobs held by women like­ly to be replaced by bots, com­pared with 2.9% of jobs held by men. In low-income coun­tries, few­er women are in the labour mar­ket, and low-skilled admin­is­tra­tive pro­fes­sions are pre­dom­i­nant­ly held by men.
Towards a productivity divide between countries?
The oth­er major dif­fer­ence point­ed out by the ILO econ­o­mists depends on the wealth of the coun­tries con­cerned. “In low-income coun­tries, arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence is unlike­ly to be deployed. The tech­nol­o­gy is expen­sive, and there is a lack of infra­struc­ture, with a poor elec­tric­i­ty sup­ply and poor inter­net con­nec­tion”, explains Janine Berg. In fact, by 2022, a third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion will not have access to the inter­net. What’s more, the struc­ture of the labour mar­ket in low-income coun­tries makes them less sus­cep­ti­ble to automa­tion. In these coun­tries, 0.4% of jobs could be replaced by bots, com­pared with 5.5% in high-income coun­tries. In terms of pos­si­ble changes to jobs, 10.4% of occu­pa­tions are affect­ed in low-income coun­tries, com­pared with 13.4% in rich coun­tries. In short, poten­tial automa­tion main­ly con­cerns rich coun­tries. They will be more dis­rupt­ed by AI, but they will also be able to take advan­tage of it. “This sit­u­a­tion could cre­ate a pro­duc­tiv­i­ty divide between rich and poor coun­tries”, says the economist.

While there are nuances depend­ing on the region of the world, the study broad­ly envis­ages the inte­gra­tion of AI into every­day life. Replac­ing humans with bots is not on the cards for the time being. “This approach could have been expect­ed to gen­er­ate an alarm­ing num­ber of job loss­es, but is not the case. Our over­all esti­mate points more towards a future where work is in fact trans­formed, but still present”, the econ­o­mists sum­marise. How­ev­er, this evo­lu­tion of work must take cer­tain issues into account to avoid a neg­a­tive impact. “Our study should not be read as a reas­sur­ing voice, but rather as a call to devel­op mea­sures to deal with the immi­nent tech­no­log­i­cal changes”, explain the authors.
Thinking through and organising the deployment of AI 
Janine Berg believes that gen­er­a­tive AI is fun­da­men­tal­ly nei­ther pos­i­tive nor neg­a­tive. It all depends on how the tech­nol­o­gy is deployed. The econ­o­mist details a num­ber of actions that gov­ern­ments need to take: “reflect­ing on the ques­tion of the bal­ance of pow­er, the voice of work­ers affect­ed by labour mar­ket adjust­ments, respect for exist­ing stan­dards and rights, and the appro­pri­ate use of nation­al social pro­tec­tions, as well as train­ing sys­tems will be cru­cial ele­ments in steer­ing the deploy­ment of AI in the world of work.”
It is not just a ques­tion of observ­ing how this new tech­nol­o­gy is applied, but of sup­port­ing it with reflec­tion and mea­sures. The aim is to ensure social dia­logue, rede­ploy­ment or train­ing for employ­ees affect­ed by automa­tion, and employ­ee par­tic­i­pa­tion in the intro­duc­tion of AI for those whose tasks will be trans­formed. “If we don’t put mea­sures in place, and these sys­tems arrive, more jobs than nec­es­sary will be lost. Work­ing con­di­tions will dete­ri­o­rate. There may be short-term gains for some com­pa­nies, but there will be social con­se­quences,” warns Janine Berg.

Generative artificial intelligence, capable of assimilating and creating written, visual, or audio content, is often described as a threat to jobs. With each new major technological advance comes its share of debate and apprehension about impacts on the workforce. During the industrial revolution, manual workers were at the forefront of these major changes. Conversely, AI is now more relevant to managers and professionals. But what will be the real impact of this technology?



Together with Pawel Gmyrek and David Bescond, International Labour Organisation economist Janine Berg analysed the 436 occupations listed in the ILO’s International Classification of Occupations. The aim was to understand which types of jobs would be most affected by AI on a global scale. The authors used ChatGPT to analyse the tasks associated with the occupations and assigned them scores corresponding to their potential exposure. Some tasks are highly exposed to technology, others less so. The higher the exposure potential of an activity, the more likely it is to be automated.



For economists, the primary impact of artificial intelligence will not really be the massive destruction of jobs, but rather the profound transformation of work. For most professions, certain tasks will indeed be carried out by bots, but this will leave time for other, more complex activities. On average, 10-13% of jobs worldwide could be “augmented” or transformed. The first jobs to use this technology will potentially be warehousemen, delivery drivers, managers in the distribution sector, machine operators and assemblers, service and sales workers, driving instructors, drivers, waiters, architects, teachers, musicians, etc. In all, 427 million jobs, or 13% of jobs worldwide, could change because of artificial intelligence.



75 million jobs could be automated



Although the potential for change is much greater than automation, the risk remains very real, with 2.3% of jobs worldwide affected. Administrative jobs would be heavily impacted by automation. “Call centre employees, secretaries, data entry operators – simple, linear activities with little variation in tasks and little interaction with others – could be replaced by bots,” explains Janine Berg. In recent years, office workers have already seen their day-to-day work evolve. According to the experts, 24% of their tasks are highly exposed to AI, and 58% are moderately exposed. This is by far the occupation most at risk. This means that 2.3% of jobs worldwide, or 75 million, could end up being automated.




Our study should not be read as a reassuring voice, but rather as a call to develop measures to deal with the imminent technological changes




Artificial intelligence will clearly not affect all professions in the same way. The technology is also likely to have different consequences for men and women. Women will be 2.5 times more affected by automation than men, not least because there are more women in low-skilled administrative positions. Conversely, male-dominated professions such as security, transport and construction are unlikely to be affected. As a result, 3.7% of women's jobs worldwide are at risk of being automated, compared with 1.4% of men's jobs. This difference is even greater in rich countries, with 7.8% of jobs held by women likely to be replaced by bots, compared with 2.9% of jobs held by men. In low-income countries, fewer women are in the labour market, and low-skilled administrative professions are predominantly held by men.



Towards a productivity divide between countries?



The other major difference pointed out by the ILO economists depends on the wealth of the countries concerned. “In low-income countries, artificial intelligence is unlikely to be deployed. The technology is expensive, and there is a lack of infrastructure, with a poor electricity supply and poor internet connection”, explains Janine Berg. In fact, by 2022, a third of the world's population will not have access to the internet. What’s more, the structure of the labour market in low-income countries makes them less susceptible to automation. In these countries, 0.4% of jobs could be replaced by bots, compared with 5.5% in high-income countries. In terms of possible changes to jobs, 10.4% of occupations are affected in low-income countries, compared with 13.4% in rich countries. In short, potential automation mainly concerns rich countries. They will be more disrupted by AI, but they will also be able to take advantage of it. “This situation could create a productivity divide between rich and poor countries”, says the economist.







While there are nuances depending on the region of the world, the study broadly envisages the integration of AI into everyday life. Replacing humans with bots is not on the cards for the time being. “This approach could have been expected to generate an alarming number of job losses, but is not the case. Our overall estimate points more towards a future where work is in fact transformed, but still present”, the economists summarise. However, this evolution of work must take certain issues into account to avoid a negative impact. “Our study should not be read as a reassuring voice, but rather as a call to develop measures to deal with the imminent technological changes”, explain the authors.



Thinking through and organising the deployment of AI&nbsp;



Janine Berg believes that generative AI is fundamentally neither positive nor negative. It all depends on how the technology is deployed. The economist details a number of actions that governments need to take: “reflecting on the question of the balance of power, the voice of workers affected by labour market adjustments, respect for existing standards and rights, and the appropriate use of national social protections, as well as training systems will be crucial elements in steering the deployment of AI in the world of work.”



It is not just a question of observing how this new technology is applied, but of supporting it with reflection and measures. The aim is to ensure social dialogue, redeployment or training for employees affected by automation, and employee participation in the introduction of AI for those whose tasks will be transformed. “If we don't put measures in place, and these systems arrive, more jobs than necessary will be lost. Working conditions will deteriorate. There may be short-term gains for some companies, but there will be social consequences,” warns Janine Berg.

What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is an emerging form of artificial intelligence that generates content. Popular examples of generative AI software include ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Runway. These programs are now used by millions of users to create text, images, video, music, and software code.
Indeed, generative AI functionality is all about creating content. It combines algorithms, deep learning, and neural network techniques to generate content that is based on the patterns it observes in other content. It analyzes vast amounts of patterns in datasets to mimic style or structure to replicate a wide array of contemporary or historical content.
For example, the image below was created using a text-to-image generative AI model. The prompt I fed the system: “a captivating portrait of a mysterious woman in a moonlit forest using a realistic style similar to Vermeer, with soft, golden lighting and a close-up framing.”

For many more examples of how generative AI serves users, see our guide: Generative AI Examples
How Do Generative AI Models Work?
Generative AI models perform several levels beyond traditional machine learning. By utilizing multiple forms of machine learning systems, models, algorithms, and neural networks, generative AI offers a tech-based foray into the world of creativity.
These models are typically trained on large datasets containing a wide range of information, such as text, images, and audio. By analyzing patterns and relationships within the data, the models can understand the underlying structure and generate new content similar in style and context.
Although the output of generative AI is classified as original material, in reality, it uses machine learning and other AI techniques based on the earlier creativity of others – this is a significant criticism of generative AI. This emerging AI technology taps into massive repositories of content and uses that information to mimic human creativity, which raises a question that is now being debated: Is generative AI a copyright violation?
One common type of generative AI model is the generative adversarial network (GAN). The GAN framework consists of two main components:

Generator: The generator is responsible for generating new outputs.
Discriminator: The discriminator acts as a critic to evaluate the generated outputs for authenticity.

The generator and the discriminator are trained simultaneously to improve the generator’s ability to fool the discriminator. To train the GAN, the generator first creates random noise as input and attempts to generate outputs that resemble the data it was trained on. The discriminator then receives real and generated outputs and aims to classify them correctly as real or fake.
The feedback from the discriminator is used to update the generator, encouraging it to improve its outputs and generate content that is increasingly difficult for the discriminator to distinguish from real data.
Benefits of Generative AI
Generative AI offers numerous benefits for those who seek to create content, and its creative potential is seemingly vast.

Creative writing and art: Generative AI can do things like analyze the entire works of Dickens or Rollins or Hemingway and produce an original novel that seeks to simulate their style and writing patterns. It can produce this same mimicry in images and music. Generative AI excels at creating coherent text and images, aiding in writing, translation, and artistic endeavors.
Data enhancement: It contributes to data augmentation, personalization, and accessibility, making generative AI a versatile tool for various industries, including healthcare and finance.

Limitations of Generative AI
For all of its benefits, the limitations of generative are quite challenging – including historical biases in supposedly neutral system outputs.

Vulnerability to adversarial attacks: Generative models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where input data is carefully crafted to mislead the model into producing incorrect or unintended outputs.
Contextual ambiguity: Generative AI models may struggle with understanding and maintaining context over long passages. They can be sensitive to slight changes in input phrasing and might produce inconsistent or contextually inappropriate responses.
Potential biases: Generative AI models are trained on large datasets, and if these datasets contain biases or prejudices, the AI system may unintentionally replicate them in the generated content.

Generative AI Use Cases
By producing fresh content, generative AI is used to augment but not replace the work of writers, graphic designers, artists, and musicians. It is particularly useful in the business realm in areas like product descriptions, variations to existing designs, or helping commercial artists explore different concepts. Among its most common use cases, generative AI can:

Text: Generate credible text on various topics. It can compose business letters, provide rough drafts of articles, and compose annual reports.
Images: Output realistic images from text prompts, create new scenes, and simulate a new painting.
Video: Compile video content from text automatically and put together short videos using existing images.
Music: Compile new musical content by analyzing a music catalog and rendering a new composition.
Product design: Can be fed inputs from previous versions of a product and produce several possible changes that can be considered in a new version.
Personalization: Personalize experiences for users such as product recommendations, tailored experiences, and new material that closely matches their preferences.

What is Predictive AI?
Predictive AI uses statistical algorithms to analyze data and make predictions about future events. It is sometimes also called predictive analytics and may sometimes be loosely termed as machine learning.
Predictive AI studies historical data, identifies patterns, and makes predictions about the future that can better inform business decisions. Predictive AI’s value is shown in the ways it can detect data flow anomalies and extrapolate how they will play out in the future in terms of results or behavior. When used properly, it enhances business decisions by identifying a customer’s purchasing propensity as well as upsell potential and can offer enormous competitive advantages.

​​How Do Predictive AI Models Work?
Predictive AI models leverage historical data, patterns, and trends to make informed predictions about future events or outcomes. These models analyze past data, identifying patterns or relationships within that data, and then use this information to generate predictions about future outcomes.
Building a predictive AI model requires a business to collect and preprocess the data. This involves gathering relevant data from various sources and cleaning it by handling missing values, outliers, or irrelevant variables. The data is then split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model and the testing set used to evaluate its performance.
Once the data is ready, the predictive AI model can be trained. Various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, can be used. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the data and the type of prediction being made.
During training, the model learns the relationships and patterns in the data by adjusting its internal parameters. It tries to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the actual values in the training set. This process is often iterative, where the model repeatedly adjusts its parameters based on the error it observes until it reaches an optimal state.
The accuracy and performance of predictive AI models largely depend on the quality and quantity of the training data. Models trained on more diverse and representative data tend to perform better in making predictions. Additionally, the choice of algorithm and the parameters set during training can impact the model’s accuracy.
Benefits of Predictive AI
For businesses that are experts at using predictive AI, the benefits range from understanding future trends to getting more value from each data repository they have.
Future trends: Predictive AI can enlighten management on future trends, opportunities, and threats. It can be used to recommend products, upsell, improve customer service, and fine-tune inventory levels.
Better accuracy: Predictive AI adds a deeper dimension and greater accuracy to management processes. When used optimally, it increases the chance of success and positive business outcomes, particularly in the area of forward-looking inventory management.
More value from data: Through accurate predictions and improved decision-making, predictive AI can help organizations glean far more value from the data by providing more information about each sector of that data.
Limitations of Predictive AI
Despite its benefits, predictive AI can’t yet predict the future with 100% accuracy, and some businesses have been frustrated by this challenge.

Data quality and availability: Predictive AI heavily relies on data availability and quality. If the data used for training the AI system is incomplete, inaccurate, or biased, it can lead to flawed predictions.
Ethical concerns: Using predictive AI raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, bias, and discrimination. Does a given company have the right to glimpse future trends about certain consumers?
Interpretability: Many predictive models, especially complex ones like deep neural networks, lack interpretability. It may be challenging to understand how the AI arrives at its predictions or to identify any underlying biases in its decision-making process.
Resource Intensive: Training and deploying sophisticated predictive models can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive, limiting their practicality in certain environments.

Predictive AI Use Cases
Predictive AI is finding innumerable use cases across a wide range of industries. If managers knew the future, they would always take appropriate steps to capitalize on how things were going to turn out. Anything that improves the likelihood of knowing the future has high value in business. Predictive AI use cases include financial forecasting, fraud detection, healthcare, and marketing. Predictive AI can:
Financial services: Enhances financial forecasts. By pulling data from a wider data set and correlating financial information with other forward-looking business data, forecasting accuracy can be greatly improved.
Fraud detection: Spot potential fraud by sensing anomalous behavior. In banking and e-commerce, there might be an unusual device, location, or request that doesn’t fit with the normal behavior of a specific user. A login from a suspicious IP address, for example, is an obvious red flag.
Healthcare: Find use cases such as predicting disease outbreaks, identifying higher-risk patients, and spotting the most successful treatments.
Marketing: More closely define the most appropriate channels and messages to use in marketing. It can provide marketing strategists with the data they need to write impactful campaigns and thereby bring about greater success.
Bottom Line: Generative AI vs. Predictive AI
As AI evolves, the distinction between generative AI and predictive AI is likely to fade. AI systems that seamlessly merge generative AI and predictive AI are emerging. Instead of using one set of algorithms to predict and another to create, advanced AI systems combine both and can deliver both types of results.
By combining the algorithms that identify trends and forward-looking correlations with those that recombine those patterns into new creations, the value of AI will be improved even further.
While there are certainly differences between generative AI and predictive AI, these distinctions are far from rigid. Each contains similar elements to the other. It is how they are put to use that brings about the different outcomes. As AI evolves, both generative AI and predictive AI will play a role in reshaping the future.

(Sanish Mondkar CEO of Legion at Workday Rising)

The stakes for enterprise AI in 2024 are already high. The shakeout at OpenAI and the EU AI Act have added new levels of complexity, raising questions about whether open source AI is viable - and how companies will approach AI amidst new IP lawsuits.
Not to mention concerning stories about unethical training data,  who owns the model's content IP, and model drift.
Will enterprises pull back on their AI pursuits? I don't believe so - but this type of volatility will compel customers to seek out AI solutions from trusted software vendors, who can assume a major chunk of the liability risk - and source different Large Language Models (LLMs) as needed.
A parallel line of thinking is that these developments point to big tech in firm control of our AI futures. To some extent, this is true. As long as we are reliant on LLMs with voracious needs for training data, organizations will find it difficult to train their own models from scratch - it's too resource/cost intensive.
Whether that will remain an impediment remains to be seen - but for now, there are other ways to move ahead. I've already documented use cases where the vendor doesn't need to build their own LLMs to provide gen AI results for customers. In such cases, customer-specific data is infused into the architecture via RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) or other scenarios.
Gen AI startups with domain experts - a force for enterprise change in 2023?
This opens up the intriguing possibility that smaller startups of domain experts can build AI into their solutions - and provide impact that is much closer to ""out of the box"" than training your own LLM, and without the risk mitigation issues that do-AI-yourself currently raises.
With that in mind, I have a couple of standout examples I picked up on my travels, starting with Legion, an HR solution focused on the problem of the deskless/hourly worker. This is actually a difficult workforce to manage - and the solutions to do so must encompass the complexity of on-the-fly workforce scheduling.
No surprise then, that Legion has been knee deep in applying AI to labor challenges for years now. But when I met Sanish Mondkar, CEO and founder of Legion at Workday Rising, Legion had just announced their Copilot Generative AI Assistant. It was not a coincidence to find the Legion team at Workday Rising. Legion is a part of the Workday Ventures program.
Some vendors seem to mistakenly assume that the scale of big AI requires them to develop all their customers' AI solutions internally. But the savvier vendors will find ways of opening their platform to their partners' AI applications. That's why I thought Workday's announcement of their AI marketplace (and certification program) was one of the underrated AI announcements of the fall.
Legion: we need better workforce management in labor-intensive industries
During our sit down, I asked Mondkar how this all started:
Legion is workforce management, largely catered towards labor-intensive industries. So retail, hospitality and so forth. Our customers in those industries, we help them manage their labor force, from the perspective of scheduling them to work - and then capturing time and creating the timesheets. So payroll can be efficiently generated, and also increasingly, enabling employees to have more flexibility and ownership over their schedules - and work at different locations of the customer.

Mondkar says this kind of a workforce management can empower employees who typically don't feel very empowered:
This gives them more options to earn more wages, and also provides a lot of self-service tools for them if they want to manage this - if they're running late to a shift, like how to communicate to the manager or swap their shifts, or if they want to get paid instantly after the shift is over. So these are all the capabilities that add a lot of value to these labor intensive industries, because labor is a challenge for them.

I spent many years writing blog posts at a local brewery. I saw firsthand the complexity and urgency of shift-swapping and schedule management. Handling this manually means contacting every other worker every time a shift opens up - and individual workers may not even have all the contact numbers. Frantic Facebook Messenger threads aren't the way forward. As Mondkar explains, providing user-friendly apps for this purpose is crucial in today's tight labor market:
The turnover is very high; anything they can do to increase efficiency, but also simultaneously engage and improve the employee experience is a highly-valuable thing. So that's where Legion comes into the picture.

But many companies already rely on an HR system of record/cloud platform like Workday. So how does Legion fit in?
We integrate with Workday. We basically integrate Workday employee record into Legion, and then from Legion, we've downloaded the Legion app to managers in these locations. They use Legion to generate the schedule, and all that good stuff. So that's the fundamental value proposition.

Investing in workforce management - intelligent automation is a must
Given the popsicle headaches of hourly worker scheduling, it's no surprise that Legion invested in AI early. Mondkar says it comes down to their founding question: ""How are we going to improve workforce management?""
We saw two ways to do that. One is to make it more employee-centric as we talked about - so, make workforce management actually about the workforce. And the second was automation. If you look at any labor-intensive job like restaurants or retail, the managers, they are not managers of that store because they like sitting in front of software and creating schedules. That's not why they are there. They like to be in front of customers, and like to run it as a business.
No one will argue against automation, but they just want to make sure it's done right, because a lot of important decisions happen on a daily basis: how much labor needs to be allocated, where should it be allocated? How many people should work, who should work at what time? How to deal with timesheets?

That took Legion's team into an ""intelligent automation"" journey. But in practice, what does ""intelligent automation"" really mean? The response:
Intelligent Automation means the right decisions are made not just for the sake of automation. The model we built when Legion was founded was machine-learning-based demand forecasting... Legion went very deep with AI and machine learning from day one - and that's very important. We built AI-based demand forecasting for automated scheduling. We do things like when managers edit the schedule, we learn from those edits and we correlate that with employee behavior, employee preferences and things like me automatically.

For the last five years, Legion's AI-based scheduling automation has integrated a range of third party data, from weather forecasts to religious holidays. Long before generative AI, Legion's team was working with predictive algorithms, optimization through expert systems, and AI learning through neural nets.  So when generative AI heated up, Legion was on the case with their new Copilot. Mondkar says gen AI is a very good fit with the needs of hourly workers, who need a fast/intuitive conversational interface on-the-go:
The thing we find so fascinating about generative AI is for workforce management, 99% of our workers are deskless workers... We think and generative AI provides this natural language interface for this workforce. Plus, they do not have time to get trained on software. The turnover is so high. When a new manager shows up, you're training how to be productive as soon as possible.

As Legion puts it:
Regardless of their location or task, managers and employees can now engage with Legion Copilot to gain insights into labor regulations, internal company policies, and even bespoke training content.

Legion's Copilot roadmap includes:

Knowledge-Based Self-Service
Labor and Hour Compliance Q&A
WFM Conversational Interface - with ability to pull up and manage schedule, with user-permissioned actions like adding shifts and changing shift assignments (natural language queries like ""what should I know about the schedule?"" brings up the relevant info - full details on Legion's blog)

My take - enterprise AI is about domain expertise in 2023
As the new year kicked off, I asked the Legion team for an update, before they head off to the NRF Retail ""Big Show"" in New York City (you can book an NRF meeting via their web site). Legion hit several key milestones including gross revenue retention (GRR) of 97%+ and 55% growth in revenue, and 88% weekly active users on the platform. Legion this growth to ""an increasing need for AI-native solutions for workforce management.""
Via email, I asked Mondkar about the potential for smaller vendors to play a key role in enterprise AI adoption. Can customers move ahead despite the various roadblocks with consumer LLMs I noted in the intro? Mondkar's response emphasized the importance of customer data - and the collaboration that entails.

It is true that the ownership of data is a crucial factor in training LLMs. This may imply that larger players who has access to bigger datasets have an advantage. However, the world for enterprise software vendors is more complex. SaaS vendors do not automatically have rights to customer data, even if it is stored in their databases. Instead, SaaS vendors must collaborate with their customers to establish guidelines and obtain permission to use the data effectively. This collaborative approach ensures that customer privacy and data security are safeguarded.

In the generative AI debate I took part in on CRM Konvos this week, I cautioned about the copyright and IP problems the large LLMs are facing, but I also encouraged enterprises not to sit on the sidelines. This is a good time for customers to look to industry-specialized vendors to help them move forward with focused AI projects, with focused data - and minimize LLM risk, while addressing something that moves the business forward.
On the customer use case side, I'd like to talk further with a Legion customer once the gen AI use cases mature. For Mondkar, the ability to serve these customers has been propelled by their time with Workday Ventures.
There were a lot of synergies. We already had common customers. They liked what they got from us. They liked what they got from Workday. They said, 'You guys should be working more closely together.'

I talked about domain expertise being crucial to the next phase in enterprise AI. But maybe I should have also said a strong organizational purpose - one that elevates human work even while it augments and automates. That certainly seems to be what's driving Legion. As Mondkar told me:
Our founding thesis for Legion is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs. That's our mission.

The pandemic put pressure on that mission, as hourly labor reached a breaking point, and that pressure hasn't really let up.
The reason why it was building up was that there wasn't much innovation, or even frankly, desire to improve the experiences and uplift these jobs, fundamentally, from the perspective of experience. So I feel pretty strongly about that.

If you can build a business on that, I'll be rooting for you.

Nothing demonstrates the technology’s impact on our public consciousness better than leading dictionary Collins naming “AI” as their word of the year. The need to regulate AI was hotly debated, along with its benefits and impact on the economy and jobs.The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023 found that nearly three-quarters of companies surveyed plan to adopt AI, with 50% expecting it to lead to job growth. In the book Bridgital Nation, our Chairman, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, predicts that AI could add 30 million jobs by 2025 and provide a major impetus to economic growth.Unsurprisingly, the impact of AI on the economy will be a major topic at the forthcoming Annual Meeting of the Forum in Davos, Switzerland. And it is easy to see why; some projections suggest the addition of an economic boom equivalent to India and China’s output combined by 2030. We’re at the start of a transformative decade in which generative AI is already reshaping work, life and business. In addition to its business impact, it will unlock benefits in healthcare, education and climate change. Yet, despite the intense focus on AI, we are missing something fundamental. Public attention has largely been on increasing productivity with accelerating outputs. But the real potential lies in the decision-making processes that precede that. Here, AI can augment what humans are capable of – taking them from average to great, making novices as proficient as experts – rather than rendering them obsolete. AI’s evolutionBefore looking into this, let’s define what AI means. Its evolution has been rapid and can be delineated by its expanding capabilities. Initially, AI focused on recognition tasks, like identifying objects in images. Its next iteration involved reasoning, analyzing what was happening, why it was happening, the likely outcomes, what we should do about it, and decision-making based on that understanding.The most transformative shift happened with the advent of generative or operative capabilities, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, LaMBDA and LLaMA. These models leverage predictions made during the reasoning stage and can make decisions and propose actions. LLMs go beyond the information fed to them and extrapolate, resulting in non-deterministic responses to the same input. They have the power to extract insights from unstructured content and when combined with enterprise-specific models, they can create a knowledge superstructure, enhancing decision speed, effectiveness and customer experiences. Augmenting, not replacing humans It’s clear that the most effective use of generative AI will be in augmenting human creativity, rather than in replacing humans. AI won’t replace jobs, but make people better at them, in part by the democratization of knowledge. This will allow for jobs to be elevated by AI, levelling existing knowledge gaps and increasing global access to information. Indeed, the World Economic Forum predicts that AI will be a net job creator between now and 2027. While there is an onus on businesses to support their staff in re- and upskilling in line with these developments, the benefits are clear for all to see; increased efficiency and, thus, often higher output are welcome side effects. The need to reskill people must be our first priority towards realizing this opportunity. At TCS, we have trained over 100,000 people on generative AI in the past year, and I am heartened to see similar efforts across the industry, which are essential in building up an AI-ready workforce. Have you read?How to harness the power of generative AI for better jobs? Experts share their viewsAutomation or augmentation? This is how AI will be integrated into the jobs of tomorrowDavos 2024: Who's coming and what to expectA new AI-first business architecture In today's knowledge economy, enterprises generate value through knowledge work, which involves decisions and actions taken by individuals or groups. Traditional techniques like machine learning and data analysis have been used to extract information from structured data. But then there is an organization's tacit knowledge: the unstructured content and data – often acquired by experience, observation, imitation and practice – that cannot be easily codified.This reliance on tacit knowledge makes decisions challenging to explain and causes variability in decision outputs, outcomes and customer experiences. GenAI or large language models can potentially extract insights from such unstructured content. Foundational models, such as GPT, LLaMA and open-source alternatives, are “world-wise” and can integrate common knowledge that may exist offline, such as in books or paintings.Combining such models with enterprise-wise ones and traditional AI/ML techniques, a knowledge superstructure can be created within an enterprise, increasing the speed and effectiveness of decisions and actions. This can improve customer experiences, productivity and talent utilization. The greater benefit of these technologies is in digitizing an enterprise's knowledge and reducing reliance on tacit knowledge in decisions and actions.The four-tier AI architecture for business Image: TCSThis requires creating large numbers of enterprise-fine-tuned purposive models or agents for each activity, which will be further augmented by these knowledge superstructures. AI should be viewed as a business redefinition exercise involving various parts of the business, such as legal, security, data, compliance and tech teams, to identify the highest value activities that can be transformed through a knowledge superstructure. Enterprises will need to invest in a four-tier architecture powered by hundreds or thousands of purpose-built models optimized for cost, quality, security and privacy. This complex undertaking offers significant opportunities to reduce reliance on tacit knowledge, deliver elite quality value, and reduce variance in output quality. A sophisticated and well thought-out strategy is required to drive this transformation within an enterprise.Taking decision-making from average to greatUltimately, generative AI offers an enterprise-wide opportunity to improve decision-making processes and overall efficiency. This integration digitizes enterprise knowledge, reducing reliance on tacit knowledge and boosting productivity and talent utilization. And it’s here where the current focus of public debate is misplaced, focusing almost exclusively on “action”, rather than on the potential to digitize an enterprise's knowledge and reduce reliance on tacit knowledge in decisions and actions. Simply put, the real value of AI and machine learning lies in the step before output, in improving decision-making. Why? Because it can help us overcome the gap between average and great outputs and unlock higher-quality outputs more consistently. It allows us to democratize knowledge. This could help improve outcomes in many areas – think of enabling doctors to diagnose and treat patients more consistently despite differences in experience and time constraints. If we harness generative AI correctly and focus on how it can augment our decision-making and creativity, we can unlock a powerful knowledge superstructure, enhance decision speed and effectiveness, and supercharge customer experiences.Turning average or even good work into great.

<p>Mentions of artificial intelligence (AI) in corporate strategy meetings will, at some point, end with discussions on the impact of the technology on staff. When automation was rolled out years ago, its initial purpose was to take away repetitive processes from human operations with the expectation it would also reduce errors while improving efficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/new-salesforce-research-links-lower-stress-levels-and-business-automation/""><strong>2021 Salesforce automation survey</strong></a> in the US reported that among 773 automation users, 89% are more satisfied with their job and 84% are more satisfied with their company as a result of using automation in the workplace. Additionally, 74% say using automation tools helps them get their work done faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The operative word here is that automation is a tool that supports or augments the way of usual work. Can the same be said of artificial intelligence? What can business, operational and IT leaders learn from the automation experience to help ‘sell’ the AI value proposition to the workforce?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Improve efficiency and automation</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href=""https://www.opencerthub.com/en/wef-ai-replace-human-jobs/""><strong>World Economic Forum</strong></a> (WEF) predicts that an evolution in the workforce is underway and will disrupt 85 million jobs globally between 2020 and 2025. The disruption is forecast to create 97 million new job roles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/augmented-workforce""><strong>IBM Institute of Business Value (IBV) report</strong></a> claims that AI and automation are creating a new division of labour between humans and machines. In an IBM IBV survey, 4 in 5 executives said generative will change employee roles and skills, with lower-level employees expected to see the biggest shift. No level is immune forcing executives to rethink job roles, skill sets and how work gets done (see Figure 1).</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking on the topic, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew1248/""><strong>Matt Lyteson</strong></a>, CIO of Technology Platforms Transformation at IBM says every area of an IT department should be looking at AI – both traditional AI as well as generative AI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He believes this helps accelerate the automation and intelligent operations of an IT department and achieves a broader scale than we’ve traditionally seen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Companies should focus on areas that will yield the greatest return with the smallest amount of effort, for example, IT modernisation and IT support, and refer to industry use cases, which are already yielding results for many organisations,” he continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Integrating AI into current infrastructure</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it is recognised that the adoption of AI into business will push new demands on the storage and computing needs of the business, one less discussed matter is AI’s impact on network and infrastructure management.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far back as 2021, FutureCIO earlier discussed the <a href=""https://futurecio.tech/podchats-for-futurecio-how-aiops-transforms-it-operations-and-management/""><strong>potential impact of AI on IT operations and management</strong></a>. Three years on, Lyteson says AI has been used in IT for some time now, with traditional approaches to AI for network management and detecting potential issues that create disruption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s also been work around infrastructure resource and capacity management tailored to specific business application workloads. With generative AI, IT departments can develop intelligent automation capabilities more quickly for managing network and infrastructure,” he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Automating software maintenance</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Gartner, the <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-total-cost-ownership-tco-david-godibadze/"">total cost of ownership (TCO) of an IT investment</a></strong> comes down to about 20% on the computer’s base and the remaining will pay for technical support, maintenance and labour costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, the maturing of automation of backend IT operations, including hardware, software and network, has also meant the introduction of AI technologies and practices to support &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/modernising-process-automation-for-growth/"">AI for IT operations</a></strong> simply means applying AI and machine learning to improve IT operations management. The rationale is that automation of routine IT tasks and processes will mean IT can focus on activities that drive IT innovation – as an example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lyteson adds that where AI can take IT departments to the next level – particularly generative AI – is by enabling them to develop automation much more rapidly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It creates a repeated cycle where it’s easier to develop the automation, that took hours and weeks, within minutes. This accelerates IT modernisation overall opening the door for reinvestment,” he posited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in decision-making</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The biggest opportunity is IT operational data and the application of AI,” opined Lyteson when asked about the opportunities for using AI in data analysis and decision-making within the IT department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He posited that even if there is centralised logging and an observability toolset across the IT estate, parts of the operational environment are likely not included.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He suggested that starting with the data lake and <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/optimising-digital-platforms-for-ai-and-da-delivery-and-consumption/"">data fabric</a></strong>, IT departments can derive intelligence through a combination of traditional AI and generative AI. For example, when is the best time to make a change to the network? This simple request typically takes many hours of brain power to determine the best window and risk for the change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“AI can look at the risk of change based on various factors: the reputation of the team performing the change; the state of the network; any overlapping changes already scheduled; and other corporate events that are on the calendar. AI can help make recommendations like this, aiding in decision-making,” he elaborated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in predictive maintenance</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pandemic has forced organisations to question the extent to which they can extract value from current capital investments. This extends throughout the lifecycle of all equipment used by the business, including maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lyteson says hardware, predictive maintenance, and software systems have used traditional AI for several years. “IT departments should consider if traditional AI is delivering the results needed or if there is an opportunity with generative AI to take it to the next level,” he continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in service and support</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asked what the potential uses of AI in customer support and service desk operations within the IT department are, Lyteson pointed out that customer support and IT support via service desk are two fantastic use cases for generative AI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He noted that with customer support, there are interactions with the consumer that go a few steps beyond <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/software-engineering-trends-to-stay-ahead-of-the-curve-from-2024-2026/"">self-service</a></strong>. “We can easily provide end users access to guidance to resolve issues on their own before contacting a service desk,” he explained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He suggested that with the service desk, support agents have access to generative AI to answer questions on how to resolve issues. “This has the potential to drastically reduce the amount of time to resolve issues as well as improve the productivity of support agents. There is also the opportunity to translate speech or chat and interpret it in real-time to quickly identify solutions to recurring issues,” he outlined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Improving IT service management</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long before AI became a fashionable term to use, chatbots were in place to augment contact centre agents in the provision of helpdesk services. Today, AI-powered solutions can be integrated into the helpdesk practice to improve the resolution – at the very least, AI-assisted helpdesk can prevent IT support personnel fatigue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Change risk analysis with AI, incident similarity matching, and incident summarisation are areas where <strong><a href=""https://futurecio.tech/rewriting-the-rules-of-it-service-management/"">IT service management</a></strong> and incident response are evolving with the advent of generative AI.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Matt Lyteson</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He added that this will be even more impactful as organisations stitch together heterogeneous data that makeup IT estates in real time to detect things before they become issues. “There are additional cases where solutions for repeated incidents are more attainable with generative AI compared to legacy knowledge-based search tools. Overall, this improves efficiency and efficacy of IT service management,” he concluded.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI in <a href=""https://futurecio.tech/digitalocean-app-platform-to-simplify-appdev-in-the-cloud/"">AppDev</a> and testing</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whoever said software development is easy must have been drinking from the low-code/no-code water cooler. While writing code can become mundane quickly, debugging and testing applications opens a can of worms, ranging from poor code quality to complex dependencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lyteson says before generative AI came to the forefront, there was already auto-test generation, application analysis for modernisation and even rudimentary development of language translation. New generative AI approaches can take it to the next level, offering code assistance for application developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This accelerates time-to-delivery and increases consistency and security if managed properly. With application development of legacy-to-modern language translation – for example, COBOL to Java – it produces real results,” he concluded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gartner coined the term <strong><a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/aiops-artificial-intelligence-operations"">artificial intelligence for IT Operations</a></strong> (<strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_for_IT_Operations"">AIOps</a></strong>) in 2016 referring to it as the combination of big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes, including event correlation, anomaly detection and causality determination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As AI continues to mature, no doubt new use cases around its use to support all aspects of IT will reveal itself.</p>

Generative AI is transforming how we work. McKinsey found that 40% of companies increasing their investment in AI are doing so because of the advancements made in generative AI. Plus, 22% of employees say they’re already using gen AI tools in their work.In the contact center industry, companies are developing a variety of AI-enabled solutions to enhance the customer experience. In fact, 80% of employers believe generative AI will help them increase revenue and profits by enhancing relationships with customers and boosting customer satisfaction scores.However, the potential application of generative AI reaches far beyond just the customer experience. It can also be a valuable tool for supporting, engaging, and empowering agents within contact centers.Since improving the contact center agent experience has a direct impact not just on CX scores, but business profitability and growth, it’s worth examining the various ways generative AI tools can enhance agent workflows.Here are 10 ways generative AI will change agent experiences in contact centers.1. Eliminating Repetitive TasksFor years, AI and automation have proven to be valuable tools for minimizing the mundane and repetitive tasks that consume employees’ time. Generative AI has the potential to handle even more tasks on behalf of omnichannel contact center agents, from summarizing calls, to transcribing and translating conversations.With fewer repetitive tasks to focus on throughout their workday, agents have more time to handle complex inquiries, and ensure they are delivering a personalized experience.2. Enhancing Data AnalysisGenerative AI tools excel at data analysis, using pre-built algorithms to sort through and understand data. The right tools can sort through huge volumes of data, surfacing valuable insights into customer journeys, purchasing decisions and even ways to improve employee performance.Intelligent AI tools can even be used to automate the process of collecting data. For example, AI chatbots can ask customers questions and extract contextual insights before transferring a conversation to an agent. They can automatically send surveys to customers via voice, IM, and email too. This allows companies to keep their finger on the pulse of CSAT (customer satisfaction) scores, and customer sentiment.3. Transforming Customer RoutingConnecting customers to the right agent quickly isn’t just important for improving customer experiences. It’s also essential to ensure agents don’t have to waste time navigating calls and transferring them to the right agent.Generative AI solutions built into an IVR system can collect valuable customer information and use that data to assign calls to agents based on skill sets, availability, and customer preferences. Some AI solutions can even address customer issues immediately, reducing call queues.4. Reducing Contact VolumesAround 90% of global customers expect companies to have self-service options in place so they don’t always have to wait for a live agent. Generative AI tools allow companies to build intelligent bots that are equipped to address a range of customer needs.Not only does this mean that customers can receive answers to their queries faster, but it also reduces the number of customers agents need to assist. This reduces the strain on your workforce and allows agents to spend more time delivering personalized assistance to customers.5. Improving Hiring and OnboardingRapid turnover is all too common in the contact center space. To ensure agents remain productive, companies need an effective way to quickly recruit new employees. Generative AI can help with this in a number of ways, such as helping to create job descriptions for new hires.AI can also assist in improving the onboarding journey for new hires.AI bots can deliver valuable onboarding information and training to new team members, reducing the strain on supervisors. With step-by-step guidance, and the ability to answer questions in real time, the AI bots have the potential to rapidly accelerate new hire training and onboarding.



6. Supporting Agents During CallsEven after the onboarding experience, generative AI bots can provide valuable support to agents throughout their workday. These bots can be equipped with knowledge from your business database and CRM, allowing them to present relevant articles and guidance to agents when they need it most.Generative AI bots can offer step-by-step coaching to employees, responding to changes in customer sentiment or intent. They can also handle things like instantly collecting and transcribing calls, so agents can focus exclusively on the customer conversation.7. Enhancing Employee TrainingEmployee training and development has always been important in the success of a contact center. Regularly supporting your workforce with the right education helps to keep them engaged and ensures they can cultivate the skills they need to thrive. Generative AI can once again help in this area.Generative AI can help supervisors determine where employees need extra help handling and managing calls and create training resources to ensure agents have the expertise to address a customer’s problem. Plus, they can auto-score agents as part of the agent performance management strategies, offering insights to supervisors on where agents may need more training and support.8. Streamlining the Search for InformationTracking down information in real time is often essential to contact center employees, whether they’re dealing with administrative tasks or connecting with a customer. Unfortunately, workers spend around 3 hours a day (on average) simply searching for the right information.Generative AI tools can make it easier for team members to find the information they need. All they need to do is enter a simple prompt into a chatbot and the system will do the rest, such as surfacing FAQs, reports, documents, and articles. They can even help agents personalize experiences with behind-the-scenes insights into customer purchase histories and preferences.9. Simplifying Content CreationGenerative AI models like ChatGPT have already proven their ability to quickly generate content in a natural human language at scale. In the contact center, a generative AI chatbot can be used to suggest rapid responses to messages across different channels like social media, email, and SMS.The same solution can analyze previous interactions with customers and suggest follow-up messages to improve customer relationships. With access to business information and CRM data, these tools can personalize content to suit your audience, and even adapt to your brand’s tone of voice.10. Transforming Productivity and EfficiencyPerhaps the biggest impact Generative AI will have on agents in the contact center involves enhancing their productivity and efficiency levels. AI tools can automate repetitive tasks, reduce call queues, and simplify processes like analyzing data or transcribing calls.They can also transform workflows in other ways. Generative AI tools can offer supervisors suggestions on how to schedule teams and make the most of their internal resources. They can instantly pull action items from conversations and meetings, helping teams to get more done in a shorter amount of time. They can even assist organizations in designing workflows that empower their teams.The Power of Generative AI for Contact CentersGenerative AI is becoming one of the most powerful tools for the contact center. It not only improves customer experience, but also has the ability to enhance agent experiences. Companies can use these tools to automate repetitive tasks, empower agents with the right training, and even simplify content creation.Bernie Lee, VP of Product Engineering at ComputerTalk, adds:“With agent assist, contact insights and other capabilities enabled by generative AI, ComputerTalk is committed to delivering AI features that help boost agent performance and equip managers with actionable analytics.”Learn more about ComputerTalk’s AI-enabled ice Contact Center platform.

Generative AI has its own capabilities, risks, and limits. Learn when, where, and how to use it in business.










In fall 2023, George Westerman, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, led a three-part webinar series, “Generative AI in Business: Unraveling Myths, Finding Opportunities, and Preparing Your Organization.”
This session lays the groundwork for GenAI, including what it is and isn’t, how it relates to current and past technologies, and what it takes to make good decisions about its use. We’ll cover:

How GenAI works — including its capabilities, risks, and limits.
How GenAI fits with other AI/ML methods — and when it’s a better or worse solution.
Examples of when, where, and how to use GenAI in business.

Maybe it’s time to consider delegating basic tasks to the much-talked about and ever-expanding technology powered by artificial intelligence. For those living under a rock, artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability to use machine learning and specific inputs to perform human-like tasks. Here are some everyday examples of how Creators are using machine learning to make their job easier:
Creator Morgan Shaw of Gold Shaw Farm is among many Creators using AI tools to streamline creative ... [+] workflow.Morgan Shaw

1. Repurposing VideoCreator Devin Lytle puts AI to work cutting down her longer form library content.Paola Trusendi
Seasoned Creators have built a back catalog of video content which provides untapped opportunity to exploit their archives through syndication and licensing. Rather than front the cost of an editor or give up revenue share to a third-party partner, some Creators like Mai Pham (3.27 million Subscribers on YouTube) and Devin Lytle (186,000 Subscribers on YouTube) are testing platforms like Opus and Munch AI. Lytle uses Munch AI to automate the cutdown of longer form YouTube videos to repurpose as short form TikToks. “It gets me about 75% of the way there. The tool will slice the long video for me and put together the most interesting parts,” says Lytle who is best known for Buzzfeed’s LadyLike and now also works behind-the-scenes as a creative producer and director. “I just go in and tweak what Munch edits to make it my own.” More traditional editing tools like Premier Pro have released AI features including Adobe
ADBE
-1.2% Sensei to streamline workflow in the video post-production process.

2. Dubbing
YouTube Creators have always been able to reach a global audience. However, it’s previously been too time consuming and expensive to dub videos in local languages which was a big missed opportunity for Creators to customize their content based on who they know is watching. AI tools like DeepTune and Vidby help solve that issue. Vidby charges a subscription fee based on the number of hours of video and level of features. One premium feature called “voice cloning” delivers a sound-alike voice of the Creator mimicking their original tone. In his weekly Night Light newsletter, Night Media CEO and founder Reed Duchscher who reps Jimmy Donaldson (aka Mr. Beast) says “[from] what I’ve heard so far, until AI can actually recognize emotion better and dub in a decent way, I think that multi-language is going to take a backseat for the majority if not 99% of creators.” Like most AI tools, the machine learning is constantly expanding knowledge base and releasing better quality results over time.

3. Music
Music plays an important part of any new video – but it’s often expensive and impossible to access well-known music for commercial use on social media. Third-party audio libraries like Epidemic Sound, JinglePunks and Audio Network helped solve this hurdle for Creators but now it may get even easier to discover the perfect sound for your creative vision. YouTuber Robbi Jan who has almost 600,000 Subscribers on the platform has been testing the waters with YouTube’s Dream Track for Shorts feature. Announced last November, Dream Track allows YouTubers to source music using text prompts. The program includes music from top recording artists like Charlie Puth and T-Pain. YouTube has made it clear this is an early test but the potential is promising for Creators on the platform.

-5.3% Design to create Instagram Story templates to promote their new video content. Up-and-coming Creators also turn to Beautiful.ai and Canva to design electronic press kits (EPKs) to promote themselves to brands and partners. Creator Morgan Gold of Gold Shaw Farm (over 850,000 Subscribers on YouTube) has gotten creative using D-iD to animate static stock imagery to appear as if they’re talking. While Mai Pham and her creative director Kayli Sandoval has utilized Adobe Photoshop’s Generative Fill to edit photos by filling in empty space with a cohesive look and feel.

5. Product Placement
One of the most intriguing new AI offerings for Creators offers a fresh source of revenue. This technology enables the insertion of branded products into a video after a final cut has been delivered. Enhanced in-scene advertising company Rembrand is working with top talent like Lauren Riihimaki (aka LaurDIY), Miki Rai, and Lavendaire. “Virtual product placement is a new revenue opportunity that is still in its very early stage,” says Brittany Maxwell, a talent manager at industry leader Select Management Group. “We’re excited to see how AI evolves to create efficiencies and provide new revenue streams for our Creators.

This is not a conclusive list. Just examples of how Creators are actually using AI to date. Some Creators and their teams admit they haven’t figured out how best to use the new technology. This is likely the year Creators will double down on putting artificial intelligence to work in supporting and growing their existing business. There’s an AI-powered tool for just about everything at this point including contractable.ai for legal templates and even Bena.Social for your very own virtual agent to negotiate brand endorsements on your behalf. Lest we forget, the onslaught of AI-generated virtual Creators like Kuki who’s worked with H&M and the original Creator bot Lil Miquela who has partnered with PacSun, Calvin Klein and more.

Even so, over 40% of working hours could ultimately be transformed – so businesses will need to move quickly to navigate these changes in the way that is best for both their organizations and their employees.Here are three areas leaders need to consider as they do so, outlined in Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs – A Business Toolkit, a white paper written by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with Accenture.A business strategy matrix for effectively leading the workforce transition through the large-scale deployment of LLMs. Image: Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs – A Business Toolkit1. Job change and job displacement riskJob tasks with the highest potential for automation by LLMs are those that use language in a routine and repetitive manner – and roles emphasizing these types of tasks could see a decline. At the same time, LLMs could augment many jobs, assisting with those that rely on abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.Organizations should respond by supporting workers through any disruption, the report says. Using predictive analytics to forecast the jobs most likely to be affected by LLMs will empower employees with the knowledge to make better decisions as they look to reskill or move to a new role. This will increase trust and wellbeing, as well as performance and business accountability.Alongside, creating an internal job marketplace that helps employees understand available opportunities and transition into new roles will provide workers with growth opportunities and firms with a tool to address talent shortages.All of this should be underpinned by a culture that values and rewards flexibility in job roles. Encouraging employees to embrace diverse work experiences and develop skills useful across different roles will increase workforce agility – and could reduce anxiety around job displacement.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology? Show moreThe Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2023 report outlined the technologies poised to positively impact society in the next few years, from health technology to AI to sustainable computing. The World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is driving responsible technology governance, enabling industry transformation, addressing planetary health, and promoting equity and inclusion.Learn more about our impact: Digital inclusion: Our EDISON Alliance is mobilizing leaders from across sectors to accelerate digital inclusion, having positively impacted the lives of 454 million people through the activation of 250 initiatives across 90 countries.AI in developing economies: Our Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Rwanda is promoting the adoption of new technologies in the country, enabling over 4,000 daily health consultations using AI.Innovative healthcare: Our Medicine from the Sky initiative is using drones to deliver medicine to remote areas in India, completing over 950 successful drone flights.AI for agriculture: We are working with the Government of India to scale up agricultural technology in the country, helping more than 7,000 farmers monitor the health of their crops and soil using AI.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesWant to know more about our centre’s impact or get involved?

The Forum report highlights that emerging data shows LLMs in fact have potential to improve job quality by making room for more creativity, problem solving and independent decision-making.Ensuring this happens will rely on organizations including workers in the governance of LLMs, involving diverse teams in their development, and promoting awareness around the benefits of new tools.For example, LLMs have the greatest impact when developed and used by teams with a diverse mix of skills and perspectives, helping to reduce bias and implement required operational changes – 92% of companies that scale AI effectively use cross-platform, multidisciplinary teams.Transparent and inclusive governance is also key to effective deployments and building trust. This can be achieved through the creation of frameworks that explain how LLM design and use should be guided by participative decisions, employee feedback and ongoing assessment and refinement.3. Skilling and learningBusiness leaders estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted in the next five years, according to the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023. As such, training will need to focus on the skills predicted to grow the most – including analytical skills, creative thinking, technology literacy and lifelong learning.Businesses can address this by increasing LLM fluency among their workforces with courses that explain the technology’s opportunities and limitations. This will help employees understand how their jobs will evolve, how they can use AI, and its benefits to the organization.Work-based learning opportunities, such as apprenticeships and temporary assignments, are an effective way of keeping employees’ skills current and creating a culture of lifelong learning, the report says.Alongside these literacy and skilling programmes, which will help build confidence in LLMs and encourage their use, businesses should develop a skills-first approach to upskilling and hiring. This involves ensuring a person has the right competencies – rather than the right degree or previous job title – for a particular role. And it can have a big impact – some studies have shown that companies hiring based on skills are 36% less likely to face talent and skills shortages.The potential of LLMs in the workplace is huge, and considerations such as those outlined in the Forum’s toolkit will help guide business leaders to take advantage of the technology in a way that benefits the organization, employees and society.Have you read?Artificial intelligence will transform decision-making.

Source: Getty.January 11, 2024ShareSave Subscribe to Listen00:0012:30Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration.Earlier this week, the Telegraph reported a curious admission from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. In a filing submitted to the U.K. Parliament, the company said that “leading AI models” could not exist without unfettered access to copyrighted books and articles, confirming that the generative-AI industry, worth tens of billions of dollars, depends on creative work owned by other people.We already know, for example, that pirated-book libraries have been used to train the generative-AI products of companies such as Meta and Bloomberg. But AI companies have long claimed that generative AI “reads” or “learns from” these books and articles, as a human would, rather than copying them. Therefore, this approach supposedly constitutes “fair use,” with no compensation owed to authors or publishers. Since courts have not ruled on this question, the tech industry has made a colossal gamble developing products in this way. And the odds may be turning against them.Read: These 183,000 books are fueling the biggest fight in publishing and techTwo lawsuits, filed by the Universal Music Group and The New York Times in October and December, respectively, make use of the fact that large language models—the technology underpinning ChatGPT and other generative-AI tools—can “memorize” some portion of their training text and reproduce it verbatim when prompted in specific ways, emitting long sections of copyrighted texts. This damages the fair-use argument.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story. Start your subscription.Uncompromising quality. Enduring impact.

Toronto-based artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical startup BenchSci has reduced its headcount as the startup looks to adapt to the impact of generative AI in the field of drug discovery.
BenchSci announced the layoffs in a LinkedIn post on Monday, but did not disclose how many staff were let go as part of these layoffs, nor did it share what percentage of the company’s total workforce these layoffs represent. 

“We believe that generative AI will continue to reshape preclinical [R&D] and have a substantial positive impact on our customers.”

A BenchSci spokesperson has since confirmed to BetaKit that the startup laid off 70 team members, marking a 17 percent reduction in headcount.
In its LinkedIn post, BenchSci cited several reasons behind its workforce reduction, including “shifts in the economic environment, operational efficiencies, and adaptation to technological advancements,” specifically citing generative AI.
“We believe that generative AI will continue to reshape preclinical [research and development] and have a substantial positive impact on our customers,” BenchSci said in its LinkedIn post. “As we look towards our future, these changes will allow us to further our investment in generative AI and work toward making drug discovery more efficient and help bring new medicine to patients faster.”

“As we continue our work to revolutionize preclinical drug discovery, this decision stems from shifts in our longer-term strategic direction and what we know will have the greatest impact on our customers—which includes furthering our investment in generative AI,” BenchSci co-founder and CEO Liran Belenzon said in a statement sent to BetaKit. “Parting ways with team members is extremely difficult, and we are committed to supporting them through this transition.”
The layoffs come roughly six months after BenchSci closed $95 million in Series D funding to expand its AI-powered drug-discovery platform. Using text and image-based machine learning models, BenchSci claims its software allows scientists to accelerate the pace and increase the success of research during the preclinical drug-development process.
BenchSci is not the only Canadian AI and biomedical startup to have reduced its headcount in recent months. In late November, Vancouver-based AbCellera laid off 63 employees, or 10 percent of its workforce. In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the layoffs would help it “focus its efforts toward the clinical development of new antibody medicines for patients.”
At the time of BenchSci’s Series D fundraise, Belenzon told BetaKit that in the 15 months between its $63-million Series C financing round and its Series D round, the startup had tripled its revenue and doubled its team size from 200 to 400.
UPDATE (01/08/2024): This story was updated with commentary from BenchSci’s CEO, as well as information regarding how many team members were let go.

Viral Lists Reveal Artists Whose Work May Have Trained an A.I. Art Generator
Thousands of painters, cartoonists, sculptors and other creatives are featured in the documents, which reinvigorated debates around copyright infringement and consent

                Lists are circulating online that contain the names of artists whose work was allegedly used to train an A.I. image generation tool without their permission.

Artists are accusing the developers of an artificial intelligence art generator of ripping off their work after a list containing the names of thousands of creatives recently began circulating online.
They claim the list confirms what they had long suspected: that Midjourney—the company behind a popular text-to-image generative A.I. technology—used their artwork without their permission to train its art generator.
Powered By                         10 Sec      The Great Diving Beetle Is an Impressive Underwater Hunter         NextStay5    


The list in question contains the names of 4,700 individuals. The artist Jon Lam shared it online in late December, but it was initially included in a court exhibit in November as part of a lawsuit against Midjourney and several other generative A.I. companies.
A larger spreadsheet titled “Midjourney Style List” is also circulating online. The spreadsheet reportedly contains the names of some 16,000 “proposed additions.” (Though its owners have made it inaccessible, a version of the sheet still exists on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.)
David Holz, Midjourney’s founder, purportedly shared the list on Discord in 2022, reports NBC News’ Angela Yang. 
The lists feature painters, cartoonists, filmmakers, animators, sculptors and many other types of creatives, both living and dead. They include famous figures such as Tim Burton, Pablo Picasso, Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney and Banksy.
Many lesser-known artists also made it onto the lists, including a 6-year-old, reports ARTnews’ Karen K. Ho.
Together, the lists have reinvigorated the debate around whether A.I. should be allowed to imitate the work of real-life artists—and, perhaps more importantly, make money off those imitations. Legal and ethical questions about copyright infringement and consent continue to swirl, with artists calling for greater regulation of A.I. art generators and related technologies. Some creatives are asking lawmakers—and the courts—to help settle the issue.
Tools like Midjourney use machine learning models to study vast amounts of data, including online images of artwork and stills from movies and video games. Then, when a user inputs a prompt, like “Paint the Faroe Islands in the style of Vincent van Gogh,” the A.I. uses its training to produce an image that matches the request. Artists argue that the A.I. platforms are spitting out replicas of their existing work—much of which is copyrighted—rather than using it as inspiration to create something new.
In a 2022 interview with Forbes’ Rob Salkowitz, Holz acknowledged that the company did not seek consent from living artists to use their work while training Midjourney’s generative A.I. technology. The company also did not get permission to use copyrighted work, he told the publication.
“There’s no way to find a picture on the internet and then automatically trace it to an owner and then have any way of doing anything to authenticate it,” Holz said.
When asked if artists could opt out of having their work included in the training data, Holz responded that the company was “looking at that.”
Some artists are taking matters into their own hands. For example, researchers at the University of Chicago have created programs that make images difficult for A.I. tools to scrape.
In the meantime, as the legal landscape evolves, “documents like the ‘Midjourney Style List’ [can help] shed light on the actual processes of converting copyrighted artwork into A.I. reference material,” writes the Art Newspaper’s Theo Belci.

A.I. ‘Completes’ Keith Haring’s Intentionally Unfinished Painting
Critics say the image is disrespectful of the original work, which the artist made as a commentary on the AIDS epidemic

The year before he died of AIDS-related complications, the artist Keith Haring created a unique work known only as Unfinished Painting (1989). In its upper-left quadrant, black and white lines form stylized patterns on a purple background. Streaks of purple paint trickle down onto the otherwise empty lower-left quadrant; the right half of the canvas is also blank. Haring intentionally left the work unfinished as a commentary on the AIDS crisis.
Now, a newly “completed” version of the work—made with the help of artificial intelligence—is generating controversy: A social media user employed an A.I. image generator to expand Haring’s designs across the blank sections of the canvas, ultimately posting the altered image on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“The story behind this painting is so sad!” writes the user, who goes by Donnel. “Now using A.I. we can complete what he couldn’t finish!” 
The image was met with intense backlash.
“It’s very disrespectful to not only anyone who was around during the AIDS epidemic, but particularly those who died from it or who lost friends and loved ones during it,” Tina Tallon, a researcher of A.I. and the arts at the University of Florida, tells NBC News’ Kalhan Rosenblatt.
Born in 1958, Haring rose to fame through the graffiti art he drew inside the New York subways. In the early ’80s, “Haring produced hundreds of these public drawings in rapid rhythmic lines, sometimes creating as many as 40 ‘subway drawings’ in one day,” according to the Keith Haring Foundation. “This seamless flow of images became familiar to New York commuters.” He began exhibiting his art in cities around the world.
While Haring is perhaps best known for his colorful, playful designs, he also used his art to help raise awareness of the AIDS crisis. In 1988, he was diagnosed with the disease, which he died from in 1990, when he was 31.
“I find the ‘completed’ version of the artwork to be abhorrent,” artist Brooke Peachley, whose post honoring Haring’s work prompted Donnel’s, tells Hyperallergic’s Elaine Velie and Rhea Nayyar, using a pseudonym for her last name. “Not only does ‘completing’ the painting completely negate it of its original meaning, but spits on the tens of thousands of queer individuals who lost their lives to the AIDS epidemic in the ’80s and ’90s.”
She adds: “To do so using generative A.I., a computer program that cannot feel the weight of what it is doing nor create with any sort of human intention, only adds to the disrespect.”

What’s more, the A.I.-generated image doesn’t appear to be faithful to Haring’s style, which often included images of human figures. These kinds of figures are visible in Haring’s original piece, but the image generator wasn’t able to replicate them.
“The once deeply intentional curves and shapes eerily lose their form as the program moves farther and farther away from the original source,” Peachley tells Hyperallergic.
Ever since A.I. image generators became publicly available, their role in the art world has been a matter of debate. Many artists worry that these models are trained on copyrighted works by living artists—who didn’t consent for their art to be used in this manner. Just last month, a list of thousands of artists allegedly used to train Midjourney started circulating, intensifying concerns about how A.I. art interacts with copyright law.
“Right now, we don’t really have structures or frameworks for engaging with A.I.,” Tallon tells NBC News. “Or engaging with generative AI in a way that I think fully respects artists and the agency of artists and their agency over their own creative work, whether living or dead.”

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Jan 9, 2024, 12:37 PM ESTShare this story72 Comments / 72 NewArtists have noted various inconsistencies with several of the dragon images in Wacom’s recent promotional campaign. Image: WacomPopular drawing tablet manufacturer Wacom is the latest target being slammed by the digital art community after appearing to use AI-generated images in ads. Over the weekend, creatives across X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok noticed that Wacom was promoting its Intuos pen tablet with a dragon illustration that showed telltale marks of AI-generated images — such as questionable scale designs and fur blending unnaturally into other sections of the image.Wacom deleted the images without explanation, fueling speculation that an industry-standard brand for artists was using tools widely criticized for replacing them. And it wasn’t the only AI controversy this weekend. Wizards of the Coast (WotC), the publisher behind Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, also issued an apology on Sunday for using an ad with AI-generated elements. The controversies have escalated mistrust around an already complicated question: how can creatives, and the companies that work with them, navigate a flood of images that are easy to create and hard to conclusively detect?Many artists have already rallied against companies using generative AI. They fear it could impact job security across a wide range of creative professions like graphic design, illustration, animation, and voice acting. But there’s a particular sense of betrayal around brands like Wacom, whose main audience is artists. The company has long been considered the industry standard supplier for drawing tablets, thanks to the success of products like its professional Cintiq lineup. At the same time, it’s facing more competition than ever from rival brands like XPPen and Xencelabs.Wacom initially didn’t respond to artists’ complaint. Several days later, and after this article was published, the company issued a contrite statement saying that the images in question had been purchased from a third-party vendor and had evaded being flagged by the online AI detection tools it used for vetting.“We want to assure you that using Al generated images in these assets was not our intent,” Wacom wrote. The company said it is now unsure whether AI was used in their creation. “For this reason, we immediately discontinued their use.”WotC’s issues are more straightforward — but in some ways, they point to a tougher problem. The company announced in August that it would prohibit AI-generated imagery in its products after confirming AI was used to create some artwork for the Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants D&D sourcebook. In December, WotC also refuted claims that AI-generated imagery was included in the upcoming 2024 Players Handbook for D&D.Despite this, the company shared a new marketing campaign for its Magic: The Gathering card game on January 4th that was quickly scrutinized for containing strangely deformed elements commonly associated with AI-generated imagery. The company initially denied AI was involved, insisting that the image was made by a human artist, only to back down three days later and acknowledge that it did in fact contain AI-generated components. In an apology that followed, WotC implied the issue was tied to the increasing prevalence of generative AI integrations within widely used creative software like Adobe Photoshop’s generative fill feature.“We can’t promise to be perfect in such a fast-evolving space, especially with generative AI becoming standard in tools such as Photoshop,” said WotC in its online statement. “But our aim is to always come down on the side of human made art and artists.”WotC says it’s examining how it’ll work with vendors to better detect unauthorized AI usage within any marketing materials they submit — but that’s easier said than done these days. There are currently no truly reliable means to check if a given image was generated using AI. AI detectors are notoriously unreliable and regularly flag false positives, and other methods like the Content Credentials metadata backed by Adobe can only provide information for images created using specific software or platforms.Even defining AI-generated content is getting harder. Tools like Firefly, the AI model integrated into Photoshop and Illustrator, allow users to make prompt-driven alterations on individual layers. Some creative professionals argue these are simply tools that artists can benefit from, but others believe any generative AI features are exploitive because they’re often trained on masses of content collected without creators’ knowledge or consent. Adobe has assured users that Firefly-powered AI tools are only trained on content that Adobe owns, but that doesn’t mean they’re passing everyone’s ethical sniff test.The situation has left bystanders visually checking projects for telltale signs of inhuman origin and organizations trusting artists to not lie about how their content was made. Neither option is exactly infallible.That uncertainty has driven a wedge of paranoia and anxiety throughout the online creative community as artists desperately attempt to avoid contributing to — or being exploited by — the growing AI infestation. The rapid deployment of generative AI technology has made it incredibly difficult to avoid. The inability to trust artists or brands to disclose how their content is produced has also sparked AI “witch hunts” led by creatives. The goal is to hold companies accountable for using the technology instead of paying designers, but in some cases, accusations are entirely speculative and actually harm human artists.Even when companies insist that AI hasn’t been involved, creatives are understandably skeptical. A poster for Marvel’s Loki TV series on Disney Plus was also criticized last year after some creatives claimed it contained AI-generated stock assets from Shutterstock. Following its own investigation, Shutterstock said that the stock image was human-made, and that a “software tool” had instead been used to create the “subtle creative imperfections most often associated with AI generated art.” Shutterstock declined, however, to share what the software tool in question was.The headache of trying to avoid generative AI entirely — including by unknowingly promoting it or having online portfolios scraped to train it — has proved too much for some creatives. Artists have credited it as a reason for leaving the industry or contemplating abandoning their studies. At least one art competition, the annual Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO) cover contest, was shut down entirely after last year’s winner admitted under duress to using banned AI tools.But even creatives who don’t expect to stop generative AI’s development want something more substantive from companies than “trust me bro,” especially when those companies rely on their patronage. Artists value honesty and accountability over stonewalling and evasiveness about whether AI tools are being used.Wacom and WotC eventually provided similar responses to their respective situations: that the offending images had come from a third-party vendor, that the companies were unaware that AI had been used to make them, and that they promised to do better in the future. That hasn’t reassured some artists, however, who questioned how apparent hallucinations within the images had gone undetected, and why these creative companies weren’t hiring artists directly.Both cases suggest that anti-AI pressure campaigns will remain an ongoing force in the creative world.

Over the weekend, creatives across X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok noticed that Wacom was promoting its Intuos pen tablet with a dragon illustration that showed telltale marks of AI-generated images — such as questionable scale designs and fur blending unnaturally into other sections of the image.

Wacom deleted the images without explanation, fueling speculation that an industry-standard brand for artists was using tools widely criticized for replacing them. And it wasn’t the only AI controversy this weekend. Wizards of the Coast (WotC), the publisher behind Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, also issued an apology on Sunday for using an ad with AI-generated elements. The controversies have escalated mistrust around an already complicated question: how can creatives, and the companies that work with them, navigate a flood of images that are easy to create and hard to conclusively detect?

[Media: https://twitter.com/Rahll/status/1743810708075131186]

Many artists have already rallied against companies using generative AI. They fear it could impact job security across a wide range of creative professions like graphic design, illustration, animation, and voice acting. But there’s a particular sense of betrayal around brands like Wacom, whose main audience is artists. The company has long been considered the industry standard supplier for drawing tablets, thanks to the success of products like its professional Cintiq lineup. At the same time, it’s facing more competition than ever from rival brands like XPPen and Xencelabs.

Wacom initially didn’t respond to artists’ complaint. Several days later, and after this article was published, the company issued a contrite statement saying that the images in question had been purchased from a third-party vendor and had evaded being flagged by the online AI detection tools it used for vetting.

“We want to assure you that using Al generated images in these assets was not our intent,” Wacom wrote. The company said it is now unsure whether AI was used in their creation. “For this reason, we immediately discontinued their use.”

[Media: https://twitter.com/RoaminBison/status/1744104852823896485]

WotC’s issues are more straightforward — but in some ways, they point to a tougher problem. The company announced in August that it would prohibit AI-generated imagery in its products after confirming AI was used to create some artwork for the Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants D&D sourcebook. In December, WotC also refuted claims that AI-generated imagery was included in the upcoming 2024 Players Handbook for D&D.

Despite this, the company shared a new marketing campaign for its Magic: The Gathering card game on January 4th that was quickly scrutinized for containing strangely deformed elements commonly associated with AI-generated imagery. The company initially denied AI was involved, insisting that the image was made by a human artist, only to back down three days later and acknowledge that it did in fact contain AI-generated components. In an apology that followed, WotC implied the issue was tied to the increasing prevalence of generative AI integrations within widely used creative software like Adobe Photoshop’s generative fill feature.

“We can’t promise to be perfect in such a fast-evolving space, especially with generative AI becoming standard in tools such as Photoshop,” said WotC in its online statement. “But our aim is to always come down on the side of human made art and artists.”

[Media: https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/1744056808254173447]

WotC says it’s examining how it’ll work with vendors to better detect unauthorized AI usage within any marketing materials they submit — but that’s easier said than done these days. There are currently no truly reliable means to check if a given image was generated using AI. AI detectors are notoriously unreliable and regularly flag false positives, and other methods like the Content Credentials metadata backed by Adobe can only provide information for images created using specific software or platforms.

Even defining AI-generated content is getting harder. Tools like Firefly, the AI model integrated into Photoshop and Illustrator, allow users to make prompt-driven alterations on individual layers. Some creative professionals argue these are simply tools that artists can benefit from, but others believe any generative AI features are exploitive because they’re often trained on masses of content collected without creators’ knowledge or consent. Adobe has assured users that Firefly-powered AI tools are only trained on content that Adobe owns, but that doesn’t mean they’re passing everyone’s ethical sniff test.

The situation has left bystanders visually checking projects for telltale signs of inhuman origin and organizations trusting artists to not lie about how their content was made. Neither option is exactly infallible.

[Media: https://twitter.com/johannamation/status/1743766546030444601]

That uncertainty has driven a wedge of paranoia and anxiety throughout the online creative community as artists desperately attempt to avoid contributing to — or being exploited by — the growing AI infestation. The rapid deployment of generative AI technology has made it incredibly difficult to avoid. The inability to trust artists or brands to disclose how their content is produced has also sparked AI “witch hunts” led by creatives. The goal is to hold companies accountable for using the technology instead of paying designers, but in some cases, accusations are entirely speculative and actually harm human artists.

Even when companies insist that AI hasn’t been involved, creatives are understandably skeptical. A poster for Marvel’s Loki TV series on Disney Plus was also criticized last year after some creatives claimed it contained AI-generated stock assets from Shutterstock. Following its own investigation, Shutterstock said that the stock image was human-made, and that a “software tool” had instead been used to create the “subtle creative imperfections most often associated with AI generated art.” Shutterstock declined, however, to share what the software tool in question was.

The headache of trying to avoid generative AI entirely — including by unknowingly promoting it or having online portfolios scraped to train it — has proved too much for some creatives. Artists have credited it as a reason for leaving the industry or contemplating abandoning their studies. At least one art competition, the annual Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO) cover contest, was shut down entirely after last year’s winner admitted under duress to using banned AI tools.

[Media: https://twitter.com/lalalyssh/status/1743777593844011420]

But even creatives who don’t expect to stop generative AI’s development want something more substantive from companies than “trust me bro,” especially when those companies rely on their patronage. Artists value honesty and accountability over stonewalling and evasiveness about whether AI tools are being used.

Wacom and WotC eventually provided similar responses to their respective situations: that the offending images had come from a third-party vendor, that the companies were unaware that AI had been used to make them, and that they promised to do better in the future. That hasn’t reassured some artists, however, who questioned how apparent hallucinations within the images had gone undetected, and why these creative companies weren’t hiring artists directly.

Both cases suggest that anti-AI pressure campaigns will remain an ongoing force in the creative world. Generative AI might not be going anywhere — but for many companies, using it has turned into a PR nightmare.

Update January 9th, 5:11PM ET: Added Wacom’s response to accusations that it used AI generated images.

(PATH) Stock9 Comments21 LikesBert Hochfeld22.45K FollowersFollowSummaryUiPath is the leading vendor, by far, in the Robotic Process Automation space.Last quarter's results were exceptionally strong and seemingly marked a breakout in terms of net new ARR.The space itself is bucking macro headwinds and is enjoying strong adoption, with 3rd party analysts forecasting a CAGR for the next several years in the mid-high 30% range.Process automation coupled with generative AI simply works much better in terms of deploying solutions than Generative AI on its own.The company's competitive position is perhaps as dominant as any other vendor in any other space within the IT market.    Shutthiphong ChandaengWhat do bots say about Path’s consistent growth? As many have observed, the last two years in the market have been a period in which stocks fell consistently for months, and then rose quite sharply, albeit not in a straight line. Depending on what ETF a reader might look at, the change over 2 years has been small, with the QQQ and the IGV ETFs up about 10% due to the weighting of the magnificent seven, while the Wisdom Tree Cloud ETF (WCLD) is still down more than 30% from its level at the start of 2022. The SPDR ETF is almost exactly unchanged over the same span. There are plenty of bold individuals who make guesses as to what is next-in politics, style and of course the market. Sometimes the guesses are right; often time’s forecasts go seriously awry. This is not an article trying to call the market for 2024. It is an article updating my last article regarding UiPath that was published on SA in April 2023. The shares have risen more than 35% since then, quite a bit more than the market as a while, mainly in the wake of what might be considered to have been a break-out quarter. That said, like the shares of many other high growth IT, the shares remain almost 40% below their levels of 2 years ago. Have Path shares run too fast and too far? The temptation is there to believe that thesis. Many observers have written much about the extraordinary rally of the last two months. I have no specific idea if the rally continues or consolidates. For the most part, the rally was based on waning inflation and lower interest rates. Currently there is a debate between those who believe that there will be 6 rate cuts, i.e. rates going from about 5% to 3.5% this year, and those who think the terminal rate will be 4.25%. In turn that evolution will be primarily decided on how the overall economy grows and how employment metrics progress. I don’t have that kind of crystal ball; for the record my favorite economist, Ian Shepherdson, who runs Pantheon Macroeconomics, is forecasting a greater than anticipated rise in unemployment and consequently more rather than fewer rate cuts. His track record on such calls, while not perfect, is better than that of most other economists. Just based on the velocity of the rally in last weeks of 2023, I would guess PATH shares, along with most else high-growth IT, will consolidate for a time until there is some additional validation of the soft landing thesis or more likely the thesis of Mr. Shepherdson. I don’t really expect some short-term out-performance from high growth IT shares, and that includes UiPath (NYSE:PATH) shares. Some technical analysis suggest there will be a short term sell-off in the shares of the magnificent 7: if that happens, PATH shares will go along. As it happens, some of the consolidation that I have expected has finally arrived with the New Year. Path shares have fallen by 11.5% in just the last 3 trading sessions, and have perhaps provided investors with a better opportunity to enter a position. But I am certainly not trying to forecast any macro headlines which will have a significant impact on the share price of PATH over the next few weeks. But this is an article about the operational performance and the valuation of PATH over the next 12 months. This is not a trading call, or an attempt to forecast how markets, and UiPath shares might trade in the next couple of weeks. If you want that, consult your local necromancer. Part of the valuation of UiPath shares will be determined by how the market plays out in 2024 and exactly how the market for high growth IT shares will evolve as the year progresses. It would be naïve to imagine that Path shares can achieve significant appreciation without at least a benign market environment for high growth IT shares. That said, UI Path will chart its own course with regards to its growth which I expect to exceed current consensus forecasts for reasons outlined in this article. Just as last quarter was a breakout period for PATH, I expect that many of the positive trends seen then to reprised in the quarter next to be reported (est. reporting date will be 3/15/24). But the question really is can Path continue to achieve accelerating revenue growth and maintain strong improvements in profitability even if the economy starts to decelerate. This article explores that in depth with a conclusion that the likelihood is that growth expectations will increase throughout the year. Based on that expectation, this is article reaffirming my prior purchase recommendation for Path shares at this time and at this price. Last quarter, Path’s revenue growth and the year on year growth of the ARR balance reached 24%. Net new ARR grew by 15% sequentially. The company’s free cash flow margin was about 13%. The company increased its expected year end ARR noticeably, and also increased its forecast for non-GAAP operating income. That said, the 1st Call consensus for 2024 revenue growth is below 20%, implying a growth slowdown from the levels expected for this current quarter. The company’s backlog (RPO balance) grew nearly 30% which self-evidently is a contradictory indicator with regards to Path’s actual growth momentum. In some ways, the most encouraging part of Path’s performance was the sequential growth in ARR additions. It is, to be sure, a second order number, but I often look at it as an indication of the changes in health in terms of go-to-market efficiency. When asked about Q4 guidance which calls for revenue growth of 24%, the CFO indicated explicitly that the forecast was based on putting adequate prudence and macro-economic concerns into the projection. The company’s forecast also was said to reflect macro headwinds at the lower end of the company’s market; the company’s go to market focus remains on acquiring larger customers with a higher propensity to grow. This focus was partly responsible for a constant currency, dollar based net expansion rate of 123% in the quarter.    Ashim Gupta Yes, I would just say, Mark, we're really pleased with our performance and the team's execution. We are focused on closing out a good year-end here. And the teams are really focused on that. And we look at our fourth quarter guidance just putting the right prudence and the right macroeconomic variability included in our guidance, and we'll update as we get closer to next year.  In this very uncertain environment, the company has taken an appropriately conservative path with regards to guidance; if the macro environment improves for enterprise IT spend as the most recent surveys have been suggesting, then current guidance and expectations are likely to see noticeable upward revisions. Some analysts on SA who have downgraded their rating of the shares have done so without considering the messaging here, which is not to be too literal in using the guided numbers as the most likely forecast. Just for the record, the company is now forecasting Q4 revenues of $383 million; that compares to a prior revenue forecast of $380 million. Ending ARR is now forecast to be $1.455 billion; the prior forecast for ending ARR was $1.435 billion. For a company like this, ARR and ARR growth are the most important metrics to consider in evaluating sales growth. The company increased its forecast for Q4 non-GAAP operating income to $78 million; the prior forecast for that metric had been $63 million. Recently, 3rd party surveys for IT spending growth have begun to tick upwards. While surveys aren’t always accurate, there seems to be a theme that last year’s anemic revenue growth for the space represented an aberration in IT spending growth. I am inclined to agree with that theme. The most recent surveys also point to a growth acceleration in the process automation space specifically, the space in which PATH enjoys a market leading position. When it comes to Path, in particular, it has been able to develop products that users view as an important component of an AI strategy. I will discuss the product strategy in greater detail below, but the concept that automation using bots + AI are better together seems to be resonating with large enterprises. Why PATH’s growth is showing signs of acceleration UiPath is the leading company in what is called the Robotic Process Automation space. This technology makes it easy for developers to build, deploy and manage software robots (most usually abbreviated as bots). The bots can be taught to emulate human actions such as understanding what is on a screen, completing the right keystrokes and perform a wide range of defined actions-basically repetitive tasks, and to do so far faster and more accurately than the comparable human actions can achieve. I have linked to a white paper by PATH’s marketing function that does a deeper dive into what RPA is all about. It is hardly any secret that users want to invest, and invest heavily in generative AI solutions. That investment will be a rising tide for many boats-and so far as it goes, many investors. But perhaps, not all boats. Initially, when the AI craze struck market participants with full force last spring, one issue that arose for PATH-or at least PATH shares, was whether the deployment of generative AI would mean less need for the process automation bots that are the heart of what this company sells. The underpinning of that thesis is linked here Despite the provocative headline, in the context of PATH’s operating performance, the thesis couldn’t be more wrong. In point of fact, AI works better with process automation bots. Indeed, that is why I wrote my last article on PATH shares last spring. A few months ago, PATH introduced a new sales tool, NorthStar, which has apparently has had a significant impact on the company’s sales efficiency. I am not going to try to provide a deep dive into NorthStar; it provides PATH sales people with a road-map to present to users showing them ROI for various steps on their automation journey. The use of NorthStar is an iterative process and is having a more substantial impact on driving the increase in ARR than might be appreciated. In addition, the company’s relatively new partnerships with SAP (SAP) and with Deloitte are starting to produce some significant transactions.    Daniel Dines Well, I think that direction in the market that we are seeing right now, around autonomous agents prove a bit -- our approach that always said that AI plus automation is the thing that drives the biggest outcomes for our customers. Actually, this is what we are seeing a lot of our customers after the initial, a little bit of a pause around how AI is going to help me with my automation, they realize that they need powerful automation platform in order to harvest the power of AI. And going forward on a longer term basis with UiPath are in one of the best positions to build the next generation foundational models that understand processes, tasks, screens and documents, the type of multimodal that is built in, in order to drive automation. So it's -- to me, it's clear that the world is going into that direction. And again, we are really in a very good position to take advantage of it.  (For those unfamiliar with the term, and that most surely includes this writer until I looked it up, an autonomous agent is a system situated within and part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time in pursuit of its own objectives. According to the link above, the deployment of autonomous agents is supposed to be the next AI wave after Chat GPT. There is some uneasiness about this trend, which I confess I share, but which is not a factor in evaluating PATH shares-the only subject at hand). I think the above quote from the founder/co-CEO is really the heart of what is happening. Generative AI + automation simply produces an overall better results for users, and PATH’s selling motion NorthStar is proving that effectively to users. It is one of the key reasons why sales growth as measured by net new ARR is showing strong gains and I anticipate that this is a long lived trend that will provide allow percentage revenue growth to continue to accelerate. Another issue that in the past had been called out as inhibiting sales growth has been the lengthy deployment time for the average bot. While it is only supposed to take a few weeks to create an intelligent bot, getting a bot deployed across a business vertical takes 6-12 months, of course an unacceptable period. The issue has been creating a reasonable knowledge base that allows a specific new chatbot to achieve satisfactory performance. The company recently launched a product called UiPath AutoPilot: essentially all generative AI products simply must have “pilot” of some version of pilot in their names. In any event this pilot, which is in beta, is apparently already seeing some definitive and positive results in terms of shortening the deployment cycle for bots. Already in production and in use at some PATH clients is something called Document Understanding and Communication Mining models as explained here by the co-CEO.    Daniel Dines This is always one of our major product focus on how can we shorten the adoption curve for our customers. And we are already seeing with our autopilot family that is in private preview some really good results with the initial set of few hundreds of customers that are testing the product. So, yes, I would say that this is going to be a significant driver for adoption. And both for advanced developers, where they will get to really increase the productivity to also citizen developers that will get started faster. And also, I would like to mention that training our specialized Document Understanding and Communication Mining models using Gen AI, it has already proven this is actually in production already. And it's been proven to accelerate the deployment quite a bit.  Overall, I believe that the reasons UiPath achieved what might be described as a break-through growth quarter when it last reported are fairly straightforward. Users are getting better results in terms of their automation journeys by using bots and generative AI as part of a unified strategy. PATH solutions are designed to help developers build next generation models that understand processes, tasks, screens and documents as part of an enterprise AI strategy. The company has an effective sales tool called NorthStar that is helping its sales people document a road map and expected ROI. And it is developing tools to speed up the deployment of intelligent bots. I don’t want to suggest that I have some particular crystal ball when it comes to handicapping the company’s growth both for the company soon to be reported and for its 2024 forecast. But I think from a qualitative point of view, what was reported was a break-out quarter whose foundation is based on multiple pillars that should support growth significantly above the current 1st Call consensus revenue growth forecast of less than 20% for this year. UiPath Competition UiPath is the leader in the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) space. 3rd party analysts suggest that RPA has one of the higher CAGRs of any IT space. The study linked here suggests that the market in 2022 had a value of about $4 billion and will have a CAGR of nearly 37% over the next 10 years. That gets the market to a value of $82 billion. I am not sure how realistic a 37% CAGR projection might be. That said, the study is just 90 days old at this point. Like most of these kinds of studies, the devil is in both the details, but particularly in the definitions. In this report, much of the growth being forecast is coming from those autonomous agents about which I commented earlier in this article. Autonomous agents are part of the process of implementing generative AI solutions, so perhaps there is a foundation for the high growth forecast. UiPath, as can be seen in this most recent study by Gartner, dwarfs its competitors with a market share of around 36%. According to Gartner: UiPath is a dominant player owing to its strong performance, global brand recognition, a customer and partner ecosystem of more than 2.5 million members, and its market-influencing narrative about AI-powered automation. The Gartner study contained commentary from Wayne Butterfield, who is the Global Lead for Augmented Intelligence at ISG. Even though this sounds like a commercial, it really isn’t. It is obviously far more authoritative than anything else I am likely to find. Many prominent RPA practitioners and thought leaders will agree with this sentiment. That includes Wayne Butterfield, Global Lead for Augmented Intelligence at ISG, who exclusively shares his perspectives on the market share research below. An Analyst’s Perspective Butterfield believes the suite of complementary capabilities that UiPath couples with its “solid” RPA product drives the vendor’s market leadership. These capabilities widen the scope for automation, “ensuring the ceiling that many end clients hit with RPA alone lifted further,” he suggests. To achieve this, UiPath delved deep into adjacent fields, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Process Mining, opening up many new opportunities for customers. Alongside this, the provider has more than 5,000 partners and resellers globally. Underlining the significance of this ecosystem, Butterfield says: They have a much broader reach than the other RPA vendors, getting into clients that others may have struggled with. Finally, Butterfield notes that UiPath has become the analysts’ preferred RPA provider for the past three or four years. That timespan corresponds with how long the provider has led the RPA space, in terms of market share, as per the Gartner report. I really don’t see that I can add much to what has been said here. RPA is growing rapidly, because it is really part of a holistic AI solution. I think it is the growth in bots that are described as autonomous agents that is leading to this very strong forecast. The analysis linked below contrasts the functionality of Path with the #2 competitor, Automation Anywhere This is how that product is said to compare to UiPath’s RPA suite. Reviewers rated RPA Suite higher than Automation Success Platform in the following categories  Better at service and support Easier to integrate and deploy Better evaluation and contracting  Based on what I have read, PATH is more likely than not to continue to enjoy market dominance for the foreseeable future, and dominating this market should be a lucrative position. Gaining market share as has been the case for UiPath for some time now ought to set the company for years of growth greater than 30% suggesting a continued path to higher percentage growth that is clearly not what the consensus is currently reflecting. The UiPath Business model UiPath’s business model has seen significant improvement over the past several quarters. This is a function of better expense management, some improvement in non-GAAP gross margins, and of course leverage at scale. Last quarter non-GAAP gross margins rose slightly to 87% of revenues compared to 86% in the preceding year. They also rose by 100 bps sequentially. The company has a rather substantial set of new products that are moving into GA; this might produce a minor headwind on short term gross margins. The non-GAAP sales and marketing expense ratio last quarter was 47% compared to 47% in the year earlier quarter. Sequentially, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense rose by 19%. To an extent, this kind of increase was a catchup from the prior quarter during which non-GAAP sales and marketing expense actually declined year on year, an unsustainable cadence. Of more significance was a reclassification of expenses between general and administrative and sales and marketing which is expected to reverse in this current quarter. Over the first 9 months of this current fiscal year, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense fell to 45% of revenue down from 53% of revenues in the comparable year-ago period. Basically, sales and marketing expense declined year on year through the first 6 months of the year and then rose as indicated, partially a function of reclassifying some expense, but also accelerated sales hiring. The company, I believe, is going to attempt to achieve 30%+ revenue growth next year in a difficult software sales environment. To achieve such a goal, the company will need adequate sales capacity in-place and reasonably trained at the start of the fiscal year. The research and development spend ratio was a comparatively modest 16% of revenue last quarter, essentially unchanged from the year earlier period. Non-GAAP research and development spend was essentially flat sequentially while sequential revenues rose by 13.5%. The Non-GAAP general and administrative expense ratio, as mentioned, was severely depressed last quarter due to the classification of some expenses into the sales and marketing category. Reported non-GAAP general and administrative expense was down almost 15% year on year and was 10% of revenues compared to 16% of revenues in the year earlier period. It would be difficult to imagine running a company of this scale on a general and administrative expense ratio of 10% over the long term. Over the first 9 months of the year, reported general and administrative expense was also down by about 16% and it was down by 3% sequentially. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses for the 3rd quarter were 74% of revenue compared to 79.5% of revenue in the prior year. This put non-GAAP operating margins at 13% of revenue compared to 7% in the year earlier period. The company is forecasting that its non-GAAP operating margin will reach 20% of revenue in this current quarter. On the surface, that looks ambitious as it implies a decline in non-GAAP operating expense in the quarter. Presumably most of that will come out of the still very elevated non-GAAP sales and marketing expense ratio. The company has seen some significant seasonality in the past with a quarterly operating margin which was actually 22% in the year earlier period. For the full year, the company CFO has forecast non-GAAP operating margins will be 13.7% compared to 6.1% in the year earlier time frame. The latest published 1st call consensus essentially calls for non-GAAP margins to fall noticeably in FY ‘25; I would suggest that is fairly unlikely. The company is quite focused on spending discipline, and it has achieved spending discipline and the results of the last year are indicative of that discipline. My guess is that the company will wind up continuing to grow non-GAAP operating margins for the year, and that current valuation metrics do not reflect a more likely margin improvement. Of course, the combination of reasonable spending discipline and resurging growth make it much easier for the company to achieve a path to stronger margins-no pun intended. The company continued to generate cash; through 9 months its free cashflow margin was 17%; in the year earlier period the company burned cash. Unlike most other enterprise software companies, the growth in the deferred revenue balance was relatively strong last quarter. The company does use stock based compensation, and stock based compensation expense was 28% of revenues last quarter, down from 36% of revenues in the year earlier period. Stock based comp. actually fell 6% sequentially. I look at actual dilution to factor in the real expense of stock based comp. Outstanding shares rose 3% year on year. I have forecast that 12 month forward outstanding shares will be 588 million, up 3.5% from the outstanding shares in the period most recently reported. Wrapping Up: The case to buy UiPath shares UiPath shares have seen a considerable run in the wake of a particularly strong quarterly earnings report that was well above prior forecasts. Guidance also was increased, although apparently not enough for some observers. The most impressive metric for me was that of the net new ARR metric which rose more than 15% sequentially. Based on the comments by the CFO as well as indications of stronger IT spend growth, I expect that the company is quite likely to exceed its Q4 revenue growth guidance. Overall, the shares are up by more than 50% since their late October, 2023 lows, but down about 11% since their highs at the end of last year. The shares after doubling over the last 12 months, are still down over 40% over the last two years. UiPath remains the leader in robotic process automation, and RPA growth has been accelerating as part of the overall enthusiasm for all things based on generative AI solutions. Generative AI + RPA demonstrably work better together, and some of the generative AI components that UiPath is deploying allow its solutions to be deployed more rapidly, typically a bottleneck for developers. Just how fast can the RPA space grow? The 3rd party analysis linked in this article show a multi-year CAGR for the space in the mid 30% range. And 3rd party analysis also linked in the report show a highly favorable evaluation of the company’s competitive position suggesting further market share gains from an already market leading position. I haven’t chosen to go all-in when forecasting a CAGR for this company-my valuation model is based on growth in the mid-20% range. My projection is that the EV/S for PATH is just greater than 7X and I have also projected a 4 quarter forward free cash flow margin of 17%. Despite the huge run the shares have had-on a relative basis, the shares are still valued below average for the mid-20% growth cohort, an indication of the strength of most high growth IT shares at the end of 2023.  I have commented that the kind of spike that high growth IT enjoyed the last two months of the year is extraordinary. While I believe that the current valuations are not excessive given greater growth, stronger profitability and a trend toward lower interest rates, as well as the base from which the spike started, I doubt that the kind of cadence seen in the last two months of 2023 can continue. And that applies to the short term outlook for PATH shares as well. I think it would be more than a bit surprising if the shares showed significant relative strength until they next report earnings which is likely not to be until mid-March. That said, I think the opportunity for the company and the shares over the next 12 months remains considerable, despite the recent rerating. I think the potential for positive alpha remains significant.This article was written byBert Hochfeld22.45K FollowersFollowBert Hochfeld graduated with a degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania and received an MBA from Harvard.

Welcome! Register now to read your first few articles at no cost.Create a FREE account. Register Already have an account?  Sign in A lot has been said about what Generative AI tools can and cannot do. The bottom line: these tools will have a pivotal role and businesses stand to gain from implementing them. In the interim period, where do leaders stand on this emerging, transformative technology? What are the opportunities and risks? More importantly, what is the roadmap that businesses should follow?To better understand how business and technology leaders are thinking about Generative AI, in March 2023 KPMG surveyed 300 global executives and senior managers at companies of various sizes across industries. (A follow-up survey was conducted in June and highlighted notable differences where relevant.) There is a clear takeaway — making the most of Generative AI will require a delicate balance between speed, thoughtful planning and risk mitigation. The report, based on a survey of global business and technology executives and insights from KPMG advisers in artificial intelligence, technology enablement, strategy and risk management, explores the emerging trends, challenges and patterns of thinking on this transformative technology.expandUnderstand the impact from Generative AIBusiness leaders do understand how transformative Generative AI can be. It is rated as the top emerging technology and all surveyed expect their organizations to be impacted very highly in the next 12 to 18 months.What sets Generative AI apart is its ability to augment human cognition and reasoning directly, creating customer-facing and operational applications. This technology has the potential to revolutionize every task and function, from content creation and user engagement to software development and data analysis. Companies across sectors continue to explore novel use cases.""It's important for business leaders to focus on the future of work and the workforce in their organization,"" according to Todd Lohr, KPMG U.S. Technology Consulting Leader and Partner in Chicago. ""Unlike most technology that has improved or automated tasks and workflows, AI augments human knowledge, it requires a different lens to approach.""Prepare the workforce to adapt and thrive While executives expect Generative AI to have a significant impact on how employees work, they mostly see it as an additional tool for workers to use rather than a job replacement. 73 percent of the executives say they expect Generative AI to increase productivity. At the same time, they also understand the risk of certain roles being automated, especially those in administrative, customer service and creative functions. Even then, human expertise and insight will be crucial for unlocking value and fact checking Generative AI. Therefore, reskilling and training will be key.Develop an AI governance program While the potential benefits of Generative AI are immense, there are also several hurdles along the way. These challenges include security, reliability and having the ability to quantify the value gained.The consequences of failing to address these risks can be catastrophic for organizations. Without proper guardrails like engaging an AI governance program, billions of dollars may be wasted on incorrect tools, unhelpful applications, or use cases that fail. Companies risk alienating customers, damaging their brand reputation and creating legal complications by violating global regulations.Interestingly, business leaders are adapting quickly to addressing risks associated with Generative AI. Their confidence in mitigating risk rose from 30 percent in March 2023 to 77 percent in June 2023. Furthermore, in March, only 3 percent of respondents reported that they had mature responsible AI governance in place. By June, 46 percent said they had implemented it.Ensuring responsible, ethical use of AI systems is something that KPMG believes in. Our Trusted AI statement outlines our strategic approach and framework to designing, building, deploying and using AI systems in a responsible and ethical manner.Follow the roadmap for success with Generative AI From this point, organizations need a roadmap to make the most of this new technology. Here are some ways to get started.Develop a strong foundation: Establish a designated leader for cross-enterprise coordination to champion adoption of the technology and ensure responsible use of Generative AI throughout the organization. Develop clear governance structures, promote accountability and address risks associated with financial, reputational and ethical aspects.Empower talent and elevate Generative AI literacy: Focus on upskilling employees, communicating job shifts and new processes and positioning Generative AI as a tool to augment human capabilities. Ensure continued education, training and a positive culture of responsible adoption across the organization.Have a transformational vision of the future: What is your end goal with Generative AI adoption? The answer should guide everything else you do, from making business moves and acquiring essential skills to purchasing technology and developing new business models. Encourage experimentation and adoption of Generative AI across the workforce.Generative AI makes the future for organizations promising, transformative and challenging all at the same time. The key to success will be in following a roadmap that guides designing, building and deploying ethical Generative AI programs that best serve organizational needs.To learn more, download Generative AI: From buzz to business value.

Some students—like those studying in the University of South Florida’s Muma College of Business Center for Marketing and Sales Innovation Customer Experience and Behavioral AI Lab—are already being exposed to how artificial intelligence can help them in the workforce. The lab uses various technologies to measure brain waves, eye movements and otherwise understand how humans respond to a variety of stimuli. Students then get opportunities to apply these insights across settings, sometimes in partnership with commercial businesses or government agencies.
“Students are learning and applying state-of-the-art skills and participating in research,” says Rob Hammond, center director, “that will make them more employable at graduation.” 
But even beyond such specialized training, nearly three in four students say their institutions should be preparing them for AI in the workplace, at least somewhat. So finds a new flash survey of 1,250 students across 49 four- and two-year colleges from Inside Higher Ed and College Pulse’s Student Voice series.

Here are the survey’s main takeaways.
AI is impacting what students plan to study, especially newer students. 
Asked how much the rise of artificial intelligence has influenced what they’re studying or plan to study in college, 14 percent of students over all say it’s influenced them a lot. An additional 34 percent say it’s influenced them somewhat. 
By year, the Class of 2024 is least influenced in this way, with just 35 percent of students saying AI has affected what they’re studying or plan to study, either a lot or somewhat. The Classes of 2025 and 2026 are incrementally more influenced, while the majority of the Class of 2027 (64 percent) says AI has at least somewhat impacted their academic plans. This difference may make sense in light of the buzz around generative AI within the last year. Two- and four-year college students in the survey report being equally influenced by AI in this area. 











But student major, gender and financial aid status all appear to factor in. By field, just 7 percent of arts and humanities students say AI has influenced what they plan to study, compared to 15 percent of natural sciences students, 17 percent of social sciences students and 22 percent of students identifying as having interdisciplinary majors. By gender, 20 percent of male students say AI has significantly impacted their academic plans, versus 10 percent of women and 4 percent of nonbinary students (there are insufficient responses to show for certain other demographics). And by financial aid status, 60 percent of students with no financial aid say AI is influencing their study plans, either a lot or somewhat, compared to 45 percent of students receiving financial aid. 
Another key difference: 52 percent of continuing-generation students say AI is influencing what they plan to study, either a lot or somewhat, compared to 41 percent of first-generation students. 












AI is impacting students’ career plans. 
Similar to how students say AI is impacting their academic plans, 11 percent of students over all say that the rise of AI has significantly influenced their career plans. An additional 31 percent say it’s influenced their career plans somewhat. 
By year, the Class of 2027 appears most impacted, with 61 percent saying the rise of AI has affected their career plans, either a lot or somewhat (just 31 percent of the Class of 2024 say this, as do 41 percent of the Class of 2025 and 51 percent of the Class of 2026). 
Gender appears to matter, as well, with 52 percent of men in the study saying AI is impacting their career plans, versus 35 percent of women and 35 percent of nonbinary students. 
Yet again, there’s no significant difference between four-year and two-year students’ responses, while relatively more students without financial aid (51 percent) than with (41 percent) say they’re influenced by AI in this respect, either a lot or somewhat. Relatively more continuing-generation students (46 percent) than first-generation students (34 percent) also say AI is at least somewhat impacting their career plans. 

Most students say their institutions should be readying them for AI in the workplace. 
Nearly three in four students say that their colleges or universities should be preparing them for AI in the workplace, either a lot (27 percent) or somewhat (45 percent). Newer students are again more likely than soon-to-graduate students to expect AI preparation, with 81 percent of the Class of 2027 saying their institutions should be preparing them at least somewhat. Yet even 66 percent of the Class of 2024 say this. By major, students in the arts and humanities are a bit less likely to say so (66 percent) than students in the social sciences (78 percent). In the natural sciences, the share is 70 percent, and among interdisciplinary majors, it’s 71 percent. 
By gender, 77 percent of men say their institutions should be readying them for AI and work at least somewhat, as do 69 percent of both women and nonbinary respondents. 
Some 76 percent of continuing-generation students expect their institutions to ready them for AI and work at least somewhat, compared to 66 percent of first-gen peers. 

Students are seeking both ethical and practical AI training. 
As for just how institutions should be preparing them for AI and work, the No. 1 priority, to students, is being taught the ethics of using AI, with nearly three in four students choosing this. The No. 2 choice (62 percent) from a list of five options is prioritizing teaching core skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving. This is presumably to build skills that make students’ would-be jobs more resistant to AI. A close third choice is teaching the ins and outs of using AI, meaning students are also eager for practical training (60 percent). 
Just 28 percent of students say their institutions should prepare them for AI and work by encouraging career paths that are less likely to be impacted by AI. These results are relatively consistent across student subgroups and institution types, including gender, major and first- or continuing-generation status. 

M’hammed Abdous, assistant vice president for teaching and learning with technology and associate director of the Center for Faculty Development at Old Dominion University in Virginia, says the responses are “a strong indication of the transformative potential that AI is registering with students.” Respondents over all seem “rightly aware of how AI is reshaping the job market in so many different areas.” Abdous cites reports suggesting that up to 40 percent of current jobs are potentially replaceable by AI, adding that even jobs that won’t be displaced will still be subject to change due generative AI’s power to reshape work. 
At the same time, “AI will also stimulate demand for new skills that require human ingenuity, creativity, empathy and ethics—things that AI cannot do,” he adds. Regarding the related Student Voice findings on what training students want, Abdous says that students are again “right on target.” 
Abdous suggests colleges and universities consider doing the following: 
Conduct a thorough analysis of current curriculum and degree offerings to ensure their continued relevancy. Identify careers that are and will be disrupted by AI and update the relevant curricula accordingly. Include AI in every program to guarantee that students are exposed. Offer multidisciplinary programs that address different aspects of AI, including in computer science, data science, ethics and English. Build lifelong learning pathways for students to continue building their knowledge after graduation. 
Suzanne Helbig, associate vice provost of the Division of Career Pathways at the University of California, Irvine, says that institutions can adopt “intentional practices to cultivate a continuous-learning mindset and critical thinking skills that will future-proof their students.” This means providing more ways for students to connect what they’re learning in the classroom to the world of work and equipping faculty and staff members to help students “identify and articulate their transferable skills for future roles.” 
Institutions should harness workforce data and industry connections to inform curriculum and program development, she adds, plus “resource and elevate campus career services to address the top reason students seek higher education: to advance their careers. The proliferation of AI and its effects on the future of work makes career services an even greater institutional imperative.”

The sweeping proposal that US Citizenship and Immigration Services released last fall was crafted with the intent of modernizing the specialty occupation visa heavily used by the tech industry and offering new flexibility to workers. But if the final version of the rule tracks the proposal, new eligibility criteria and definitions will actually make it harder to hire the talent needed for roles in emerging tech fields like AI, according to many of the over 1,300 public comments submitted on the proposal.Among the most notable proposed changes, the regulations would overhaul the annual H-1B lottery system, which USCIS uses to select petitions to process because demand far exceeds the supply of 85,000 visas each fiscal year. The agency has proposed basing lottery selection on individual workers, rather than the current practice of selecting based on employer submissions—which allows for multiple registrations to be filed on behalf of the same worker. Businesses say that shift, proposed to weed out companies gaming the lottery, would level the playing field for securing the visas. At the same time, the proposed rule would modify the definition of what qualifies as a “specialty occupation,” adding the requirement of a direct relationship between a degree held by a potential H-1B employee and the position the employer aims to fill. A role also wouldn’t qualify as a specialty occupation under the proposal if it requires only a general degree such as engineering without further specialization.That added restriction would stymie hiring in interdisciplinary fields like AI or business intelligence and adopt an approach already rejected in court rulings, pro-immigration groups including the American Immigration Lawyers Association said in comments on the proposed rule.The reality is employers are seeking to build teams of workers with a range of knowledge and backgrounds, said Divyansh Kaushik, associate director for emerging technologies and national security at the Federation of American Scientists.“USCIS is essentially going against what the market considers best practice,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Law. “It appears the language is trying to solve government’s needs, not the user’s needs.”The requirements of most technology jobs can change significantly after a person moves from higher education into the workforce, said Jennifer Young, CEO of the Technology Councils of North America. “It’s not really keeping up with the times,” she said of the proposal. “Flexibility is required because these jobs are changing so rapidly.”Targeted in AI OrderThe proposed H-1B changes were released the same month that President Joe Biden issued an executive order that made adding foreign talent with essential expertise a central piece of his administration’s policy vision on artificial intelligence.The order directed the State and Homeland Security departments to consider policies that would lower visa barriers for researchers and students working in AI or other critical new fields. The order specifically targeted J-1 research scholar visas; F-1 visas for students in science, technology, engineering, and math fields; and H-1B visas for regulatory changes. While industry advocates welcomed the immigration provisions of the executive order, they said it also underlined the need for Congress to make streamlined access to visas and to increase the numbers of visas available for foreign talent.The H-1B program in particular is the main pathway for employers to bring in international workers with at least a bachelor’s degree in fields like technology and engineering, but the 85,000 visas issued annually don’t even come close to what employers are seeking. Entries for the annual H-1B lottery have skyrocketed since the government adopted an online registration system, surpassing 750,000 registrations for this fiscal year alone.Those numbers reflect growing demand for the visas. But USCIS also says they demonstrate attempts by at least some users to cheat the system by submitting multiple entries on behalf of the same worker to increase the odds of selection. Those particular concerns drove much of the draft regulations even as the agency sought to lower barriers for other program users. USCIS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the feedback. Unnecessary HurdlesTightening specialty occupation standards by requiring a degree be “directly related” to a position adds unnecessary hurdles for employers and contravenes the Biden executive order, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said in public commentson the rule.A Silicon Valley lawmaker, Lofgren has been one of the biggest advocates in Congress for updating the employment-based immigration system. USCIS said in its proposal that the suggested new regulatory language would codify existing practices and shouldn’t be read as requiring a singular field of study. For example, a degree in electrical engineering or electronics engineering may qualify for an electrical engineer position, the agency said. The draft regulations don’t mention artificial intelligence directly. For any job to qualify as a specialty occupation, the proposal states that “a position may allow a range of degrees or apply multiple bodies of highly specialized knowledge, provided that each of those qualifying degree fields or each body of highly specialized knowledge is directly related to the position. That fails to account for the way industry hires talent with a range of scholarly specialties in developing fields, Lofgren wrote. “Across industries, employers have trended towards hiring teams with degrees and skills that complement each other from across various academic backgrounds. This is true for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) workforce, as well,” she wrote. “As AI makes its way into various industries not historically associated with the use of AI, such as agriculture and healthcare, employers will need to hire professionals with knowledge specific to the industry itself, not just those who will have the academic background traditionally associated with AI fields.”The new eligibility standards would increase scrutiny of H-1B petitions and thus denials, and would “open the door to even narrower interpretations of H1B eligibility under future administrations,” Scott Corley, executive director of the Compete America Coalition, wrote in the organization’s comments. The coalition is made up of employers that advocate for reform of the high-skilled immigration system.Although the draft was a thoughtful update to H-1B regulations overall, the proposed definition of specialty occupation “really does risk putting the wheel in the ditch,” said Bo Cooper, a partner at Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy LLP.The proposal would put agency officials’ focus on broad labels of positions and degrees when adjudicating petitions, he said in an interview with Bloomberg Law. That change would potentially lead to petition denials for workers who are actually qualified under the statute, he said.“The basic equation should be is there a connection between the course of study and the job duties required for the position,” Cooper said. “If you focus too much on labels, then that doesn’t align with the realities of university-level education. Normally, emerging fields come first and then degrees to support those specialties follow.” Continue Reading To contact the reporter on this story: Andrew Kreighbaum in Washington at akreighbaum@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Laura D.

Duolingo lays off contractors
00:32

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Pittsburgh-based Duolingo has laid off some of its contractor workforce, in part because of artificial intelligence. The East Liberty-based company said it has ""off-boarded"" 10 percent of its contractor workforce. In some cases, the contractor work was concluded, Duolingo said, adding that in other cases the work is being aided by A.I. ""There is some merit to the idea that AI is contributing to the reduction of our contract workforce, but it would be an oversimplification to say this is the sole reason,"" Sam Dalsimer, Duolingo's global head of communications, said on Monday to our news partner at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""We use AI for a variety of different functions and tasks.""Duolingo produces courses in 40 different languages and said artificial intelligence is generating some narratives and translations. Over the summer, Duolingo was recognized as one of Time's 100 most influential companies across the globe for 2023. Time highlighted the company's use of artificial intelligence as a reason for making the top 100.

While COVID fast-tracked flexible working models, in 2023 many organisations began ushering employees back to the office.In a KPMG survey of more than 1300 chief executives released in October, most predicted a complete eradication of working from home over the next three years.Younger workers, who require more support than previous generations after COVID, benefit from a return to the office.Credit: Peter RaeStill, many employers are grappling with keeping employees happy.“We’re seeing a divide between managers and staff in terms of how much time they want to be spending in the office versus working from home,” says Dengate.Editor's pickGot a Minute?My boss asked for honest feedback, then froze me out of the team“An idea that’s gaining momentum is that a workplace is not somewhere to sit down and quietly do your work. Going into work is about connecting with your colleagues and having a bonding experience, more so than just working.”Younger workers, who require more support than previous generations after COVID, also benefit from a return to the office.“That generation really do need mentors, they need to be getting feedback and to feel that others in the workplace value them and that they have the opportunity to learn,” says Johnson.The fall of corporate jargon“Circling back”, “taking things offline”, “sorry if that was unclear” – corporate jargon has been slowly falling out of favour for the past few years – and younger generations are leading the charge.A global report from LinkedIn from June found that “60 per cent of Gen Z and 65 per cent of Millennials want to reduce or eliminate the use of workplace jargon”, while a quick scroll on TikTok reveals many young office workers mocking the veiled language.  “Sometimes corporate buzzwords can help a team feel like they’re all speaking the same language,” says Dengate. “But the flip side is that it can isolate people who aren’t in on the lingo.“Remote workers are more likely to dislike corporate buzzwords because it makes them feel left out. They don’t know what the latest acronym is, and it stands in the way of understanding.”WellbeingFrom managers supporting staff through a divorce to lunchtime meditation, the personal and professional have become increasingly intertwined. Worker wellbeing is a growing concern for organisations with increases in psychosocial risk claims and work absences due to stress and exhaustion.The pandemic was a trigger for many workers. “People did some soul-searching and asked themselves, do I care about where I work? Is this feeding my soul?” says Dengate.In response, she says organisations took a “stronger stance on social issues, such as the environment, to create a workplace where people’s personal mission is aligned with their workplace”.While breath work and nutrition seminars are positive steps, wellbeing solutions in the workplace should go beyond the individual to be meaningful. “We need to be looking more closely at what people are doing at work and whether it’s good for them,” says Johnson. “How is the work you’re doing designed? What extent are you receiving feedback? Do people just have too much to do in the time that they have available?”Paid job interviewsRecognition is growing for just how much work goes into looking for a job. From multiple rounds of interviews to business proposals, the application process can be incredibly time and labour-intensive – and some are calling for applicants to be compensated for their time.The idea is gaining traction abroad. Canadian food justice organisation FoodShare offers prospective candidates $75CAD per interview ($83), while Zero Waste Club in the UK compensates workers with $275 for attending a two to three hour workshop. It’s a concept Dengate believes will catch on in Australia in 2024.Editor's pickWorkplace cultureWhy offering senior jobs part-time is a ‘no-brainer’“Part of the reason why is to level the playing field. It’s not one person asking to impress the other. It’s an acknowledgement that this person is important, and their time is valuable.”Dengate says compensating workers for work during the interview process can also be beneficial for organisations.“Paying somebody to attend a job interview forces companies to be more direct about who they want and why, without wasting time on additional job interviews and additional applicants,” she says.Make the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our Live Well newsletter.

We’ve often heard it said that generative AI will affect many of the jobs people do today. But they won’t all be affected equally.

We are increasingly seeing that certain occupations will be changed more than others.


Recent research carried out by Indeed’s economic research team, Hiring Lab, found that some of the most commonly-posted jobs – including nurses, care workers and chefs – are among the 35 percent of roles that will be least affected.

However, if your job is something that can be done remotely or involves software development, there’s a much higher chance you’ll use AI to augment your work. Or, in a worst-case scenario, make you redundant.

PROMOTED
So, what does this mean for the future of work? On the one hand, those in the 20 percent of jobs that are highly likely to be transformed by generative AI are in a position of privilege. The ability to adopt generative AI into their workflow will make them more efficient, productive and valuable.
On the other, as many of these roles – which include doctors, lawyers, and software engineers – command salaries at the higher end of the scale, this could be seen as leading toward growing inequality in society.

A job description is generally presented as a selection of necessary skills. This was used as a jumping-in point to start analyzing the potential impact of generative AI across workforce roles.

The aim was to answer a question that’s been on everyone’s mind but certainly isn’t unique to this latest wave of technological disruption.
Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, tells me, ""Frankly, it's a very old question of whether technology will help or hurt jobs. That question goes back a couple of hundred years to when the Luddites first smashed looms in the UK because they thought those jobs were going away.”
It’s easier to assess the impact of generative AI on individual skills than on entire jobs. For certain skills, including driving vehicles, construction skills and veterinary skills, It’s fairly useless. For others, like accounting skills, legal tasks and software development, it’s great.
When broken down like this, however, it seems likely that just about every job will be affected in some way, as nearly all involve skills to some extent that can be enhanced with generative AI.
Educators, researchers, project managers, healthcare professionals, content creators and clerical workers all use these skills, too.
“We think that AI is going to transform almost every job, how they’re done, not necessarily eliminate those jobs, but they will transform,” Hyams says.

New Jobs
As well as changing existing jobs, new jobs are likely to emerge to enable businesses and governments to benefit from the emergence of generative AI – hopefully in a safe and ethical way!
AI scholar and Google Brain co-founder Andrew NG was among the first to offer a balanced evaluation of how this will happen.
He believes that transforming the way we do existing jobs will lead to the creation of many new jobs as well. And we’re already starting to see this happen, with openings appearing for positions like AI prompt engineer or AI auditors.
But it’s widely acknowledged – by Ng and others – that it could also lead to job losses. Again, this will largely affect roles where many of the skills can be augmented or automated. However, it seems likely that a disproportionate impact could be on jobs paying lower salaries. This might include customer service advisors, translators, assistants and back-office clerical staff.

The Evolution Of Skills
Rather than needing to develop new skills (or change profession entirely), I think this shows that skills are evolving.
Remember, when the pocket calculator was invented in the 20th century, many thought that it would lead to a decline in our ability to do basic mathematics. What actually happened was that lots of people – school children in particular – became capable of solving more complicated math problems more quickly.
But as well as enhancing our technical skills, delegating routine elements of work – scheduling, drafting reports – to machines means we have more time to focus on the human aspect of our work.
For lawyers and doctors, this means spending more face time with patients and less time reading charts and reports. Teachers will spend less time grading papers and more time one-on-one with pupils. Real estate agents will use generative AI to create property listings or sales reports while they focus on understanding buyers' unique needs.
It’s also important to point out that employers have a responsibility to help out with this evolution. It's in the interest of their employees, who will benefit from the personal development. But it's also in the interest of their businesses that will grow thanks to the advances in efficiency and innovation driven by the adoption of generative AI.

The Ethical Impact 
As with any discussion on the impact of AI, there are ethical considerations that can’t be ignored.
The changing nature of work, the income disparity between roles that can be augmented and those that can’t, and the intrinsic need for human-centric services in many professions all need to be addressed.
Cooks, cleaners, and laborers will have fewer chances to use generative AI to increase their value, while for financial analysts, lawyers, and software engineers, the opportunities are significant.
This has the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities, and this can only be addressed by continued focus on improving opportunities. This means ensuring that the chance to move into positions that can benefit are available regardless of economic, social, class, racial or gender grouping that has traditionally created barriers.
It’s also vital to make sure that aspects of human behavior that are critical to day-to-day well-being are not augmented out of society. A doctor’s ability to alleviate anxiety with their bedside manner is an important part of the healing process, for example. This could be lost if elements of the work that seem routine – like communicating non-urgent updates on how a patient is recovering – are delegated to AI.
What is becoming clear is that the impact of generative AI on jobs is only going to grow, and over the coming year or two, we’ll start to get a better picture of how this will impact our lives and society as we face up to these important challenges.
Right now, from an individual perspective, the most important thing to do is develop an understanding of how our own roles – or the roles we hope we will have in the future – can benefit from this hugely transformative opportunity.

by Francis BignellJanuary 5, 2024January 18, 2024LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy LinkShareParticularly since the release of OpenAI‘s ChatGPT at the back-end of 2022, the world has sat up and taken notice of the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to disrupt all industries in countless ways. To kick off 2024, The Fintech Times is exploring how the world of AI may continue to impact the fintech industry and beyond throughout the coming year.In 2023, Salesforce published research revealing some of the biggest generative AI trends of the year. It found that 75 per cent of generative AI users are looking to automate tasks at work and use generative AI for work communications. Furthermore, 38 per cent of generative AI users use the tech for fun/messing around. Meanwhile, 34 per cent use it for learning about topics that interest them.Seventy-three per cent of the Indian population 49 per cent of the Australian population, 45 per cent of the US population and 29 per cent of the UK population surveyed were all using generative AI last year. With adoption trends suggesting that these numbers will only increase throughout 2024, it begs the question, how will the technology evolve over the year?AI-driven by key playersDavid Sewell, CTO, SynechronFor emerging technologies to succeed, they must be adopted by figureheads of an industry, and the financial sector is no different.David Sewell, CTO, Synechron, the financial services digital transformation consulting firm explains: “Advanced AI will continue to offer businesses new ways to innovate and grow. ’Graph databases’, which store complex data structures (most commonly used for social networks), and which are very powerful when combined with generative AI (GenAI), will come to the fore.“Likewise, ‘vector databases’ which store, manage and index massive quantities of high-dimensional vector data efficiently, are garnering significant interest for their potential to create additional value for GenAI use cases and applications.“According to Gartner, by 2026, more than 30 per cent of enterprises will have adopted vector databases to ground their foundation models with relevant business data.“Breakthroughs in GenAI and transfer learning from top universities and big tech are driving the next wave of innovation around AI. Key players like Google are building significant capabilities while still considering risks and monetisation.“The biggest benefits for businesses will likely come from mass adoption of simple tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft copilot-like assistants that work alongside popular Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams, to provide real-time intelligent assistance, enabling users to enhance their creativity, productivity and skills.“But, as the use of AI proliferates, so too do fears about data safety, privacy and bias. For businesses seeking to allay these fears and develop safe, accountable AI solutions, effective governance is essential.”Developing new techniques Malcom deMayo, VP of financial services at NVIDIAMalcom deMayo, VP of financial services at NVIDIA, the multinational software company, explores the next big technique which will see AI further develop.“Financial services firms are ramping up investment in AI, promoting its status within their organisations from AI associate to chief AI officer.“In order to fine-tune a model to generate the insights that will best answer customer inquiries, minimise investment risk, or process documents for loan applications, underwriting, regulatory compliance and more, firms will need to train them on their proprietary, industry-specific data. That’s why firms will leverage new AI training techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to shift from off-the-shelf generative AI solutions to custom models that more accurately serve internal and external stakeholders.Tip of the icebergDave Colwell, VP of AI and ML at TricentisDave Colwell, VP of AI and ML at Tricentis, automation software company, discusses how AI won’t just be a technology which requires a singular expert in a company. Rather, it will need an entire team – so much so, independent organisations will be called in to test the technology.“We’re at the tip of the iceberg for the potential of generative AI.Alongside increased adoption, we can expect significant regulatory progress. Steps have already been made following the 2023 AI Safety Summit, with a “landmark” cross-governmental agreement to test future AI models of some of the world’s biggest tech firms prior to release.AI presents an almost unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of everyday people, but also a potential disruption to many parts of society, including education, workforces, and our interpersonal interactions.“This will likely mean independent organisations responsible for testing the safety of new AI models to confirm validity and accuracy, as well as a greater governmental role in defining how AI should be used to benefit, not harm, the people it governs. We can also expect major updates to compliance frameworks with responsible and acceptable AI use policies becoming commonplace.”An added benefit, not a human replacementDr Henry Balani, global head of industry and regulatory affairs for Encompass CorporationThere have been many fears surrounding AI and the potential threats it could have on human jobs. Dr Henry Balani, global head of industry and regulatory affairs for Encompass Corporation, the KYC process automation firm, explains that this will not be the case in 2024.“Generative AI represents an evolving concept that offers potentially exciting benefits to financial institutions.“However, the overriding message is that generative AI will not replace KYC analysts now, or in the foreseeable future. It will instead accelerate existing processes and augment the work of analysts, empowering them to detect financial crime risk faster and more comprehensively.“Maximum value will only be derived from generative AI if banks have already established robust digital and automated processes to optimise the quality of data collated and deliver deeper customer insights. By focusing on laying this groundwork now, banks will be well positioned to take full advantage of this new technology as it continues to evolve and mature.”Complying with fintech regulationsNima Montazeri, CPO of LiberisNima Montazeri, CPO of Liberis, an embedded finance platform, dives into how AI will navigate the minefield which is fintech regulations over the coming year: “Gen AI is poised to revolutionise the fintech industry through its widespread adoption, bringing about significant transformations across various sectors.“One area that will experience a remarkable impact is customer service, where the integration of generative AI algorithms will serve to enhance the capabilities of human agents.“By augmenting their abilities, gen AI will boost productivity levels and expedite the learning process. In fact, studies highlighted that with the assistance of gen AI, newly recruited call centre employees were able to acquire the equivalent of six months’ worth of experience in just two months on the job, showcasing the immense potential for accelerated skill development.“Furthermore, compliance within the fintech sector will witness a new era of oversight facilitated by gen AI algorithms. Continuous audits of customer interactions, encompassing phone calls, emails, and other forms of communication, will be seamlessly conducted to ensure strict adherence to regulatory frameworks and industry standards. The utilisation of gen AI in this context will enable real-time.”AI will spread its wings in 2024Steve Morgan, global banking principal at PegasystemsSteve Morgan, global banking principal at Pegasystems, the low-code platform to adopt change, does not agree that AI will seen its ‘winter’ this year, rather it will be given room to grow providing it is done so in a safe way.“Even though some are predicting an ‘AI winter’, or a slowdown in interest of generative AI, 2024 will actually be the year generative AI will be let out of its cage to spread its wings and show its true potential. Generative AI-driven agents can be relied on to do the heavy lifting, by creating and executing plans from start to finish.“Even with generative AI evolving, a human will still need to be in the loop and be in control of the AI to ensure that it is working ethically and set clearly defined parameters for what the tool can and cannot do. Generative AI will be freer and be able to evolve, but there will still be controls on it to ensure that it is working in a safe way.”More realistic and accurate outputsDanny Butvinik, chief data scientist at NICE ActimizeDanny Butvinik, chief data scientist at NICE Actimize, the financial crime and compliance solution company, believes ethical guidelines will be an absolute necessity for generative AI to succeed in 2024.“Generative AI models are expected to produce even more realistic and accurate outputs, whether in text, image, or other forms. This includes better context understanding and fewer errors. We expect advancements in allowing users more control and customisation options when generating content, leading to more tailored outputs. As generative AI becomes more powerful, it will be crucial to develop ethical guidelines and legal frameworks to govern its use.”Author Francis BignellFrancis is a journalist and our lead LatAm correspondent, with a BA in Classical Civilization, he has a specialist interest in North and South America.

Yet this time, workers are ready.Now that generative AI has been on employees' radars for more than a year, they're not only better positioned to understand its place in the contemporary work landscape, but also equipped to embrace the changes and possibility that comes with it.It's time to put that advantage to use. To get ahead, workers should know what's coming in the AI space, including these five trends that are poised to impact the year.1. AI will encourage widespread inclusivityArtificial intelligence is likely to become a powerful tool for workers with disabilities – and those advances could drive change for all people.   First, many machine-learning tools developed to benefit disabled workers could become increasingly available, believes Victor Santiago Pineda, director of the Inclusive Cities Lab at UC Berkeley, US. Think, for instance, algorithm-based speech-to-text and text-to-speech tools that provide additional information to visually- and hearing-impaired users, respectively. ""AI-powered assistive technologies have the potential to break down barriers and empower individuals with disabilities, fostering a sense of independence and inclusion,"" he says.He believes the mainstream adoption of tools meant to assist disabled people can also benefit everyone. For example, as large language models continue to refine real-time, multilingual closed captioning, all people will have access to a wider and more diverse range of information.2. AI will make hiring – and layoff – processes more equitableHuman-resource professionals are already prepared to use artificial intelligence in the hiring process to create a more equitable hiring landscape, but the current technology is far from perfect. In response, academics and industry experts are working to reduce algorithmic bias on electronic hiring platforms and other HR tools through AI. Some experts are already prioritising these goals. The Hire Aspirations Institute, led by Cynthia Dwork, professor of computer science at the Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, is focused on identifying bias in screening tools and the professionals who use them.AlamyTools to help workers with disabilities may proliferate, and these advances stand to help all workers (Credit: Alamy)Beyond the hiring process, some companies, including the global consultancy firm Deloitte, are using artificial intelligence technology to retain talent. The firm is currently experimenting with using AI data to more effectively reallocate budgets, move workers to more in-demand positions and, in turn, stave off layoffs. This could particularly help marginalised groups, who are often the targets of corporate cuts.However, many experts and HR professionals agree that although AI development will be helpful in creating a more diverse candidate funnel, it may not be able to solve all issues, including human bias in hiring. However, a heightened awareness of hiring inequity may help HR professionals understand their own implicit judgements and how to move past them.3. Workplaces will use AI to centre diversity in hiring and training Beyond levelling the playing field for applications, evolving AI tools may also help to ensure traditionally marginalised people are not starting a new job on the back foot.To begin, the development of AI may push regulators to increasingly focus on funding worker inclusion practices in the public and private sectors. In its recent Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP), the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission prioritised overcoming workplace discrimination in an increasingly AI assisted world. In the EU, the newly passed AI act requires that HR data and processes at firms must meet established standards for workers' rights, or face corporate fines.Investment in inclusive technology such as language-learning models designed by diverse teams, for instance, stands to help employers create personalised educational programs tailored to a wide set of employee experiences. This has the potential to help workers from all backgrounds get the same start.Importantly, these kinds of changes stand to impact how hiring platforms are designed. Addressing bias in the development of algorithms can head off exclusionary practices from the start of the hiring process, instead of working to make up for mistakes and blind spots after they show themselves. Experts say this could make a real difference, as they point to the importance of creating inclusive teams at the development stage of AI technology to help all workers have an equal chance to advance.4. Employees want to work with AI, and employers will invest in upskillingWhile some experts say concerns about AI replacing some roles are valid, they also have simultaneously predicted that it won't eliminate all human jobs. Instead, workers will evolve to co-exist with this emerging technology, and the employees who are willing to learn and adapt to AI will see the greatest benefits.AlamyGetting diverse groups into the development of AI from the outset can head off exclusionary practices (Credit: Alamy)For many, this will require re-training in specific areas and employer-sponsored learning opportunities. A 2023 survey conducted by Jobs for the Future's Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work (JFF) showed the majority of respondents believe they will need new skills to compete in an AI-driven workforce. Younger workers are particularly feeling the pressure: 66% of Gen Z and millennial respondents said they felt the need to hone and update their skillsets to maintain a competitive edge.Companies may increasingly rise to the occasion, offering better resources for upskilling, through programmes such as in-office workshops, partnerships with academic institutions, mentoring schemes and trials that expose workers to multiple parts of the business. Experts at the JFF report that companies that invest stand to drive employee success and also have a business edge in the wider competitive landscape. 5. AI regulation will continue to struggle to keep pace with the technology AI will come with benefits, but implementation of these advancements won't necessarily be smooth sailing.As AI has come into mainstream usage, some technology leaders are calling for a push to define its boundaries. Regulators are tasked with expanding the technology, while also protecting the rights – and occupations – of a diverse human workforce. In the meantime, as AI becomes commonplace in many industries, experts say that a successful framework for regulation will require global collaboration from corporations, governments and academic researchers.As the rapid advances in AI technology threaten to outpace efforts to create a flexible and comprehensive framework for its use, workers may be left concerned about job protections, privacy in the workplace and industry shifts. These concerns have real-life consequences – according to the American Psychological Association's 2023 Workplace in America survey, respondents who were worried about AI affecting their jobs reported greater amounts of stress, anxiety and professional burnout, than those who embraced the technology.   The biggest takeaway: AI in the workplace is here to stay. Across nearly all facets of the workplace, employees will see a rapid evolution in how the tech affects their professional lives in the year to come, and businesses will have to adapt as swiftly as their workers.Work cultureFuture of businessFeaturesHow we workArtificial intelligence",https://schema.org,NewsArticle,,['https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0h34w56.jpg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Leah Carroll', 'url': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'BBC'}",AI in 2024: Five trends workers need to know,2024-01-05T12:00:00.000Z,2024-01-05T12:52:50.279Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While AI brings tremendous potential benefits — from diagnosing illness to predicting earthquakes — the possible disruption from the AI revolution could also be significant. As the rate of AI adoption increases, humans are essential to guiding the technology’s implementation and usage of these technologies.Before we can fully embrace this revolution, we have an obligation to reskill our talent to use these technologies effectively, equipping them to succeed in today’s environment. Executives estimate that up to 40% of their workforce may need to reskill as a result of implementing AI or automation over the next three years. This is largely because humans need diverse skills — from technical proficiency to human understanding and adaptability in their thinking — to work most effectively alongside AI. While this percentage seems daunting, the demands on today’s workforce present a unique and exciting opportunity to empower a new group of people to enter desired, skills-oriented jobs in the digital economy. We need to rethink our approach to reskilling to achieve this goal while ensuring the skills of our workforce match the pace of technological advancement.Have you read?AI is helping to identify skills gaps and future jobs. An expert explains howHow to leverage your skills in the post-knowledge AI economyDavos 2024: Who's coming and what to expectInvest in human capital First, we must stop fixating on whether AI will impact our lives and start managing the elements within our control. While the ubiquity of AI has caused fear of these technologies overtaking human ability, this is not yet the case — and may never be. Human capital is a much more important asset than ever before. As Dr. Chris Mason, director of the WorldQuant Initiative for Quantitative Prediction, and I discuss in our book, The Age of Prediction, humans and machines will continue to have a symbiotic relationship. Prediction is an innovative tool for advancement but requires human collaboration to enhance its outcomes. As we move into the future of technology, we should increasingly focus on the value of what we are doing: bringing opportunity to talent and using technology to strengthen our workforces.Integrate reskilling as a change management initiativeResearch shows that few companies to date have taken the call to action for reskilling seriously. Companies have become so preoccupied with filling immediate vacancies that they focus less on internally developing talent for future roles.While CEOs say hiring is the most important thing they do, many companies are entirely disengaged from the process and feel it is their biggest challenge. With constantly evolving demands on jobs and skills, we cannot solely rely on hiring. The only way to fully prepare our organizations for the future is through upskilling and reskilling. Leaders need to start viewing reskilling as an organizational change management initiative — preparing workforces for lasting change and offering them the skills required to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market. This transformation goes beyond just training employees. It underscores the importance of creating an organizational context — across leadership, managers and employees alike — in which reskilling will be embraced to maximize success. Doing so might create new opportunities for better-paying and more skilled roles.Leverage new technology to support education We are entering a new era for education, made possible by the commoditization of AI. The growth of information and data available to us means there is an ever-increasing opportunity to learn more and to facilitate learning opportunities. Online learning platforms are expected to grow 19% over the next four years. We need to lean into this trend. With AI breaking down barriers to quality education, simplifying interfaces and providing varied learning pathways, organizations should embrace the accessibility of reskilling programs. Let’s use the widening availability of education platforms to our advantage by building from within, partnering with an academic institution or establishing public-private partnerships. Embedding these kinds of reskilling programs will help ensure a seamless transition toward a more agile, tech-savvy and future-ready workforce.Online learning platforms can help organizations worldwide close the AI skills gap. Image: Statista Market InsightsClosing the AI skills gapOrganizations that recognize the value of human capital while embracing advanced technologies will be most prepared for the future of work. Empowering employees with opportunities to reskill will help them better leverage AI tools, helping to drive business value, improve efficiency and shape the future of success. Implementing a cultural shift around reskilling will help organizations accelerate this change. Only then will we be able to more fully understand and harness the potential of AI.

Like it or not, artificial intelligence is coming for your job. Seemingly overnight, the software has crept into the workplace, and once highly-paid workers are already seeing salaries slip and vacancies dry up.But the dawn of AI has also birthed hitherto unthought-of job titles. On LinkedIn, “head of AI” job roles have tripled globally in the last five years, while job posts mentioning AI have more than doubled in Britain in the last two. Nearly a third of British business leaders expect the software will lead to new roles, and roughly half of British workers believe AI will impact their jobs in some way in the next five years, according to a study by PwC. Earlier this year, BT announced it would cut 55,000 jobs, and replace a fifth of its workers with AI.Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs globally in the coming years.In the near future, customer service phone lines could be answered by a robot, while graphic designers, computer programmers, writers and teachers may well find their roles consumed, at least in part, by software. Some companies have married AI with hologram technology, replacing in-person customer service with digital avatars.At a summit last year, Elon Musk told Rishi Sunak that artificial intelligence could one day eradicate the need for jobs altogether. The owner of X, formally Twitter, told The Prime Minister AI would be “the most disruptive force in the industry for jobs”, claiming that “there will come a point where no job is needed – you can have a job if you want to for personal satisfaction”.Mr Sunak likewise urged industry figureheads and politicians “not to be alarmist” about the rapid rise of AI, while denying the technology would be a threat to jobs. “I know this is an anxiety people have,” he said. “We should look at AI more as a co-pilot than something that is necessarily going to replace someone’s job.”Nonetheless, trade unions are worried. Andrew Pakes, Deputy General Secretary of Prospect, which has over 150,000 members, said the Government’s attempts to regulate AI were being outpaced by the technology’s rapid development. “AI brings with it opportunities for better work but it also threatens jobs and has the potential to exacerbate prejudices in recruitment and disciplinary processes,” he said.Which careers are safest from AI?Though some previously lucrative careers are already feeling the rapid encroachment of smart software, some careers may be safe.Using studies published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the University of Pennsylvania, and research by Goldmann Sachs, data analysts at job search engine Adzuna identified several job roles where pay had been resilient to the advent of AI – and ranked them by how high their advertised salaries were in December 2023.Specialist medical professionals ranked among the highest-paid roles best insulated from the march of technology, according to advertised salaries on Adzuna.The average salary for orthodontists was £113,576 a year in December, compared to £102,842 last year – an increase of 10.4pc.Oncologists, pediatricians, surgeons, and midwives also ranked highly, with advertised salaries ranging from £55,000 to £100,000.








However, the average pay for some roles has dipped year-on-year. Pay across listed vacancies for oncologists had dropped by 8.4pc, from £219,755 to £201,243, Adzuna said. Meanwhile, pay for midwives dipped by 10.8pc – from £58,864 to £52,490. Advertised salaries had skyrocketed over the summer as hospitals desperately tried to fill the gaps left by an exodus of midwives during the pandemic.Jobs requiring subjective reasoning, including judges and politicians, were similarly deemed safe from the AI revolution.MPs are paid £86,584 a year, and while judge vacancies are not advertised on jobsites, they can expect to earn salaries far in excess of £100,000. Adzuna listed 546 vacancies for chief executive positions in December – and average pay had risen by 15.1pc year-on-year – from £78,916 to £90,868.Elsewhere, the jobsite said society would be reluctant to accept jobs involving “human stories or motivation”, such as influencers, therapists, or life coaches, being performed by AI. Pay rose fractionally in all three cases, and the number of listed vacancies for the latter jumped from just five to 63.Perhaps unsurprisingly, manual labour was also deemed safe from automation. Blue-collar jobs including oil rigging, and pipelaying (average salary £44,448), mechanics (£42,862) and plumbers (£39,039) dominated the list. Roofers, crane drivers, and carpenters also ranked highly.Even as companies embracing AI futures replace swathes of their workforce, the presence of the software is expected to generate jobs specifically geared around monitoring its use. Prompt engineers, AI ethics officers, and AI auditors are expected to be common job roles in the near future, Adzuna said in June. By December, a number of such roles had already started cropping up on job boards. These roles included “machine manager”, “AI trainer”, and “prompt engineer”, for which the advertised salary was £192,000.In the US, the AI job market is booming: a study by marketing publication Biz Report found that AI-related jobs offered 77pc higher salaries than other occupations, while the pay gap between tech jobs and other occupations had widened by 36pc due to AI. At the tail end of 2023, almost a third of all tech jobs were AI-related, the study found.Workers are already steeling themselves for a word of work alongside artificial intelligence. LinkedIn has seen an 80pc increase in members watching AI-related learning courses over the last three months, and a 60pc increase in generative AI skills – such as Chat GPT and prompt crafting – being added to users’ profiles every month since January 2023.

If you're not fully clued up yet, you can grasp the essentials with the help of these AI statistics.",,,,"         ChatGPT took the world by storm after its explosive launch in November 2022, and in 2024, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution certainly isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. Every day, businesses are finding new ways to use AI to save themselves time and money, with the latest AI statistics reflecting the technology’s meteoric rise.Over the last twelve months, the AI market has grown exponentially. Google launched its own Chatbot, Bard, in March 2023, while companies like monday.com and Wix have incorporated similar technology into their existing product infrastructures.In this article, you’ll find 29 must-know statistics relating to the growth of AI, how it’s being used in the workplace, and the future of AI in the business world. Below are the top AI statistics you should know for 2024:  The Top AI Statistics for 2024 In August 2023, OpenAI’s ChatGPT registered more than 180 million unique visitors (Reuters)47% of business leaders will consider using AI to carry out tasks over hiring new staff (Tech.co)The artificial intelligence market is estimated to be worth over $638 billion by 2024 (Precedence Research)ChatGPT costs around $700,00 per day to keep running, covered by Microsoft’s investment (The Information)77% of consumers now use an AI-powered device, but only 33% think that they do (Pega)        In the rest of this guide, we cover:What Is AI?AI Job Replacement StatisticsArtificial Intelligence Growth StatisticsAI in the Workplace StatisticsAI Ethics StatisticsThe Future of AI in Business What Is AI?AI – which stands for artificial intelligence – refers to the wide range of “intelligent” behaviors and functions exhibited by machines, computers, or other technology – many of which are skills typically associated with human intelligence.Importantly, many artificial intelligence systems can “learn” or adapt to novel scenarios without following explicit instructions. This is called machine learning. ChatGPT and Bard have machine-learning capabilities.Machines or systems with artificial intelligence capabilities are usually built to solve problems, answer questions, help with planning, leverage data more efficiently, and complete complicated and time-consuming tasks at a quicker pace than humans can. AI Job Replacement Statistics1. Artificial intelligence is expected to create 133 million new jobs by 2030 (McKinsey)Let’s start off with the good news. Although there’s a lot of talk about the negative impact AI may have on jobs, some sources, such as McKinsey, predict that millions of new roles will be created as they’re gradually incorporated into existing business infrastructures. But this isn’t the only study about AI replacing jobs that’s been released recently.2. Almost 25% of jobs are expected to be “disrupted” by AI over the next five years (World Economic Forum)The World Economic Forum predicts that a quarter of all jobs will be disrupted by the rapid adoption of AI over the next half-decade. The organization says that there will be 14 million fewer overall jobs in 2028, with 83 million roles vanishing yet only 69 million being created.3. Artificial intelligence could already replace the equivalent of 300 million jobs (Goldman Sachs)This much-written-about figure made the headlines back in March, around the same time that Google’s AI chatbot, Bard, was released.Goldman Sachs says that the rapid changes to our economy spurred on by AI development and adoption could drive “a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.” The multinational bank also says that around two-thirds of US jobs are currently “exposed” to automation.4. 78% of legal occupations are now influenced by AI, more than any other occupation (Forrester)As you can see from the graph below, the legal world has been influenced by AI more than any other field, with life, physical, and social occupations in a distant second. Office and administrative occupations – which many people believe to be the most at-risk category of job roles – came in third.      Source: Forrester 2023 Generatvie AI Impact Forecast5. Low-paid workers are fourteen times more likely to be replaced by AI than high-paid workers (McKinsey)McKinsey’s “Generative AI and the Future of Work in America” report reveals that workers on low wages are around 14 times more likely to be forced to make career changes due to the development of AI-powered tools and systems.As Tech.co’s Conor Cawley wrote in a recent article discussing the findings, “these won’t be lateral moves. Given that lower-wage jobs will likely be automated out of existence, these employees will need to be reskilled in a major way, requiring substantial investment from organizations and businesses to address the labor needs of the new world.” Artificial Intelligence Growth Statistics1. The AI market is expected to experience an annual growth rate of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030 (Grand View Research)Grand View Research explains that the “essential fact” that’s seeing the AI market grow rapidly is the datasets accessible to companies building LLMs. “Technology has always been an essential element for these industries,” the research organization explains, “but artificial intelligence (AI) has brought technology to the center of organizations.”2. By 2030, the artificial intelligence market is projected to be worth over $1.3 trillion (Markets and Markets)AI really is here to stay – and companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have not found it difficult to secure various rounds of seed funding to continue their research and improve their large language models. With AI set to play an increasingly pivotal role in business operations, it’s not surprising that the market is set to grow exponentially over the next next seven years.3. More than 1 in every 4 dollars invested in US-based startups during 2023 went to AI companies (Crunchbase)Crunchbase has revealed that the share of overall investment making its way into the bank accounts of AI startups in 2023 is 25%. This is a huge uptick from the 12% they received on average during the four years (2018-2022) prior, another sign that AI is going to dominate the tech industry during the next decade.      Source: Crunchbase4. AI will give China a 26% boost to GDP by 2030, while North America will receive a 14.5% boost (PwC)According to consulting and auditing firm PwC, it is China that will economically benefit the most in the foreseeable future from AI. Overall however, AI could add $15.7 trillion to GDP by 2030 – which is higher than the GDP of India and China combined. AI in the Workplace Statistics1. 82% of business leaders think it’s okay to use AI to write responses to colleagues (Tech. co)Only a very small percentage of business leaders think that it’s wrong if staff members start to use AI to write responses to colleagues. While 8.8% said it was a bad practice outright, another 8.8% said that it depended entirely on the type of message being sent.2. Generative AI such as ChatGPT in business operations improves workers’ performance by 66%, averaged across 3 case studies (NN Group)Three different case studies – focusing on customer service agents, business professionals in report-heavy roles, and programmers coding software – all found that AI tools like ChatGPT improve workers’ performance.The NN Group says that support agents using AI handled 13.8% more customer inquiries every hour, while business professionals who used AI could write 59% more documents every hour. Programmers, on the other hand, benefitted the most, coding 126% more projects per week thanks to AI.3. 56% of businesses cite “inaccuracy” as the greatest risk AI poses to their organization (McKinsey)Out of all the risks posed by AI, businesses are most worried about inaccuracies – or “hallucinations” – generated by AI tools. However, cybersecurity and intellectual property theft rank highly too. Concerningly, the number of companies working to mitigate these risks is a lot lower than the number of companies that identify them as so.      Source: McKinsey’s State of Generative AI in 2023 report.4. 22% of companies have adopted AI primarily to address labor shortages (IBM)The same IBM report details that 20% of respondents said they were adopting AI due to environmental pressures, while 31% referenced competitive pressure.5. 65% of companies are using AI internally, while 74% are testing it (Deloitte)The vast majority of companies have officially jumped on the AI bandwagon. A huge proportion of companies are using AI internally and an even larger percentage claiming to be “testing” the technology. So, there’s a very small percentage who are yet to explore what AI can do for them. AI Ethics Statistics1. 68% of business leaders think it’s unethical for employees to use AI tools without the permission of a manager (Tech.co)According to a recent Tech.co survey, the vast majority of business leaders think their employees should be checking in with their employer, manager, or supervisor before they use AI tools in the workplace. However, 12.3% of respondents said they expect their employees to use AI tools, and they don’t need permission to do so.2. Training one AI large language emits as much carbon as five cars will during their lifetimes (MIT)Unfortunately, all the computing power needed to train an AI model creates quite a lot of carbon. Some estimates show that ChatGPT – one of the world’s largest language models – produces the equivalent of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by 1,369 gasoline-powered cars over a year.      Source: MIT Technology Review.3. 76% of consumers are concerned about misinformation generated by AI-powered technology (Forbes Advisor)Misinformation spread across the internet via social media platforms quickly enough without the help of powerful AI tools like ChatGPT. Worryingly, the same survey found that only 54% of respondents thought they could distinguish between human and machine-generated content.4. 56% of employees “don’t know or are unsure if their organizations have ethical standards” guiding its use (Deloitte)This is a worrying AI statistic. Unchecked usage of AI tools can cause reputational damage for companies, especially if they’re used to assist with work that’s being created for customers, clients, or public consumption. Companies that aren’t communicating internal standards for governing employees’ usage of such tools open themselves up to a wide range of risks.5. 68% of technology innovators, policy leaders, and decision-makers believe that “ethical principles focused primarily on the public good will not be employed in most AI systems by 2030” (Pew Research)If you thought the previous stat was pretty bleak, another recent AI ethics survey found that experts are not optimistic at all about the chances of AI systems being focused on creating a positive impact in society. What else these systems might be based on – good or bad – is not specified. The Future of AI in BusinessAI is going to be at the heart of many business’s operations going forward. The vast majority are already using it, while many others are getting to grips with exactly how it can help them through testing and experimentation.With business leaders apparently already keen to explore artificial intelligence as an alternative to employing new members of staff, it’s really anyone’s guess as to how the business landscape will actually change. However, businesses should be careful when incorporating generative AI tools like ChatGPT into their existing infrastructure without proper guidelines for its usage.A lack of guidelines can lead to confusion, wasted time, and even reputational damage if content created by an AI tool is released to the public without being properly checked. While AI tools and machines present a myriad of exciting opportunities for businesses, time must be taken to fully understand the range and limitations of their capabilities.

It's also one of the least automated. Step one is I've picked a space step 50 is I have now built the space, there's a million moving parts. So we started leveraging robotics and A I in order to automate some of the things that have previously been done by people. You know what we've come from in the industry in terms of how things get built and how fast things get built and how complicated things are. Now, everything is a lot more interactive. Everyone's being tasked with building more with less. The challenge for construction is actually to make construction more efficient by adopting more technology and automation. Typically today, what you'd see is big plans being printed on big sheets of paper uh handed off to someone in the field, he gets down on his hands and knees and uses measuring tape and string to mark out the locations of where all of those things are going to get built inside the building. It used to be an architect, put a piece of paper together actual hard piece of paper, an engineer got it. Drew on top of it, that then went back to a contractor who built it. And if they had questions, they picked up the phone or they mailed you something that came to you three days later. So today buildings are designed in software and 95% of the information in those digital models never gets used to build, it disappears. And that's because the process of actually laying out that information in the field is so painful. It requires someone on their hands and knees marking out each and every detail on the robot. It will follow it. And so dusty is automating this information flow by taking those digital models and printing them out in the field. Basically a little box with wheels on it that has a printer on the front and it takes those digital models and it dries itself around the floor. And as it goes, it leaves a trail of ink behind that ink marks out the locations where all the walls, the pipes, plumbing, the electrical fixtures, where everything gets installed inside that building. Dusty's field printer guarantees 1/16 of an inch accuracy to the digital run. It used to be, you drew a duct, you assumed there was some level of tolerance that you had to account for, for other trades. You gave yourself an extra couple of inches. Then the next trade came in, they gave themselves an extra couple of inches. Then by the time you were done, your shilling was a foot and a half lower than it needed to be. When we need to produce more with the workers. We have, we make better tools for the people that we have. You know, a prime example of this is the excavator. We used to dig holes with a shovel. And now all the workers who are digging, the shovels are driving excavators. These types of machinery that help improve productivity, improve jobs exist in the exteriors of spaces. We really haven't seen them penetrate the interiors. And so canvas basically makes tools for installing materials on these spaces. And our first product is in drywall finishing. Everybody has mostly seen the kind of person lift where you have a wheel base where a platform extends up and down on a lift that lifts a person. Instead of putting a person on that, we put a robot arm and a whole suite of sensors that allow us to sense and understand the space that we're working in because of the precision of the machine. It allows us to apply material more all at once as opposed to many iterative steps, which is what you'll see in drywall finishing. And so that actually shortens the schedule of the chain. The owner who wants their building finished and wants to start getting people into it can do that more quickly. Two people are retiring for every one person that enters the industry at a time where we need to build twice as much over the next 40 years. How are we going to build sustainably? How are we going to build affordably? How are we going to be able to grow our companies? Given that it's becoming harder and harder to find uh the labor that we need? You know, I think is a marketing problem because I think construction, once you actually get into it, it actually is a stem career robotics is actually just magnifying that that effect by creating more jobs that are robot operator jobs, robot technician jobs, I'm really excited about the opportunity to attract new talent to the industry and give them, you know, skills that are going to be broadly applicable for their futures going forward. And I think that's going to make construction once again, an incredibly attractive place to have a career. There's certainly growth to be done in the in the world of technology in this industry. In A I A lot of people are afraid that it's gonna replace what we do or it's gonna replace the, the installers or it's gonna replace a labor union. And I just, I don't ever, I don't ever see that happening. I don't see it getting to that point, the experts have just gotten better and refined their skills and input their experience in the right places. The machine is a tool that the worker is operating. And so we use a I more to understand our environment and to interface with the worker so that we can get good instruction from the workers. Robotics has the potential to bring people into the construction industry that would have never considered a job in construction. Because suddenly when you're using a robot, you don't need to be super strong. And that makes construction a lot more appealing to a wider variety of people. And that's really important because one of the challenges in construction is actually hiring the workforce of the future.",2023-12-20,PT5M28S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://fortune.com/videos/watch/Why-AI-could-be-the-construction-industrys-answer-to-a-workforce-shortage/df0478f3-7106-466a-939b-c26f1c67f912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fortune,https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/df0478f3-7106-466a-939b-c26f1c67f912/Images/posterImage-ver4-640x360.jpg,https://d2byebo1j9i40c.cloudfront.net/df0478f3-7106-466a-939b-c26f1c67f912/Images/posterImage-ver4-1280x720.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the wake of dramatic technological advances, the workplace of the future will be far different than was envisioned a year ago.

A little more than a year ago, we wrote a series of articles for Route Fifty about the future of government jobs in an effort to help states and localities prepare. About a month later, the phrase “generative AI” came into the public’s consciousness and that future has changed dramatically.   As governments increasingly learn how to take advantage of the information retrieval and communication dimensions of this new technology, the impact on customer service fields, call centers and service requests is likely to be especially profound.“If a city is using something like this, you may not need a 311 system,” says Ron Holifield, chief executive officer of Strategic Government Resources and interim executive director of the Alliance for Innovation. “And that has implications for the workforce because [generative AI] will route you where you need to go and get the information you need far more efficiently.”In summer 2022, Ryan Oakes, Accenture’s global health and public services industry practice chair, marveled at the speed with which technological responses to the pandemic had occurred, but wondered whether they would continue at the same rate. “AI has just put what we saw during the pandemic on steroids,” he says now. “It’s opened additional possibilities in the ways that governments can connect data, augment workers and fill gaps in staffing.”A recent report from Accenture, calculated that across both the public and private sectors, generative AI has the potential for automating and augmenting work hours in 63% of office and administrative support jobs, 59% of business and financial services jobs and 40%, on average, of occupations generally.There’s little question that generative AI is a game changer, but how fast the game will move is still an unknown as states, cities and counties try to balance the risks of utilizing the potential advances with the hazards of cybersecurity and privacy issues. There are also significant concerns about bias.Governments will need to be aware of these hazards as they seize on generative AI to power their call centers and 311 lines. This has become an even more alluring opportunity as governments realize that they can avoid troublesome misinformation on the internet by confining the uses of generative AI to “controlled” sources of information, like the entities’ own websites.But even when controlled sources are used, there can still be “missing content on a website and some content is out of date,” says Parth Shah, chief executive officer and founder of Polimorphic, a producer of advanced generative AI services. That's why governments using generative AI tools are beginning to realize they have to pay extra attention to keeping their websites accurate and up to date.Shah has spoken in recent months at ICMA and Alliance for Innovation conferences, emphasizing the importance of limiting searches to controlled generative AI sources. “Controlled content is so important because seeing everything on the internet leads to misinformation and the potential of bias,” he says.

Andy Pederson, the village manager in Bayside, Wisconsin, with about 4,400 residents, began using controlled generative AI on his government’s website in early November with the help of Polimorphic. He is enthusiastic about the possibilities, and though he’s not certain what the impact on government jobs will be, “this makes things more user-friendly for everybody involved, not only the general public but also the staff as well.”As Pederson sees it, the new tool has become “a little bit of a succession plan and training module” for his employees. He can see immediate ways in which generative AI has changed the way his workers get information, produce documents and learn about the small government they serve.

The Future of State and Local Government Jobs


There’s More Than Just AI in the FutureTechnological advancements are not the only force driving job changes. Workforce shortages are as well, especially as problems in hiring persist, staff vacancies continue, competition from the private sector grows and aging employees retire. A government that has 100 staffers now is likely facing the retirement of as many as a third of them in the next 10 years, says Shah.With advances brought on by artificial intelligence, robotics and a range of technologies that improve the efficiency of services, there are a slew of routine jobs that will no longer exist or exist in far fewer numbers. That makes the future of jobs in the public sector extremely dependent on a much more aggressive focus on training, including apprenticeships and other skill-based efforts that also expand work opportunities to populations that have been blocked from jobs in the past by job experience and college degree requirements.As Route Fifty recently reported, at least 16 states have taken steps to move away from more traditional degree requirements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.   One of the states that has been most active in preparing for the future of government jobs is Colorado, where the Office of the Future of Work was first set up in 2019 and tasked with preparing the state for work transitions. While much of its mission is focused on the general Colorado workforce, it collaborates on a parallel effort within the Department of Personnel Administration to build skill-based learning programs for the state’s own employees. Currently, the task within the personnel administration is to work directly with all 23 of the state’s executive branch agencies on a vast array of programs and techniques to build apprenticeships (both registered and informal), internships, curriculum-based learning programs and experiential-based learning. “We’re intentional about creating sustainable programs that can cast a wide net towards our community,” says Melissa Walker, the director of Workforce Solutions for the state.Hiring changes in Colorado and other entities are accompanied by a commitment to professional development and career growth. This kind of training was often cited as a crucial need in last year’s future of government jobs series along with the warning that training programs have always been dependent on the availability of financial and time resources, particularly given workforce shortages.The Need for CautionAs efforts at automation continue to develop, one of the other major needs is caution as jobs change and new technologies are introduced. Generative AI, in particular, presents dangers as well as opportunities. As governments experiment with the new technology, they will be faced with sales pitches from vendors who may see a striking opportunity in this exciting new world but lack sufficient background and knowledge to provide necessary guardrails.“We can take advantage of technologies like generative AI without necessarily trying to introduce it into the most complicated or complex environments in government,” Accenture’s Oakes says, citing the importance of governance policies that are accessible, provide transparency to algorithms and communicate clearly.“It’s still very early, early on,” he adds. “On Tuesdays, I’m wildly enthusiastic about the potential for generative AI to make this a better world, and on Wednesdays, I wake up in a sweat, absolutely terrified.”

Few technologies have shown as much potential to shape our future as artificial intelligence. Specialists in fields ranging from medicine to microfinance to the military are evaluating AI tools, exploring how these might transform their work and worlds. For creative professionals, AI poses a unique set of challenges and opportunities — particularly generative AI, the use of algorithms to transform vast amounts of data into new content.
The future of generative AI and its impact on art and design was the subject of a sold-out panel discussion on Oct. 26 at the MIT Bartos Theater. It was part of the annual meeting for the Council for the Arts at MIT (CAMIT), a group of alumni and other supporters of the arts at MIT, and was co-presented by the MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology (CAST), a cross-school initiative for artist residencies and cross-disciplinary projects.
Introduced by Andrea Volpe, director of CAMIT, and moderated by Onur Yüce Gün SM ’06, PhD’16, the panel featured multimedia artist and social science researcher Ziv Epstein SM’19, PhD’23, MIT professor of architecture and director of the SMArchS and SMArchS AD programs Ana Miljački, and artist and roboticist Alex Reben MAS ’10.

            Panel Discussion: How Is Generative AI Transforming Art and Design?

The discussion centered around three themes: emergence, embodiment, and expectations:
Emergence  
Moderator Onur Yüce Gün: In much of your work, what emerges is usually a question — an ambiguity — and that ambiguity is inherent in the creative process in art and design. Does generative AI help you reach those ambiguities?
Ana Miljački: In the summer of 2022, the Memorial Cemetery in Mostar [in Bosnia and Herzegovina] was destroyed. It was a post-World War II Yugoslav memorial, and we wanted to figure out a way to uphold the values the memorial had stood for. We compiled video material from six different monuments and, with AI, created a nonlinear documentary, a triptych playing on three video screens, accompanied by a soundscape. With this project we fabricated a synthetic memory, a way to seed those memories and values into the minds of people who never lived those memories or values. This is the type of ambiguity that would be problematic in science, and one that is fascinating for artists and designers and architects. It is also a bit scary.
Ziv Epstein: There is some debate whether generative AI is a tool or an agent. But even if we call it a tool, we need to remember that tools are not neutral. Think about photography. When photography emerged, a lot of painters were worried that it meant the end of art. But it turned out that photography freed up painters to do other things. Generative AI is, of course, a different type of tool because it draws on a huge quantity of other people’s work. There is already artistic and creative agency embedded in these systems. There are already ambiguities in how these existing works will be represented, and which cycles and ambiguities we will perpetuate.
Alex Reben: I’m often asked whether these systems are actually creative, in the way that we are creative. In my own experience, I’ve often been surprised at the outputs I create using AI. I see that I can steer things in a direction that parallels what I might have done on my own but is different enough from what I might have done, is amplified or altered or changed. So there are ambiguities. But we need to remember that the term AI is also ambiguous. It’s actually many different things.
Embodiment
Moderator: Most of us use computers on a daily basis, but we experience the world through our senses, through our bodies. Art and design create tangible experiences. We hear them, see them, touch them. Have we attained the same sensory interaction with AI systems? 
Miljački: So long as we are working in images, we are working in two dimensions. But for me, at least in the project we did around the Mostar memorial, we were able to produce affect on a variety of levels, levels that together produce something that is greater than a two-dimensional image moving in time. Through images and a soundscape we created a spatial experience in time, a rich sensory experience that goes beyond the two dimensions of the screen.
Reben: I guess embodiment for me means being able to interface and interact with the world and modify it. In one of my projects, we used AI to generate a “Dali-like” image, and then turned it into a three-dimensional object, first with 3D printing, and then casting it in bronze at a foundry. There was even a patina artist to finish the surface. I cite this example to show just how many humans were involved in the creation of this artwork at the end of the day. There were human fingerprints at every step.
Epstein: The question is, how do we embed meaningful human control into these systems, so they could be more like, for example, a violin. A violin player has all sorts of causal inputs — physical gestures they can use to transform their artistic intention into outputs, into notes and sounds. Right now we’re far from that with generative AI. Our interaction is basically typing a bit of text and getting something back. We’re basically yelling at a black box.
Expectations
Moderator: These new technologies are spreading so rapidly, almost like an explosion. And there are enormous expectations around what they are going to do. Instead of stepping on the gas here, I’d like to test the brakes and ask what these technologies are not going to do. Are there promises they won’t be able to fulfill?
Miljački: I am hoping that we don’t go to “Westworld.” I understand we do need AI to solve complex computational problems. But I hope it won’t be used to replace thinking. Because as a tool AI is actually nostalgic. It can only work with what already exists and then produce probable outcomes. And that means it reproduces all the biases and gaps in the archive it has been fed. In architecture, for example, that archive is made up of works by white male European architects. We have to figure out how not to perpetuate that type of bias, but to question it.
Epstein: In a way, using AI now is like putting on a jetpack and a blindfold. You’re going really fast, but you don’t really know where you’re going. Now that this technology seems to be capable of doing human-like things, I think it’s an awesome opportunity for us to think about what it means to be human. My hope is that generative AI can be a kind of ontological wrecking ball, that it can shake things up in a very interesting way.
Reben: I know from history that it’s pretty hard to predict the future of technology. So trying to predict the negative — what might not happen — with this new technology is also close to impossible. If you look back at what we thought we would have now, at the predictions that were made, it’s quite different from what we actually have. I don’t think that anyone today can say for certain what AI won’t be able to do one day. Just like we can’t say what science will be able to do, or humans. The best we can do, for now, is attempt to drive these technologies towards the future in a way that will be beneficial.

Here are three of the biggest AI innovations from the past year.",,How do ChatGPT and the other contemporary AIs look when compared with this understanding of human brains and human minds? ,How do ChatGPT and the other contemporary AIs look when compared with this understanding of human brains and human minds? ,,,"IdeasBy Andy ClarkJanuary 5, 2024 7:00 AM ESTClark is Professor of Cognitive Philosophy at the University of Sussex. For more on the picture of human minds as action-based prediction machines, see Clark, A.  The Experience Machine: How Our Minds Predict and Shape Reality (Penguin Random House, 2023).Generative AI—think Dall.E, ChatGPT-4, and many more—is all the rage. It’s remarkable successes, and occasional catastrophic failures, have kick-started important debates about both the scope and dangers of advanced forms of artificial intelligence. But what, if anything, does this work reveal about natural intelligences such as our own?I’m a philosopher and cognitive scientist who has spent their entire career trying to understand how the human mind works. Drawing on research spanning psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, my search has drawn me towards a picture of how natural minds work that is both interestingly similar to, yet also deeply different from, the core operating principles of the generative AIs. Examining this contrast may help us better understand them both.The AIs learn a generative model (hence their name) that enables them to predict patterns in various kinds of data or signal. What generative there means is that they learn enough about the deep regularities in some data-set to enable them to create plausible new versions of that kind of data for themselves. In the case of ChatGPT the data is text. Knowing about all the many faint and strong patterns in a huge library of texts allows ChatGPT, when prompted, to produce plausible versions of that kind of data in interesting ways, when sculpted by user prompts—for example, a user might request a story about a black cat written in the style of Ernest Hemingway. But there are also AIs specializing in other kinds of data, such as images, enabling them to create new paintings in the style of, say, Picasso.What does this have to do with the human mind? According to much contemporary theorizing, the human brain has learnt a model to predict certain kinds of data, too. But in this case the data to be predicted are the various barrages of sensory information registered by sensors in our eyes, ears, and other perceptual organs. Now comes the crucial difference. Natural brains must learn to predict those sensory flows in a very special kind of context—the context of using the sensory information to select actions that help us survive and thrive in our worlds. This means that among the many things our brains learn to predict, a core subset concerns the ways our own actions on the world will alter what we subsequently sense. For example, my brain has learnt that if I accidentally tread on the tail of my cat, the next sensory stimulations I get will often include sightings of wailing, squirming, and occasionally feelings of pain from a well-deserved retaliatory scratch.Read More: AI and the Rise of MediocrityThis kind of learning has special virtues. It helps us separate cause and simple correlation. Seeing my cat is strongly correlated with seeing the furniture in my apartment. But neither one of these causes the other to occur. Treading on my cat’s tail, by contrast, causes the subsequent wailing and scratching. Knowing the difference is crucial if you are a creature that needs to act on its world to bring about desired (or to avoid undesired) effects. In other words, the generative model that issues natural predictions is constrained by a familiar and biologically critical goal—the selection of the right actions to perform at the right times. That means knowing how things currently are and (crucially) how things will change and alter if we act and intervene on the world in certain ways.How do ChatGPT and the other contemporary AIs look when compared with this understanding of human brains and human minds? Most obviously, current AIs tend to specialize in predicting rather specific kinds of data—sequences of words, in the case of ChatGPT. At first sight, this suggest that ChatGPT might more properly be seen as a model of our textual outputs rather than (like biological brains) models of the world we live in. That would be a very significant difference indeed. But that move is arguably a little too swift. Words, as the wealth of great and not-so-great literature attests, already depict patterns of every kind—patterns among looks and tastes and sounds for example. This gives the generative AIs a real window onto our world. Still missing, however, is that crucial ingredient—action. At best, text-predictive AIs get a kind of verbal fossil trail of the effects of our actions upon the world. That trail is made up of verbal descriptions of actions (""Andy trod on his cat’s tail"") along with verbally couched information about their typical effects and consequences. Despite this the AIs have no practical abilities to intervene on the world—so no way to test, evaluate, and improve their own world-model, the one making the predictions.More From TIMEThe 3 Most Important AI Innovations of 2023More Videos0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Loading adLive00:2500:0004:14 This is an important practical limitation. It is rather as if someone had access to a huge library of data concerning the shape and outcomes of all previous experiments, but were unable to conduct any of their own. But it may have deeper significance too. For plausibly, it is only by poking, prodding, and generally intervening upon our worlds that biological minds anchor their knowledge to the very world it is meant to describe. By learning what causes what, and how different actions will affect our future worlds in different ways, we build a firm basis for our own later understandings. It is that grounding in actions and their effects that later enables us to truly understand encountered sentences such as ""The cat scratched the person who trod on its tail."" Our generative models—unlike those of the generative AIs—are forged in the fires of action.Might future AIs build anchored models in this way too? Might they start to run experiments in which they launch responses into the world to see what effects those responses have? Something a bit like this already occurs in the context of online advertising, political campaigning, and social media manipulating, where algorithms can launch ads, posts and reports and adjust their future behavior according to specific effects on buyers, voters, and others. If more powerful AIs closed the action loop in these ways, they would be starting to turn their currently passive and ""second-hand"" window onto the human world into something closer to the kind of grip that active beings like us have on our worlds.But even then, there’d be other things missing. Many of the predictions that structure human experience concern our own internal physiological states. For example, we experience thirst and hunger in ways that are deeply anticipatory, allowing us to remedy looming shortfalls in advance, so as to stay within the correct zone for bodily integrity and survival. This means that we exist in a world where some of our brain’s predictions matter in a very special way. They matter because they enable us to continue to exist as the embodied, energy metabolizing, beings that we are. We humans also benefit hugely from collective practices of culture, science, and art, allowing us to share our knowledge and to probe and test our own best models of ourselves and our worlds.In addition, we humans are what might be called ""knowing knowers""—we depict ourselves to ourselves as having knowledge and beliefs, and we have slowly designed the complex worlds of art, science, and technology to test and improve our own knowledge and beliefs. For example, we can write papers that make claims that are swiftly challenged by others, and then run experiments to try to resolve the differences of opinion. In all these ways (even bracketing obvious but currently intractable questions about ‘true conscious awareness’) there seems to be a very large gulf separating our special kinds of knowing and understanding from anything so far achieved by the AIs.Could AIs one day become prediction machines with a survival instinct, running baseline predictions that pro-actively seek to create and maintain the conditions for their own existence? Could they thereby become increasingly autonomous, protecting their own hardware and manufacturing and drawing power as needed? Could they form a community, and invent a kind of culture? Could they start to model themselves as beings with beliefs and opinions? There is nothing in their current situation to drive them in these familiar directions. But none of these dimensions is obviously off-limits either. If changes were to occur along all or some of those key missing dimensions, we might yet be glimpsing the soul of a new machine.",https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,,,,,The 3 Most Important AI Innovations of 2023,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/gIt8zUdS/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,2023-12-20T17:25:47.000Z,PT4M14S,https://time.com/6552233/generative-ai-reveals-human-mind/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6552233/generative-ai-reveals-human-mind/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/gIt8zUdS.m3u8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PascualJAN 04, 2024 - 10:20 ESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkMatthew Butterick seems like a normal guy. He wears a baseball cap, clear-rimmed glasses and a colorful sports jacket. Behind him are two vintage keyboards and synthesizers — they add a bohemian touch to the basement of his Los Angeles home, which is also his office. “I have a collection of more than 20,” he notes, in a video call with EL PAÍS. Nothing in this scene suggests that Butterick is a lawyer… nor that someone so far removed from the classic suit-and-tie stereotype makes giants like Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta hold their breath.The American has started a legal crusade against generative artificial intelligence (AI). In 2022, he filed the first lawsuit in the history of this field against Microsoft, one of the companies that develop these types of tools (GitHub Copilot). Today, he’s coordinating four class action lawsuits that bring together complaints filed by programmers, artists and writers. If successful, he could force the companies responsible for applications such as ChatGPT or Midjourney to compensate thousands of creators. They may even have to retire their algorithms and retrain them with databases that don’t infringe on intellectual property rights. “This is, for many of us, the fight of our lives,” he affirms. The first results of his efforts could arrive in a matter of months.The New York Times took the same path as Butterick a few days ago, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for having used millions of articles from the newspaper (without consent) to train their algorithms. This the first media outlet to take this measure. “I can’t comment on the case because I haven’t read the lawsuit,” Butterick shrugs. “We were the first to sue Meta and OpenAI for training linguistic models with copyrighted material. We’re not surprised that others have subsequently done so. My partner Joe Saveri and I have always viewed our cases and other litigation as one part of an emerging global conversation about how generative AI will coexist with human creativity. This race has just begun,” he adds.2023 was the year in which the world became aware of the potential of generative AI, which is capable of producing (apparently) original texts, images, or music. But the algorithms that make this possible are applied to gigantic databases made up of billions of documents, including texts, illustrations, or pieces of music. All of these works — without which automatic systems would be totally useless — have an author behind them, who not only isn’t compensated for AI’s use of their work, but who may become unemployed as generative AI tools become more sophisticated.Butterick identified this danger in the summer of 2022, months before the emergence of ChatGPT. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this 53-year-old American has made his living primarily as a typeface designer, programmer and writer. “Like many other creators and artists, it’s become clear to me that my work is doomed. It’s now part of the training data of many generative AI systems. The next step is to get rid of us,” he sighs.The first product that put Butterick on alert was Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, an AI-assisted software tool that trains with a host of open source software. He remembers how its launch sowed doubt among the programming community. The difference between Butterick and the rest of those affected is that he decided to take action on the matter. He dusted off the law degree that he obtained from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 15 years ago.“After speaking with those affected, I concluded that this system is a violation of open source licenses and that it’s not a benign tool. It’s designed to replace open source programmers… I expressed this in my blog,” he points out. “Joseph Saveri — a lawyer I knew, who was a fan of my typography work — contacted me and said, ‘You know, the point you’re making about GitHub Copilot is pretty interesting.’ At the time, I wasn’t a practicing lawyer, so Joe and I embarked on an investigation and became convinced that there really was a case [to be made].”In November 2022, Butterick and Saveri filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against Microsoft, owner of GitHub Copilot, alleging that the firm violates open license agreements. This was the first piece of litigation having to do with generative AI.Illustrator Karla Ortiz, along with lawyers Matthew Butterick (on her right) and Cadio Zirpoli, before testifying at the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, in July 2023.Chip Somodevilla (Getty Images)But programmers weren’t the only ones who saw their jobs in danger. After filing the lawsuit, a group of visual artists approached the lawyers. “They told us: ‘Wow, that sounds similar to the problem we have. Would you be interested in taking our case?’” This is how the legal process they opened in January 2023 against Stability AI, Midjourney and Deviant Art — the main generative AI tools applied to illustration — was conceived. This past November, they submitted amendments requested by the judge. The process continues, just like that of Copilot.The third group that Butterick and Saveri represent are authors of books. In July, they filed two class-action lawsuits against OpenAI and Meta for including books written by plaintiffs — including Richard Kadri and Christopher Golden — in their training dataset.A very real threatIllustrator Karla Ortiz realized the tsunami that was about to hit her and her colleagues in the summer of 2022. This 38-year-old Puerto Rican artist has worked for most of the major Hollywood studios, including Marvel Studios, HBO and Universal Pictures, as well as video game production companies such as Blizzard and Ubisoft. Key characters from blockbusters such as Thor: Ragnarok, Doctor Strange and Jurassic World have been drawn up by her brushes. But not even someone of her status feels safe.Ortiz began researching how generative AI tools are applied to illustration. She soon recognized the work of her colleagues in the drawings produced by the tools. “I was horrified to see that these platforms use your name, so that users can demand your style. [The AI] takes your work to generate images that look like yours,” she explains by video call from her San Francisco studio. “At that moment, I started to worry a lot. I’m a member of the board of directors of the Concept Art Association of America, which brings together artists who work for the film and video game industry. We decided to mobilize.”Ortiz and two other colleagues became plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit filed by Butterick and Saveri against Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt. Her cause gained momentum when, this past July, she was called to testify before the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to talk about the legality and ethics of AI. “That would have been inconceivable a year earlier. Senators are taking seriously [the fact] that creators have their works taken away without their consent, without compensation and without credit,” Butterick notes. He accompanied his client to the Capitol.“For illustrators, a traditionally important source of income is putting the ideas of producers and directors into images, to then show them to the studios. That activity has literally been erased by generative AI,” Ortiz says. “My job is at risk. It consists of showcasing ideas, and machines are now doing that really well. We artists cannot compete against those tools. I never worried about the future of my career until now.”AI reaches the courtsThe momentum generated by the class-action lawsuits filed by Butterick and his colleague has paved the way for more lawsuits. In 2023, Getty Images sued Stability AI for using images from its archive without permission. In September, two other groups of writers filed complaints against OpenAI. Bestsellers George R. R. Martin, John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen are among them. And, in October, several record labels — including the Universal Music Group — sued Anthropic, a company created by former OpenAI workers, for training its algorithms with copyrighted materials. Hollywood actors’ unions haven’t litigated yet, but they were on strike for months to improve their pay conditions and obtain guarantees that protect them against artificial intelligence.Butterick and Saveri know that the fight is now or never. This wave of lawsuits basically says that generative AI is illegal. When this technology is fully established, it will be more difficult to go against the companies that develop it. But if the courts conclude that the training of algorithms is illegal, the blow to big tech could be massive. They would have to start over and redo their databases. It would also be disastrous for them to have to license these databases, negotiating payments in exchange for permissions from each source.Is it too optimistic to think about such an outcome? “That’s happened before,” Butterick responds with a smile. “The FTC has investigated companies that used models based on private data and made them delete their databases and the algorithms and models built with them,” he explains. Cambridge Analytica — the consulting firm that used data from more than 80 million Facebook users to influence the 2016 presidential election — was the first company to suffer from the FTC’s new policy in 2019, dubbed “algorithmic destruction.”In the EU, the pending regulatory framework on AI — whose final text is not yet public, although there has been wide consensus among member states — establishes the obligation for foundational models to comply with the bloc’s copyright regulations. We’ll have to wait for the fine print of the framework to see how it’s executed.Butterick has put writing, design and programming on hold for almost a year to focus on his lawsuits. He believes this is the right thing to do. “I have the firm conviction that if I don’t stop my regular work and join these cases, I won’t have anything left. When we presented the first lawsuit — the one against Copilot — people looked at us as if we were crazy, or Luddites,” the American emphasizes. “Barely a year has passed and now, no one doubts the tremendous effect that generative AI has on creative professions. This has just begun. We have to establish safeguards so that this technology doesn’t put an end to everything.”Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

He wears a baseball cap, clear-rimmed glasses and a colorful sports jacket. Behind him are two vintage keyboards and synthesizers — they add a bohemian touch to the basement of his Los Angeles home, which is also his office. “I have a collection of more than 20,” he notes, in a video call with EL PAÍS. Nothing in this scene suggests that Butterick is a lawyer… nor that someone so far removed from the classic suit-and-tie stereotype makes giants like Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta hold their breath. The American has started a legal crusade against generative artificial intelligence (AI). In 2022, he filed the first lawsuit in the history of this field against Microsoft, one of the companies that develop these types of tools (GitHub Copilot). Today, he’s coordinating four class action lawsuits that bring together complaints filed by programmers, artists and writers. If successful, he could force the companies responsible for applications such as ChatGPT or Midjourney to compensate thousands of creators. They may even have to retire their algorithms and retrain them with databases that don’t infringe on intellectual property rights. “This is, for many of us, the fight of our lives,” he affirms. The first results of his efforts could arrive in a matter of months. The New York Times took the same path as Butterick a few days ago, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for having used millions of articles from the newspaper (without consent) to train their algorithms. This the first media outlet to take this measure. “I can’t comment on the case because I haven’t read the lawsuit,” Butterick shrugs. “We were the first to sue Meta and OpenAI for training linguistic models with copyrighted material. We’re not surprised that others have subsequently done so. My partner Joe Saveri and I have always viewed our cases and other litigation as one part of an emerging global conversation about how generative AI will coexist with human creativity. This race has just begun,” he adds. 2023 was the year in which the world became aware of the potential of generative AI, which is capable of producing (apparently) original texts, images, or music. But the algorithms that make this possible are applied to gigantic databases made up of billions of documents, including texts, illustrations, or pieces of music. All of these works — without which automatic systems would be totally useless — have an author behind them, who not only isn’t compensated for AI’s use of their work, but who may become unemployed as generative AI tools become more sophisticated. Butterick identified this danger in the summer of 2022, months before the emergence of ChatGPT. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this 53-year-old American has made his living primarily as a typeface designer, programmer and writer. “Like many other creators and artists, it’s become clear to me that my work is doomed. It’s now part of the training data of many generative AI systems. The next step is to get rid of us,” he sighs. The first product that put Butterick on alert was Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, an AI-assisted software tool that trains with a host of open source software. He remembers how its launch sowed doubt among the programming community. The difference between Butterick and the rest of those affected is that he decided to take action on the matter. He dusted off the law degree that he obtained from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 15 years ago. “After speaking with those affected, I concluded that this system is a violation of open source licenses and that it’s not a benign tool. It’s designed to replace open source programmers… I expressed this in my blog,” he points out. “Joseph Saveri — a lawyer I knew, who was a fan of my typography work — contacted me and said, ‘You know, the point you’re making about GitHub Copilot is pretty interesting.’ At the time, I wasn’t a practicing lawyer, so Joe and I embarked on an investigation and became convinced that there really was a case [to be made].” In November 2022, Butterick and Saveri filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against Microsoft, owner of GitHub Copilot, alleging that the firm violates open license agreements. This was the first piece of litigation having to do with generative AI. But programmers weren’t the only ones who saw their jobs in danger. After filing the lawsuit, a group of visual artists approached the lawyers. “They told us: ‘Wow, that sounds similar to the problem we have. Would you be interested in taking our case?’” This is how the legal process they opened in January 2023 against Stability AI, Midjourney and Deviant Art — the main generative AI tools applied to illustration — was conceived. This past November, they submitted amendments requested by the judge. The process continues, just like that of Copilot. The third group that Butterick and Saveri represent are authors of books. In July, they filed two class-action lawsuits against OpenAI and Meta for including books written by plaintiffs — including Richard Kadri and Christopher Golden — in their training dataset. Illustrator Karla Ortiz realized the tsunami that was about to hit her and her colleagues in the summer of 2022. This 38-year-old Puerto Rican artist has worked for most of the major Hollywood studios, including Marvel Studios, HBO and Universal Pictures, as well as video game production companies such as Blizzard and Ubisoft. Key characters from blockbusters such as Thor: Ragnarok, Doctor Strange and Jurassic World have been drawn up by her brushes. But not even someone of her status feels safe. Ortiz began researching how generative AI tools are applied to illustration. She soon recognized the work of her colleagues in the drawings produced by the tools. “I was horrified to see that these platforms use your name, so that users can demand your style. [The AI] takes your work to generate images that look like yours,” she explains by video call from her San Francisco studio. “At that moment, I started to worry a lot. I’m a member of the board of directors of the Concept Art Association of America, which brings together artists who work for the film and video game industry. We decided to mobilize.” Ortiz and two other colleagues became plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit filed by Butterick and Saveri against Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt. Her cause gained momentum when, this past July, she was called to testify before the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to talk about the legality and ethics of AI. “That would have been inconceivable a year earlier. Senators are taking seriously [the fact] that creators have their works taken away without their consent, without compensation and without credit,” Butterick notes. He accompanied his client to the Capitol. “For illustrators, a traditionally important source of income is putting the ideas of producers and directors into images, to then show them to the studios. That activity has literally been erased by generative AI,” Ortiz says. “My job is at risk. It consists of showcasing ideas, and machines are now doing that really well. We artists cannot compete against those tools. I never worried about the future of my career until now.” The momentum generated by the class-action lawsuits filed by Butterick and his colleague has paved the way for more lawsuits. In 2023, Getty Images sued Stability AI for using images from its archive without permission. In September, two other groups of writers filed complaints against OpenAI. Bestsellers George R. R.

However, AI is more transformational technology-wise and has come at a time when two wars are being fought with global ramifications. So, the likelihood of AI-related jobs that will get created may not be enough to dwarf the job losses created by AI's disruption,” he said.Vijay Sivaram, chief executive at Quess IT Staffing, said although AI innovation has been there for a while, its implications on the workforce are being felt only now because of rapid evolution in generative-AI tools.“We will continue to see AI replacing certain skills, especially among yesteryear engineers who have not been able to upskill,” Sivaram said.At a macro level, the IT hiring market is in itself in a slowdown, he said. “The ongoing job displacement is also playing out now due to over-hiring that happened in the 2021-22 pandemic cycle. And, therefore, organisations are looking at thinning their teams through AI automation wherever possible.”ET had previously reported that the big tech pack of ‘FAAMNG’ companies in India are in a near hiring pause amid the macroeconomic headwinds and global layoffs.These companies — Facebook (Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) — registered a 90% drop in active job postings in India so far in 2023 compared with last year, according to data put together for ET by Xpehno. In fact, the combined current job postings by these companies at 200 is just 2% of what usually is the number in India.Cumulatively, the top four Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro — have cut down their headcount by 37,299 over the past two quarters. This compares to an addition of 81,678 jobs during the first half of fiscal 2023.Vikram Ahuja, CEO of hiring solutions provider Talent500, said IT support services and routine software development have started to see a change in opportunities. “Organisations have started to explore chatbots and customer support products which will help them drive higher productivity and conversion,” he said.Conversely, AI has positively impacted sectors such as advanced tech (AI development, machine learning), healthcare (AI-assisted diagnostics) and finance (algorithmic trading, fraud detection), he added.Munira Loliwala, assistant vice president (strategy and growth), TeamLease Digital, said the need for reskilling 16 million employees will also create more than 4.7 million new opportunities by 2027, across manufacturing, retail, education, finance & insurance. The manufacturing sector alone is expected to add nearly 1 million new tech jobs led by AI.“Roles in application developers, data analysts and platform owners will be the most sought-after skills … Slightly over 50% of these roles are expected to fall in manufacturing, retail / consumer and healthcare sectors that involve substantial amounts of repetitive work that lends itself to automation. Followed by farming, education and finance,” she said.Read More News onartificial intelligencetata consultancy servicespaytmapplenetflixmicrosoftinfosysgoogleamazon",https://schema.org/,WebPage,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/india-job-scene-sees-early-signs-of-disruption-from-ai/articleshow/106422589.cms,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-106422589,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-1759279,overlay-ettech/photo.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Himanshi Lohchab'}","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Economic Times', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",India job scene sees early signs of disruption from AI,2024-01-01T06:01:00+05:30,2024-01-01T06:01:00+05:30,Tech,India job scene sees early signs of disruption from AI,https://schema.org/False,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/india-job-scene-sees-early-signs-of-disruption-from-ai/articleshow/106422589.cms,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'https://schema.org/False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}",,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}",,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Indian workforce is feeling the heat of artificial intelligence taking over their jobs.Last week, digital payments company Paytm laid off 1,000 employees from its operations, sales and engineering teams due to what it said was “AI-powered automation” aimed at cutting 10-15% employee costs.

As per market trends, more than 16 million working employees in India will need reskilling and upskilling due to AI's influence by 2027, HR services firm TeamLease Digital said.To be sure, some experts said the reskilling will also create millions of new opportunities in sectors such as manufacturing and retail in the next few years.But for now, there could be some pain.“The possibility of large AI-induced layoffs in the near term are real,” said Kamal Karanth, cofounder at staffing company Xpheno.“The past technology breakthroughs were also coupled with economic tailwinds; hence, more tech-enabled jobs were created than lost. However, AI is more transformational technology-wise and has come at a time when two wars are being fought with global ramifications. So, the likelihood of AI-related jobs that will get created may not be enough to dwarf the job losses created by AI's disruption,” he said.Vijay Sivaram, chief executive at Quess IT Staffing, said although AI innovation has been there for a while, its implications on the workforce are being felt only now because of rapid evolution in generative-AI tools.“We will continue to see AI replacing certain skills, especially among yesteryear engineers who have not been able to upskill,” Sivaram said.At a macro level, the IT hiring market is in itself in a slowdown, he said. “The ongoing job displacement is also playing out now due to over-hiring that happened in the 2021-22 pandemic cycle. And, therefore, organisations are looking at thinning their teams through AI automation wherever possible.”ET had previously reported that the big tech pack of ‘FAAMNG’ companies in India are in a near hiring pause amid the macroeconomic headwinds and global layoffs.These companies — Facebook (Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) — registered a 90% drop in active job postings in India so far in 2023 compared with last year, according to data put together for ET by Xpehno. In fact, the combined current job postings by these companies at 200 is just 2% of what usually is the number in India.Cumulatively, the top four Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro — have cut down their headcount by 37,299 over the past two quarters. This compares to an addition of 81,678 jobs during the first half of fiscal 2023.Vikram Ahuja, CEO of hiring solutions provider Talent500, said IT support services and routine software development have started to see a change in opportunities. “Organisations have started to explore chatbots and customer support products which will help them drive higher productivity and conversion,” he said.Conversely, AI has positively impacted sectors such as advanced tech (AI development, machine learning), healthcare (AI-assisted diagnostics) and finance (algorithmic trading, fraud detection), he added.Munira Loliwala, assistant vice president (strategy and growth), TeamLease Digital, said the need for reskilling 16 million employees will also create more than 4.7 million new opportunities by 2027, across manufacturing, retail, education, finance & insurance. The manufacturing sector alone is expected to add nearly 1 million new tech jobs led by AI.“Roles in application developers, data analysts and platform owners will be the most sought-after skills … Slightly over 50% of these roles are expected to fall in manufacturing, retail / consumer and healthcare sectors that involve substantial amounts of repetitive work that lends itself to automation. Followed by farming, education and finance,” she said.","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) physicians and researchers are applying artificial intelligence (AI) in innovative ways to advance clinical care and scientific understanding of these cutting-edge tools. Some examples of the use of AI are included here but other new examples are being developed and tested.
VUMC recently began testing AI for assisting health care documentation with a 10-physician pilot involving a system called DAX Copilot, from Nuance, a Microsoft subsidiary.
DAX Copilot is an AI-powered, voice-enabled system designed to automate the creation of clinical notes. The program listens to patient encounters and leverages generative AI to generate real-time, comprehensive clinic visit notes with appropriate headings and context. These notes are then made available immediately for clinician review and editing, integrating directly into VUMC’s electronic health record system.
Dara Mize, MD, MS
A key aspect of AI-assisted documentation is its potential to alleviate physician burnout while improving patient interactions, said the leader spearheading the pilot, Dara Mize, MD, MS, assistant professor of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine and Chief Medical Information Officer for VUMC.
“Generative AI shows promise in improving both the quality and efficiency of health care documentation. The upcoming pilot marks a significant step in VUMC’s exploration of AI’s potential in streamlining clinician workflows and enhancing medical record-keeping while reducing time spent on documentation,” Mize said.
The initial pilot will involve physicians from the Division of General Internal Medicine and Public Health and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. The Medical Center may evaluate additional AI-powered documentation assistants, Mize said, and these tests could expand to involve faculty in other divisions and departments.
“This continues VUMC’s commitment to identifying and integrating leading health care technologies for quality, safety, and an enhanced patient/provider experience,” Mize said.
For research, VUMC has created a version of OpenAI’s large language model which is deployed inside of VUMC’s Azure tenant and is available to VUMC’s researchers. The VUMC-hosted graphical user interface (GUI) supports common prompt and response features.
Researchers can experiment using this interface as an alternative to the public version of ChatGPT which is disabled on VUMC’s networks. The Chat playground provides more controls than the public chat interface from OpenAI.
Unlike the public version of ChatGTP, VUMC retains control over all data submitted to aiChat. aiChat is HIPAA certified and its use is covered under VUMC’s Business Associates Agreement with Microsoft.
“Health IT worked closely with leaders in the Department of Biomedical Informatics to create a platform for the VUMC community to safely explore large language models,” said Travis Osterman, DO, MS, Associate Vice President for Research Informatics and associate chief medical information officer for VUMC.
More information about generative AI can be found at the Office of Research On the Horizon Town Hall Series (https://www.vumc.org/oor/horizon-series). Researchers can test aiChat at https://aichat.app.vumc.org/ (on campus or vpn required).
The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) was an early adopter of using AI to help schedule treatment for patients with cancer. In 2019 VICC implemented the LeanTaaS iQueue system to reduce patient wait times in infusion centers, assist with nurse scheduling, and improve throughput. The iQueue platform collects actual infusion times for various treatments and leverages AI to recommend the optimal infusion appointment for patients.
“Use of the LeanTaaS iQueue for Infusion product has helped TVC 2 Infusion achieve a 50% reduction in median patient wait time, while increasing our average patient hours by 10%. Our scheduled is now level-loaded throughout the day, leading to significantly fewer bottlenecks, increased patient satisfaction, and increased nurse satisfaction,” said Cody Stansel, MSN, RN, administrative director of Nursing for VICC.
“Patients typically feel that their wait times are more reasonable and that they can get in and get their treatment faster. Our nursing staff are enabled to take their breaks on time and no longer feel the pressure caused by a consistent lobby full of patients waiting to be seen.”
As another example of AI adoption at VUMC, RapidAI is also currently being used to assist the VUMC Stroke Team in evaluating patients with stroke. These tools deliver quantified and color-coded CT perfusion maps that help physicians quickly assess salvageable brain tissue — enabling faster clinical decisions that facilitate better patient outcomes (https://www.rapidai.com/rapid-ctp).
In addition to deploying commercial AI applications, VUMC also has a history of developing its own. For instance, in 2014 Vikram Tiwari, PhD, MBA, associate professor of Anesthesiology and Biomedical Informatics, William R. Furman, and Warren Sanberg, MD, PhD, chair of the Department of Anesthesiology and professor of Biomedical Informatics, developed an AI tool to predict elective surgical case volume that is still used today. Their work is published in the journal Anesthesia.
Developing elective schedules allows anesthesiologists to predict final case volumes weeks in advance. After implementation, overly high or low-volume days are revealed in advance, allowing nursing, ancillary service, and anesthesia managers to proactively fine-tune staffing to match demand.

There is a serious concern that with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), entry-level job seekers are doomed. However, the more I’ve spoken with employers across the continent, it has become clear that we are not dealing with an AI problem. Instead, we’re dealing with a change in investment philosophy that is leading to a shift in the fundamental strategy behind technology’s rapid growth.Employees are expressing sweeping concerns about the impact of AI on their jobs. We’re seeing new terms like FOBO, or fear of becoming obsolete, enter our lexicon. It’s natural to feel this way. In fact, 74 per cent of Canadian (both employed and unemployed) job seekers do, expressing concern that generative AI may replace them. This concern has only escalated with the incessant layoffs that have plagued the tech sector.

The recent firing and subsequent re-hiring of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sparked conversations about the potential consequences of superintelligent systems. This fall, the federal government launched a voluntary code of conduct for the responsible use of AI. In the U.S., President Joe Biden recently issued an executive order for AI, in part to mitigate the harms of AI for workers and address job displacement. While prudent, most of this will be addressing future iterations of AI, as the reality is that AI is not taking people’s jobs ... yet. There is no denying that companies are trying it as a job replacement, but up until now it has been relatively unsuccessful. The reason they are trying this hard is the fundamental shift in how technology companies grow and value themselves — from the startup to the enterprise stage.

Let’s take a step back.The reality is that AI has the potential to boost productivity. At the beginning of the pandemic, investors heavily funded tech companies with the expectation of rapid growth, prioritizing expansion and speed over profitability. If AI had arrived during that period, we would be talking about the potential to accelerate company builds, not the threat to junior jobs. Instead, companies entered a talent war and hired an abundance of employees at inflated salaries.Since then, a number of factors, underscored by rising interest rates, have shifted investment strategies. Companies previously valued at $100 million missed a couple of targets and almost immediately were pressured to turn a profit to justify that valuation. That pressure to achieve profit is what led to a rapid increase of layoffs in 2023 and will likely lead to more in 2024. Companies had to rightsize on a new standard.Over the past decade, a combination of low-interest rates, consumer confidence and a growing pool of educated professionals encouraged a healthy business ecosystem. This environment incentivized tech companies to take business risks that they are now struggling with, and there is an increased urgency for companies to deliver profitability. This change in philosophy means there’s not a lot of room for hiring, and what’s left is a massive group of people on the market. Amazon, Google and Shopify are not going bankrupt. They laid people off because they needed to drive more profitability. It’s as simple as that.The tides have shifted. Don’t get lost at sea.This is where AI comes into play. AI is a powerful tool that has the ability to streamline administrative tasks and simplify decision-making. The reconciliation tech companies now face between growth and profit offers the opportunity to re-evaluate business models and focus on achieving profitability, while harnessing the technology’s potential.Many companies can’t afford to hire right now, but if they use AI, maybe they’ll be more productive. They’re not using AI to replace juniors, they’re simply using AI to get the most out of the teams they currently have and hit inflated goals. The important thing to keep in mind is that there are still more roles than people with the talent to fulfil them. This overcorrection has led to an abundance of talent searching for homes while companies are under pressure to not hire, but that will change, because it’s not sustainable.

The importance of entry-level jobs cannot be overstated. Schools and training can provide the skills necessary to succeed in the job, but to meet the talent needs of the next decade, there will be a need for a constant influx of talent. As the backbone of all industries, the entry-level market provides individuals with a pathway to gain experience and develop skills. A healthy job market relies on varying degrees of seniority to succeed.Entry-levels jobs are here to say — just not in the way they have been existing. Technology companies will need to continue acclimating to the demands of innovation, and juniors will have to pivot to new territory. But, at the end of the day, AI is not yet useful without humans attached to it. Instead, we should all watch how the change in investment and tech growth philosophy impacts innovation and the job market.

Rapid use of Generative AI, the emergence of a new blended workforce of humans and digital workers, and increasing employee fear of being obsolete (FOBO), together prove what Intel co-founder Gordon Moore (and the author of Moore’s Law) said, at any given point in time, “change has never been this fast and will never be this slow ever again.”


Resiliency, agility, and adopting a “test and learn approach” will mark the winning strategies for 2024.

As I have done in in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,  2022, and 2023, here is my countdown of what you should include on your HR roadmap for 2024.



1. Generative AI Will Be Your New Work Buddy
PROMOTED
In 2024, Generative AI will shake up how we think about what work we do and what we delegate to our new “work buddy.” This will be the year of specialized AI powered assistants working side by side with humans. Teachers will get a copilot for homework grading, such as Class Companion. Architects will get an AI assistant for design, SketchPro, and online learners studying at Kahn Academy will be able to access Kahnmigo to aid in brainstorming helping them to become better writers and learners while decreasing a teacher’s administrative workload.
Walmart launched one of the largest AI powered work buddies, called My Assistant, an AI powered app to help Walmart’s 50,000 corporate employees be more productive in summarizing long documents, creating new content, and taking over routine tasks that humans did in the past. Microsoft’s Co-Pilot, soon to launch, will integrate generative AI into Microsoft 365, allowing workers to perform at a much higher level. Jared Spataro, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, believes Microsoft Co-Pilot will transform meetings from a point in time and place to a knowledge object. This means employees working with Microsoft Co-Pilot will not only be able to create a summary of the meeting, but also use Co-Pilot to query the group’s sentiment on the meeting topic, the dissenting opinions, who the key dissenters were, and the agreed-to next steps. While these AI powered work buddies can boost efficiency and performance, it will be up to humans to have a strategy to capitalize on their potential.

2. Generative AI Will Impact How Managers Lead 
Generative AI has evolved to one of the fastest adopted technologies, with nearly 200 million users of ChatGPT since it launched on November 30, 2022. Business and HR leaders are struggling with how to keep pace with rapid adoption in the workplace. The impact on managers is not simply in training employees on how to use Generative AI, but also in helping managers lead teams of humans and digital workers. Morgan Stanley estimates Generative AI technologies will likely affect a quarter of all occupations that exist today, and this will rise to 44% within three years. To address this, companies and education providers need to provide training on how to use Generative AI. Within the next three years, this will translate into a $16 billion market for re-skilling workers displaced by Generative AI.

As Generative AI becomes increasingly adept at problem solving, it will be up to managers to get better at problem finding. Managers will be working side-by-side with their human and digital teams to foster a culture of continuous learning while leaning into their uniquely human skills, such as relationship building, communications, and collaboration. One thing is certain: Generative AI will drive organizational change, impact workflows, automate some jobs, and create new ones. But it will always be humans augmented by machines that will create innovation.

3. The Fear of Obsolescence Will Force Companies to Increase Spending in Career Development & Mobility 
While employers see the promise of increased productivity using Generative AI, a recent survey by EY reports that 75% of employees are concerned AI will make certain jobs obsolete, and two-thirds say they fear AI will replace their job. This fear of being obsolete is causing employees to seek out training in using Generative AI and acquiring new skills to better deal with their fears. PwC announced a $1 billion investment in training its workers on AI with courses on topics such as the ethics of AI, responsible use of AI, and how to create AI prompts to generate the best results. Their goal is to engage 75,000 U.S. PwC employees to both enroll and complete these courses.
In addition to training employees on how to use Generative AI, there is an explosion of new internal talent marketplaces as companies continue to find it difficult to successfully recruit external talent. Internal talent marketplaces have become the de facto way companies connect employees with internal career opportunities and resources to grow in their careers. For example, Grow at Key is KeyBank’s AI powered employee-led, and manager supported talent platform to support internal talent mobility. Launched with the vision that every employee can be the CEO of her own career, Grow at Key provides a range of resources, from matching employees to new job roles to accessing mentoring, coaching, and stretch assignments. To date, there has been a 60% increase in employees engaging in training programs and one in three KeyBank employees have enrolled in an Investing in My Development session to prepare them for understanding how to better manage their careers.
4. Hybrid Work Environments Are Good for Business 
Companies need to stop debating the merits of hybrid work and realize this is the new way of working for many knowledge workers as we enter 2024. An ADP survey of 32,000 workers reports that 64% of workers would consider quitting if asked to return to the office full time. Recent research shows companies that allow choice and a remote first/hybrid work environment have revenue growth four times faster than their peers who are more stringent about office attendance. This research conducted by Boston Consulting Group and Scoop Technologies Inc. among 554 public companies employing 26.7 million people, found that “fully flexible” firms — which are either completely remote or allow employees to choose when they come to an office — increased sales 21% between 2020 and 2022, on an industry-adjusted basis. The better growth rates for more remote-friendly companies reflects their ability to hire faster and from a wider geographic area, along with higher rates of employee retention.
As hybrid work becomes the norm, leaders must have a plan to combat proximity bias, or the phenomenon of favoring in-person workers for career development, mentoring, and stretch assignments at the expense of those who work remotely. Hybrid work environments “work” when leaders ensure they are equitable for all and grant autonomy for individual leaders to determine when and where work happens, rather than follow a CEO mandate. Leaders must remember presence in the office does not equate to performance, so they need to shift from “managing by walking around,” to “managing by connecting across geographies.”
5. The Workforce Is a Blend of Full-time Employees, Part-Timers, Contingent Workers, and Digital Workers 
Remember when the blended workforce was simply a distinction between full-time workers and part-time workers. Today’s work now gets accomplished by a blend of full-time workers, part-timers, teams of contractors, contingent workers, and digital workers, the later designed to augment some tasks of human labor. In fact, Statista reports a growth in all sectors except full-time workers, with part-timers (growing from 20 million in 1990 to 26 million in 2022) and contingent workers forecast to be half of the US workforce by 2027.
This blended workforce is not a new concept; it’s been around for decades. What’s different now is that a greater percentage of key jobs are performed by contingent workers. Overall, we are starting to see upwards of 30% to 50% of a global organization’s total workforce composed of contingent workers. MIT Sloan Management Review  reported that the Novartis workforce includes 110,000 full time employees plus 50,000 contractors and temporary workers. Cisco has 83,000 full time employees and 50,000 plus contingent workers of various types. This new workforce ecosystem requires a new set of management practices, and leadership approaches, especially as 81% of companies in a recent HBR Analytical Services survey report that contingent workers are important to their organization, but only 38% say that their organization is effective at managing them.
Leaders will need to acknowledge they will have more types of contributors—human and digital, full time, part time and contingent—that must seamlessly work together. What is needed is a total workforce strategy where HR plays a central role in coordinating all the cross-functional disciplines that hire internal and external workers.
6. The Four Day Work Week is Desired by Both Front-line and Knowledge Workers 
Many of the assumptions we have about how we work, when we work, the needs of our workers, the demographics of the workforce, and where we work have been changed forever. One of the major changes, as we move into 2024, is our assumptions about a five-day work week. All workers, including both frontline and knowledge workers, want flexibility in when they work. Research conducted among 1,301 workers found 41% of both front-line workers and knowledge workers want flexibility in when they work, and 56% of front-line workers and 69% of knowledge workers want the ability to opt for a 4-day work week with no pay reduction.
As I wrote in my Forbes column, the UK four-day work week pilot was conducted among 61 companies and found 56% intend to continue trying the four-day week citing benefits of increased productivity and decreased employee attrition. These UK companies adopted the 80-100-100 model of flexible working: a drop in hours to 80% of their standard work week, while retaining 100% pay and 100% productivity.
Experiments on a shortened work week are also occurring in the US. For example, several Chick-Fil-A stores are allowing front-line workers the opportunity to work 13 hour shifts for three consecutive days with full pay. The results so far have been increased retention while maintaining customer service efficiencies.
However, it’s important to remember the three- or four-day work week is not a one size fits all solution. Companies should adopt a “test and learn approach,” focusing on the type and magnitude of changes required to allow for a shortened work week, the level of employee and manager training needed, and the type of well-being support required for new ways of working.
7. Cognitive Skills Will Increase in Importance as Generative AI Gains Traction 
The World Economic Forum estimates that 44% of a workers’ core skills are expected to change in the next five years. While there are endless lists of the most important skills for the future, World Economic Forum identifies five core skills that will increase in importance in the next five years. This are shown in Figure 1 as:Figure 1: Top Five Skills Gaining in Importance For Future of Work Jeanne Meister LLC
Cognitive skills are growing in importance, reflecting the increased demand for creative and analytical thinking in the age of AI. This combined with technological literacy, the third fastest growing skill along with the skills of resilience, flexibility, curiosity, and lifelong learning are evidence that leaders will continue to emphasize a culture of lifelong learning. As Generative AI gains traction, one skill I see that is foundational to all of them is the ability to be digitally curious, meaning seeking out and using new and emerging digital technologies to enhance one’s cognitive skills. I think about the past few years where some of the new technologies I have used include Mural, an online visual collaborative tool, StreamYard, a live streaming studio, and ChatGPT 4.0 and Pictory, to create a new video entitled, Flexible Work for All. This is the start of building my digital curiosity muscle, trying out these platforms and seeing what they might mean for enhancing my work.
8. Holistic Financial Well-being Is The Must Have Benefit for 2024
Financial well-being among workers is eroding. LendingClub reports 61% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck and lack a core set of financial literacy skills, and over half of workers earning $100,000 are living paycheck to paycheck. 
Unifi, a leader in aviation services with more than 23,000 employees, became aware of this two years ago and created a new offering for frontline workers to access their earned wages on-demand.  Since then, this has grown beyond early access to wages to a holistic financial well-being offering with almost 20% frontline workforce enrolled and taking advantage of free services including anonymous financial coaching and customizable saving plans. Dr. Archana Arcot, Chief People Officer at Unifi, believes that, “the major driver of this program is to relieve an employee’s financial stress and make financial wellness part of their everyday life.”
MetLife reports nearly half of workers surveyed cited financial concerns as the cause of poorer mental health. To address this, Unifi adopted a Goal Based Savings program which resulted in the company moving to the top 1% with a total amount saved of $10,000+ YTD, as reported by Payactiv. By offering holistic financial well-being programs, companies like Unifi can not only enhance their employee experience but build financial wellness into their employer value proposition and be better able to attract talent in a tight labor market.
9. The Sexy C-Suite Job For 2024 Is Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer 
While we have seen a myriad of new C-suite job roles in the past decade—from Chief Medical Officer to Chief Ethics Officer—the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer is coming at a time when organizations are looking for guidance with how to create guidelines and policies for safe and ethical use of generative AI in the workplace. LinkedIn reports 44% globally and 57% in the U.S. say their organizations don’t have policy guidelines or training for how to use these new tools at work. 
Organizations are starting to appoint a new C-suite player to lead this effort. Research from Foundry, an IDG company, finds 11% of mid-size to large organizations already have an individual with the role of Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer and another 21% of organizations are actively seeking such a person for this role. This role is growing in importance as business leaders develop an AI strategy, create governance practices, and engage cross functional leaders in safe, ethical, and responsible use of generative AI.
A new Wavestone survey of Data and AI leaders found 61.7% report the responsibility for Generative AI is currently part of the Chief Data Officer (CDO) remit. But a growing number of organizations are creating a new role, the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO) to oversee AI developments for their organization. “This will be very much a focus during 2024,” says Randy Bean, Innovation Fellow at Wavestone. 
10. An Organization’s Sustainability Record Will Attract and Retain Talent 
As the talent marketplace continues to be competitive, climate change and sustainability has become one of the defining challenges for current and future generations. A growing number of publicly traded companies, such as Alphabet, Apple, Cisco, and PayPal, have created sustainability annual reports with Alphabet committing its entire $5.57B Sustainability Bond to support environmentally and socially responsible projects such as clean energy, clean transportation, and circular economy design.
A company’s sustainability record is proving to make a difference in talent acquisition and retention. Research by IBM Institute for Business Value, found 70% of workers and those in the job market, are drawn to environmentally sustainable employers. And almost half of these workers said they would take a lower salary to work for environmentally and socially responsible organizations. Gartner predicts employers will respond by promoting climate change protections, such as offering employees shelter during natural disasters, as part of employee benefit offerings.
In addition, a growing number of universities are building ambitious goals to integrate sustainability into their curriculum, campus operations, and endowment. The University of Toronto, placing first out of 1,400 universities in environmental and social impact, is making headway to de-carbonize its campus by 2050, developing new energy efficient student centers, and committing to climate responsible construction.
The Global Business School Network, a network of 150 global business schools in 50 countries, has several new initiatives for universities to share sustainability “next practices.” While companies and universities are each addressing sustainability, I see the need for greater collaboration among them, as both employees and students weigh the environmental impact of their employer and university. Sustainability is both a business and educational issue requiring joint corporate and university solutions.

That's what Matthew Candy, IBM's global managing partner for generative AI, told Fortune in a recent interview. Candy said that AI would make it possible for anyone with an idea to create products without having to code. ""The speed at which people will be able to come up with an idea, to test the idea, to make something, it's going to be so accelerated,"" Candy said in the story. ""You don't need to have a degree in computer science to do that,"" he added. Instead of technical skills, Candy said that soft skills like creativity and innovation would be more valuable in the age of AI. ""Questioning, creativity skills, and innovation are going to be hugely important because I think AI's going to free up more capacity for creative thought processes,"" he told the publication earlier. But it's not just the tech industry that will be affected by AI. Candy said that AI image-generation technology could also transform the arts. ""You're going to be able to take on the role of a designer. You don't need to be a graphic designer and have an art degree to do these things,"" he said. Even as tech executives are welcoming the AI wave, the outlook of other working professionals is not as positive. A recent report by edtech startup Hero Vired revealed that 82% of professionals fear job redundancy amid AI advancement. In fact, back in May of last year, IBM itself said they were considering a freeze on hiring people for jobs that AI could potentially do instead. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a Bloomberg interview that he sees 30% of the company’s back-office roles getting replaced by AI over a five-year period, which roughly amounted to over 7,800 positions. &nbsp;","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,,,,,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-23,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/matthew-candy-ibm-featured.jpg', 'caption': 'Creativity and innovation are the new skills for the AI era, says IBM&#039;s generative AI boss.

More than a third of state agencies are using AI. Texas is beginning to examine its potential impact.



Amid fears that AI could heighten bias or affect privacy, the state is forming an advisory committee to recommend how the technology is deployed. “We’re gonna have to set up some rules,” the committee’s founder says.

When the Texas Workforce Commission became inundated with jobless claims in March 2020, it turned to artificial intelligence.
Affectionately named for the agency’s former head Larry Temple, who had died a year earlier, “Larry” the chatbot was designed to help Texans sign up for unemployment benefits.
Like a next generation FAQ page, Larry would field user-generated questions about unemployment cases. Using AI language processing, the bot would determine which answer prewritten by human staff would best fit the user’s unique phrasing of the question. The chatbot answered more than 21 million questions before being replaced by Larry 2.0 last March.
Larry is one example of the ways artificial intelligence has been used by state agencies. Adaptation of the technology in state government has grown in recent years. But that acceleration has also sparked fears of unintended consequences like bias, loss of privacy or losing control of the technology. This year, the Legislature committed to taking a more active role in monitoring how the state is using AI.

“This is going to totally revolutionize the way we do government,” said state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, who wrote a bill aimed at helping the state make better use of AI technology.
In June, Gov. Greg Abbott signed that bill, House Bill 2060, into law, creating an AI advisory council to study and take inventory of the ways state agencies currently utilize AI and assess whether the state needs a code of ethics for AI. The council’s role in monitoring what the state is doing with AI does not involve writing final policy.
Artificial intelligence describes a class of technology that emulates and builds upon human reasoning through computer systems. The chatbot uses language processing to understand users' questions and match it to predetermined answers. New tools such as ChatGPT are categorized as generative AI because the technology generates a unique answer based on a user prompt. AI is also capable of analyzing large data sets and using that information to automate tasks previously performed by humans. Automated decision making is at the center of HB 2060.
More than one third of Texas state agencies are already utilizing some form of artificial intelligence, according to a 2022 report from the Texas Department of Information Resources. The workforce commission also has an AI tool for job seekers that provides customized recommendations of job openings. Various agencies are using AI for translating languages into English and call center tools such as speech-to-text. AI is also used to enhance cybersecurity and fraud detection.





Automation is also used for time-consuming work in order to “increase work output and efficiency,” according to a statement from the Department of Information Resources. One example of this could be tracking budget expenses and invoices. In 2020, DIR launched an AI Center for Excellence aimed at helping state agencies implement more AI technology. Participation in DIR’s center is voluntary, and each agency typically has its own technology team, so the extent of automation and AI deployment at state agencies is not closely tracked.
Right now, Texas state agencies have to verify that the technology they use meets safety requirements set by state law, but there are no specific disclosure requirements on the types of technology or how they are used. HB 2060 will require each agency to provide that information to the AI advisory council by July 2024.
“We want agencies to be creative,” Capriglione said. He favors finding more use cases for AI that go well beyond chat bots, but recognizes there are concerns around poor data quality stopping the system from working as intended: “We’re gonna have to set some rules.”
As adoption of AI has grown, so have worries around the ethics and functionality of the technology. The AI advisory council is the first step toward oversight of how the technology is being deployed. The seven-member council will include a member of the state House and the Senate, an executive director and four individuals appointed by the governor with expertise in AI, ethics, law enforcement and constitutional law.

Samantha Shorey is an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied the social implications of artificial intelligence, particularly the kind designed for increased automation. She is concerned that if technology is empowered to make more decisions, it will replicate and exacerbate social inequality: “It might move us towards the end goal more quickly. But is it moving us towards an end goal that we want?”
Proponents of using more AI view automation as a way to make government work more efficiently. Harnessing the latest technology could help speed up case management for social services, provide immediate summaries of lengthy policy analysis or streamline the hiring and training process for new government employees.
However, Shorey is cautious about the possibility of artificial intelligence being brought into decision-making processes such as determining who qualifies for social service benefits, or how long someone should be on parole. Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department began investigating allegations that a Pennsylvania county’s AI model intended to help improve child welfare was discriminating against parents with disabilities and resulting in their children being taken away.
AI systems “tend to absorb whatever biases there are in the past data,” said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Technology Responsibility at Brown University. Artificial intelligence that is trained on data that includes any kind of gender, religious, race or other bias is at risk of learning to discriminate.

In addition to the problem of flawed data reproducing social inequality, there are also privacy concerns around the technology’s dependence on collecting large amounts of data. What the AI could be doing with that data over time is also driving fears that humans will lose some control over the technology.
“As AI gets more and more complicated, it's very hard to understand how these systems are working, and why they're making decisions the way they do,” Venkatasubramanian said.
That fear is shared by Jason Green-Lowe, executive director at the Center for AI Policy, a group that has lobbied for stricter AI safety in Washington DC. With the accelerating pace of technology and a lack of regulatory oversight, Green-Lowe said, “soon we might find ourselves in a world where AI is mostly steering. … And the world starts to reorient itself to serve the AI's interests rather than human interest.”
Some technical experts, however, are more confident that humans will remain in the driver’s seat of increasing AI deployment. Alex Dimakis, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, worked on the artificial intelligence commission for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

In Dimakis’ view, AI systems should be transparent and subject to independent evaluation known as red teaming, a process in which the underlying data and decision-making process of the technology are scrutinized by multiple experts to determine if more robust safety measures are necessary.
“You cannot hide behind AI,” Dimakis said. Beyond transparency and evaluation, Dimakis said the state should enforce existing laws against whoever created the AI in any case where the technology produces an outcome that violates the law: “apply the existing laws without being confused that an AI system is in the middle.”
The AI advisory council will submit its findings and recommendations to the Legislature by December 2024. In the meantime, interest is growing in deploying AI at all levels of government. DIR operates an artificial intelligence user group made up of representatives from state agencies, higher education and local government interested in implementing AI.
Interest in the user group is growing by the day, according to a DIR spokesperson. The group has more than 300 members representing more than 85 different entities.

Truth be told, human resources are still needed. For instance, it is a known truth that many people lost their employment when industrial organisations began to use automation. It’s also true, though, that humans were required to run those automated devices. The difference is that the task that was previously completed by five persons is now being completed by one person.Top Videos View AllSwipe Left For Next VideoPiyush Raj Akhouri, managing partner of BridgeNTech and Hire++ Technology, which uses AI for hiring and staffing, says that AI will lead to job loss but at the same time, it will create new job opportunities. According to Akhouri, people will have to skill themselves for AI and those who can do so will find themselves in a better position than before.Piyush says that AI will mainly eliminate human intervention in tasks that are very repetitive, for example, security checking or similar designing.

Sam Fleming in DavosJanuary 15 202488Print this pageUnlock the Editor’s Digest for freeRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.A quarter of global chief executives expect the deployment of generative artificial intelligence to lead to headcount reductions of at least 5 per cent this year, according to a survey unveiled as world and business leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland.Industries led by media and entertainment, banking, insurance and logistics were most likely to predict job losses because of cutting-edge AI tools, according to the poll of top directors conducted by PwC ahead of this week’s World Economic Forum. Engineering and construction firms were least likely to anticipate cuts because of automation, alongside technology companies. Some 46 per cent of those surveyed said they expect the use of generative AI — systems that can spew out humanlike text, images and code in seconds — to boost profitability in the next 12 months, the survey added. However, 47 per cent said the technology will deliver little or no change. The findings, based on interviews with 4,702 company chiefs spread across 105 countries, point to the far-reaching impacts that AI models are expected to have on economies and societies, a topic that will feature prominently at the annual meetings. Executives at the forefront of AI, including Sam Altman, the recently reinstalled chief of OpenAI, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft are among those slated to attend. While many economists say they expect AI to lead to productivity gains as it becomes more pervasive, it will also lead to workforce upheaval. The PwC survey showed that a rising share of executives envisage strengthening economic growth in 2024, but at the same time are exercised by the need to respond to revolutionary developments including generative AI and climate change.“As business leaders are becoming less concerned about macroeconomic challenges, they are becoming more focused on the disruptive forces within their industries,” said Bob Moritz, global chair of PwC.“Whether it is accelerating the rollout of generative AI or building their businesses to address the challenges and opportunities of the climate transition, this is a year of transformation.”A growing number of executives are planning to deploy generative AI in the coming months, the survey showed, after 32 per cent reported they had adopted it across their company in the past year. Some 58 per cent said they expect it to improve the quality of their products or services in the next 12 months, while 69 per cent said their employees will need to learn new skills. Last year Goldman Sachs predicted that the latest breakthroughs in AI could lead to the automation of a quarter of the work done in the US and eurozone, while sparking a productivity boom that will eventually lift annual gross domestic product around the world by 7 per cent over a decade. When it comes to risks stemming from AI, the PwC survey showed executives are most worried about cyber security and the spread of disinformation. In the shorter term, the study pointed to receding anxiety about the broader outlook, with less than a quarter of directors reporting that their firm is “highly/extremely” exposed to the threat of inflation, a steep drop from last year’s 40 per cent reading. Some 38 per cent thought the global economy will enjoy better fortunes this year, double the 18 per cent who responded similarly in 2023. This is well below the optimism for growth that accompanied the ending of Covid lockdowns in previous years. The findings reflect hopes that the worst of the inflationary upsurge that hit economies from 2021 onwards has now passed, and comes amid investor speculation that central banks led by the US Federal Reserve will start cutting policy rates as soon as this spring. Of all the regions covered by the PwC survey, executives in Asia and North America were least concerned about inflation, with around 20 per cent reporting they are extremely or highly exposed to price growth, PwC said. Those in Africa were among those most anxious about how vulnerable their companies were to spiking prices. Nevertheless, inflation and macroeconomic volatility trumped other threats, according to the survey, ahead of cyber risks, geopolitical volatility and climate change.

We are on the brink of a technological revolution that  could jumpstart
productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the  world. Yet
it could also replace jobs and deepen inequality.


The rapid advance of artificial intelligence has captivated  the world,
causing both excitement and alarm, and raising important questions  about
its potential impact on the global economy. The net effect is difficult  to
foresee, as AI will ripple through economies in complex ways. What we can
say with some confidence is that we will need to come up with a set of
policies  to safely leverage the vast potential of AI for the benefit of humanity.


Reshaping the Nature of Work

In a new analysis, IMF staff examine the  potential impact
of AI on the global labor market. Many studies have predicted  the
likelihood that jobs will be replaced by AI. Yet we know that in many cases
AI is likely to complement human work. The IMF analysis captures both these
forces.


The findings are striking: almost 40 percent of global  employment is
exposed to AI. Historically, automation and information  technology have
tended to affect routine tasks, but one of the things that sets  AI apart is
its ability to impact high-skilled jobs. As a result, advanced  economies
face greater risks from AI—but also more opportunities to leverage  its
benefits—compared with emerging market and developing economies.


In advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs may be  impacted by AI.
Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration,  enhancing
productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key  tasks
currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to
lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these
jobs  may disappear.


In emerging markets and low-income countries, by  contrast, AI exposure is
expected to be 40 percent and 26 percent,  respectively. These findings
suggest emerging market and developing economies  face fewer immediate
disruptions from AI. At the same time, many of these  countries don’t have
the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the  benefits of AI,
raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen  inequality
among nations.


AI could also affect income and wealth inequality within  countries. We may
see polarization within income brackets, with workers who can  harness AI
seeing an increase in their productivity and wages—and those who  cannot
falling behind. Research shows that AI can help less experienced
workers enhance their productivity more quickly. Younger workers may find it
easier to exploit opportunities, while older workers could struggle to
adapt.


The effect on labor income will largely depend on the  extent to which AI
will complement high-income workers. If AI significantly  complements
higher-income workers, it may lead to a disproportionate increase  in their
labor income. Moreover, gains in productivity from firms that adopt AI  will
likely boost capital returns, which may also favor high earners. Both of
these phenomena could exacerbate inequality.


In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall  inequality, a troubling
trend that policymakers must proactively address to  prevent the technology
from further stoking social tensions. It is crucial for  countries to
establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining  programs
for vulnerable workers. In doing so, we can make the AI transition  more
inclusive, protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality.


An Inclusive AI-Driven World


AI is being integrated into businesses around the world  at remarkable
speed, underscoring the need for policymakers to act.


To help countries craft the right policies, the IMF has  developed an AI
Preparedness Index that measures readiness in areas such as  digital
infrastructure, human-capital and labor-market policies, innovation and
economic integration, and regulation and ethics.


The human-capital and labor-market policies component,  for example,
evaluates elements such as years of schooling and job-market  mobility, as
well as the proportion of the population covered by social safety  nets. The
regulation and ethics component assesses the adaptability to digital
business models of a country’s legal framework and the presence of strong
governance for effective enforcement.


Using the index, IMF staff assessed the readiness of 125  countries. The
findings reveal that wealthier economies, including advanced and  some
emerging market economies, tend to be better equipped for AI adoption than
low-income countries, though there is considerable variation across
countries.  Singapore, the United States and Denmark posted the highest
scores on the  index, based on their strong results in all four categories
tracked.


Guided by the insights from the AI Preparedness Index,  advanced economies
should prioritize AI innovation and integration while  developing robust
regulatory frameworks. This approach will cultivate a safe  and responsible
AI environment, helping maintain public trust. For emerging  market and
developing economies, the priority should be laying a strong  foundation
through investments in digital infrastructure and a digitally  competent
workforce.


The AI era is upon us, and it is still within our power  to ensure it brings
prosperity for all.

But It Will Change How You WorkAdobe Stock
When you read or listen to anything about generative AI and its impact on jobs, it's often a story of job losses. Massive waves of job losses as more and more tasks are given over to machines.

But the truth is more complicated – and more optimistic – than that. Because, rather than job displacement, the biggest impact of generative AI is likely to be job augmentation. In this article, we’ll look at what that means in practice and help you uncover how your own job might be impacted.




Generative AI Is Accelerating Automation
There is no doubt about it: generative AI tools like ChatGPT are accelerating the wider trend for AI-driven automation. A 2023 McKinsey report found that, by 2030, activities that add up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated. That’s a pretty big chunk, and yet, some jobs will be more affected than others.

PROMOTED
If we look at Indeed’s 2023 AI At Work report, the findings suggest that roughly 20 percent of jobs could be considered “highly exposed” to generative AI automation – meaning the technology is considered good or excellent at 80 percent or more of all skills for that job. At the other end of the scale, 34 percent of jobs were “low or minimally” exposed – but even that means that generative AI is good or excellent at up to 50 percent of the work.
In other words, almost every job will be impacted by generative AI to some extent. Some jobs will cease to exist, but many more will be augmented or altered by AI tools. And, of course, new jobs will be created, just as they have before in previous waves of transformation.

Customer service representative is a job that faces one of the highest risks of being displaced thanks to generative AI. Many customer service tasks are already automated through chatbots – and this will only increase. ChatGPT, for example, is far more impressive than your average customer service chatbot and is getting better all the time. Looking ahead, generative AI chatbots will routinely talk to customers and help them solve their problems.

But even in this highly exposed field, it doesn’t mean everyone who works in customer service is on a one-way route to redundancy. While many tasks within customer service can be automated, there will still be scenarios that require the human touch. Complex issues, sensitive topics, or situations requiring empathy and judgment will always be better handled by humans. Most likely, then, the role of customer service representative will evolve, with a smaller group of humans working alongside AI tools. In this scenario, humans will oversee AI operations and handle the more complex interactions.

At The Other End Of The Scale: Job Augmentation
What exactly do we mean by “job augmentation”? Augmentation means that rather than human workers being replaced by generative AI systems, job roles will adapt to incorporate generative AI. Indeed, many jobs – including knowledge work and creative roles – will increasingly integrate generative AI tools.
For the most part, this will mean automating certain tasks that are repeatable and straightforward – the sort of work that doesn’t really require the human touch. This allows people to focus their time and effort on aspects that require uniquely human skills.
Teaching, for example, is a role that will always need the human touch. A good teacher’s ability to inspire young minds and really connect with students is special. But can teachers use generative AI to help streamline lesson planning? Absolutely. Similarly, doctors can use generative AI tools to interpret medical images or generate medical notes more quickly, freeing up more time for patient care. Lawyers can use generative AI to automate certain research and contract analysis tasks. And software developers can use generative AI to automate parts of the code creation and testing process.

So What About Your Job?
I’d advise anyone to take a good, long look at their job to see which parts of the role are exposed to automation and which require the human touch. A good starting point is to ask yourself questions like:
· How does my work add value?
· Which of my tasks can be automated?
· And, importantly, how can I use generative AI to add greater value/deliver a better service/do a better job?
That last question is crucial. Because this process isn’t just about assessing your level of risk – it’s about finding new ways to do your job better and easier by tapping into generative AI tools.
And if you find that your job is highly exposed to automation, ask yourself, how would you like to add value in the world? To put it another way, what would you rather be doing? In her book Next! The Power of Reinvention in Life and Work, Joanne Lipman sets out a four-step reinvention road map that helps people transition to a new way of working and/or living:
· Search: this stage is about identifying the information and experiences that will inform your transition. For example, this could be a side hustle, a hobby, or a topic that you're particularly passionate about.
· Struggle: This stage is where you're starting to disconnect from your previous identity, but perhaps you don't yet know where you're going. We often overlook this stage in favor of the dramatic ""I quit my job, and now I run yoga classes in the woods"" stories. But the truth is, this stage takes time. And it's a struggle, hence the name.
· Stop: This is the thing that finally stops you in your tracks – such as a change in circumstances, or something like a global pandemic, or a decision to quit your job.
· Solution: And in this final stage, the transition is complete.
If there’s one thing I want people to take away from this article, it’s that generative AI isn’t something to fear. Yes, it will bring about job displacement for some people. But it also has the potential to make work better.

Why you can trust Sky News


Artificial intelligence will affect up to 40% of jobs worldwide, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned.This could rise to 60% of roles in advanced economies like the UK - but it is believed that, in half of these cases, AI will benefit the workforce.



In a new report, the IMF warned that AI's consequences for society remain difficult to foresee, but the technology is likely to exacerbate income and wealth inequality.

Will AI mean 'no job is needed'?



Developing economies are much less likely to ""seize"" AI's advantages, fuelling a digital divide and increasing income disparity between countries.Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's managing director, said the world is ""on the brink of a technological revolution that could jumpstart productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world"" - but some could lose their livelihoods as a result.





While automation and IT have often affected routine tasks, she explained that AI is unusual because of its ability to impact well-paid careers.""Jobs that require nuanced judgment, creative problem-solving, or intricate data interpretation - traditionally the domain of highly educated professionals - may now be augmented or even replaced by advanced AI algorithms,"" the IMF report says.

""In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,"" Ms Georgieva warned.The UK is said to be among the countries that is best prepared for the disruption AI will bring - based on digital infrastructure and the education of its workforce.In other developments, the Information Commissioner's Office is launching a consultation to examine how data protection law should apply to the development and use of generative AI apps.It will first examine whether it is lawful to train models such as ChatGPT on personal data scraped from the web.Generative AI technology can be used to create new content including words, pictures, video, computer code and music from scratch, but based on large amounts of data the program has been trained on, much of which is often scraped from internet and fed into the system.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. This could rise to 60% of roles in advanced economies like the UK - but it is believed that, in half of these cases, AI will benefit the workforce. In a new report, the IMF warned that AI's consequences for society remain difficult to foresee, but the technology is likely to exacerbate income and wealth inequality. Developing economies are much less likely to ""seize"" AI's advantages, fuelling a digital divide and increasing income disparity between countries. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's managing director, said the world is ""on the brink of a technological revolution that could jumpstart productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world"" - but some could lose their livelihoods as a result. While automation and IT have often affected routine tasks, she explained that AI is unusual because of its ability to impact well-paid careers. ""Jobs that require nuanced judgment, creative problem-solving, or intricate data interpretation - traditionally the domain of highly educated professionals - may now be augmented or even replaced by advanced AI algorithms,"" the IMF report says.

""In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,"" Ms Georgieva warned. The UK is said to be among the countries that is best prepared for the disruption AI will bring - based on digital infrastructure and the education of its workforce. In other developments, the Information Commissioner's Office is launching a consultation to examine how data protection law should apply to the development and use of generative AI apps. It will first examine whether it is lawful to train models such as ChatGPT on personal data scraped from the web. Generative AI technology can be used to create new content including words, pictures, video, computer code and music from scratch, but based on large amounts of data the program has been trained on, much of which is often scraped from internet and fed into the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sky News LIMITED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"London, UK",,business,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rupert Murdoch'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dan Milmo Global technology editorMon 15 Jan 2024 05.53 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Jan 2024 15.43 ESTShareArtificial intelligence will affect 40% of jobs around the world and it is “crucial” that countries build social safety nets to mitigate the impact on vulnerable workers, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund.AI, the term for computer systems that can perform tasks usually associated with human levels of intelligence, is poised to profoundly change the global economy with advanced economies at greater risk of disruption.Analysis by the IMF, the international lender of last resort, says about 60% of jobs in advanced economies such as the US and UK are exposed to AI and half of these jobs may be negatively affected. But the technology will also help to enhance some humans’ productivity as AI improves their performance, it said.Horrified by Horizon? Then get ready to be totally appalled by AIRead moreAccording to the IMF, the safest highly exposed jobs are those with a “high complementarity” to AI, meaning the technology will assist their work rather than displace it entirely. This includes roles with a high degree of responsibility and interacting with people – such as surgeons, lawyers and judges.High-exposure jobs with “low complementarity” – meaning the potential for being displaced by AI – include telemarketing, or cold-calling people to offer goods or services. Low-exposure occupations include dish washers and performers, the IMF said.AI jobs exposure is 40% in emerging market economies – defined by the IMF as states including China, Brazil and India – and 26% for low-income countries, with an overall total of just under 40%, according to the IMF.Generative AI – the term for technology that can produce highly plausible text, images and even voice from simple hand-typed prompts – has risen up the political agenda since the emergence of tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot.Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF managing director, said AI’s ability to affect highly skilled jobs means that advanced economies face greater risks from the technology. She added that in extreme cases some jobs in major economies could disappear.“Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity,” wrote Georgieva, in a blogpost accompanying the IMF research. “For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labour demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”She added that in most scenarios AI would probably worsen overall inequality across the global economy and could stoke social tensions without political intervention. AI is expected to feature prominently as a topic of discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, which top executives from the tech industry will attend.“It is crucial for countries to establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programmes for vulnerable workers,” Georgieva said. “In doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality.”The IMF analysis shows that higher-wage earners whose jobs have high complementarity with AI can expect an increase in their income, leading to an increase in inequality.“This would amplify the increase in income and wealth inequality that results from enhanced capital returns that accrue to high earners,” the IMF report said. “Countries’ choices regarding the definition of AI property rights, as well as redistributive and other fiscal policies, will ultimately shape its impact on income and wealth distribution.”The report said workers in the UK, with its high proportion of graduates, might be better prepared to switch from jobs at risk of displacement to “high complementarity” jobs, although older workers may struggle to adapt and move to new jobs or retrain.Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, which is the biggest investor in OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, said on Monday there would be jobs in the future but the question remained about what would be “the shape of these jobs”. Speaking at an event hosted by the Chatham House thinktank in London, Nadella said AI could help with “mid-career transitions”. He added: “I think this is the age where this is about expertise at your fingertips. So if anything, anyone can become an expert in anything because you have the AI assistant helping you.”Last year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the occupations at highest risk from AI-driven automation were highly skilled jobs and represented about 27% of employment across its 38 member countries, which include the UK, Japan, Germany, the US, Australia and Canada. It said skilled professions such as law, medicine and finance were most at risk.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)International Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsDavos 2024newsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma AydemirSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggests‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a question on the minds of many workers across industries: “Is generative artificial intelligence (genAI) going to take my job?”
Yes and no, experts say.
There’s no doubt that the technology is set to be the most disruptive in recent history. And, while on the one hand it will disrupt roles well-suited for automation, on the other it will bolster leaders and creatives and lead to entirely new job functions and career opportunities, many experts say..

This transformative technology—which is reshaping nearly every sector—signals a future where mastery of Gen AI could dictate who holds global influence and power.

We have arrived at a crucial junction, magnified by the pandemic and rapid technological advancements. We now face a decision that will shape generations. Do we allow these changes to perpetuate global disparities or find ways to harness them to create a world abundant in opportunities for all?

The development of Gen AI has been predominantly concentrated in the Global North, creating a significant digital divide. This chasm places the Global South at risk of lagging further behind, with two primary challenges: access to Gen AI technology and ensuring its relevance to diverse global populations. In many regions of the Global South, the lack of infrastructure and educational support hinders the full realization of Gen AI's potential. Moreover, the suitability of Gen AI solutions, primarily designed in the tech hubs of the Global North, for the unique challenges of the Global South needs to be investigated.

The world needs a “Global Manhattan Project” for Gen AI in the Global South where the global community collaborates to accomplish one of the most significant events of the 21st century. This initiative would entail nurturing local AI ecosystems and forging global partnerships to encourage technological innovation. Through this, Gen AI could be tailored to revolutionize areas like agriculture in climate-sensitive regions, expand educational access, and strengthen public governance.

The urgency for inclusive Gen AI investment in the Global South cannot be overstated, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic underscored the interconnectedness and vulnerability of our global systems. A haphazard deployment of Gen AI could precipitate a crisis far exceeding the pandemic's impact, exacerbating poverty, widening gender disparities, and undermining democratic institutions.

By ensuring that Gen AI serves the global community, we can harness its immense potential to safeguard existing progress and propel humanity towards a more equitable and resilient future. The challenge is significant, but the potential benefits for our collective prosperity and stability are too substantial to overlook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence may displace very large numbers of workers from their jobs, research published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns.Worldwide, almost 40% of workers are  exposed to the impacts of the technology, Mauro Cazzaniga and colleagues say in a discussion note published on January 14. They say AI’s impact is likely to differ according to workers’ incomes.  They looked at International Labour Organization data on 142 countries.Workers in advanced economies – some 60% –

In the rush to establish technical strategies for making good on the promise of generative AI, many CIOs find themselves running headlong into what may be their most challenging task yet: preparing their organization’s end-users — from knowledge workers and assembly line laborers to doctors, accountants, and lawyers — to co-exist with generative AI.
Although many analysts, thought leaders, vendors, and chief executives view and position large language models (LLMs) and tools such as Microsoft Copilot as assisting rather than replacing workers, the flood of generative AI products that have hit the market and speedy implementation of LLMs in production to perform many human tasks has challenged that argument, outlining a complex relationship between artificially intelligent machines and the humans who must work with them.
Given the disruptive potential of generative AI, the stakes are high, as Reuven Cohen, strategic AI advisor to Baxter International, a Fortune 500 company, points out.
 
 
 













 
 

“The struggle is augmenting your workforce or replace it altogether,” he says. “Step one is likely a question of empowering the most capable people in your organization with highly tailored AI; the next step is removing the less capable altogether.”

But what will be defined as ‘less capable’ will likely be impacted by the technology’s evolution, as well as the evolution of human-machine partnerships wherever the technology is implemented. After all, one increasingly common adage is that generative AI will not replace humans but “humans who are using generative AI will replace humans who are not using generative AI,” as Teradyne CIO Shannon Gath said on a September episode of CIO Leadership Live.
For now, most CIOs are deploying generative AI to enhance productivity and efficiency. Gartner pegs this number at 77% of CIOs. Jamie Holcombe, CIO of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, is one.
 
 
 













 
 

“I consider AI an augmented intelligent tool. I don’t feel you collaborate with a tool — you use it,” Holcombe says. “Our examiners are welcoming the help from AI tools to take away the clerical and administrative functions so they can focus more on thoughtful analytics that cannot be merely programmed.”
Consequently, one of the CIO’s top priorities for 2024 is discovering and uncovering the added value human workers can concretely achieve using LLMs — and much of this remains unknown.
Mike Mason, chief AI officer at Thoughtworks, believes CIOs must remain critical when considering new generative AI tools for their workforces in light of this issue.
 
 
 













 
 

“Even as AI becomes more advanced and integrated into software and everyday tasks, an influx of AI tools is causing confusion among employees,” he says. “CIOs must remember that it is their workforce who will be using this AI technology, and consider the impact of AI on their workforce, ensuring proper management, training, and integration to make the most of their investment.”

The makings of a close partnership
Even as industry luminaries call for caution on AI, most corporate giants, including Goldman Sachs, Fidelity Investments, Procter & Gamble, American Express, Gilead Sciences, and many others, have gone public about developing and deploying LLMs internally to boost productivity and innovation.
At Fidelity, early returns are proving fruitful for cost savings and increased efficiencies, said Vipin Mayar, the finserv’s head of AI innovation, at the Chief AI Officer Summit in Boston in December.
 
 
 













 
 

While he acknowledged LLMs are not on par with human intelligence, Mayar sees the pace of innovation in generative AI as unparalleled. “It’s only been 13 months and it made time nonlinear,” he quipped.
Still, to ensure workers gain the most out of the tools, Mayar suggested multimodal LLMs combining structured datasets and unstructured data should be designed smaller and for specific tasks.
Yvonne Li, vice president of AI, data engineering, and decision science at Advanced Auto Parts, agrees that the technology — and how humans will make use of it — is still in its early stages.
 
 
 













 
 

“Gen AI is not a magic bullet,” she said at the summit. “Gen AI can pull data together and gives data scientists a different lens, but it can’t ideate for us. People are using gen AI for efficiency and as a tool for diagnostic problems.”
Thomson Reuters is one organization targeting gen AI for efficiency. The company recently released a generative AI platform that makes it easier for its developers to create solutions like AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision. Westlaw with generative AI enables legal editors to produce document summarization of legal research in minutes that used to take days or weeks to complete, says Shawn Malhotra, head of engineering at Thomson Reuters.
Thomson Reuters’ legal drafting with Microsoft Copilot, another aspect of the platform, unlocks higher functionality for legal editors as well. But observers say innovations such as these will require CIOs to develop upskilling and governance strategies to ensure employees can benefit from new generative AI implementations, wherever they reside. This is fast becoming crucial, as the push for productivity gains is putting pressure on workers across the enterprise to learn to collaborate with LLMs, many of which remain in pilot testing.
 
 
 













 
 

“LLMs in many ways can and will exceed human capabilities, but I’m a firm believer that AI will continue to augment humans,” says John T. Marcante, US CIO in residence at Deloitte, and former global CIO at Vanguard. “I think AI will be man’s very close companion now and in the future.”
To ensure an amicable relationship, Marcante stresses the importance of considering stakeholder workflows when implementing generative AI.
“It’s important to remember that using AI to accelerate an outdated or onerous process could be the wrong answer. More benefit may come from a process or technology improvement instead of broad application of AI to ‘fix’ problems,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

Changing how work gets done
Evolutions in the technology, as well as its use, are sure to transform how workers make the most of the tools over time.

At CES this week, Accenture released a public statement that generative AI tools are more “human by design,” pointing to refined conversational user interfaces, robots that respond to English commands, and software that augments how humans work naturally, such as Adobe Photoshop’s Generative Fill and Expand features.
Late last year, Gartner kicked off its annual IT Symposium/Xpo detailing how generative AI is revolutionizing the human-machine relationship.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s more than just a technology or a business trend. It really is shift in how we interact with machines,” said Mary Mesaglio, a Gartner analyst. “We are moving from what machines can do for us to what machines can be for us. Machines are evolving from being our tools to becoming our teammates. “
Machines are not only evolving into work partners but also into customers, Mesaglio said. For instance, connected to a service that monitors usage levels, HP printers are capable of purchasing ink when needed. Tesla automobiles are also capable of ordering parts when a self-diagnosis surfaces a malfunction.
USPTO’s Holcombe also believes that evolutions in interfaces will help workers be more effective with the tools, with the next iteration of human-to-machine interface being audio with natural language rather than keyboards and the mouse. But he still does not see LLMs replacing human cognition any time soon.
 
 
 













 
 

“Human thinking and analysis have not been overtaken by machines because the algorithms themselves are at best iterations and trial and error for guessing,” he says. “I’ve never seen a machine make an intuitive leap without it being programmed by a human.”
Usama Fayyad, executive director of Northeastern University’s Institute for Experiential AI, sees conversational AI becoming increasingly important in the enterprise, providing more substantial answers to questions over time. Content generation, document summarization, as well as enhanced analysis and insight extraction tools and decision-making algorithms that require human augmentation will also be important use cases for enterprises across industries, he says.  
But for these tools to reach their full potential, how — and how often — they are put to use by humans is important. Such is the nature of the technology.
 
 
 













 
 

Joe Atkinson, chief products and technology officer at PwC US, sees generative AI applications helping to create a more tech-savvy workforce. But it remains unclear how workers will add value to the tools themselves, which, by design, learn as they go. No doubt human creativity will be necessary to elevate the quality of application, he says.
To that end, Gartner advises CIOs to establish “lighthouse” principles that define how workers and machines will interact in the year ahead — a priority that the firm puts on par with making data AI-ready and implementing AI-ready security.

After all, generative AI is not a set-it-and-forget-it tool — at least not yet. It requires human oversight and experience to assure accuracy, quality outcomes, and safety.
 
 
 













 
 

As part of this push, CIOs are gearing up with education and training sessions, implementing generative AI tools into the workplace gradually, and reassuring workers that AI tools are designed to augment their work and not replace them.
Sreenivasan Narayanan, executive vice president of Nous Infosystems, an enterprise technology consultancy in Dallas, has attended an AI program at the Wharton School of Business and has trained 42% of Nous’ workforce on Level 1 AI skills.
“We were dabbling with GitHub, PowerApps, Teams, M365, and Security Copilots so far in our digital labs a while back,” he says. “In the last few months, we have deployed this to production-grade client environments to provide solutions around code generation, case document summarization, voice answering, language translation,” he adds. “The workforce will embark on Level 2 [training] while more inducted in this organizational transformation.”
 
 
 













 
 

The human factor
But not all are taking their employers’ word for it.

Microsoft and the AFL-CIO recently announced the creation of a partnership, described as a first of its kind, designed to keep the dialogue open about AI development and how it may impact workers’ needs and roles, incorporate worker feedback, and shape public policy that supports the technology skills and needs of frontline workers, according to Microsoft.
And at its IT Symposium, Gartner led off with what it says was an unusual, but necessary call to arms: that machines are taking on different roles, and in some cases, human roles, and this cannot be ignored.
Moreover, the rapid pace of innovation of ChatGPT and development of capabilities such as DocLLM — which would be far more accurate in extracting data that is unstructured, such as images and video — has some wondering whether human-like artificial capable intelligence (ACI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI) will arrive sooner than expected and alter the value equation in the machine’s favor.
 
 
 













 
 

In the meantime, the daily evolution of generative AI platforms is exciting to developers and eagerly awaited by enterprise executives. For CIOs and CTOs, it’s a balancing act of cost vs ROI. Generative AI solutions are expensive to build and deploy and that will temper enterprise adoption, observers say.
“As CTOs, we need to work on quickly evaluating new tech, and whether it makes sense for our companies and what we need for our users,” says Jeremy King, SVP and CTO of engineering at Pinterest. “It’s a lot to evaluate — from whether to ‘buy or build’ to ensuring it works with existing foundations.”
Chief among those foundations — at least for now — is the company’s workforce. CIOs should strategize accordingly.

From jobs to skills, and regulations and governance, AI permeated conversations like never before. The impact it will have on jobs is on the radar of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has just released its Staff Discussion Note Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work.It finds almost 40% of employment globally is exposed to AI, which rises to 60% in advanced economies. Among workers, those that are college-educated and women are more exposed to AI, but also more likely to reap the benefits, while strong productivity gains could boost growth and wages.Countries around the world have been exploring regulation and governance around AI, including the European Union, where a draft deal on AI rules was agreed in December.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesWe also held our own AI Governance Summit, in response to rising concerns about the technology’s impact, released a set of recommendations, and explored the impact of AI and large language models on jobs.As we look ahead to 2024 at Davos, AI as a driving force is one of our four key themes. Below, we’ll keep you up to date on what to watch, read and look out for.Live updates on key AI sessionsDive into the key quotes, tweets and YouTube clips from Davos sessions on AI. What to know from Day 2Generative AI: Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?Speakers from government and business discussed the implications of generative AI following its rapid emergence in 2023, and how we can manage the risks. But there was also a strong focus on how much it could boost productivity and its possible applications, with Senator Mike Rounds, from South Dakota, US, believing it can transform healthcare.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesFinnovationBusiness leaders discussed how to ensure the benefits of AI outweigh the risks in fin-tech.The Expanding Universe of Generative ModelsGen AI is advancing rapidly, but what is the latest research and development in the field and what future opportunities will the technology offer?

This session brought together the chief executives of Deloitte, Sanofi, L'Oréal, and Exponential View, to explore the most likely scenarios for jobs and productivity. Emerging technology has the potential to have a significant impact on jobs.  Image: World Economic Forum360° on AI RegulationsMicrosoft President Brad Smith joined Arati Prabhakar, the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Vera Jourová, Vice-President for Values and Transparency at the European Commission, and Josephine Teo, Singapore's Minister for Communications and Information, to discuss the future of AI governance.There are diverse approaches to regulating AI, from the US, EU and multi-nationally to date, but Brad Smith said he expects more convergence in the future.""We won't have a world without divergence, but people actually care about a lot of the same things and actually have similar approaches to addressing them.""Jourová said AI promises ""a lot of fantastic benefits for people"". “The regulation is the precondition to cover the risks, but the rest remains to be free for creativity and positive thinking - and in Europe we are well placed. ”— Vera Jourová, Vice-President for Values and Transparency, European CommissionEthics in the Age of AIPhilosopher Michael Sandel explored the ethical questions AI poses, beyond jobs, fairness, privacy and democracy to whether technology would affect what it means to be human.If we can digitally de-age the actor Harrison Ford in the latest Indiana Jones movie, it is OK to bring back actors such as Humphrey Bogart from the dead?Sandel showed the audience a video interview of him and director and actor Michael B Jordan discussing casting deceased actors.It boiled down, he said, to a deep human value of authenticity and presence.He concluded: ""Will new technologies lead us, or are they already leading us and our children to confuse virtual communities and human connection for the real thing? Because if they do, then we may lose something precious about what it means to be human."" What to know from Day 4 Education Meets AIAI has the potential to change education and the way we learn. Emilija Stojmenova Duh, Slovenia's Minister of Digital Transformation, joined UAE Minister of Education, Ahmad bin Abdullah Humaid Belhoul Al Falasi, Hadi Partovi, Founder and CEO, Code.org, and Jeffrey Tarr, CEO of Skillsoft to explore how we can adapt and adjust to take advantage. Partovi said when people think about job losses due to AI, the risk isn't people losing their job to AI. ""It's losing their job to somebody else who knows how to use AI. That is going to be a much greater displacement. It's not that the worker gets replaced by just a robot or a machine in most cases, especially for desk jobs, it's that some better educated or more modernly educated worker can do that job because they can be twice as productive or three times as productive.""“The imperative is to teach how AI tools work to every citizen, and especially to our young people.”— Hadi Partovi, Founder and CEO, Code.orgAgendaWill copyright law enable or inhibit generative AI?Gen AI: Boon or Bane for Creativity?Generative AI presents a future where creativity and technology are more closely linked than ever before. Neal Mohan, Chief Executive Officer of YouTube, joined Daren Tang, Director-General, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Almar Latour, CEO; Publisher, Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and Contemporary Artist, Krista Kim, to explore whether prompts should be copyrighted and how we distinguish what is made by humans from machines.“We need to bring all these actors together to talk and share best practice. We will need some sort of interoperability - that's where the world is heading.”— Daren Tang, Director-General, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)Technology in a Turbulent World AgendaDavos 2024: Sam Altman on the future of AIAs technology plays an ever bigger role in our daily lives, questions of safety, trust and human interaction become increasingly important. In a key and highly anticipated Davos session, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO of Salesforce, Julie Sweet, Chair and CEO of Accenture, Jeremy Hunt, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer and Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, to discuss these issues.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesHard Power of AIFrom diplomacy to defence, AI is markedly changing geopolitics.

Login     Listen to this article 6 min    Does generative artificial intelligence – such as ChatGPT which is capable of generating content such as text and images – represent a big threat to your job security?It’s a question even people in previously “safe” professions are asking themselves as companies look to harness the cutting-edge technology to replace existing workers.AI is coming to the professional services sector at a rate of knots. David RoweEven software companies – which are expected to be the big beneficiaries of AI – could reduce their headcount. After all, if generative AI can boost the productivity of existing workers by 50 per cent to 100 per cent, these companies won’t need to hire as many workers as in the past.And the process is already under way. According to the Financial Times, “a quarter of global chief executives expect the deployment of generative artificial intelligence to lead to headcount reductions of at least 5 per cent this year,” according to a PwC survey of 4702 company bosses, spread across more than 100 countries.“Industries led by media and entertainment, banking, insurance and logistics were most likely to predict job losses because of cutting-edge AI tools”, the FT reported.AdvertisementIn contrast, “engineering and construction firms were least likely to anticipate cuts because of automation, alongside technology companies”.Of course, the potential of generative AI technology to revolutionise workplaces has long been recognised.Productivity boomLast year, Goldman Sachs predicted that generative AI systems would lead to the automation of a quarter of the work done in the US and eurozone.The US investment bank said generative AI could spark a productivity boom that would eventually boost annual global gross domestic product by 7 per cent over a decade.But it warned that the technology would also bring “significant disruption” to the labour market, exposing about 300 million full-time workers in big economies to automation.AdvertisementThe International Monetary Fund has also weighed into the debate, warning that about 40 per cent of jobs around the world could be affected by AI. It says workers in affluent economies – where there are more cognitive task-oriented jobs – face greater risks than those in emerging markets and developing countries.In a blog post, IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva noted that “in advanced economies, about 60 per cent of jobs may be impacted by AI”.“Roughly half of the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labour demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring.“In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”A new IMF discussion paper, Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work, points out that AI differs from previous technological revolutions because higher-income earners now find themselves at risk of displacement.“AI challenges the belief that technology affects mainly middle and, in some cases, low-skill jobs: its advanced algorithms can now augment or replace high-skill roles previously thought immune to automation.”AdvertisementAs a result, the IMF paper says, “even high-skill occupations, which were previously considered immune to automation because of their complexity and reliance on deep expertise now face potential disruption”.“Jobs that require nuanced judgment, creative problem-solving, or intricate data interpretation – traditionally the domain of highly educated professionals – may now be augmented or even replaced by advanced AI algorithms, potentially exacerbating inequality across and within occupations.”So what’s at risk?The first step is to break down individual occupations into their various tasks, and then consider which of these can be replaced or complemented by technology. This determines the AI “exposure” of particular occupations.The IMF researchers then consider the social, ethical and physical context of various occupations to determine how likely an occupation is to be shielded from AI-driven job displacement.For instance, they note that “because of advances in textual analysis, judges are highly exposed to AI, but they are also highly shielded from displacement because society is currently unlikely to delegate judicial rulings to unsupervised AI”.AdvertisementAs a result, “AI will likely complement judges, increasing their productivity, rather than replacing them.”In contrast, the IMF researchers say “clerical workers, who are also very exposed to AI but have a lower level of shielding, are more at risk of being displaced”.That means there will be an uneven impact across the labour market.“Occupations with high exposure for which AI can autonomously complete tasks may see reduced human labour demand, leading to lower wages.”On the other hand, “jobs that require human supervision over AI may experience a boost in productivity, which would raise labour demand and wages for incumbent workers”.The corollary is that AI could exacerbate income and wealth inequality – workers who can harness it will enjoy a boost in their productivity and wages, while others fall behind.AdvertisementWhat’s more, if AI significantly complements higher-paid occupations, it could lead to a disproportionate increase in their salary levels.And the productivity gains enjoyed by companies that adopt AI will lift capital returns, which will tend to favour the more affluent.Educational levels and age will also be important factors.According to the IMF researchers, “college-educated workers are better prepared to move from jobs at risk of displacement to high-complementarity jobs: older workers may be more vulnerable to the AI-driven transformation”.On a more optimistic note, they point out that if AI results in a productivity surge, “higher growth and labour demand could more than compensate for the partial replacement of labour tasks by AI, and incomes could increase along most of the income distribution”.RelatedWhat could derail this ‘risk on’ rally?RelatedWhy Howard Marks doesn’t believe in GoldilocksKaren Maley writes on banking and finance, specialising in financial services, private equity and investment banking.

This could lower demand for labour, affecting wages and even eradicating jobs.Meanwhile, the IMF projects that the technology will affect just 26% of jobs in low-income countries.It echoes a report from Goldman Sachs in 2023, which estimated AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs - but said there may also be new jobs alongside a boom in productivity.Ms Georgieva said ""many of these countries don't have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality among nations"".Our fingerprints may not be unique, claims AIYoung people turning to AI therapist bots More generally, higher-income and younger workers may see a disproportionate increase in their wages after adopting AI.Lower-income and older workers could fall behind, the IMF believes.

Oliver Wyman Forum Finds Challenges Remain in Training Current and Future Workforces 
DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Oliver Wyman, a business of Marsh McLennan (NYSE: MMC), announced today findings from a new report entitled ""How Generative AI is Transforming Business and Society,"" released at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
The report, from Oliver Wyman's think tank, the Oliver Wyman Forum, found that more than half of employees globally now use generative AI at work and that adoption is far higher in some countries. The Forum also found that adoption has not necessarily translated into higher levels of productivity – yet.
""The adoption rate of generative AI has been nothing short of remarkable,"" said John Romeo, CEO of the Oliver Wyman Forum. ""ChatGPT achieved mass adoption in less than one year -- a stark contrast to the internet, which took 17 years, smartphones 21 years, and electricity which took three decades, but training is not keeping up and we are facing an AI productivity disconnect.""
Forecasting business impact over the next decade, the report shows generative AI-trained junior employees will climb into management ranks faster than ever before. And senior-level leaders express the greatest levels of concern about losing their jobs to generative AI automation, according to the report.
Key workplace findings from the report are below:

Developing Countries Ahead: India leads 16 countries in employee adoption with 83% surveyed reporting daily or at least weekly use of generative AI. By contrast, weekly use by North American and European employees is below 50%.
Explosive Growth Among Pink & Blue Collars: Between June and November 2023, generative AI use exploded among white-collar knowledge workers as well as pink-collar workers. Doctors, nurses, and life-sciences employees increased weekly use by 264%. Weekly adoption among pink-collar education employees grew 144%, and blue-collar retail worker use increased by 71%.
Productivity Gains Are Years Away: As many as 20% of employees who report generative AI has not increased their productivity say they are bogged down by corporate guidelines and ""unsatisfactory output"" which adds review and editing time to projects. The full potential of generative AI's productivity gains is still six to 10 years away, according to the report.
Generative AI Training Gap: Lack of productivity may be linked to insufficient training. Employees at all levels seek more upskilling than employers currently provide. Among white-collar employees, 80% want more or better AI training, but only 64% currently say they receive it. This gap is wider among pink-collar employees.
Job Loss Concern: Across the 17 industries and job types studied, 60% of employees express increasing concern their jobs will be replaced by generative AI. Globally, 30% of all job seekers say generative AI is motivating their job search. Employees who worry about AI are 57% more likely to feel their productivity is declining and 78% more likely to believe they don't matter to their employer, according to recent data from the American Psychological Association.

Consumer findings include:

Bias concerns: In all 16 countries studied, most consumers are concerned generative AI is producing biased content. People are most concerned in India (92%) and least concerned in France (73%) while 83% of US respondents report being are concerned.
Trust is shaken: When asked if organizations using generative AI are untrustworthy, 29% said ""yes,"" with 18% saying generative AI tools ""are not trustworthy at all"" or ""not very trustworthy.""
Privacy, cybersecurity and more: Privacy, cybersecurity and overreliance on generative AI are the top three concerns for over 30% of consumers, but many cited additional worries, including job loss (29%), environmental impact (15%) and mental health (14%).

Ana Kreacic, COO of the Oliver Wyman Forum and Chief Knowledge Officer of the Oliver Wyman Group commented: ""Automation is no longer just a narrative of blue-collar workers. Many white-collar workers fear their roles will become displaced with generative AI, and this anxiety is having a direct impact on productivity. It's a misconception for businesses to wait a year or two and hope to hire a fully generative AI trained workforce. Companies need to reskill the employees they have now by focusing on areas with the most near-term applications.""

New Microsoft Copilot tools will enable retailers to take the first steps with generative artificial intelligence, says Microsoft.
“Retailers are looking for ways to begin working with generative AI that will allow them to learn quickly and scale effectively,” said Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president of global retail, consumer goods and gaming industries at Microsoft, in a recent blog post. “I’m excited to share new tools that help retailers more easily incorporate AI across the shopper journey.”
Retailers can use the Microsoft Cloud for Retail copilot template on Azure OpenAI Service, currently in public preview, to build individualised shopping experiences across their existing websites and applications.



The copilot template enables retailers to provide personalised customer experiences


Another copilot template has been designed to help store associates to work more productively and improve their customer service.
“Our copilot template for store operations helps build a generative AI-powered large language model-based assistant that enables Q&A from store documentation such as store operating procedures and natural laungague-based task creation,” said Bransten. “Store associates can use natural language to quickly and easily access the information they need in the flow of work, increasing their productivity and efficiency.”



Another copilot template helps store associates to work more efficiently


New copilot features, which will be available in the first quarter of 2024, will also help retailers to plan, develop and monitor marketing campaigns with the capabilities.
Retailers can also optimise their media captions with the Microsoft Retail Media platform, which is available for preview in January 2024, and collect and analyse their data with Microsoft Fabric.
Microsoft plans to expand on the possibilities of generative AI-powered retail tools at NRF 2024, with a talk on ‘Retail Unlocked: Achieve more with Microsoft’ hosted by Bransten and a session on ‘Unlocking true customer-centricity: Optimising touchpoints across the shopper journey with AI’ by Kathleen Mitford, corporate vice president of global industry marketing at Microsoft, and more.

Generative AI Enterprise Use Cases
Some enterprises, like marketing and sales-driven companies, have quickly added generative AI to their workflows because of the speed and scale AI tools can bring to content production and customer relationship management efforts. Other industries that have more legal and compliance hoops to jump through — such as healthcare, insurance, and education — have been more hesitant to add generative AI, which is growing quickly but without much transparency or regulation.
Enterprise companies across these industries and more are looking to today’s top AI companies for assistance — most enterprises cannot produce or support artificial intelligence without external support. Below, learn about some of the top ways AI companies are fulfilling enterprise use cases that take maximum advantage of generative AI capabilities.

Code Generation, Documentation, and Quality Assurance
For software developers and programmers, generative AI can write, complete, and vet sets of software code. Quality assurance is perhaps the most important emerging use case in this area, with generative AI models handling bug fixes, test generation, and various types of documentation.
As they mature, generative AI coding tools are increasingly assisting non-developers by creating code from their natural language scenario-based queries. This particular feature of AI coding tools is a promising development in a business world that’s pushing for greater tech democratization and accessibility.
But what many people don’t realize is that these tools can also supplement the work of experienced developers and coders. Particularly if developers are looking to move through a coding project more quickly or with fewer errors, generative AI tools can make well-informed recommendations to support their efforts. For example, many generative AI coding tools provide code autocompletion, error detection and correction, and even code refactoring to make complex code more readable and efficient.

Product Development and Management
Generative AI is now being used to code various apps, write product documentation, and manage user experience and new iterations throughout the product lifecycle. Generative AI is also increasingly being implemented for generative design, or the act of using AI to generate different design concepts at scale so product designers can more effectively determine their optimal design.
Developers and product managers can use generative AI tools to autocomplete, improve, and consolidate data for their various requirements. For example, a product developer or designer might use a generative AI tool to brainstorm new code and designs that they wouldn’t have considered otherwise. A product manager, on the other hand, may use generative AI tools that consolidate and summarize user feedback from various data sources so products can be improved with relevant data.
Most commonly today, generative AI foundation models and APIs are being used to develop new and fine-tuned generative AI models and products. Several enterprises have built customer service and chatbot generative AI tools based on OpenAI foundation models.

Blog and Social Media Content Writing
With the right prompts and inputs, large language models (LLMs) are capable of creating appropriate and creative content for blogs, social media posts, product pages, and business websites. Existing content can be modified, shortened, or expanded upon with generative tools, and many of these tools can also generate entirely new content with the right user prompts and contextual information.
Generative AI models that focus on this type of content generation enable users to give instructions on article tone and voice, input past written content from the brand, and add other specifications so new content is written in a way that sounds human and relevant to the brand’s audience. However, users need to remember that generated content could contain inaccuracies or unsubstantiated claims; particularly for content that is journalistic or fact-driven, writers, editors, and/or QA analysts should take the time to personally fact-check AI outputs before publishing them.

Inbound and Outbound Marketing and Sales
Inbound and outbound marketing campaigns frequently require employees to send contextualized emails and chat threads to prospective and current customers on a daily basis. Generative AI solutions can create and send the content for these communications to lessen the load. In some cases, they can also automate the process of moving these contacts to the next stage of the customer lifecycle on a CRM platform.
These types of assistive generative AI tools are increasingly popping up in both CRM and project management platforms, but there are also many independent generative AI tools for sales and marketing workflows. If your team of sales development representatives, marketers, salespeople, or other members who focus on outreach are getting minimal results with their current outreach strategies, the right tool can help them generate better content at a greater scale. Even better, a growing number of these sales and marketing tools include AI-powered analytics so you can develop a deeper understanding of what is and isn’t working with your current tactics.

Project Management and Operations
Project management platforms are in the early stages of incorporating generative AI into their toolkits, but many have already released public betas or full versions of AI suites to their users. These tools can support users with everything from task and subtask generation and recommendations to note-taking to project risk prediction, and use cases continue to expand, particularly for automation workflows. Project management AI tools also help users manage and summarize documents, datasets, and other assets so both internal resources and client-submitted information can be processed and applied to projects more efficiently.
Several generative AI tools have also emerged for assistive and secretarial tasks, both within project management platforms and as standalone solutions. With these tools, users can use a voice assistant to take notes and jot down ideas on their mobile devices, create smart and quick email replies, complete smart searches and summaries of important business documents, and automate certain communication workflows. The goal of this type of technology is to save time, giving users the ability to focus their efforts on higher-level strategy rather than day-to-day business and data management.

Graphic Design and Video Marketing
 
Generative AI is capable of generating realistic images, animation, and audio that can be used for graphic design and video marketing projects. Some generative AI vendors also offer voice synthesis and AI avatars so you can create marketing videos without actors, video equipment, or video editing expertise.
Generative AI video marketing tools are some of the earliest pioneers in multilingual content generated by artificial intelligence. While video avatars in particular will need some work before they can believably replace human speakers, this development is an exciting one, especially for global enterprises that need to send out video marketing or communication messages in languages they don’t speak.
In general, this type of generative AI lowers the barrier to entry for accessing technologies and products that have traditionally been cost-prohibitive. For example, generative AI tools can be used to not only edit headshots but also create believable background imagery and other edits so companies don’t need to pay for professional headshots. As another example, several generative AI tools are emerging that can create a relevant social media graphic or image based on user inputs.

Entertainment Media Generation
As AI-generated imagery, animation, and audio become more and more realistic, this type of technology is being used to create the graphics for movies and video games, the audio for music and podcast generation, and the characters for virtual storytelling and virtual reality experiences. With many of these tools, an actual human does not need to go on camera, edit footage, or even speak in order to create believable content.
Some tech experts predict that generative AI will constitute the majority of future film content and script writing, though creatives are understandably pushing back on that assumption. Right now, these tools are primarily used to supplement existing scripts and create more interactive non-player characters (NPCs) in the entertainment industry.

Performance Management and Coaching
Generative AI can be used in several business and employee coaching scenarios. For example, contact center call documentation and summarization, when combined with sentiment analysis, gives managers the information they need to assess current customer service rep outreach calls and coach employees on ways to improve.
Generative AI coaching and performance management tools can support both managers and their direct reports. Business leaders can use generative AI tools to inform — and even structure — performance reviews for their employees, while employees can use conversational AI tools to get feedback on their performance and areas for improvement independently.
However, while these kinds of AI solutions are trained to give thorough feedback and utilize ample data to back that feedback, not all employees will be comfortable with or trust this performance management approach. It’s important to supplement any generative AI you use in business performance management with direct manager feedback, catered training, and other personal touches that earn and maintain employee trust.

Business Performance Reporting and Data Analytics
 
Because generative AI can work through massive amounts of text and data to quickly summarize the main points, it is becoming an important tool for business intelligence and performance reporting. It’s especially useful for unstructured and qualitative data analytics, as these types of data usually require more processing before insights can be drawn.
Generative AI data analytics tools may be standalone products or embedded features within well-established data analytics platforms, such as Power BI. Generative AI enables traditional data analytics platforms to go beyond manual workflows and visualizations by supplementing the data scientist’s ideas with suggestions for improved visuals, easier-to-read reports, and cleaner data.
One of the most interesting areas being explored with this technology is data narratives, which are highly contextualized AI explanations of datasets. This goes beyond typical visualizations and dashboards into explainable data, which is particularly helpful for less technical business stakeholders and other key players who need straightforward information about business performance.

Customer Support and Customer Service
For many of the most straightforward customer service engagements, generative AI chatbots and virtual assistants can handle customer service questions at all hours of the day. Chatbots have been used for customer service for many years, but generative AI advancements are giving them additional resources to provide comprehensive and more human answers without the help of a human customer support representative.
Many early adopters of this technology are building custom service solutions with the help of OpenAI’s API and ChatGPT Enterprise. Customer service generative AI solutions are dramatically changing the chatbot landscape by offering longer service hours at far cheaper costs while also offering users higher-quality, real-time responses to more complicated queries than ever before.
Similar to AI-driven performance coaching, enterprise users must strike the right balance between AI transparency and a human touch with customer service. For example, you may want to state upfront if a generative-AI-informed chatbot is handling a customer’s initial questions, but to keep them from getting frustrated, make it clear that a human is available to support them if the questions go beyond the chatbot’s frame of knowledge. Being transparent and aware of what customers want still allows you to save time with repeated or simple questions but simplifies the handoff if a human support representative needs to step in.

Medical Diagnostics and Pharmaceutical Drug Discovery
Generative AI in medicine and pharmaceuticals is still nascent, but that is changing quickly. Image generation and editing tools are now increasingly used to optimize and zoom into medical images, allowing medical professionals to get a better and more realistic look at certain areas of the human body. Some tools even perform medical image analysis and basic diagnostics on their own, though it’s important to view this success cautiously and bolster results with actual medical professionals who can check results for quality.
On the pharmaceutical side, generative AI technology is being used to make drug discovery and design processes more efficient for new drugs. With this new development, scientists are beginning to generate novel molecules, more effectively discover disordered proteins, and design and predict clinical trial results.
AI-driven drug discovery is one of the areas of generative AI that is receiving the most funding right now, so expect this particular enterprise use case to grow significantly in the coming months and years. Few tools have been officially brought to market, but a number are in beta and early adopter trials. However, there has also been fairly significant churn among both medical and pharmaceutical AI companies, so it’s unclear who the leading players are in this segment or who the leaders will be in the coming months and years.

Consumer-Friendly Synthetic Data Generation
 
Although generative AI poses some crucial security concerns, it can also be used to heighten data and consumer privacy when used strategically for synthetic data generation.
For example, generative AI can be used to create synthetic data copies of actual sensitive data, allowing analysts to analyze and derive insights from the copies without compromising data privacy or compliance. With these accurate data copies, data analysts and other members of an enterprise team can develop AI models and score those models without exposing actual business or consumer data to their efforts.
A range of different tools are available for generating synthetic data, but one of the most interesting tool formats is the generative adversarial network (GAN). With this type of generative tool, two different neural networks compete against each other to learn intricate data patterns and structures for duplication. This competition-driven learning framework enables generative models to develop a more complex understanding of source data so they can effectively create synthetic data for a variety of enterprise use cases, including data augmentation, image generation, drug discovery, anomaly detection, and voice generation.

Smart Manufacturing and Predictive Maintenance
Generative AI is quickly becoming a staple in modern manufacturing, helping workers create more innovative designs and meet other production goals. In the realm of predictive maintenance, generative models can generate to-do lists and timelines, make workflow and repair suggestions, and simplify the process of assessing complex data from sensors and other parts of the assembly line.
Generative AI copilots are taking off in diverse enterprise settings and use cases, including manufacturing. With these types of copilots, both engineers and frontline workers are given real-time data about system performance issues and optimizations, how current assembly lines and tasks can be optimized, and what data needs to be considered for more efficient outcomes in the future.
In medicine, manufacturing, and other materials-based industries, generative AI is also being used in a process called inverse design. With inverse design, generative AI assesses missing materials in a process and generates new materials that fulfill the required properties for that environment. With inverse design and other innovations in the background, generative AI is going into projects like semiconductor chip development and design, which makes it a helpful solution for creating the materials generative AI models themselves need to operate effectively.

Fraud Detection and Risk Management
AI-powered fraud detection and risk management technology can analyze large amounts of transaction or claims data, quickly summarizing and identifying any patterns or anomalies in that data. With these capabilities, generative AI is a great supporting tool for fraud detection, underwriting, and risk management in finance and insurance scenarios.
For insurance in particular, generative AI can benefit both insurers and their customers. Both underwriters and claims adjusters can use generative AI tools to scour previous policies and claims — both their own and third-party data sources — to optimize coverage and claim outcomes for their customers. This process gives customers more reasonable and well-fitted plans for their needs and also saves insurers time, as they can quickly pull together the right plans and settlements because of how generative AI collects and summarizes massive amounts of relevant data.
The flip side of this solution is a potential concern for enterprises, as bad actors can take advantage of generative AI tools to commit fraud and other crimes more effectively. At this phase in generative AI development, companies need to invest in fraud and threat detection solutions to mitigate this risk.

Optimized Enterprise Search and Knowledge Base
Both internal and external search are benefitting from generative AI technology. For employees and other internal users of business tools, generative AI models can be used to scour, identify, and/or summarize enterprise resources when users are searching for certain information about their jobs or projects. These tools are designed for not only searching typical sources, like company files, but also company applications, messaging tools, and web properties.
Similarly, generative AI models can be embedded into company websites and other customer-facing properties, giving visitors a self-service solution for finding answers to their brand questions. Many companies have long invested in chatbot support tools, but with generative AI-powered search, these chatbots now have a much larger library of resources to reference when answering user questions.
Creating smarter versions of self-service search tools can save time for every member of your team. Leaders can shift their focus to higher-value projects and tasks rather than focusing their energy on routine employee training and information sharing. On the flip side, employees still receive the information and training they need. If the same technology is applied to customer service, customers can independently find the answers to their most important questions so your team can focus on other areas of business growth and management.

Leading Examples: Generative AI Enterprise Use Cases
Clearly, generative AI is being used to support many enterprise use cases and creative initiatives today. Some enterprises are sticking with conventional subscription-based generative AI models, while others are building their own models and versions of these tools into an existing tool stack.
Here are a few examples of how major enterprises are adding generative AI to their processes today:
Professional Services and Business Operations: Accenture Use Case
Accenture, a major consulting firm, is using generative AI to help its clients create smarter business strategies, roadmaps, and operations. Accenture’s clients span across banking, sales, customer service, legal, and other industries and are using the firm’s generative AI services for enhanced search, document summarization, and automated communications.
Here are a few specific examples of how client companies are partnering with Accenture for generative AI solutions:

A major oil and gas company: Accenture is helping the client implement tools from Microsoft Azure and OpenAI while instilling best practices for big data management. The firm is helping with multimodal data handling, cognitive search, and semantic modeling.
Spain’s Ministry of Justice: Accenture designed an AI-powered search engine for legal professionals — called Delfos — that makes it easier for judges, lawyers, and regular citizens to look up judicial processes and other information in a massive dataset and document collection. Accenture is also helping the organization use large language models to more efficiently manage how users access judicial information.
A multinational bank: Accenture is using generative AI to automatically review and triage emails to the right employees and departments.
A European banking group: The company is primarily using Microsoft Azure architecture and a GPT-3 LLM to create and manage a more searchable employee knowledge database.

Life Sciences: Nvidia Use Case


Nvidia recently released its BioNeMo Drug Discovery Cloud Service, which uses large language modeling to advance and speed up drug discovery, protein engineering, and research in genomics, chemistry, biology, and molecular dynamics. Researchers who use BioNeMO with Nvidia cloud APIs can create custom biomolecular AI models for their specific research purposes.
BioNeMo has recently shifted from limited early access to full public access. Part of what makes this solution highly scalable and attractive to potential customers in its early stages is its on-demand supercomputing infrastructure, which is available to support early drug discovery pipelines.
Travel and Hospitality: Expedia Use Case


Expedia’s ChatGPT-powered travel planner lets users ask questions and get recommendations on travel, lodging, and activities. It also saves suggested hotels and venues through an intelligent shopping feature, so users can recall and easily book recommended lodging.
Although this solution is more catered to individual consumers than enterprise users, it certainly can be used in a business context. For employees who frequently travel or book travel for their colleagues, Expedia’s travel planner can smooth out the planning process and free up time for more important tasks.
E-commerce and Retail: Shopify Use Case


Shopify now offers Shopify Magic to help retailers generate product descriptions and other product-related content with artificial intelligence. Users can input a verbal tone and a handful of keywords that they want to be represented in the product description. From there, Shopify generates a description that matches those parameters.
Shopify is one of the few retail and e-commerce enterprises that has tapped into generative AI at this time. Although Shopify Magic is still fairly new, it is being integrated with other Shopify features so Shopify customers can better incorporate AI assistance at every stage of product development and selling.
Fintech and Software Development: Stripe Use Case


Stripe, a financial services SaaS company, is using OpenAI’s GPT-4 to power better documentation, summarization, and query management for developers that use Stripe Docs. Stripe Docs is set up so users can input natural language queries about documentation. Stripe Docs then responds by summarizing and extracting important pieces of that content in a user-friendly format.
Stripe is also helping OpenAI and several other generative AI companies better monetize their products with Stripe Billing, Stripe Checkout, Stripe Tax, Revenue Recognition, and Link. These tools help OpenAI, Runway, Diagram, Moonbeam, and other generative AI companies create a smoother subscription and checkout process for customers, all while managing compliance and finances for these AI companies.

Generative AI Use Cases: Ethics and Compliance
Generative AI is an emerging technology, and there are still many unknowns that significantly impact its use in the enterprise. For example, most users aren’t familiar with how the models are trained or what data goes into their training.
Additionally, these models have wide-ranging capabilities that can both help and harm cybersecurity postures. And finally, generative AI models are quickly growing in their skill sets, posing a threatening alternative for many skilled workers’ careers.
So what can enterprises do to make sure they’re using generative AI responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with security and privacy regulations? We believe best practices for using generative AI ethically will evolve rapidly as the technology matures, but these tips are a good way to get started with responsible use:

Only input depersonalized and nonsensitive data into large language models. Otherwise, your most sensitive data could become part of the tool’s training dataset and be exposed to third-party users and companies.
Stay current with generative AI news and trends. The generative AI space is changing daily, and with that change comes regular news about companies that are getting the technology right and others that are taking dangerous and/or unethical steps in their AI development efforts. Staying updated on all of these changes will ensure you only use the most credible tools and work with the most ethical AI providers.
Create an AI usage and ethics policy for your business. Your policy should cover how internal users in your organization are allowed to use AI tools and also how your business is allowed to invest in third-party tools. For reference, several AI policy templates are already publicly available.
Offer career training to all employees. Employees are understandably afraid that parts of their jobs will soon be outsourced to AI. To combat this fear and build up their career prospects, offer training and certifications that will help employees use AI in their jobs and build skills that cannot easily be replicated by AI models.

Bottom Line: Generative AI Enterprise Use Cases
Because generative AI capabilities are changing on a near-daily basis, enterprise use cases for this new technology are evolving just as quickly. With this change comes new opportunities for enterprises to enhance their current operations.
Already, enterprises are leveraging generative AI for everything from writing marketing copy to discovering new pharmaceuticals. For enterprise leaders who want to incorporate generative AI into their business, the key is to consider what model works best for your business, what you’re trying to achieve, and how this new business factor will impact your employees and your customers.

From the creation of new art to the bolstering of cyber security, the technology will soon be ubiquitous — and the moment is historic.AI has been compared to the printing press or the steam engine — two technologies that brought about once-in-a-generation advances and fundamental changes in how we operate. Speakers on panel at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting unanimously agreed with the premise of the session: Generative AI: Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.And they had words of advice for all of us on surviving and thriving in the new age of AI:Have you read?AI - artificial intelligence - at Davos 2024: Rolling coverage and what to know“If you embrace Artificial Intelligence, you will be complete. If you do not and you're late, you'll be finished. And if you reject it altogether, you will be completely finished,"" said Omar Sultan Al Olama, United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence.IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna said generative AI's impact on jobs would be huge.""It is the first technology that goes after the white collar work or what I will call the lower half of cognitive work ... It doesn't matter whether you're a physicist, mathematician, a computer scientist, a doctor, a writer,"" he said.So what will be the one key skill we all will need to thrive in the age of AI?""If the lower half of cognitive work gets taken over by genAI, it implies that you've got to learn critical thinking. That means critical thinking, regardless of which domain you're in, becomes the skill that is far, far more needed,"" Krishna said.Accenture Chair and CEO Julie Sweet said the ability to keep learning was key, and that was something Accenture demanded of all its employees, even at the interview stage:""We ask one question to every person, regardless of whether you're a coder or you're a strategist or you're a doctor or you're working in HR. We ask one interview question to everyone. We say: what have you learned in the last six months?""We don't care if it's how to bake a cake, but we have to have people who like to learn. And that question is incredibly insightful, you have to have people who want to learn and build a learning culture,"" she said.The World Economic Forum's most recent Future of Jobs report said: ""Analytical thinking and creative thinking remain the most important skills for workers ... Analytical thinking is considered a core skill by more companies than any other skill.Continuous learningAll the panelists in Davos stressed the need to adapt education to the coming changes.""We actually deployed AI education within our schooling,"" the UAE's Omar Sultan Al Olama said.""So from grade five onwards, people learn how to code. From grade nine onwards, kids in schools actually learn what artificial intelligence is, what are the ethics of it, and they also understand, whatever their career path is going to be, how AI is going to affect it.""Beyond school, we need to keep learning, said IBM's Krishna.""Continuous learning, I think, is a hallmark,"" he said.""A statistic: The half-life of skills used to be 30 years. It's now seven years. So if you think about that, that means that an average career, you're going to change five times your overall skills.""Accenture's Sweet told the Davos audience: “AI will create a lot of new jobs, but you won’t be able to take the current people and put them in the jobs unless you partner together — governments and companies — on reskilling.”Accenture has already prioritized a minimum level of digital literacy across the board — their staff must understand concepts like cloud technology, for example, at a minimum — giving the company an advantage when it comes to building an AI-ready workforce.It’s not just businesses that can bring their people along in the AI revolution.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
AI is transforming the future of work, with potential disruptions and the need for reskilling. While some jobs may be automated, AI can enhance human capabilities and productivity. Reskilling is crucial to adapt to changing demands, and collaboration is needed for comprehensive programs. AI has economic implications, creating new industries and addressing inequality, but also poses challenges. Upskilling, social safety nets, and worker protections are necessary for an equitable future of work.




In the rapidly evolving age of artificial intelligence (AI), the future of work is undergoing a profound transformation.
This article delves into the potential job disruptions, the significance of reskilling, and the economic implications accompanying this new era of work.
Job Disruption and AI: Adapting to a Changing Landscape
As AI evolves and automates tasks previously performed by humans, professionals need to take on the challenge of adapting to this changing landscape. Here are some key aspects of this transformation.
The Complex Relationship Between AI and Employment
The impact of AI on employment sparks concerns about job displacement and automation. For example, a recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.
However, it is essential to note that the relationship between AI and employment is multifaceted.
Instead of merely replacing humans, AI technologies have the potential to enhance and complement human capabilities. According to a recent research paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), for example, customer support agents who utilized a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) AI tool experienced an approximate 14% boost in their productivity.Advertisements




This is because AI can assist workers in completing tasks more efficiently, allowing them to focus on their work’s more creative and innovative aspects. This way, AI can empower individuals and increase their productivity rather than replace them.
Vulnerable Occupations and Automation
It is also true, however, that certain types of jobs are at a higher risk of automation than others, depending on the industry.
Jobs that involve repetitive manual tasks or data processing, such as assembly line workers or data entry clerks, are particularly susceptible to automation. These roles often consist of routine activities that AI systems can easily replicate.
An insightful Forbes analysis suggested finance & banking, media & marketing, and legal services are/will be the sectors most affected by AI automation.
On the other hand, jobs that rely heavily on skills like creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are less likely to be automated. Professions in healthcare, education, and the arts, for example, require human empathy and judgment, which are challenging for AI systems to replicate accurately.
The Forbes report corroborates some of these assumptions, explaining manufacturing & factory workers, agriculture, and healthcare are the sectors more resistant to automation and less likely to be replaced by AI technologies.
Reskilling and Upskilling: Thriving in the AI-driven Workforce
Reskilling and upskilling are crucial not only for individuals but also for organizations to thrive in the AI-driven workforce. As mentioned above, the transition to an AI era brings a significant shift in the job market, with automation replacing routine tasks.
The Importance of Reskilling in the AI Era
With AI increasingly automating routine tasks, workers need to acquire new skills that complement and enhance these technologies. Effective prompt engineering capabilities, for instance, are one of them.
While AI excels at processing large amounts of data and performing repetitive tasks, it lacks problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Therefore, individuals must engage in learning and continuous skill development to stay relevant in the job market.
Additionally, organizations must prioritize reskilling efforts to ensure their workforce can effectively utilize AI technologies and adapt to changing industry demands.
Collaborative Efforts for Reskilling
Successful reskilling outcomes require collaborative efforts from various stakeholders.
Governments play a crucial role in creating an enabling environment for reskilling initiatives by implementing policies that promote accessible and affordable education and training opportunities.
Additionally, educational institutions must adapt their curricula to include AI literacy and offer training programs that equip workers with the skills needed to collaborate effectively with AI technologies.
Through collaboration between governments, educational institutions, and other stakeholders, comprehensive reskilling programs can be developed and implemented, ensuring the workforce is equipped with the skills required to thrive in the AI era.
Economic Implications: Unleashing the Potential of AI
As AI advances rapidly, its economic implications become increasingly significant. Unleashing the full potential of AI holds the promise of transforming industries, driving innovation, and revolutionizing productivity.
Creating New Industries and Opportunities
The advent of AI technology can potentially give rise to entirely new industries and job opportunities.
Integrating the technology into various sectors can increase productivity as mundane and repetitive tasks are automated. This automation allows human workers to focus on more value-added activities that require creativity and critical thinking skills.
Adopting AI can create a positive feedback loop, where increased innovation, enhanced efficiency, and greater economic output further fuel the development of new industries and job opportunities.
Addressing Inequality and Job Polarization
While AI can create new employment opportunities, it also poses challenges related to job polarization and income inequality, as recently expressed by economist Daron Acemoğlu.
For context, job polarization refers to the division of the labor market between high-skilled, well-paid jobs and low-skilled, low-paid jobs, with a decline in middle-skilled positions.
Additionally, AI automation may lead to job displacement in certain occupations. Inclusive policies and support mechanisms are essential to ensure the equitable distribution of AI benefits.
Collaboration between governments, businesses, and society at large becomes crucial to create a future of work that is accessible to all.
Measures such as upskilling and reskilling programs, social safety nets, and regulations protecting workers’ rights can help mitigate the negative impact of AI on inequality and job polarization, fostering an environment where everyone can participate and benefit from AI tools.
The Bottom Line
Embracing the future of work in the age of AI presents both opportunities and challenges.
While some jobs may be disrupted and automated, AI technologies have the potential to augment human capabilities and create new and exciting job prospects. Reskilling and upskilling the workforce are crucial for adapting to changing job market demands.
By embracing AI and investing in human capital, we can shape a future where humans and machines work together to create a more productive, innovative, and equitable society.

A recent Financial Times essay argued it is time to start discussing a targeted tax on artificial intelligence companies to address expected job losses from AI. While the intentions behind such a proposal may seem well-meaning, an AI tax at this juncture would be premature and also sets a dangerous precedent.


First and foremost, projections of massive job losses stemming from AI are highly speculative. It is true that some studies forecast widespread employment losses. A report from the consulting firm McKinsey estimated that 30 percent of current work hours in the U.S. could be automated by 2030. The IMF says about 40 percent of workers worldwide are in high-exposure occupations with respect to AI.

Yet while AI will inevitably destroy some occupations, it will also lead to new kinds of work. History shows that technology often creates as many or more jobs than it destroys, just different kinds of jobs and usually higher-paying ones as well. For example, new positions at AI companies and roles like “prompt engineer” are likely to emerge, while the AI systems themselves will also require human oversight and maintenance. Rather than displace all workers, AI will augment jobs, allowing people to focus on higher-value tasks.

PROMOTED
Meanwhile full automation—where humans are completely removed from decision making—is typically challenging and rarely cost-effective. Until the extent of displacement is better understood, an AI tax is jumping the gun. Rather than upend the tax code, policymakers should instead wait to see what AI’s actual effects are on the labor market and then tailor a response, if one is needed, to conditions on the ground.

Relatedly, the hypothesized “transition” to an AI economy could be abrupt or it could be very gradual. A short transition, based on a “singularity” moment where rapid innovation transpires in an extremely compressed time period could indeed result in considerable disturbance to the labor market. In that case, the situation might well require some adjustment assistance for some workers. On the other hand, a long, drawn out transition would leave ample time for the labor force to adapt.

Predicting the pace of AI’s impacts is essentially just guesswork. Progress rarely follows a straight line. Breakthroughs happen alongside delays and dead ends. Rushing to support displaced workers before it is even clear who benefits and who loses from technology be could prove a mistake, especially if AI integrates relatively less smoothly into business activity as part of a slow and deliberate process.

Moreover, workers themselves are not helpless victims of progress. Ample opportunities exist for mid-career skill development even without government retraining programs, which are rarely effective anyway. Policymakers should trust workers’ resourcefulness in charting their own futures.

The author of the Financial Times column points to a global agreement on the minimum corporate tax rate as a model for the proposed AI tax, but implementing an international AI tax regime has its own problems. Tax and regulatory competition between countries is healthy. Contrary to the myth of a regulatory “race to the bottom,” tax havens play a beneficial role by imposing discipline on high-tax nations and encouraging reforms when governments overstep their bounds.
Consider that Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which reduced the corporate tax rate in the U.S. The Biden administration sensibly kept most of these business tax provisions in place, despite having the opportunity to overturn them. There is much more consensus on these topics than often meets the eye.
In fact, singling out a technology for punitive taxes is unfair and sets a troubling precedent. In a recent paper, my co-authors and I predicted AI could become the next target after cryptocurrencies for discriminatory electricity taxes. With proposals for AI taxes now appearing in the mainstream press, that warning is appearing prescient.
Instead of making scapegoats of innovators, officials should pursue policies that foster an open and competitive global business environment. They should not punish based on hypotheticals, nor should they constrain tax competition through cartel-like international agreements. Innovation, not a destructive AI tax, is the surest path to shared prosperity.

From an innovation growth point of view, it raises an increasingly important question: Where to find the talent needed in some of these fast-growing roles and avoid a scenario in which talent availability becomes a binding constraint for economic development and growth?On the other hand, the exponential growth of the global AI market also highlights the need for establishing standards and frameworks that ensure responsible AI practices and procurement, especially for commercial enterprises.How are businesses navigating these challenges while leveraging its potential? Here, four leaders share insights on how their companies are exploring the field.Have you read?Davos 2024: Who's coming and what to expect'Innovation is burgeoning'Jeff Schumacher, CEO NAX GroupAI is the next frontier in a long line of disruptive technologies, offering enterprises immense potential to create value and solve complex challenges, such as reducing scope3 emissions. Yet, to truly realize the promise of AI, businesses must not only adopt it but also operationalize it. This process involves connecting AI models with observable actions, leveraging data subsequently fed back into the system to complete the feedback loop. The critical element lies in automating these steps, enabling rapid, self-learning iterations that propel continuous improvement and innovation.In pursuing this goal, however, established leaders often grapple with limitations rooted in experience, hampered by technology functions inundated with backlogs and technical debt from critical systems reliant on outdated technologies. These challenges highlight the impracticality of attempting transformation from within – it’s too time-consuming, costly, and risky.“To truly realize the promise of AI, businesses must not only adopt it but also operationalize it.”— Jeff Schumacher, CEO NAX GroupIn recognizing these hurdles and the escalating need to confront large-scale systemic issues, businesses are increasingly forging strategic partnerships with software and services companies. Such collaborations signify the evolving landscape of industry practices and serve as a catalyst for businesses to create innovative solutions to challenges that previously seemed insurmountable.'People are key to confidence in AI'Carmine Di Sibio, EY Global Chairman and CEOThe biggest threat to business adoption of AI is not a lack of desire but confidence. In a recent EY survey, nearly 70% of CEOs revealed that uncertainty around generative AI made it challenging to develop and execute a strategy quickly.Leaders’ concerns are not without merit. Consider AI chatbots: they produce erroneous outputs or “hallucinate” 3% of the time, with incidents peaking at 27%. Companies also have reservations about data privacy, misinformation and intellectual property. In sectors where generative AI has immense potential to improve lives – such as health care, financial services and logistics – such risks are untenable. Indeed, they are for most businesses.Every new technology has a hype phase before its total value is realized. However, navigating the in-between can be messy. So, how can organizations harness AI confidently? An important first step is implementing people-led governance mechanisms. For example, the EY AI principles cover crucial considerations such as accountability, security, transparency and sustainability. It also means using human input to “fine-tune” models and interpret outputs. In other words, to unlock AI’s value, we must put people at the centre.After all, technologies we’ve come to rely on – from the internet to cellphones – were once AI-powered transformation strategies to optimize performance and foster confidence in this game-changing technology.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies'Pitching AI enthusiasm just right'Lisa Heneghan, Chief Digital Officer, KPMG InternationalAI is unquestionably the “internet” moment of our time. The speed at which it will be debated, embraced and improved will surprise even the most enthusiastic supporters. In KPMG’s CEO Outlook survey, 70% of senior executives told us that generative AI is their top investment priority and that it’ll pay off in the next three to five years. It’s clear that despite economic uncertainty, CEOs are focused and determined to make AI work for them. For corporate leaders, the danger right now is the “fear of missing out” driving decisions which could damage long-term profits or create new ethical or cyber security challenges. It’s a delicate balancing act between late adopters who may miss golden growth opportunities and early adopters who risk making impulsive moves that could backfire. Companies should start investing today. Understanding the business case will not be about savings but based on driving experience and skills, which will help identify the opportunities. Focus on getting the foundations in place and building the right tech platforms that are agile enough to adapt to the rapidly evolving AI landscape. It is better to test and learn now than watch and miss the opportunity to lead change – time to market is more important than perfection.“It’s a delicate balancing act between late adopters who may miss golden growth opportunities and early adopters who risk making impulsive moves that could backfire.”— Lisa Heneghan, Chief Digital Officer, KPMG International'Making AI work with safety at the fore'Dr. John Markus Lervik, Chief Strategy & Development Officer and Co-Founder, CogniteIndustrial companies face an AI revolution dilemma. How do they innovate for competitiveness with AI when hallucinations are not an option for critical asset operations in energy and manufacturing?The ageing industrial workforce, low data literacy, difficulty attracting talent, hazardous working environments, increasingly complex optimization needs and sustainability all call for AI-based solutions, including AI robotics. With disruptive generative AI innovation occurring in every part of society, industrial enterprise boardrooms increasingly push for AI strategy and investment as the highest priority. But how do we make generative AI work for industries where safety is the top priority?The answer is surprisingly simple. By combining generative AI large language models with industrial knowledge graphs. If the “knowledge graph” is as new to you as large language models, that is because, in the context of digital transformation, they are better known as the data models that power digital twins. From that perspective, large language models need digital twins to make generative AI work for industry.Digital twins provide a deterministic, real-time, governed and access-controlled digital representation of real-world assets with all its processes, whereas large language models offer a natural language conversational interface for anyone to access the digital twin for insight and analytics. It’s a win-win.'Companies must act on AI-driven OT automation'Anant Maheshwari, President and CEO Global High Growth Regions, HoneywellAI is rapidly creating new opportunities across industries, yet most companies are still trying to define how to use AI to impact profit and loss positively. Accelerating AI across Operational Technology (OT) automation is one opportunity. OT has leveraged control automation for decades, and it is here that AI can become the logical leap forward. Reaching this goal requires organizations to adopt a new integrated software and hardware playbook for OT as a critical automation enabler. Additionally, the right technology partners are needed to combine a patchwork of IT and OT systems under a common strategy and coherent execution building on embedded control systems. Get this right, and the returns will be significant.“The pace of AI’s evolution is evident and companies must act on AI-driven OT automation now to avoid getting left behind.”— Anant Maheshwari, President and CEO Global High Growth Regions, HoneywellOne example of such automation can be seen in a real estate company to reduce energy intensity across an international buildings portfolio. It has achieved higher revenues from tenants who want a data-driven pathway to reduce scope 3 emissions. Another example can be seen from a global energy company that has dramatically reduced downtime and associated costs and increased throughput revenues by deploying AI-enabled controls across its OT assets.These “early movers” are leveraging AI to impact profit and loss positively and drive higher shareholder returns. However, the pace of AI’s evolution is evident and companies must act on AI-driven OT automation now to avoid getting left behind.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesRelated topics:Emerging TechnologiesForum InstitutionalShare:Contents'Innovation is burgeoning''People are key to confidence in AI''Pitching AI enthusiasm just right''Making AI work with safety at the fore''Companies must act on AI-driven OT automation'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

            Almost 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a trend that is likely to deepen inequality, according to the International Monetary Fund.
    

            In a Sunday blog post, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to establish social safety nets and offer retraining programs to counter the impact of AI.
    

            “In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” she wrote ahead of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where the topic is set to be high on the agenda.

            The ski resort town of Davos was already bedecked with AI advertisements and branding as the summit got underway Monday.
    

            Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, and his biggest backer — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella — will speak at the event later this week as part of a program that includes a debate Tuesday on “Generative AI: Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?”
    

            As AI continues to be adapted by more workers and businesses, it’s expected to both help and hurt the human workforce, Georgieva noted in her blog.

            Echoing previous warnings from other experts, Georgieva said the effects were expected to be felt more deeply in advanced economies than emerging markets, partly because white-collar workers are seen to be more at risk than manual laborers.

            In more developed economies, for example, as much as 60% of jobs could be impacted by AI. Approximately half of those may benefit from how AI promotes higher productivity, she said.
    

            “For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring,” wrote Georgieva, citing the IMF’s analysis.
    

            “In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”
    

            In emerging markets and lower income nations, 40% and 26% of jobs are expected to be affected by AI, respectively. Emerging markets refer to places such as India and Brazil with sustained economic growth, while low-income countries refer to developing economies with per capita income falling within a certain level such as Burundi and Sierra Leone.
    

            “Many of these countries don’t have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality,” noted Georgieva.

            She warned that the use of AI could increase chances of social unrest, particularly if younger, less experienced workers seized on the technology as a way to help boost their output while more senior workers struggle to keep up.

The tech sector is pouring billions of dollars into AI. But it keeps laying off humans




            AI became a hot topic at the WEF in Davos last year as ChatGPT took the world by storm. The chatbot sensation, which is powered by generative AI, sparked conversations on how it could change the way people work around the world due to its ability to write essays, speeches, poems and more.
    

            Since then, upgrades to the technology have expanded the use of AI chatbots and systems, making them more mainstream and spurring massive investment.
    

            Some tech firms have already directly pointed to AI as a reason they are rethinking staffing levels.
    

            While workplaces may shift, widespread adoption of AI could ultimately increase labor productivity and boost global GDP by 7% annually over a 10-year period, according to a March 2023 estimate by Goldman Sachs economists.
    

            Georgieva, in her blog post, also cited opportunities to boost output and incomes around the world with the use of AI.
    

            “AI will transform the global economy,” she wrote. “Let’s make sure it benefits humanity.”

In a Sunday blog post, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to establish social safety nets and offer retraining programs to counter the impact of AI. “In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” she wrote ahead of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where the topic is set to be high on the agenda. The ski resort town of Davos was already bedecked with AI advertisements and branding as the summit got underway Monday. Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, and his biggest backer — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella — will speak at the event later this week as part of a program that includes a debate Tuesday on “Generative AI: Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?” As AI continues to be adapted by more workers and businesses, it’s expected to both help and hurt the human workforce, Georgieva noted in her blog. Echoing previous warnings from other experts, Georgieva said the effects were expected to be felt more deeply in advanced economies than emerging markets, partly because white-collar workers are seen to be more at risk than manual laborers. In more developed economies, for example, as much as 60% of jobs could be impacted by AI. Approximately half of those may benefit from how AI promotes higher productivity, she said. “For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring,” wrote Georgieva, citing the IMF’s analysis. “In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.” In emerging markets and lower income nations, 40% and 26% of jobs are expected to be affected by AI, respectively.

By any measure, 2023 was an amazing year for AI. Large language Models (LLMs) and their chatbot applications stole the show, but there were advances across a broad swath of uses. These include image, video and voice generation.
The combination of these digital technologies have led to new use cases and business models, even to the point where digital humans are becoming commonplace, replacing actual humans as influencers and newscasters.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Importantly, 2023 was the year when large numbers of people started to use and adopt AI intentionally as part of their daily work. Rapid AI innovation has fueled future predictions, as well, including everything from friendly home robots to artificial general intelligence (AGI) within a decade. That said, progress is never a straight line and challenges could sidetrack some of these predicted advances.
As AI increasingly weaves into the fabric of our daily lives and work, it begs the question: What can we expect next?”
Physical robots could arrive soon
While digital advancements continue to astonish, the physical realm of AI — particularly robotics — is not far behind in capturing our imagination. LLMs could provide the missing piece, essentially a brain, particularly when combined with image recognition capabilities through camera vision. With these technologies, robots could more readily understand and respond to requests and perceive the world around them.
In the Robot Report, Nvidia’s VP of robots and edge computing Deepu Talla said that LLMs will enable robots to better understand human instructions, learn from one another and comprehend their environments.
One way to improve robot performance is to use multiple models. MIT’s Improbable AI Lab, a group within the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), for instance, has developed a framework that makes use of three different foundation models each tuned for specific tasks such as language, vision and action. 
“Each foundation model captures a different part of the [robot] decision-making process and then works together when it’s time to make decisions,” lab researchers report. 
Incorporating these models may not be enough for robots to be widely usable and practical in the real world. To address these limitations, a new AI system called Mobile ALOHA has been developed at Stanford University. 
This system allows robots “to autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks such as sautéing and serving a piece of shrimp, opening a two-door wall cabinet to store heavy cooking pots, calling and entering an elevator and lightly rinsing a used pan using a kitchen faucet.”
An ImageNet moment for robotics
This led Jack Clark to opine in his ImportAI newsletter: “Robots may be nearing their ‘ImageNet moment’ when both the cost of learning robot behaviors falls, as does the data for learning their behaviors.”  
ImageNet is a large dataset of labeled images started by Fei Fei Lee in 2006 and is widely used in advancing computer vision and deep learning research. Starting in 2010, ImageNet served as the dataset for an annual competition aimed at assessing the performance of computer vision algorithms in image classification, object detection and localization tasks.advertisement
The moment Clark references is from 2012, when several AI researchers including Alex Krizhevsky along with Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, a form of deep learning, that achieved a dramatic reduction in image classification error rates.
This moment demonstrated the potential of deep learning, and is what effectively jumpstarted the modern AI era. Clark’s view is that the industry could now be at a similar moment for physical robots. If true, biped robots could be collaborating with us within a decade, in hospitals and factories, in stores or helping at home. Imagine a future where your household chores are effortlessly managed by AI-powered robots.
The pace of AI advancement is breathtaking
Many such inflection points could be near. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said recently that AGI, the point at which AI can perform at human levels across a wide variety of tasks, might be achieved within five years. Jim Fan, senior research scientist and lead of AI agents at Nvidia, added that “the past year in AI is like leaping from Stone Age to Space Age.”advertisement

Consulting giant McKinsey has estimated that gen AI will add more than $4 trillion a year to the global economy. Securities from UBS recently updated their perspective on AI, calling it the tech theme of the decade and predicted the AI market will grow from $2.2 billion in 2022 to $225 billion by 2027. That represents a 152% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), a truly astonishing number.
Enthusiasm for the potential of AI to improve our quality of life runs high. Bill Gates said in his “Gates Notes” letter at the end of 2023 that “AI is about to supercharge the innovation pipeline.” A New York Times article quotes David Luan, CEO of AI start-up company Adept: “The rapid progress of A.I. will continue. It is inevitable.” 
Given all of this, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that gen AI is at the peak of inflated expectations according to the Gartner Emerging Technology Hype Cycle, a gauge of enthusiasm for new technologies.

Is AI progress inevitable?
As we revel in the achievements of AI in 2023, we must also ponder what challenges lie ahead in the aftermath of this rapid growth period. The momentum behind AI is unlike anything we have ever seen, at least since the Internet boom that fueled the dot com era — and we saw how that turned out.
Might something like that occur with the AI boom in 2024? A Fortune article suggests as much: “This year is likely to be one of retrenchment, as investors discover many of the companies they threw money at don’t have a workable business model, and many big companies find that the cost of compute outweighs the benefit.” 
That view aligns with Amara’s Law that states: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” Which is another way of stating that systems attempt to rebalance after disruption, or that hype often outpaces reality.
This view does not necessarily portend the AI industry falling from grace, although it has happened twice before. Since it was originally coined as a term at a 1956 Dartmouth College conference, AI has had at least two periods of elevated expectations that ended due to problems encountered in building and deploying applications when the speculative promises did not materialize. The periods, known as “AI winters,” occurred from 1974 to 1980 and again from 1987 to 1993.

Not all rainbows and unicorns
Now amid a brilliant “AI summer,” is there a risk of another winter? In addition to the cost of computing, there are also issues with energy use in AI model training and inference that is running into a headwind of climate change and sustainability concerns.
Then too, there are what are sometimes referred to as the “Four Horsemen of the AI-pocalypse:” data bias, data security, copyright infringement and hallucination. The copyright issue is the most immediate, with the recent lawsuit brought by the New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft. If the Times wins, some commentators have speculated, it could end the entire business model on which many gen AI companies have been built.
The biggest concern of all is the potential existential threat from AI. While some would welcome the advent of AGI, seeing this as a pathway to unlimited abundance, many others led by proponents of Effective Altruism are fearful that this could lead to the destruction of humanity.
A new survey of more than 2,700 AI researchers reveals the current extent of these existential fears. “Median respondents put 5% or more on advanced AI leading to human extinction or similar, and a third to a half of participants gave 10% or more.”
A balanced perspective
If nothing else, the known and potential problems function as a brake on AI enthusiasm. For now, however, the momentum marches forward as predictions abound for continued AI advances in 2024. 
For example, the New York Times states: “The AI industry this year is set to be defined by one main characteristic: A remarkably rapid improvement of the technology as advancements build upon one another, enabling AI to generate new kinds of media, mimic human reasoning in new ways and seep into the physical world through a new breed of robot.”
Ethan Mollick, writing in his One Useful Thing blog, takes a similar view: “Most likely, AI development is actually going to accelerate for a while yet before it eventually slows down due to technical or economic or legal limits.” 
The year ahead in AI will undoubtedly bring dramatic changes. Hopefully, these will include advances that improve our quality of life, such as the discovery of life saving new drugs. Likely, the most optimistic promises will not be realized in 2024, leading to some amount of pullback in market expectations. This is the nature of hype cycles. Hopefully, any such disappointments will not bring about another AI winter.

In a world grappling with racial inequalities, artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising tools for fostering equity and inclusion. By identifying and addressing biases in various areas, people are using AI to dismantle systemic barriers and promote racial equality. The process has already started, so let’s explore how AI is currently being utilized to enhance racial equality and overcome some of the historical barriers that exist.

AI in Law Enforcement and Judicial Systems
Perhaps surprisingly to some people, AI is increasingly being employed in law enforcement and judicial systems to reduce racial biases. Consider, these systems are already employing tools like COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) for risk assessment in courts to predict the likelihood of re-offending. While initially criticized for potential biases, ongoing improvements and oversight are being implemented to ensure its fairness and promote more equitable justice. In policing, AI-powered facial recognition technology is focused on reducing racial bias, contrary to people’s initial fears on how visual identification could be used. For example, IBM has developed more equitable facial recognition systems by training algorithms on diverse datasets. This approach helps in accurately identifying individuals across different racial groups, reducing instances of misidentification.

AI in Employment and Recruiting
AI is already revolutionizing the hiring process by promoting diversity and reducing unconscious biases. AI-powered tools like Entelo and HireVue analyze a candidate's experience and skills without considering factors like race or gender, enabling fairer recruitment processes. For instance, Unilever utilizes AI-driven assessments in its hiring process, which has led to a more diverse workforce. Moreover, AI is used for job advertisement targeting to reach diverse candidates. LinkedIn uses AI algorithms to ensure job ads are not biased towards a particular demographic, encouraging a diverse range of applicants.

Moreover, academic researchers leverage AI to analyze and address racial disparities. Project Implicit, a Harvard University initiative, uses AI to study implicit racial biases among individuals, providing insights that inform policies and practices in education and beyond.Shot of human hands stuck on each other between business colleagues partnershipgetty
Potential Future Applications of AI in Promoting Racial Equality
Looking ahead, AI has the potential to further promote racial equality in several innovative ways. First is bias detection in media and literature: AI could be used to analyze media content and literature for racial biases, providing insights that could inform more inclusive content creation. Second is community engagement platforms. AI-powered platforms could facilitate community discussions on racial issues, analyzing sentiments and suggestions to inform policy making. Third is enhanced language translation services. AI-driven translation services could be improved to cater to a wide range of dialects and languages, ensuring better communication and understanding across different racial groups. Fourth is AI in policy formulation: AI systems could assist policymakers in analyzing data related to racial disparities, helping in the creation of more equitable policies and programs.

AI's role in promoting racial equality is a powerful testament to the technology's potential for social good. By addressing biases in various sectors, people will benefit from AI’s help to create a more equitable world. However, the success of these efforts depends on continuous improvements in AI algorithms and ongoing human oversight to ensure fairness. As AI systems continue to evolve, our application of these capabilities in enhancing racial equality will likely expand, offering new and innovative ways to address long-standing disparities and forge a path towards a more inclusive society.

However, surprisingly, the impact will not be felt equally across countries. Advanced economies like the US and Europe face greater disruption than emerging markets and low-income nations. ""In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,"" said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in a recent blog post about the study. She warned that if AI complements high-income workers more, it could widen wealth gaps as returns to capital increase. To combat this, Georgieva recommended countries implement ""comprehensive social safety nets"" and retraining programs to support workers vulnerable to displacement. While some occupations could become fully automated by AI, it is more likely to augment human capabilities in most roles initially. Georgieva's views come as political and business leaders meet at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos this week, where AI's impact is a hot topic. The regulatory environment for AI remains in flux globally. For instance, the European Union reached a tentative deal last month on legislation governing use of the technology, including risk assessments and transparency rules. Meanwhile, the US is still evaluating its stance on AI regulation at the federal level. In related news, 2024 is already seeing a wave of layoffs from tech companies including big names like Google and Amazon. In such a scenario where layoffs are already so common, would AI only exacerbate the problem? Time will tell.","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,,,,,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-23,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/europe-ai.jpg', 'caption': 'Artificial Intelligence words are seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023.

The IMF also found that not all countries will be affected the same way. The agency is calling for a, quote, ""careful balance of policies,"" to ensure AI is applied effectively and efficiently. 
Our senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent joins us now from Los Angeles to talk through this report and what it may mean. So what did the IMF-- well, let's start with why they conducted this analysis. 
Hey, John, good evening. They conducted this analysis because AI is here to stay, and it's creating all kinds of sea changes in different industries across the globe. And so the IMF's reasoning is that they want to help countries create the right kind of policies to absorb the change and innovate on top of it. 
We're already seeing this kind of activity happening at the Senate AI Forum, for example, here in the United States. But if you take a look at what they're trying to do at the IMF, it's essentially assess 125 countries for AI readiness, and then help make recommendations, or at least share the research, so these countries can then take that and act accordingly. 
Right. So the IMF doesn't find itself in a pinch when these changes cause some of those countries to wobble economically. So what-- in this study, what kinds of jobs will be most affected by AI? 
Yeah, it's not so much of a surprise. You've seen some of this data come out before from Goldman Sachs and other places. But looking at it from the United States' perspective, 60% of jobs will be affected by AI, according to this IMF study. And the groups that will be most impacted in places like the US and the UK-- we're talking about clerical support workers, office workers, technicians, people who are in service and sales. 
And on the flip side, those who will be least likely to be-- least likely to be affected are people who work in agriculture and machine operations. But if you look at the risk and the opportunity, the IMF is saying that even though your job may be at great risk of being impacted negatively by AI, the more complementary your skill set becomes, the more opportunity you'll have to sort of evolve with it. And that's part of the recommendation here, not just for countries, but also individuals. 
Right. So there's some people might be helped by it, and others will be hurt. So does that affect-- that imbalance in AI and how it may help you-- is that going to affect income inequality? 
Absolutely. The IMF is warning that income inequality could get significantly worse if the right measures are not taken. And if you look at the populations that are most at risk, women face the most at risk when it comes to the types of jobs that many women have across the 125 countries that were studied. But unlike previous waves of automation, we should point out that this is not just an AI innovation impact that will hit the middle-class. 
This is likely to hit higher-income earners and lower-income earners with a similar sort of magnitude. And so the IMF is saying if your job is complementary with AI, then you actually have a chance to earn even more, which would create a larger wage gap, according to this assessment. 
So then finally, the IMF says that-- so we've gone from the kind of within-country inequalities, and the IMF is saying wealthier economies tend to be better equipped to handle the AI adoption, rather than, say, low-income countries. Which countries do well, and why, and how do they sort through that analysis? 
Countries that are more technologically advanced, essentially, will do better. And it will come as no surprise to you, we're talking about the United States, Singapore, Denmark. They tend to do very well. 
Now, lower-income countries will fare worse. But if you take a look at what the issues are when it comes to how you deal with-- the findings basically showed that countries tend to be better at AI adoption, compared to the lower-income countries, because they have the resources to do so. And that's why you see an overall-- not just income gap between individuals perhaps on the horizon, but also between these countries. 
So the idea here is the IMF is trying to warn and sound the alarm now, so that countries can legislate or provide regulations to sort of absorb what could be this negative impact.

 U.S. government investment in artificial intelligence (AI), which amounted to $4.38 billion in 2022, is designed to benefit not only national security and government operations but also American society. This two-pronged approach has led to discoveries about the advantages of AI in areas beyond governance, including healthcare, transportation, the environment, and others.1


 Starting with an endorsement of “man-machine cooperation” by then-President John F. Kennedy’s Science Advisory Committee in 1962, numerous presidential administrations have encouraged AI research and knowledge, including in the workforce, education, and government. These efforts included an Obama administration 2016 report titled “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence;” the Trump administration’s “American AI Initiative,” launched in 2019; and the Biden administration’s executive order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,” issued in October 2023.234


 As AI technology advances, the government is exploring ways to harness and leverage it in its operations while setting and maintaining appropriate guardrails.


Key Takeaways
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in various sectors, including government services.The U.S. government is actively harnessing AI technologies to improve its services and operations.AI offers numerous benefits in areas such as healthcare, transportation, the environment, and benefits delivery.The federal government has initiated various projects and initiatives to leverage AI technologies.Responsible use of AI in government requires establishing strong guardrails and addressing ethical and privacy concerns.
  AI Initiatives in the U.S. Government  
 President Joe Biden’s October 2023 executive order (EO) on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” provides extensive guidance for government involvement in AI.5




  Primary Directives  
 The Biden EO directs U.S. government agencies to establish safety and security standards, protect privacy, advance equity and civil rights, promote innovation and competition, and advance American AI leadership worldwide. An overview of the document’s eight primary directives follows.654


 New Standards for AI Safety and Security


 The EO directs government agencies to ensure robust, reliable, repeatable, and standardized testing and evaluations of AI systems. The administration will also help develop adequate labeling and mechanisms to ensure the origin of AI content.


 Promoting Innovation and Competition


 AI-related education, training, development, research, and capacity investments must be leveraged to address specific intellectual property (IP) questions. Agencies must promote competition by providing small developers access to technical assistance and encouraging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to exercise its authority to enforce competition and protect consumers.


 Supporting Workers


 Government departments must develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers. This will require addressing job displacement, labor standards, workplace equity, health and safety, and data collection.


 Advancing Equity and Civil Rights


 Government use of AI will comply with all federal laws and promote substantive oversight and engagement with all communities to protect against unlawful discrimination and abuse. Coordination between the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and federal civil rights offices will play a significant role in these efforts.


 Standing Up for Consumers, Patients, and Students


 To protect consumers and promote the responsible use of AI in domains such as healthcare and education, the administration will enforce existing consumer protection laws and enact safeguards against fraud, unintended bias, privacy violations, and other harmful effects. This will include advancing the responsible use of AI in developing affordable and lifesaving drugs and advancements in other health-related areas.


 Protecting Americans’ Privacy


 The lawful, secure collection, use, and retention of data must promote privacy by directing federal agencies to use privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) where beneficial. Congress is also urged to pass bipartisan data privacy legislation.


 Ensuring Responsible and Effective Government Use of AI


 Agencies will ensure the responsible government deployment of AI and work to modernize federal AI infrastructure in various domains, such as regulation, governance, benefits, procurement, and security. The government will further accelerate hiring AI professionals as part of a government-wide AI talent surge led by the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Digital Service, the U.S. Digital Corps, and the Presidential Innovation Fellowship.


 Advancing American Leadership Abroad


 Government agencies are directed to engage with international partners to develop a framework to manage AI risks while advancing American leadership in safety, security, trust, and AI development. This will include the expansion of bilateral, multilateral, and multistakeholder collaborations on AI; accelerated development and implementation of vital AI standards with international partners; and promoting safe, responsible, rights-affirming development and deployment of AI worldwide.

  Ensuring Responsible Use of AI in Government  
 Government agencies regularly call for the responsible use of AI. This includes mandates for compliance with laws that protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The benefits of AI come with potential pitfalls that create a need to establish strong guardrails to ensure AI keeps people safe and doesn’t violate individual rights.


  AI Safety and Security  
 Section 4 of the Biden EO addresses AI system vulnerabilities through the Defense Production Act of 1950. AI companies must report safety test results and other information for systems that may pose national security or infrastructure risks. Federal agencies must establish guidance and standards for safe AI development and use and promote research and collaboration to address potential risks. Workforce development plans for integrating AI technology are also required.4


  Ethical Considerations and Privacy Concerns  
 AI has raised ethical concerns about privacy, bias, accountability, and transparency. Despite ideological differences between administrations, government AI policies have attempted to address these concerns since 2016. AI systems require large amounts of data, which can raise privacy concerns. Bias can result from training AI systems on non-representative data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. AI decisions can have significant impacts on individuals, making accountability critical. The transparency of AI decision-making processes is also important for individuals to understand how and why decisions are made.4



The AI for autonomous situational awareness system is one use-case example for the Department of Homeland Security that was proposed for customs and border protection. It is intended to use Internet of Things sensors, high-resolution cameras, and motion sensors to covertly detect and analyze illicit border crossings in remote locations while creating a low-cost, low-power footprint.7
  Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Government Services  
 AI can offer several benefits to the government, such as improved efficiency, accuracy, and decision making. AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value tasks. AI can eliminate errors and inconsistencies for improved accuracy and consistency of government services. AI can facilitate data-driven and evidence-based decisions, as well as personalized and responsive services. Additionally, AI can save costs by reducing the need for manual labor and streamlining processes.68


 AI has shown benefits in specific areas, such as healthcare, transportation, the environment, and delivery of government benefits. HHS leverages AI to solve problems and improve patient outcomes. The DOT uses AI in three areas: drone operations, traffic management, and railroad safety. AI is used in the environment to monitor natural resources and predict natural disasters. AI can also reduce the workload for workers and assist caseworkers. The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses data analytics and computer systems to process claims more efficiently.91011121314


  Challenges and the Future of AI in Government Services  
 AI constantly evolves, and potential advancements include improving accuracy and efficiency, creating more human-like systems, personalizing medicine, and addressing global challenges.


 However, implementing AI in government services has several challenges, such as a lack of skilled personnel, data privacy and security concerns, integration with existing systems, and transparency and accountability. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach involving government agencies, AI developers, domain experts, and citizens. Governments need to invest in training, establish clear policies and guidelines, and engage citizens to build trust and ensure accountability.


 How Is Artificial Intelligence Being Used in Healthcare by the U.S. Government?
One of AI’s most significant applications is in medical imaging to improve accuracy and speed up diagnosis. The U.S. government also uses AI to analyze health data in order to identify trends and patterns that can inform public health policy decisions.15


 What Are the Potential Benefits of AI in Improving Transportation Services?
AI-powered technologies can be used to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall road safety. Additionally, AI can predict demand for transportation services, enabling providers to allocate resources more efficiently and reduce wait times. AI enables transportation providers to improve routes and schedules and provide more personalized services to passengers.


 What Initiatives Has the U.S. Government Undertaken to Leverage AI Technologies?
Initiatives include an Obama administration 2016 report titled “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence;” the Trump administration’s “American AI Initiative,” launched in 2019; and the Biden administration’s executive order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,” issued in October 2023.234Furthermore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been tasked with developing AI standards, while the National Science Foundation (NSF) is funding research in AI and machine learning. Additionally, several federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, are investing in AI technologies to enhance their operations and capabilities.


 What Are the Ethical Considerations and Privacy Concerns Associated with AI in Government?
Law enforcement agencies’ use of facial recognition technology has raised concerns about surveillance and potential privacy violations. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for AI to perpetuate bias and discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system. The use of AI in decision-making processes, such as those related to hiring or lending, could also have unintended consequences and reinforce existing biases.


 How Much Money Has the U.S. Government Spent on AI?
According to the most recent figures, the U.S. government spent approximately $4.8 billion on AI research and development in 2022. This includes funding for various agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy. This funding is expected to increase in the coming years, as AI plays an increasingly important role in government operations.1


  The Bottom Line  
 The potential of AI to transform government services and improve public welfare is immense. AI can help streamline bureaucratic processes, enhance decision-making capabilities, and enable more efficient delivery of public services.


 For example, AI-powered chatbots can provide 24/7 customer support, reducing wait times and improving the overall experience for citizens. AI can also be used to analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, which can inform policy decisions and resource allocation.


 By harnessing the power of AI, the government can enhance its capacity to serve its citizens and improve the overall well-being of its communities. Additionally, the use of AI in government services may be imperative to achieve efficiency, accuracy, and cost containment, especially as both the number of government services and the population continue to expand.


 While advantages of AI—especially in healthcare, transportation, the environment, and benefits delivery—are numerous, responsible use of AI in government requires establishing strong guardrails and addressing ethical and privacy concerns.

CNN
         — 
    


            The tech sector has kicked off the new year with a spate of fresh job cuts that are coming at the same time as the industry is doubling down on investments into artificial intelligence.
    

            While AI tools putting workers out of jobs has been a major point of anxiety in Silicon Valley and beyond over the past year, not all the recent layoffs in the tech industry are directly linked to AI tools simply replacing workers.
    

            But many of the recent job cut announcements have come on the heels of those same companies disclosing major investments into AI technology as they look to reallocate resources, and a growing number of tech firms have explicitly cited AI as a reason for rethinking head counts.

            The continued labor upheaval unfolding in the very industry creating AI could point to more unrest to come as the technology is forecast to reshape the broader business landscape in the years ahead.
    

        More than 5,500 tech layoffs less than two weeks into 2024


            The latest rounds of tech job cuts are occurring across a range of roles and in both Big Tech companies and smaller startups.
    

            Tech giants Google and Amazon both announced sweeping layoffs this week impacting hundreds of workers across various business divisions. News of the job cuts at Google and Amazon come months after both companies separately announced multi-billion-dollar investments into AI startup Anthropic.
    

            Also this week, social platform Discord said it was trimming 17% of its staff. Unity Software, the maker of technology used in popular mobile games such as Pokemon Go, said it was cutting 25% of its workforce. And the language-learning app Duolingo said it laid off around 10% of its contract workers.

Silicon Valley’s greatest minds misread pandemic demand. Now their employees are paying for it.




            All told, there have been more than 5,500 tech employees who have lost their jobs less than two weeks into 2024, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi.
    

            And the latest cuts in tech come after a very painful two years for the industry, marked by hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs amid a reset in pandemic-induced demand.


            There were some 262,682 tech industry layoffs recorded in 2023, per Layoffs.fyi data, after 164,969 cuts the previous year.
    

        Pandemic demand recoils as AI anxiety takes hold


            Roger Lee, a startup founder who has long been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, told CNN that many tech companies are still trying to “correct for their overhiring during the pandemic surge.”
    

            The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to skyrocketing demand for digital services as people around the world were forced to work, socialize and shop from home. Against that backdrop, the tech industry went on a remarkable hiring spree. But as pandemic restrictions eased in the years that followed and broader macroeconomic uncertainty set in, the tech industry saw its greatest retraction since the dotcom bust of 2000, cutting tens of thousands of jobs in rapid succession.

            While Lee says the high interest rate environment and tech downturn have lasted longer than initially expected, he adds that “an increasing number of tech companies have cited AI as reason for layoffs.”
    

            Last year, companies including Chegg, IBM and Dropbox cited the onset of AI as a reason to rethink staffing. More recently, Duolingo and even Google have suggested the same as they seek to mobilize resources to capitalize on the AI boom.
    

            As the full extent of AI’s impact to the labor market is still revealing itself, researchers have said that hundreds of millions of jobs globally could be impacted, though the tech could simultaneously have the potential to create new and different jobs in the future.
    

            Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note last March that as many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could be lost or diminished by the rise of generative AI technology and that white-collar workers appeared to be most at risk. Separate research also indicates that women’s jobs could be disproportionately impacted by businesses’ adoption of AI in the years ahead.
    

        Disparate impacts of tech job cuts come under scrutiny


            As the tech industry layoffs continue, labor advocates and even lawmakers are taking notice.
    

            The Google workers who lost their jobs this week were shocked to find out via email that they were being laid off, according to Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the grassroots Alphabet Workers Union, a CWA-affiliated group that is organizing workers throughout Google’s parent company Alphabet.
    

            Koul slammed the layoffs as “unnecessary and counterproductive” in a statement to CNN on Friday that blasted “corporate greed.”
    

            “The layoffs introduce chaos and instability into the workplace and force workers to make do with less,” Koul added, saying even those that remain on the job “work in constant anxiety that they will be next.”
    

            Google, for its part, has said that the cuts were to help the teams “become more efficient and work better,” and that it is supporting impacted employees “as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.”
    

            Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have recently taken aim at reports of the tech layoffs’ disparate effects on certain workers.

            A coalition of more than two dozen Black lawmakers led by Democratic Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Barbara Lee of California expressed concerns over the “impacts of widespread layoffs within the tech industry and its disproportionate impacts on the African American community and women” in a letter late last month to acting Labor Secretary Julie Su that was obtained by CNN.
    

            “Recent findings have consistently shown that minorities and women are vastly overrepresented in industry layoffs,” the letter said.
    

            The lawmakers pressed the Department of Labor to pay closer attention to these ongoing mass layoffs and to do more to protect the workers most at risk of losing their livelihoods.

While AI tools putting workers out of jobs has been a major point of anxiety in Silicon Valley and beyond over the past year, not all the recent layoffs in the tech industry are directly linked to AI tools simply replacing workers. But many of the recent job cut announcements have come on the heels of those same companies disclosing major investments into AI technology as they look to reallocate resources, and a growing number of tech firms have explicitly cited AI as a reason for rethinking head counts. The continued labor upheaval unfolding in the very industry creating AI could point to more unrest to come as the technology is forecast to reshape the broader business landscape in the years ahead. More than 5,500 tech layoffs less than two weeks into 2024 The latest rounds of tech job cuts are occurring across a range of roles and in both Big Tech companies and smaller startups. Tech giants Google and Amazon both announced sweeping layoffs this week impacting hundreds of workers across various business divisions. News of the job cuts at Google and Amazon come months after both companies separately announced multi-billion-dollar investments into AI startup Anthropic. Also this week, social platform Discord said it was trimming 17% of its staff. Unity Software, the maker of technology used in popular mobile games such as Pokemon Go, said it was cutting 25% of its workforce. And the language-learning app Duolingo said it laid off around 10% of its contract workers. All told, there have been more than 5,500 tech employees who have lost their jobs less than two weeks into 2024, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi. And the latest cuts in tech come after a very painful two years for the industry, marked by hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs amid a reset in pandemic-induced demand. There were some 262,682 tech industry layoffs recorded in 2023, per Layoffs.fyi data, after 164,969 cuts the previous year. Pandemic demand recoils as AI anxiety takes hold Roger Lee, a startup founder who has long been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, told CNN that many tech companies are still trying to “correct for their overhiring during the pandemic surge.” The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to skyrocketing demand for digital services as people around the world were forced to work, socialize and shop from home. Against that backdrop, the tech industry went on a remarkable hiring spree. But as pandemic restrictions eased in the years that followed and broader macroeconomic uncertainty set in, the tech industry saw its greatest retraction since the dotcom bust of 2000, cutting tens of thousands of jobs in rapid succession. While Lee says the high interest rate environment and tech downturn have lasted longer than initially expected, he adds that “an increasing number of tech companies have cited AI as reason for layoffs.” Last year, companies including Chegg, IBM and Dropbox cited the onset of AI as a reason to rethink staffing. More recently, Duolingo and even Google have suggested the same as they seek to mobilize resources to capitalize on the AI boom. As the full extent of AI’s impact to the labor market is still revealing itself, researchers have said that hundreds of millions of jobs globally could be impacted, though the tech could simultaneously have the potential to create new and different jobs in the future. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note last March that as many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could be lost or diminished by the rise of generative AI technology and that white-collar workers appeared to be most at risk. Separate research also indicates that women’s jobs could be disproportionately impacted by businesses’ adoption of AI in the years ahead. Disparate impacts of tech job cuts come under scrutiny As the tech industry layoffs continue, labor advocates and even lawmakers are taking notice. The Google workers who lost their jobs this week were shocked to find out via email that they were being laid off, according to Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the grassroots Alphabet Workers Union, a CWA-affiliated group that is organizing workers throughout Google’s parent company Alphabet. Koul slammed the layoffs as “unnecessary and counterproductive” in a statement to CNN on Friday that blasted “corporate greed.” “The layoffs introduce chaos and instability into the workplace and force workers to make do with less,” Koul added, saying even those that remain on the job “work in constant anxiety that they will be next.” Google, for its part, has said that the cuts were to help the teams “become more efficient and work better,” and that it is supporting impacted employees “as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.” Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have recently taken aim at reports of the tech layoffs’ disparate effects on certain workers. A coalition of more than two dozen Black lawmakers led by Democratic Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Barbara Lee of California expressed concerns over the “impacts of widespread layoffs within the tech industry and its disproportionate impacts on the African American community and women” in a letter late last month to acting Labor Secretary Julie Su that was obtained by CNN. “Recent findings have consistently shown that minorities and women are vastly overrepresented in industry layoffs,” the letter said.

AI's impact on jobs: AI is expected to create more opportunities than it renders obsolete, particularly in STEM jobs, according to Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera. AI has opened doors for more hiring, increased the above-average performance bar, and will boost remote opportunities in India.





    Premium Coursera CEO Jeff Maggioncalda, says AI is helping eliminate the parity of capabilities between an above-average performer and a weak performer.

Experts assess sector-wise impact | Mint,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Human vs AI: STEM jobs are expected to rise in opportunities, Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO of Coursera, told LiveMint, while answering the question of whether AI is going to create more jobs than it renders obsolete.However, there is no straightforward answer to the question of the overall number of opportunities AI will create in comparison to the number of jobs it will end or change. Maggioncalda highlighted the need to look at this through the lens of specific sectors. Speaking on AI's impact on Coursera hiring, he said that it has only opened doors for more hiring, mostly for a developers' profile.Maggioncalda also highlighted that AI is helping eliminate the parity of capabilities between an above-average performer and a weak performer.The use of AI also increased the above-average performance bar, the CEO further added. Additionally, AI will also boost remote opportunities in India for the next few years as people become more equipped with the help of AI.Raghav Gupta, Managing Director, India, and APAC, Coursera, added that emerging technologies like Generative AI are transforming the way people learn, teach, and work.“Not using AI is like not using Google or Spreadsheet,” said, Maggioncalda, emphasising the importance of implementing AI.Sharing the use case of radiologists, Maggioncalda said that radiologists also use computer vision (CV)–a specialised field of artificial intelligence to predict diseases accurately. “We still need radiologists, despite the introduction of AI to detect the diseases.”AI will increase opportunities overall. ""Earlier, we had 4 content developers, and now we only have 1 content developer. However, we hired over double the tech developers,” Ajay Setia, CEO of InvincibleMeta.AI, noted.As of now, for the next 10-15 years, Setia expects that AI will create more opportunities until the world gets introduced to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) because AI needs to be fed data to generate output. Meanwhile, AGI is expected to create its own data.In the future, with technological advancement, Setia expects to see artificial superintelligence (ASI), which can eliminate the need for humans to feed data, but that is still around 50 years away.“Current Gen AI is the weakest version of AI. We're in the first stage,” Setia added.India has the potential to add USD 359 billion to USD 438 billion to its GDP on account of Gen AI adoption in 2029-2030, which is above estimates, according to a report ‘The AIdea of India’ by EY. This means adding 5.9 per cent-7.2 per cent to the country's GDP for the same period.Meanwhile, AI adoption will contribute around USD 1.2 trillion to 1.5 trillion to India's cumulated GDP over seven years.Approximately 69 per cent of the overall impact of Gen AI is expected to come from business services, including IT, legal, consulting, outsourcing, rental, financial services, transportation, logistics, education, retail trade and healthcare, the report further added.“Intellectual property debates rage, with questions about AI’s creative ownership and rights of human creators. While such fears are normal, given the capabilities demonstrated by Gen AI tools, it is far more likely, as our survey suggests, that rather than Gen AI supplanting humans, it will be ‘humans + Gen AI’ that will boost productivity, bring greater visual and audio magic, and help improve monetization of products and services,” the EY report explained.AI's impact on media &amp; entertainment sectorIndia’s Media &amp; Entertainment sector stands at the cusp of a Gen AI revolution. The journey ahead, while challenging, is replete with opportunities. With the right blend of policy, innovation, and ethical considerations, the report added that a new era of Indian storytelling beckons.AI's impact on healthcare sectorIn an environment marked by significant demand-supply disparities and a severe shortage of both clinical and non-clinical talent (e.g., only 64 doctors per 100,000 patients compared to the global average of 150 per 100,000), Gen AI holds the potential to augment the healthcare system’s capabilities and accelerates the transformation of diagnostics, treatments, and patient care. Over 48 per cent of healthcare organisations that participated in the EY survey said that they are likely to implement AI in a year.AI's impact on retail sectorMore than 50 per cent of respondents in this sector believe that Gen AI will have a huge impact on the entire value chain, making it more efficient and responsive to market dynamics. In India, the survey reveals that while a small 6 per cent have already implemented Gen AI, a staggering 71 per cent in the retail sector plan to adopt it within the next 12 months. By 2025, Gen AI could potentially elevate the retail sector’s profitability by 20 per cent.AI's impact on technology servicesOver two-thirds of the tech CXOs in the study said Gen AI would have a significant impact (medium to high) on their business, with about 86 per cent having already implemented Gen AI or looking to implement it within a year. Access to the tool increased productivity (issues resolved per hour) by 14 per cent on average. For novice and low-skilled workers, the improvement was 35 per cent but with minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers.AI's impact on government and public servicesAccording to the EY survey, about 70 per cent of respondents from the GPS sector see a medium-high impact of Gen AI on their functioning, while about 50 per cent expect to implement Gen AI in the next 12 months.&nbsp;AI's impact on financial servicesGlobally, most financial institutions anticipate that fully harnessing the automation potential of Gen AI may require a considerable amount of time, ranging from 5 to 10 years, the survey added.“Financial institutions have recognised the transformative potential of Gen AI, as evidenced by the fact that about 78 per cent of the respondents in the survey have either put the technology into practice in at least one use-case or have plans to pilot it over the next 12 months,” as per the EY report.","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to impact nearly 40% of global jobs, with advanced economies expected to bear a greater share of the consequences compared to emerging markets and low-income countries, according to an analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported by Bloomberg.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva wrote in a blog post that, in most scenarios, AI is likely to exacerbate overall inequality and called for proactive measures by policymakers to prevent the technology from further intensifying social tensions.
The impact of AI on income inequality will hinge on how well the technology complements high earners. Increased productivity from high-income workers and companies could widen the wealth gap, Georgieva explained.

According to the IMF chief, countries should implement ""comprehensive social safety nets"" and retraining programs for vulnerable workers to mitigate these effects.
The IMF report, published on Sunday (14 January) evening, highlighted that, while there is potential for AI to fully replace some jobs, the more probable scenario is that it will complement human work. Advanced economies may witness about 60% of jobs affected, surpassing the impact on emerging and low-income countries.




However, the report noted that only half of the jobs affected by AI will face negative consequences; the rest may benefit from enhanced productivity gains due to AI integration.
""Your job may disappear altogether - not good - or artificial intelligence may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,"" Georgieva wrote.


Georgieva's comments align with discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where global business and political leaders are deliberating on AI. Some companies have raised concerns among employees by investing heavily in AI, with examples such as Buzzfeed Inc. using AI for content creation and restructuring its news department.


While the European Union has reached a tentative deal on AI legislation, the US is still considering its federal regulatory stance on the matter.
The IMF report predicts that emerging markets and developing economies will experience a smaller initial impact from AI on labour markets but are also less likely to benefit from the productivity gains that AI integration may bring.


The IMF chief stressed the importance of helping low-income countries seize the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence.
While addressing the potential challenges of AI, she acknowledged its tremendous opportunity for everyone.
She also acknowledged the need for an AI-related productivity boost to sustain global economic growth, emphasising the importance of unlocking productivity for a positive global narrative.
The IMF is set to publish updated economic forecasts later this month, indicating that the global economy is broadly on track to meet previous projections.
Georgieva cautioned that 2024 is likely to be a ""very tough year"" for fiscal policy worldwide due to countries addressing debt burdens from the Covid-19 pandemic and managing depleted buffers.
With billions of people heading to the polls this year, Georgieva expressed concern that governments might face pressure to increase spending or cut taxes to gain popular support, potentially undermining progress made in the fight against high inflation.

A Seattle-area nonprofit helping disadvantaged job seekers around the world is adding generative artificial intelligence to the toolkit for its participants. 
The Global Mentorship Initiative is teaching college students and recent graduates how to use digital tools that are  powered by technology including ChatGPT and GPT-4 to more easily and successfully land jobs, starting with the job search and application all the way through the interview process to sending thank you emails. 
“This is a new opportunity for students in these high unemployment areas,” said Jon Browning, founder and CEO of the Global Mentorship Initiative, which is based in Bellevue, Wash.
The program is conducted virtually through video conferences. It has partnerships with more than 50 colleges and universities that refer students for mentoring. Close to 6,000 students from 100 countries are in the program, with about one-quarter in the U.S., half in African countries, and the rest in other countries and areas with high unemployment rates. Global Mentorship Initiative also works with refugee students. 
The initiative has 5,000 volunteer mentors in 127 countries, with about 1,000 of those coming from Microsoft. 
Browning himself was a Microsoft employee for 24 years, leaving as a director in 2014. He took a role at the Rockefeller Foundation, working to bring tech jobs to underserved youth in Africa. Through the effort, he was struck by the need to provide mentorship to bridge the gap between educated young people and employment opportunities. So Browning created the initiative, which launched in 2019. 
The program pairs mentors with college students prepping for jobs, guiding them through the process with a scripted playbook that spans 12 sessions. 



The Global Mentorship Initiative last year adopted generative AI curriculum following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022, followed by the more powerful GPT-4.  
In March of last year, Microsoft disclosed it was using OpenAI’s technology in its Bing search engine. It created Microsoft Copilot, allowing Bing users to pose detailed queries and receive highly specific, footnoted answers. Users could provide prompts that produced written responses and images. 
Browning recognized the potential impact of the AI tools and the team began developing these resources for Global Mentorship Initiative. By June, the program had primers on the new technology, describing how it could be useful, while also explaining how the models are trained and cautioning students to watch for biases, errors and exaggerations. The initiative created a library of queries for basic job-searching tasks using Bing’s Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT. 
Sample questions include:

What are the keywords I should use in my resume/CV for a project manager job at an IT company in <country>?
Write a cover letter for this job. Below is the job description and my resume/CV.
What are the most common interview questions for project managers applying to <company>? How should I answer these questions based on my resume/CV below?
Is there an organization in <country> that lends clothes for job interviews?
What should I do if I get a bad work performance review?

The Global Mentorship Initiative this fall also partnered with 300 Microsoft employees over two months to generate 800 suggested queries for pursuing specific tech jobs. 
The organization is supported by corporate sponsorships and grants, and its backers include Microsoft, LinkedIn, Expedia, healthcare provider Providence and others. 
The initiative’s work was particularly timely given the expansion of remote employment opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. But college graduates in the U.S. and abroad weren’t necessarily prepped with the professional skills for landing the roles.  
Numerous African countries, for example, are providing greater access to education and producing “hundreds of thousands of graduates every year,” Browning said. “[But] they are not prepared to compete on a global stage for a job or remote work.”

Brianna Chambers, an international relations major at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, completed the program, which she calls “a masterclass in entering the workforce.” It helped with building her personal brand on LinkedIn and offered important advice on professional workplace conduct to establish credibility.
Chambers, who graduates in the fall, wants to work with aid organizations in navigating international trade regulations and tariffs, or as a foreign service officer to promote her country.
“I feel more than prepared for my job search,” she said by email, “which I will be starting promptly.”
The Global Mentorship Initiative is continuing to grow its efforts to fill in students’ knowledge gaps, expanding to reach 10,000 young people by the end of this year. Browning wants to create resources for teachers and professors to use in classrooms, scaling the program beyond one-on-one mentorships. He’d like to include students in trade programs as well. 
“Everybody needs to know how to get a job,” Browning said. “And it doesn’t matter if you’re a programmer or you’re an electrician, you need to know how to land a job.”

Around 26% percent of jobs in India are “highly exposed” to disruption by artificial intelligence, or AI, in the foreseeable future, according to a recent analysis published by the International Monetary Fund. Globally, the number stands at 40% for all jobs, while in developed economies, 60% of jobs are similarly susceptible.The analysis cites data from India’s Periodic Labour Force Survey to state that most of the country’s jobs fall in the low-exposure category. This is because the majority of workers are “craftspeople, skilled agricultural workers, and low-skilled, or ‘elementary’ workers.”  Essentially, jobs in India are therefore less likely to be impacted by artificial intelligence.However, the analysis cautions that professionals, managers, clerical support workers, technicians and those working in service and sales jobs face the highest risk from artificial intelligence in the country. India was also found to be an exception to a global trend of jobs held by women being more likely to be impacted by artificial intelligence. “[This] may be attributed to high shares of women in agricultural jobs, especially in countries where the farming sector is large [for example, India],” the analysis states.On the other hand, advanced economies are highly exposed to artificial intelligence because of the predominance of “cognitive-intense” jobs. These markets will “experience the benefits and pitfalls of artificial intelligence sooner than emerging markets”, said the analysis.To measure the risk that AI poses to job markets, the analysis considered the factor of “AI complementarity”. It said that AI would not necessarily render some jobs obsolete but could enhance their productivity.“AI complementarity suggests that...about half [of jobs] may be negatively affected by AI while the rest could benefit,” the anaysis found, waarning that this could have lopsided benefits. “The correlation between earnings and potential complementarity...suggests that AI’s gains will likely disproportionately accrue to higher-income earners, especially in countries such as India,” said the analysis.In a blog post about the findings of the analysis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva emphasised the need to draft a “set of policies to safely leverage the vast potential of AI” in both advanced and emerging markets.“In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” Georgiva wrote.Also read: A technology lawyer suggests how artificial intelligence can benefit every Indian tangiblyIndia’s scaling up of AI could reproduce casteist bias, discrimination against women and minorities

Apple has decided to shut down a 121-member artificial intelligence team based in San Diego.
The team is to be relocated to a site in Austin, and members have been given time until the end of February to choose to move.

Apple Inc. is shuttering operations on a team related to artificial intelligence operations in San Diego, which is expected to result in many employees being terminated from their posts. Apple has decided to move the entire team’s operations to Austin, Texas. Consequently, any employees who are unwilling to make the move are likely to be let go.
The team known as the Data Operations Annotations has been key to the operations and success of Siri, the company’s digital assistant, used by several million device users worldwide. It has members worldwide, including Spain, China, India, and Ireland. The San Diego team focuses on using Siri in French, Hebrew, English, Arabic, Spanish, and Portuguese.

The move is likely to result in many of the team members exiting the company owing to the long-distance move and the short notice for relocation. However, members willing to make the move would retain their roles and are offered stipends worth $7000. Members of the AI team could also potentially apply for other roles within the company.
The potential layoffs will also continue the trend of job cuts that have come from other tech giants, including Google, Amazon, X, Citigroup, and more. The growing role of AI in organizations is only expected to exacerbate the issue in the coming months and years. Apple is also expected to unveil its plans for its own large language models by June 2024.

to boost flagging productivity levels and fuel global growth, the IMF chief told AFP.AI will affect 60 percent of jobs in advanced economies, the International Monetary Fund&#039;s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said in an interview in Washington, shortly before departing for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.With AI expected to have less effect in developing countries, around &quot;40 percent of jobs globally are likely to be impacted,&quot; she said, citing a new IMF report.&quot;And the more you have higher skilled jobs, the higher the impact,&quot; she added.However, the IMF report published on Sunday evening notes that only half of the jobs impacted by AI will be negatively affected; the rest may actually benefit from enhanced productivity gains due to AI. &quot;Your job may disappear altogether -&ndash; not good &ndash;- or artificial intelligence may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,&quot; Georgieva said. UNEVEN EFFECTSThe IMF report predicted that, while labor markets in emerging markets and developing economies will see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the enhanced productivity that will arise through its integration in the workplace.   &quot;We must focus on helping low income countries in particular to move faster to be able to catch the opportunities that artificial intelligence will present,&quot; Georgieva told AFP. &quot;So artificial intelligence, yes, a little scary. But it is also a tremendous opportunity for everyone,&quot; she said. The IMF is due to publish updated economic forecasts later this month which will show the global economy is broadly on track to meet its previous forecasts, she said.  It is &quot;poised for a soft landing,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;monetary policy is doing a good job, inflation is going down, but the job is not quite done.&quot;&quot;So we are in this trickiest place of not easing too fast or too slow,&quot; she said.The global economy could use an AI-related productivity boost, as the IMF predicts it will continue growing at historically muted levels over the medium term. &quot;God, how much we need it,&quot; Georgieva said. &quot;Unless we figure out a way to unlock productivity, we as the world are not for a great story.&quot; &#039;TOUGH YEAR&#039; AHEADGeorgieva said 2024 is likely to be &quot;a very tough year&quot; for fiscal policy worldwide, as countries look to tackle debt burdens accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic, and rebuild depleted buffers.Billions of people are also due to go to the polls this year, putting additional pressure on governments to either raise spending or cut taxes to win popular support.  &quot;About 80 countries are going to have elections, and we know what happens with pressure on spending during election cycles,&quot; she added. The concern at the IMF, Georgieva said, is that governments around the world spend big this year and undermine the hard-won progress they have made in the fight against high inflation.&quot;If monetary policy tightens and fiscal policy expands, going against the objective of bringing inflation down, we might be for a longer ride,&quot; she added. CONCENTRATING ON THE JOBGeorgieva, whose five-year term at the IMF&#039;s helm is set to end this year, refused to be drawn on whether she intends to run for a second stint leading the international financial institution. &quot;I have a job to do right now and my concentration is on doing that job,&quot; she said. &quot;It has been a tremendous privilege to be the head of the IMF during a very turbulent time, and I can tell you I&#039;m quite proud of how the institution coped,&quot; she continued. &quot;But let me do what is in front of me right now.&quot;Published By: Shweta KumariPublished On: Jan 15, 2024Tune InALSO READ |  AI&#039;s impact in education: Balance between innovation and digital safetyMust Watch","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.story-kicker']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'http://schema.org/True', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202401/imf-chief-152000645-16x9_0.png?VersionId=pKuukthE5T0ygkHywIOV7UDuRkX92Ujp?size=1200:675', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'description': '&quot;Your job may disappear altogether\xa0-– not good –- or AI may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,&quot; IMF chief said.\xa0(Photo: AFP)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'India Today', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/'}","{'@id': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/author/agence-france-presse', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Agence France-Presse'}",,,,,

BenchSci Layoffs: 17% of staff axed, investing in generative AI



January 12, 2024








BenchSci, a Toronto-based artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical startup, has confirmed to BetaKit that it has eliminated 17 per cent of its workforce, or 70 jobs.
What’s happening at BenchSci?
In a recent LinkedIn post, BenchSci said the decision to trim its headcount is a result of “shifts in the economic environment, operational efficiencies, and adaptation to technological advancements, specifically Generative AI.”
“We believe that Generative AI will continue to reshape preclinical R&D and have a substantial positive impact on our customers,” the post reads.
“As we look towards our future, these changes will allow us to further our investment in Generative AI and work toward making drug discovery more efficient and help bring new medicine to patients faster.”
Several staff members commented on BenchSci’s post — claiming that they had been let go.
According to the company’s LinkedIn page, it employs more than 340 people in Canada.
Termination agreements for BenchSci employees
In Canada, non-unionized employees at BenchSci are owed full severance pay when they lose their jobs due to downsizing, corporate restructuring, or the closure of the business.
This includes individuals working full-time, part-time, or hourly in Ontario, Alberta, and B.C.
People working “on contract” or as a contractor may also be owed severance pay — given that many employees in Canada are often misclassified as independent contractors.
Severance can be as much as 24 months’ pay, depending on a number of factors.

WATCH: Employment lawyer Lior Samfiru explains what rights employees have if they are being fired or let go on an episode of the Employment Law Show.


Before you accept any severance offer, have an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP review it and your employment contract.
If you don’t receive the correct amount, which happens often, you have been wrongfully dismissed and should take legal action.
Non-unionized employees in Canada have up to two years from the date of their dismissal to pursue proper severance pay.

When any major new technology grabs the headlines, talk quickly turns to jobs. And so it is with generative AI. How will generative AI affect jobs? What’s the potential scale of job displacement? I’ve written extensively on this subject, but what I’d really like to emphasize in this article is the potential for generative AI to create entirely new jobs.


Rather than replace human workers, generative AI is going to create a new need for skilled workers – professionals with the ability to manage and get the best out of generative AI. What might those jobs look like? Here’s a list of emerging roles related to generative AI.

AI Prompt Engineer
Prompt engineers are experts at getting generative AI applications like ChatGPT to deliver a specific output. (For example, a generic prompt will elicit a generic response, so a prompt engineer will refine their prompts until they get the desired result.) As such, rather than being experts in programming, prompt engineers need strong communication skills, attention to detail, critical thinking, and data skills (in terms of working out what info the AI needs).

PROMOTED
Generative Design Specialist
A bit like a prompt engineer but focusing on design outputs, this role will become increasingly popular across fields like architecture, product design, and engineering. In a nutshell, because generative AI can be used to create almost limitless design variations, experts will be needed to guide the AI and interpret its outputs to achieve optimal designs.

AI Input And Output Manager
Think of this role as the next level up from a prompt engineer – a more strategic role that oversees the information being uploaded to generative AI systems and the outputs that AI systems deliver. This will become increasingly important as companies grapple with considerations around data privacy, copyright, AI explainability, and AI bias.

AI Content Reviewer/Content Auditor
Across all forms of content – such as written articles, visual designs, and analysis reports – human reviewers will be needed to assess the quality, accuracy, and appropriateness of content. So, while we will undoubtedly see generative AI being used to create more and more content, we still need humans to ensure that content is fit for purpose.

AI Trainer
These are professionals who specialize in “teaching” and refining AI models. Their tasks can range from feeding the AI data, to fine-tuning its outputs to ensure accuracy and relevance.

AI Maintenance Engineer
Like any system, AI models require upkeep in terms of updating models, ensuring systems run efficiently, and troubleshooting issues. Generative AI is no different.
AI Security Specialist
The cybersecurity landscape is becoming a whole lot more complicated thanks to AI, with the technology enabling more sophisticated phishing attacks, malware, and more. Organizations will therefore need experts who can defend systems against the malicious use of AI – and potentially harness AI to mitigate threats.
AI Instructor/AI Literacy Educator
Just as computer literacy became a fundamental skill in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, AI literacy will become crucial going forward. Instructors who can teach individuals about AI’s workings, benefits, and challenges are emerging.
AI Ethicist/AI Ethics Officer
Given the powerful capabilities of GenAI, there’s a clear need for professionals who can ensure that these systems are developed and used ethically, without biases, and in ways that are socially responsible. So, part of an AI ethicist’s remit will be to create and implement guidelines that govern an organization’s ethical, safe use of AI systems.
AI Compliance Manager/AI Compliance Officer
If an ethicist’s role is about shaping the ethical use of AI, the compliance manager’s role is to ensure those guidelines are properly followed. Plus, as regulation and scrutiny around AI increases, organizations will need dedicated compliance professionals to ensure the business is acting within legal frameworks.
AI Personality Designer
As more and more generative AI tools emerge, it makes sense that these tools will need their own unique “personalities” to differentiate them from the competition. As such, we could see a new role emerge dedicated to creating engaging, likable personalities for generative AI entities. This will make interactions with generative AI tools feel more human-like.
Custom AI Solution Developer
While many AI applications might be broad, there’s a growing market for custom, niche AI solutions tailored to specific industry needs or challenges. Indeed, this is already happening, with many organizations partnering with AI companies to create their own bespoke, internal models built on publicly available models.
The Final Takeaway
As generative AI continues to evolve, new job roles will emerge that center around guiding, refining, and interpreting AI – not to mention integrating its capabilities into various sectors. That’s not to downplay the fact that many jobs will be altered or made obsolete by generative AI. But rather than focusing on generative AI solely as a job disruptor, we should also recognize it as a job creator.

There is a bit of impatience in the higher education sector to “do something” about generative AI.
In the last year, academics and leaders have been exhorted to bolster academic integrity in the face of new AI tools, prevent misconduct, integrate AI into the curriculum, and ensure assessments are AI-proof – while simultaneously implementing measures to reorient their courses and curricula to exploit the many advantages generative AI offers.
The positive potential of generative AI is, of course, the same potential that directly links to concerns about assessment integrity – AI authored essays, code snippets and software, graphics, audio, posters, and video.
As engineering educators, we are instinctively inclined to welcome new technology tools and to be progressive in assessment formats. The engineering curriculum offers a wealth of opportunity for innovative and authentic assessment formats including designs, portfolios, test reports, specifications, code, and business cases as well as traditional exams and the occasional essay.
However, at this genesis of accessible and widespread generative AI, we lack authority, governance, and visibility of these tools to understand how they work. It is with this in mind that we urge special caution in the integration of generative AI, specifically in two main areas: creative work (which includes engineering), and work-based learning.
The question of creativity
In creative work, we ask students to innovate through objects, designs, written works; it is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding activities of learning and assessment, and used well it can evidence high levels of competence and achievement due to the inherent recognition of the steps taken along the creative journey to produce the end artefact.
When directed through generative AI, the work becomes embellished by the public corpus of work that the AI model has learnt from. This raises questions. Firstly, to what extent is generative AI truly inspiring and developing a learner’s creative skill, if self-formulated ideas are being filtered, and possibly diluted, with the consensus of public work held by the model.
At present these tools offer no transparency into the process they follow and how they reach the conclusions they present, effectively degrading the learner’s creative journey to a series of keyboard taps and a few strategic clicks.
Secondly, at the point at which work is loaded through generative AI, this now forms a part of the public corpus that the model derives its learning from – raising the question of who now owns the intellectual property and any further iteration of that work.
There might be further ramifications of using AI-enabled assessments particularly with regards to fairness and inherent biases. Since these AI tools have been trained on public corpus, they assimilate underlying biases, including but not limited to racial, gender and other forms of discriminatory text which can then trickle into grading and assessments.
Confidential matters
In engineering, the workplace is a powerful and frequently integral part of the learning experience, whether through an apprenticeship, an industrial placement year or industrially located project. Here, at the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology, our students are comprehensively inducted to a broad range of project work, spanning a wider range of engineering disciplines for which they build and refine their workplace competencies.
Provision of opportunities to gain professional experience is considered best practice by PSRBs and greatly add to student employability, their sense of their own direction, and identity as engineers.
However, this workplace activity may be in a work context where there would be strong security or commercial sensitivities. Across different institutions, we have supervised students who have worked in – for example – nuclear reprocessing, commercial aeronautics, agriculture, or innovative materials.
When these students return to their course and seek to evidence their workplace learning, it is usual for a student to negotiate a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in respect of what they can and cannot share with their university supervisor and the wider university community. It goes without saying that uploading any such material to a generative AI tool to – for example – aid compilation of a portfolio, technical poster, or reflective report would compromise the confidentiality the student had promised and could inadvertently place the institution in a precarious legal position.
These dual issues – of confidentiality and intellectual property relating to generative AI – are still in their infancy. In August this year, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Enterprise as a way of attempting to mitigate some of the concerns around data and security by allowing organisations to tailor the period with which internal data lives in the model, provide different levels of data access and prevent business-critical data from becoming foundational to a model’s training.
In the theoretical instances where a business allows such data to be used with generative AI, you can foresee such configurations coming at a significant expense, with responsible universities needing to pay to ensure there are appropriate safeguards in place.
If institutions are to encourage students to utilise generative AI in the innovative ways they are currently calling for, this would likely involve commercial data. However, in reality, the prospect of a business willingly sharing cutting-edge commercial data is unfathomable until generative AI tools afford greater visibility and clarity of internal workings, rather than the current black box (input/output) experience they offer. This calls for distributed control with industry taking ownership of their own models with formalisation of their own protocol(s) and governance structures to support the use of business data confidentially.
And what about students who have produced their own designs or creative work? It is still unclear whether ChatGPT (for example) is trained on copyrighted material.
Cases are still working their way through the courts, for example bestselling household-name fiction and non-fiction authors John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and Julian Sancton who have taken legal action against OpenAI. OpenAI outlined a legal strategy that proposes paying costs for clients sued for copyright infringement, as opposed to outlining an arguably more sustainable solution to take action to remove copyrighted content from their repository. In this scenario, universities embedding the use of AI in learning, teaching and assessment might have their legal costs covered by the OpenAI service provider, for as long as OpenAI pledges to commit to, but they would not be indemnified from fault.
Don’t just “lean in”
So, we urge caution. More progressive educators, educational developers, and institutions will want to lean into generative AI as an exciting teaching tool. But they should only do that when they know with clarity that generative AI is truly bolstering creativity, understanding whose data is being input, what the expectations for IP and confidentiality are, and whether those requirements can be met.
As it stands, generative AI services operate on legally unstable ground with cost models that have yet to emerge and stabilise. These are fundamental questions that can’t be answered with any real degree of confidence, and the stakes are high.

One response to “Caution is needed around generative AI, especially when work-based learning is involved”





Alan Smithee says: 

Jan 24 2024 at 3:23 pm 


Nobody wants to hear this but this is why everyone is racing into the arms of Microsoft in Higher Education because they have thought about or tried to pre-empt these questions in most areas.
For example: “In this scenario, universities embedding the use of AI in learning, teaching and assessment might have their legal costs covered by the OpenAI service provider”.
Microsoft are clear in the contractual document that there is a “Copilot Copyright commitment” – if there is a legal challenge, they are clear that they will assume responsibility. 
Same with what happens to data that is used within the organisation they are clear that it’s not used for training datasets. 
For most organisations, it’s an extension of an solid existing relationship with a mature player.

Drawing on a recent survey of academic perceptions and uses of generative AI, Richard Watermeyer, Donna Lanclos and Lawrie Phipps suggest that the potential efficiency promised by these tools disclose which work is and isn’t valued in academia.

Widespread use of generative AI tools in academia seems inevitable. This is one of the conclusions drawn from our recent study of how academics in the UK are using Large Language Models (LLMs). Through a survey of 284 UK academics we found that even those whose use of generative AI is sparse and/or tentative, anticipate the transformation of their professional lives through more efficient and economical ways of working.
At a time when academic success is determined by the speed and subsequent volume of productive output, generative AI seems to offer a way to do things more quickly. Its enthusiasts describe it as providing ‘faster ways to process data’ and in terms of how it ‘saves scientists time and money’. One respondent in our survey reported using LLMs to more than triple the number of research funding applications they had submitted within one year. Others spoke of how LLMs could be used to outsource up to 80% of their work. However, even if generative AI is increasing academics’ work-rate, it’s not clear whether its impact on workload and work quality will witness a commensurate uptick.
even if generative AI is increasing academics’ work-rate, it’s not clear whether its impact on workload and work quality will witness a commensurate uptick.
While we found in our study a common refrain of generative AI alleviating the burden and drudgery of heavy administrative loads, we found scant evidence of generative AI being used to decelerate and exploit the ‘gift of time’ for, among other things, higher order thinking and intellectual growth. Instead, our respondents talked almost exclusively about how LLMs had enhanced their productivity and capacity to meet performance demands.
It may be thus that the intercession of generative AI results not in any major disruption to the nature of academic work, but rather the further magnification of its product. This leads us to ask whether AI-enabled academics might be moving too quickly through the gears, and losing sight of the significance of tasks that are easily automated. It may be that important tasks are overlooked where generative AI is used to fast-track processes. Is the hype around generative AI consequently muddying what academics should be doing and obscuring the reward(s) of such undertaking?
We have seen how generative AI ‘helps’ write manuscripts, grant applications, presentations, e-mails, code, coursework and exam questions. Yet presently, the parameters of ‘help’ are ill-defined and unaided by the immaturity of regulatory intervention and consensus concerning the ethics of AI use. Consequently, just as generative AI may excessively help students in the realm of assessment so too may it excessively ‘help’ academics.
While the affordances of generative AI to academic work may appear obvious, recognising when generative AI should be used and when it shouldn’t, is less so. The danger is that enthusiasm for generative AI as an efficiency aid, obfuscates the tasks that academics should remain focused on. The ‘triumph’ of generative AI in terms of productivity gain may accordingly culminate (if it hasn’t already) in its indiscriminate use.
just as generative AI may excessively help students in the realm of assessment so too may it excessively ‘help’ academics.
By streamlining and removing stages of ‘process’ in academic labour, where these are delegated to machine intelligence, the iterative dimension of knowledge work loses out to ‘algorithmic conformity’, and so too constrains serendipity, happenstance and the unpredictability of scientific discovery. Research rarely pans out as it is initially conceived or intended; the greatest findings are often decided by chance. Moreover, in accelerating already hyper-stimulated work regimes in universities, generative AI may exacerbate an epidemic of burn out among academics and cause them to leave their roles in even greater numbers than are already reported. It may furthermore become as a snare to those whose employment is most precarious and contingent upon the promptness  and regularity of their output. Where generative AI further buries exhortations for slow scholarship, disincentivises the hard and long slog of intellectual inquiry, and displaces human-generated content, the contribution of the academic becomes increasingly degraded and susceptible to detraction.
Perhaps, the emergence of generative AI should then be grasped to reflect on and respond to what is already redundant in academia?
Yet these questions of technology-aided or technology-diminished contributions are useful to elucidate the extent to which academia is already automated, already dominated by a culture of profligate repetition and reproduction, ‘copy and paste’ and short-cuts to productive accumulation. Perhaps, the emergence of generative AI should then be grasped to reflect on and respond to what is already redundant in academia? Generative AI might then be assessed as, and developed into a form of help which does not deskill but reskills academics and reenergises their intellectual mission. It might also be used to enjoin a reappraisal of what really matters in academia beyond a false economy of productive efficiency and for the purpose of enculturing a new kind of adaptability among academics amidst winds of alleged change.
If not, academics’ dependency on generative AI as a means of coping with productivity demands will only likely escalate as will exploitation by those who wield precarity unashamedly for the purpose of leveraging maximum value extraction.

Excellent, and about time.
About time that academics focus on actual research and actual teaching rather than on writing grant proposals and developing teaching material.
Hopefully, a better way of awarding grants can be found, and the joy of teaching can be rediscovered.

I use it all day every day in my programming course. I could use it to save time as it can complete coursework virtually by itself.
Howeber, that would mean i don’t learn. Instead I use it as a 24 hour personal tutor. 
If I don’t unddrstand a coding concept, I ask it all the same questions as I would a human tutor.
Funnily enough fee people use it on my course, possibly due to concerns about plagiarism.
Based on the questions i heae those people ask, and based on assessment scores they don’t understand the material as well.
So tech students are either not using it, using it inneficiently or to borderline cheat, or using it as a tutor. The latter actually takes up time, but it also prepares one for the workplace where coders take every shortcut they can get.
Industry workers are doing the same job, only much faster which seems to have finally burst the ridiculous contract heavy tech market the UK has been trapped in for years.
Those contractors milking businesses by overplaying the amount of experience they have in, say Workday, are no longer commanding £750 per day.
The life-long contractors are now all feeling the pinch of having a jumpy CV, whilst complaining they can’t earn 3-4 x their permanent equivalents anymore.
Gone too are their tax dodging practices, so its going to be tough for them but I won’t shed a tear.
I just hope the UK educational institutions embrace the technology instead of falling for a get-rich-quick anti-gpt scheme as they did over the pond

Considerations for Artificial Intelligence and Employment Law
As artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies become more ubiquitous and advanced, both the advantages and potential risks they pose for employers continue to grow as well. This is especially true with regard to the use of generative AI – that is, AI that can generate original content based on data patterns. This type of AI can produce original images, text, music and designs, among other things. With the rising use of AI, we are seeing a corresponding rise in legislation, guidance and litigation addressing the use and consequences of AI. One area where this is increasingly common is the employment sphere.
AI in the Employment Cycle
More and more, employers are using AI in various aspects of the employment cycle. Recruitment is one of the stages when AI is used most, including through resume screening, video interviews, pre-employment assessment and automated candidate services. During employment, AI may be used in various ways, such as automated employee service, skill development, performance management and in various everyday work tasks.
These usages, though, can pose various risks to employers that use AI.
The Risks of AI in Employment
Title VII and Machine Learning AI
Title VII – the landmark anti-discrimination law – prohibits employers from using neutral tests or selection procedures unrelated to the position and inconsistent with business necessity when those tests or procedures disproportionately exclude persons of a protected class (i.e., race, color, religion, sex, national origin).
When such an effect results from such neutral tests or selection procedures, it is known as disparate impact or adverse impact discrimination. This type of discrimination is generally only an issue with predictive AI tools because that type of AI utilizes algorithms to recognize data patterns and make predictions – which can lead to biased results when the underlying algorithms are biased (even if inadvertently so).
In May 2023, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) released guidance specifically addressing the use of AI for employee selection processes. According to the EEOC, AI has an “adverse impact” when the selection rate for one group is “substantially” less than the selection rate for another group. The May 2023 guidance set forth the “Four-Fifths Rule” for determining what “substantially” means. The acceptance rate for a class of applicants is “substantially” different from the acceptance rate of another class of applicants if the ratio of the two rates is less than four-fifths (80%). Not only do employers need to make sure their selection processes are in line with these requirements, but they can still be liable for discriminatory selection procedures even if the AI tool used for the procedures was developed by a third party or administered by an agent. 
ADA and Machine Learning AI
Similar to what was done with Title VII, the EEOC issued guidance addressing concerns with the use of AI in interacting with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). That guidance provides three main examples of AI violating the ADA:
1. If the AI usage results in a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation – this may occur when an applicant or employee requests a reasonable accommodation and the disability is likely to make it more difficult to use the AI tool or make an assessment less accurate and the employer fails to provide an alternative format.
2. If the AI usage results in an intentional or unintentional screening out of disabled applicants – this may occur when an AI tool results in lower scores for assessments as a result of a disability, such as giving a lower rank to applicants with significant gaps in employment history or with specific speech or movement patterns.
3. If the AI system makes “disabilityrelated inquiries” or conducts “medical examinations” prior to extending a conditional offer of employment – this can also violate the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.
Labor Law and AI
The broad scope of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act’s right of employees to self-organize and bargain collectively can also be affected by AI usage. The National Labor Relations Board General Counsel issued a memo in October 2022 setting forth numerous ways the use of AI tools can violate Section 7, including when:

AI tools surveil/gather information regarding employee Section 7 activities – even if merely creating the impression of surveillance;
Employees are disciplined for protesting the use of AI tools for employee monitoring/ management;
AI tools include personality tests to evaluate an employee’s propensity to engage in protected Section 7 activities;
AI tools use algorithms to make decisions based on union representation;
AI tools use algorithms that include production quotas or efficiency standards to single out union supporters;
Employers fail to provide information about the implementation/use of AI technology to employees; and
Employers fail to bargain with employees over the implementation/use of AI technology in the workplace.

Legislative and Litigation Trends
Cybersecurity
Adding to the growing mix of guidance is November’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (EO).i Among other things, the EO addresses cybersecurity requirements that must be considered by federal agencies and AI developers given AI’s ability to be leveraged by threat actors.
Cybersecurity threats posed by AI – known as, adversarial AI – include the vivid examples highlighted by Jonathan Care in his article aptly titled, “Fight AI with AI.”
[A]n autonomous vehicle that has been manipulated could cause a serious accident, or a facial recognition system that has been attacked could misidentify individuals and lead to false arrests. These attacks can come from a variety of sources, including malicious actors, and could be used to spread disinformation, conduct cyberattacks, or commit other types of crimes.
For these and other safety and security reasons, the EO requires the establishment of an advanced cybersecurity program to develop AI tools to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical software. The EO also includes deadlines by when certain standards must be established for such things as physical and cybersecurity protections (90 days) and safety and security guidelines for use by critical infrastructure owners and operators (180 days).ii
Data Privacy
Another major concern with AI is its natural intersection with data privacy – AI usage of consumer and employee data lends itself to potential problems with maintaining the privacy of that data. At the same time, many states are taking a stronger approach to data privacy, with numerous states passing data privacy laws in the past year or so, with some of those states – including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Utah and Virginia – even specifically addressing AI in their privacy laws.
Beyond just state law, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has also exercised its authority to regulate algorithmic consumer data usage under Section 5 of the FTC Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The FTC specifically has encouraged deployers of AI to take steps to:

Ensure transparency through disclosures;
Monitor data inputs and outputs to prevent class discrimination;
Grant user-access to delete or correct personal information;
Ensure output data is accurate;
Protect the algorithm from unauthorized use or breaches;
Implement accountability structure to help maintain compliance.

The FTC further recommends that employers remove any identifying data before entering it into any AI platform.
Data privacy concerns in particular are becoming a heightened concern for employers, as courts begin to view employer obligations in protecting such data more broadly. In Ramirez v. Paradies, the Eleventh Circuit found that traditional tort law – and the duty of care, the special relationship between employers and employees, and the foreseeability of harm thereunder – could impute liability to an employer that suffered a ransomware attack on its administrative systems leading to the unauthorized disclosure of current and former employees’ social security numbers. With AI potentially increasing the collection of personal information on employees and courts and legislatures heightening scrutiny on employer protection of that information, employers should take a careful look at their processes and procedures for protecting employee data.
Automated Employment Decisions
New York City has already passed a law regulating automated employment decision tools (“AEDTs”). The law is meant to prevent bias in the use of AEDTs and requires that AEDTs undergo bias auditing within the year prior to use when (a) the employer relies “solely” on the AEDT in making employment decisions; (b) the employer relies on other factors in addition to the AEDT output but weighs the AEDT output more heavily than any other criterion; or (c) the AEDT output is used in a way that can overrule conclusions from other factors, including human decisionmaking. In addition to the bias auditing, employers must also provide notice to employees and applicants of the AEDTs’ use and publish the audit results, and they must retain AEDT records and reveal them to employees upon request. As the use of AI and AEDTs increases, an increase in this type of regulation can be expected.
Under the draft regulations, ADMT has a broad definition and includes any system, software or process (including those derived from AI) that processes personal information and uses computation, either on its own or as part of a system, to make or execute a decision or facilitate human decision-making.
Specific AI State Legislation
Many state legislatures, including those of California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont, as well as the D.C. legislature, have proposed legislation relating to the use of AI in the employment sphere. More states will likely follow suit. These laws would be expected to prohibit “algorithmic discrimination” and put in place notice and accommodation requirements for the use of AI in employment decisions.
EEOC Litigation and Settlement
In May 2022, the EEOC filed an age discrimination lawsuit against a group of affiliated companies employing English language tutors. According to the EEOC, for a brief period in the spring of 2020, those companies programmed application software to automatically reject female applicants over 55 years old and male applicants over age 60. The lawsuit alleged this screening process affected over 200 applicants who were above the programmed age thresholds. The parties reached an expansive settlement, including a consent decree subjecting the employers to various nonmonetary obligations, including providing notice of the lawsuit to high-level executives and HR employees, retaining a third-party group to conduct extensive training on all federal equal employment opportunity laws, and inviting the rejected applicants to reapply (with reporting obligations to the EEOC). It can be expected this will just be the first of many such actions by the EEOC. 
Looking Ahead
The landscape in terms of the use of AI and its regulation is constantly evolving as new technologies develop and become more accessible. With many states already working on legislation to regulate AI usage, the trend can be expected to continue moving forward. The same is true in terms of litigation – both in terms of data privacy and in AI. As has already been seen, the EEOC likely will be focused on the use of AI in employment decisions, and many more lawsuits and settlements can be expected.
Employers navigating in this new arena should keep several things in mind moving forward. Consider auditing vendor AI systems that are being used for potential biased algorithms. Conduct HR and hiring manager training on the proper use of AI systems. Limit employees’ access to AI tools to prevent misuse. Implement policies to limit AI use to preapproved circumstances. Provide notice to applications and employees of AI usage. Conduct privacy impact assessments to determine the risk to individuals and applicable mitigation measures. Update incident response plans to address the cybersecurity threats AI may pose to employee data. With an ever-changing world of AI, employers need to be prepared to handle the advancements and challenges that lie ahead.

Generative AI set to disrupt jobs



New research suggests that most jobs could be disrupted in some way by generative AI in the next ten years.
The study published on January 10th by tech consulting firm Cognizant, in collaboration with Oxford Economics, found that around 9% of the current US workforce may be displaced by the new technology. It also reported that thanks to AI, 11% of workers may lose their jobs and struggle to find new employment.
This difficulty comes as the skills workers possess for their current roles may not be easily transferable to a job market increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence.
A specialized model was used to reveal three scenarios reflecting low, middle, and high levels of AI business adoption, which first examined how quickly artificial intelligence would be utilized within a company.
The authors explain that from 2023 to 2026, users will be in the “experimentation and cautious” phase, with organizations tentatively deploying generative AI for tasks that are “manageable in scope and low in risk — like image creation, text generation for reports and emails, and code suggestions for developers.” It is expected that 13% of businesses will implement this during this period.
It is said that by 2026 to 2030, there will be a notable rise in Al’s role across a range of professions. The top-end prediction reveals that AI usage will leap from 13% to 31% in just four to eight years. The research also claims that more than half of all general managers and operations managers will be exposed to AI by this time.
The researchers also believe that after 15 years, while AI employment will continue, it is likely to slow down.
Recommendations for upskilling the workforce
The study recommends that employees are “reskilled” in order to try and protect them from job losses and to maintain a brand’s reputation. It also proposes that organizations build a robust technological infrastructure designed to accommodate the rapid pace of AI development, including policies, structures, and operating processes.
At the same time, it warns against potential bias formulated by AI. The research calls for organizations to create safeguards that minimize the risk of partiality, error, and ethically problematic decisions. Finally, it also encourages using AI to benefit employees’ lives by shortening the workday or week.
The video gaming industry has already called for guardrails against AI. In December, the game workers union at Zenimax announced that they had reached an agreement with Microsoft that “commits ZeniMax to uses of AI that augment human ingenuity and capacities, to ensure that these tools enhance worker productivity, growth, and satisfaction without causing workers harm.”

But AI is still far too expensive to replace humans in most jobs for now,  according to a study  by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The research looked into the practicalities of replacing human labour with AI in jobs in the United States where computer vision was employed, such as teachers, bakers and property appraisers.  The study found that only 23 per cent of workers’ wages could be cost-effectively replaced by AI. The researchers also predicted that it would still take decades for computer vision tasks to become financially efficient for companies, even with a 20 per cent drop in cost per year. Computer vision in AI allows machines to draw information from visual and digital inputs. In a hypothetical bakery, used as an example in the study, computer vision was used to inspect ingredients for quality control. But that task is only six per cent of their work and would cost more to install and operate the technology than for a human to perform the task.  The study, financed by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, used online surveys to gather information on roughly 1,000 visually assisted tasks in 800 occupations. It found that in many cases it was more expensive to install and maintain AI systems than for a human to perform the same tasks. “‘Machines will steal our jobs’ is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models,” the researchers said in the 45-page paper titled “Beyond AI Exposure”.  “We find that only 23 per cent of worker compensation ‘exposed’ to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems”. Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in November 2022, fears have mounted over the possibility of AI causing job losses in industries spanning the arts to banking. A Goldman Sachs report in 2023 estimated that 18 per cent of work globally could be affected by generative AI.  But last week in Davos,  OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman  said artificial general intelligence (AGI), a  hypothesised form of AI with intelligence that can perform tasks like humans,  “will change the world much less than we all think and it will change jobs much less than we all think”.

Artificial Intelligence Use Continues to Rise in Employment

Updated: Jan 24, 2024




As 2023 wound down, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by employers showed no sign of slowing down. Rather, you should prepare for an increased use and presence of AI in employment decision-making, as well as employee engagement.




Intersection of Technology and Employment Law
Throughout 2023, an increasing number of states and cities began limiting the use of AI in employment decision-making, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) draft strategic enforcement plan (SEP) likewise outlined its intended approach to employers’ use of AI. As the year progressed, both states and the federal government continued to crack down on AI use in employment in cases that resulted in discrimination or discriminatory impact.



More specifically, multiple states proposed legislation in 2023 addressing individuals’ data privacy rights, with some including provisions addressing AI use in employment. In Washington, for example, the People’s Privacy Act sought to prohibit covered entities from, among other things, “the use of artificial intelligence-enabled profiling to make decisions that produce legal effects or similarly significant effects concerning individuals” (including employment opportunities). Although this specific legislation hasn’t passed through committee, it signals that states are increasingly primed to legislate the intersection of technology and employment law.

	



Eliminating Barriers
Similarly, the EEOC’s finalized SEP for 2024 to 2028 included six “subject matter priorities,” with the first being “eliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring.” Within this subject matter priority, the EEOC stated it will focus on “the use of technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, to target job advertisements, recruit applicants, or make or assist in hiring decisions where such systems intentionally exclude or adversely impact protected groups.”



The SEP likewise advises that the EEOC will focus on “the use of screening tools or requirements that disproportionately impact workers on a protected basis, including those facilitated by artificial intelligence or other automated systems, pre-employment tests, and background checks.”



EEOC Pursuing AI Discrimination Claims
The EEOC’s SEP wasn’t the end of its involvement in AI and employment decision-making in 2023. Rather, the agency made headlines when it settled its first case involving AI discrimination in the workplace.



As we wrote about previously, the EEOC asserted age and gender discrimination claims against three integrated companies providing English-language tutoring services to students in China under the name iTutorGroup (see “EEOC targeting discriminatory use of artificial intelligence” in the April 2023 newsletter).



According to the EEOC, the companies’ tutor application software automatically rejected female applicants and male applicants over the age of 60. The companies settled the lawsuit with the EEOC for $365,000, along with their agreement to adopt antidiscrimination policies, conduct training, and more.



Increased Employee Use of AI
Significantly, AI in employment isn’t used only by employers. You should expect employees to continue to use the technology moving forward. For example, national nonprofit organization Moms First partnered with other philanthropic entities and AI research/development companies (including OpenAI) to create PaidLeave.ai, a website that explains New York’s paid leave laws and helps those seeking such leave to obtain it.



According to its website, PaidLeave.ai was “designed to simplify [an individual’s] journey, providing clear answers and support every step of the way—from understanding [the individual’s] eligibility to navigating paperwork and planning [his/her] leave.”



Critically, the website intends to help provide documents and supporting resources individuals “can bring to [their] HR manager.” Although this resource is currently set to support only those seeking paid leave in New York, the potential for similar resources to arrive for other state leave laws—or even federal leave laws, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)—isn’t out of the question.



Tips for Employers in 2024
How should you prepare for AI’s role in 2024? Here are a few tips to keep in mind:




If you are an employer that uses (or intends to use) AI in employment decision-making, ensure the processes comply with any applicable state law, as well as the guidance from the EEOC’s SEP. You should be aware that failure to follow the laws and EEOC guidance can lead to costly litigation, as exemplified by the iTutorGroup lawsuit.
Prepare for more sophisticated requests for leave and accommodation, as well as potential complaints of discrimination, from employees using AI to draft such documentation/requests.
Ensure policies/procedures address the use of AI by employees (e.g., the submission of the company’s or its customers’ confidential information to AI platforms).
Consult with counsel regarding any questions related to the use of AI in the employment context, whether such use occurs from the employer or the employee.

New rise in artificial intelligence ""expert"" jobs
04:28

The emergence of artificial intelligence like ChatGPT has aroused fears of these tools replacing people in a range of professions, from coders to truck drivers. Although such concerns tend to ignore technology's potential to create jobs, new forms of AI do pose a risk to some workers, new research from Indeed suggests: white-collar workers.""Surprisingly enough, knowledge workers are facing the highest level of exposure here, which is quite different with what we've seen with other revolutions,"" Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, a job-search platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""With automation, often it was manual labor that was replaced.""Unlike previous cycles of technical innovation, in-person, often low-wage jobs that rely heavily on humans being physically present are likely to be the the most resilient to encroaching AI, she added. 






""Driving cars still currently takes a person. Or child care. We probably wouldn't give our kids over to the robots quite yet,"" she said. Gudell added that ""We'll see the destruction of some jobs but also the creation of others along way. The human element still carries a lot of weight in these jobs — you really can't do without it.""What jobs are most at risk?Among the openings currently on Indeed, software and coding jobs are the most exposed to replacement by AI, the firm found in a its analysis. That's because so-called generative AI was determined to be adept at performing 95% of the skills these jobs require. 


In addition to software development, information technology, mathematics, information design, legal and accounting positions are also among the more exposed professions.By contrast, truck and taxi driver jobs are least exposed to AI, which could only adequately perform about 30% of the necessary skills, according to Indeed. Other jobs that are relatively insulated against AI include cleaning and sanitation as well as beauty and wellness jobs, in part because they are least likely to be performed remotely. 






AI job interviews are becoming more common. Here's how to ace them.

Another key takeway, according to Indeed: The more suitable a job is to remote work, the higher its potential exposure is to generative AI-driven change. ""A lot of in-person jobs heavily rely on that human element. You might mix in parts of generative AI there, but at the end of the day a nurse still needs to be present to stick the needle in the patient's arm to draw blood. With sales reps, a lot of in-person communication happens when talking to clients,"" Gudell said.


To be sure, AI is unlikely ever to fully replace humans even in areas where the technology excels. But it may supplant some workers whose jobs are rote and who don't employ AI to make them more productive. ""It could mean you as an employee can use these tools and focus on higher productivity-level skills on the job. From the employer perspective, instead of hiring 15 copy editors, you might employ five because generative AI carries the load,"" Gudell said. Of all the vacant positions on its platform, Indeed said that 20% are highly exposed to generative AI. Just over 45% are moderately exposed, and 35% are minimally exposed, the firm found.Still, it is likely premature for workers in highly exposed occupations to overhaul their careers based solely on the potential threat of AI, according to Indeed. ""It's too early to switch to another job because we are still in the beginning days of this technological advancement,"" Gudell said. ""We will see what it means for jobs of the future, to see how it will be translated to everyday actions on job.""

Generative AI copyright issues won’t be solved by blockchain.
Multiple lawsuits attempt to claw back owners’ rights.
Use of ‘scraped’ materials is ‘fair use.’

The economic viability of machine learning as a service (MLaaS) is being stymied by a host of lawsuits, most notably against Anthropic and OpenAI. In all cases, owners of copyrighted material object to and seek compensation for the use of materials used without their permission to train machine learning models.
Generative AI models used by companies like OpenAI scrape vast amounts of data from the public internet, but the companies claim their methods constitute ‘fair use’ of publicly-available materials. There are several legal arguments in play, including “volitional conduct,” which refers to the idea that a company that commits copyright infringement has to be shown to have control over the output of the disputed materials. In short, if you can get OpenAI to disgorge a line of poetry, verbatim, that’s been published under a notice of copyright (say, at the bottom of the web page it’s published on), OpenAI is in breach of copyright.

In the case of the New York Times‘s action against OpenAI, the newspaper claims the ML engine crawled and absorbed millions of NYT articles to inform the popular AI engine, gaining a “free ride on the Times’s massive investment in its journalism,” according to the text of the lawsuit.
Generative AI copyright lawsuits
Similar cases have been brought against Midjourney and Stability AI (owners of Stable Diffusion) by Getty Images, who also cite copyright infringement of images they own the rights to. Class action suits have also been brought DeviantArt, whose machine models produce images from users’ text prompts.
Giving evidence to the UK’s House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee, OpenAI claimed, “[…] it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.” In this, the company admits it’s trained models on materials legally owned by others, but it’s ‘fair use.’

The case of Getty Images is particularly noteworthy. The company had steered wide of any AI image creation offering, citing “real concerns with respect to the copyright of outputs from these models and unaddressed rights issues with respect to the imagery, the image metadata, and those individuals contained within the imagery,” said Getty’s CEO, Craig Peters in an article in The Verge in 2022.
However, the company announced ‘Generative AI by iStock’ at CES 2024, which draws on its library of images, claiming legal protection and usage rights for content creators. “You can rest assured that the images you generate, and license, are backed by our uncapped indemnification,” the company’s website now states, and that it’s “created a model that compensates […] content creators for the use of their work in our AI model, allowing them to continue to create more […] pre‑shot imagery you depend on.”

Enforcing copyright has always been problematic online, especially if the owner of published media lacks the backing of a phalanx of sharp-toothed lawyers, shoals of whom tend to congregate around large businesses and organizations rather than independent content creators. The choice for artists, musicians, and even part-time bloggers has always, since the internet began, been whether or not to publish. Put the message or media ‘out there,’ and it’s open to potential exploitation by others. Don’t publish digitally, and risk obscurity. Halfway houses like robots.txt files that state “No ML crawlers” in the same way that it’s hoped search engines will not index website pages (“no follow, pleeease”) are a gamble that trusts the inherent good nature of huge corporations controlling the ML models, like Microsoft in the case of Open AI.
Because nobody ever got burned trusting huge corporations. Right?
Blockchain to solve copyright issues?
Speaking to Business Insider last week, the CEO of cryptocurrency trading specialist Greyscale, Michael Sonnenshein, suggested blockchain would be an immutable way of proving copyrighted material’s provenance. “[…] To us, it’s just so obvious that you need an irrefutable, immutable technology to marry [authenticity and ownership], to actually head-on address some of the issues, and that technology is blockchain, which underpins crypto[currency]. […] All of a sudden, issues like provenance and authenticity and ownership, etc., get resolved really, really quickly.”
There are three reasons why Sonneshein’s assertions are fallacious. Firstly, we already have an ascertained authenticity via blockchain: it’s a Ponzi scheme called NFTs, which are vauled only by the idiots who trade in them. Secondly, blockchain publication has the potential to be ecologically disastrous. The coin mining industry for Bitcoin, Ether, and Monero produces the equivalent carbon of a medium-sized country each year. For example, each $1 value of Bitcoin produces $0.50 in environmental and health damage (primarily through air pollution from fossil fuel generation powering mining rigs). Thirdly, if we ensure creators are “properly compensated and credited for what they produce,” because blockcahin tells us, without doubt, who they are, we have come full circle. To re-quote OpenAI’s statement in the UK’s House of Lords committee rooms:
“[…] it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.” What the word “impossible” means, in context, is “too costly.” Could you imagine a world where big AI-as-a-service providers track down and pay every content creator on the internet for the use of their work to train AI models? No, neither can we.

As a content creator, the only sure-fire way to protect copyright is to digitally encrypt every item, or place it behind some kind of insurmountable barrier where it can’t be scraped. That’s a paywall, or equivalent walled garden in front of every creator’s work. At a stroke, the internet – designed to be a place for the free and open interchange of ideas, knowledge, and perhaps art – becomes the victim of voracious machine learning algorithms controlled by global businesses.
The world in which generative AI and copyright peacefully co-exist may be attainable. What it won’t be is either cost-effective or easy to achieve.

Get it with a Times subscription.If you aren’t already scared about artificial intelligence, you will be after you read the next sentence: “If science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10 percent by 2027, and 50 percent by 2047.”That’s the aggregated forecast of 2,778 researchers who have presented their work in top-tier publications and conferences, according to research that was released this month but not yet published in a journal. Folding clothes and wiring a new home were two of the tasks they were asked to think about. The date of 2047 for the 50 percent chance is 13 years earlier than researchers were estimating in a survey conducted one year earlier. (Hat tip to Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for pointing out this study in his Substack newsletter.)One plausible scenario is that the machines will come for our jobs one by one until the only working human beings on the planet are the judges on “America’s Got Talent.”Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Peter Coy has covered business for more than 40 years.

Artificial intelligence continues to develop at a breakneck pace, transforming one industry after another. One area where AI has already proven successful is in improving the day-to-day lives of people with disabilities. Examples include a brain-spinal chord interface that helps people relearn how to walk, AI-enabled voice assistants (such as Olga Phone and Google Assistant) which make it easier for visually impaired people to use their smartphones, learning algorithms that enable computers to understand users’ intentions and anticipate a command, etc.
Around 87 million people in the European Union suffer from some form of disability, which can sometimes result in their exclusion from the workplace or even from society as whole. According to figures published by the European Parliament in June 2020, there is significant room for improvement when it comes to their professional integration: the employment rate for people with disabilities in the EU (ages 20 to 64) stands at 50.8 per cent, compared to 75 per cent for able-bodied people.
Given that access to employment depends first and foremost on access to training, how can disabled people be better helped to learn using AI tools?
Impact AI is a French think tank whose members include companies, start-ups and schools that train future data analysts. Together, they are looking for solutions to create “conditions conducive to human-centred AI”.
The group has carried out research in partnership with the EdTech association to study specific needs (according to the type of disability: hearing, visual, physical, cognitive, etc.) and identify existing technological solutions. These are generally based on powerful algorithms and intelligent software capable of analysing data and generating responses to certain commands. They facilitate, for example, image recognition and analysis, lip-reading, transcription of audio into text (dictation, generation of subtitles), translation into sign language, etc.
One of the projects the group is presenting and supporting is Roger Voice, a “solution combining automatic speech recognition and voice intonation,” designed for the deaf and hard of hearing. Another is ISIcrunch, a software solution that uses artificial intelligence to produce online texts (such as ebooks or epubs) by digitising teaching materials and converting them into accessible formats.
Increasing the availability of digital resources for people with sensory or cognitive impairments represents a major challenge for inclusion and the future of work, and is the subject of an international treaty between the European Union and the World Intellectual Property Organisation.
Professional integration: pitfalls and perspectives 
According to Jan Ramon, a researcher at the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA), “integration into working life is better thanks to technology”. Some workers with disabilities are already using automatic transcription and text recognition to help them with their tasks. “I think that AI will help these people [more and more] over the years to come. But it’s early days yet”. In Ramon’s opinion, the latest developments in AI are still primarily aimed at the general public and often fail to target people with disabilities.
Federico Camporesi works for the Association for Research and Training on Integration in Europe (ARFIE) on the problems of integrating disabled workers into the workplace. In his view, “companies and even governments should invest in promoting progress in this area”.
AI technologies for disabled people have seen greater advances in certain business sectors, particularly those that involve work with computers and intellectual, rather than physical, functions.
Voice assistant technology is currently booming. Olivier Gatelmand is the founder of Olga, a voice assistant for smartphones designed for people with reduced autonomy or visual impairments. “We created the service seven years ago. At the time, artificial intelligence was not at all widespread. Every access to our phone is voice-activated. We implemented a system in Olga that enables conversational intelligence to be used to search for information. Users can then learn more easily and receive help in their decision-making. It’s kind of like a voice-activated ChatGPT”.
“[Currently] we are mainly focused on people with visual and motor disabilities. But it’s important to understand that disabled people have different abilities,” says Gatelmand, who has also addressed the possibility of diction problems in users.  “We’ve carried out tests with autistic children. Based on a specific case, we learned that artificial intelligence could potentially rephrase words in sentences that are difficult to understand”.
As a visually impaired person, Ramon uses services to help him in his day-to-day life. For example, when interviewed by Equal Times over Zoom, the words he says appear on his screen. It’s a way of getting a better grasp of what’s being said. “This technology still has room to improve”. He predicts that people who are deaf or hard of hearing will be able to obtain a similar application in “about two years.”
However, a number of questions remain unanswered, particularly with regards to the legislative framework for supporting the introduction of new tools. “Society evolves, opportunities evolve, but the problems associated with legislation require a great deal of knowledge,” continues Camporesi. “We need to clarify the issue of data management and privacy”.
The issue of digital privacy rights in relation to technology in the workplace is not specific to disabled workers alone.
Medical advances for greater autonomy in the future
Last August, the media reported that a new research breakthrough at Stanford University in the United States had enabled paralysed people to speak using brainwaves. Artificial intelligence can now transcribe neural signals into text and words. Thanks to a “device consisting of electrodes implanted in the brain,” patients can regain the use of speech with a synthetic voice that is personalised and closely approximates their original voice. While these pioneering trials are promising, there is still a long way to go to develop a technology that is smoother, less invasive and more widely accessible.
Another revolution is underway at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), where Henri Lorach, project leader for the brain-spinal cord interface, has been running a project since 2018, whose aim is to enable people rendered paraplegic by accidents to regain the ability to walk.
“Initial results were published on primates. Researchers demonstrated the intention to walk and stimulate the spinal cord to restore voluntary motor function in the animals,” explains Lorach. “The NeuroRestore laboratory had been working on this subject for ten years. This work makes it possible for various muscles to be reactivated even years after an injury. Through electrical stimulation, we are able to abolish certain muscle responses and control walking. In 2018, an article appeared in the journal Nature”.
Artificial intelligence comes into play a little later in this novel process. “Initially, patterns were pre-programmed to make someone walk again. The second stage was to have an implant in the brain, above the motor cortex, to help the patient carry out the movements. Artificial intelligence then helps us to interpret the signals from the brain and to know which signals are linked to which intentions. We train the algorithm to know when the patient is thinking of bending their leg, extending their knee, etc. Our 64 electrodes record brain activity on the surface,” explains Lorach.
While only one patient is currently benefiting from this programme, “others are waiting. Our aim is to implant around ten people over the next three or four years”.

Credit: Jamie Goodman   The FMI Midwinter Executive Conference keynote session ""Putting Generative AI to Work for Food Retail"" brought industry leaders together to discuss the transformative impact of artificial intelligence in the grocery retail industry. Sponsored by Invafresh, Doug Baker, vice president, industry relations at FMI, led a conversation with Jose Luis-Gomes, managing director retail & consumer, at Google Cloud, addressing the current state of AI applications, future possibilities, and the challenges and responsibilities associated with AI adoption. The following are five takeaways from the session:Purposeful AI Implementation: Joe Smirlies, senior vice president, product management at Invafresh, kicked off the session by emphasizing the importance of harnessing AI's power for purposeful change. The focus should be on delivering meaningful transformation that benefits businesses and society as a whole.""While it really is the epitome of a transformative technology, the real question is, how do we harness its power?"" asked Smirlies. “More importantly, how do we harness this technology to deliver purposeful change and use it in a pragmatic way that helps businesses and, more broadly, society, be better?""Challenges and Responsibilities in AI Adoption: Luis-Gomes emphasized the need for a rigorous framework to evaluate AI initiatives, ensuring ethical considerations, and mitigating risks.""Every single initiative within Google that has AI as a component goes through a very rigorous framework,” said Luis-Gomes. “We actually call it Lemonade With Google Cloud, and that means that any initiative, whether it's an internal Google initiative or whether it's something our customer has asked us to do, goes through this framework and goes through an evaluation of an independent committee.”Regulation and Fast-Paced Innovation: Baker and Luis-Gomes touched on the multitude of ongoing discussions about AI regulation globally. As Baker noted, “this train is going extremely quickly.” Gomes acknowledged the increasing talks about regulation and the need for a balance between continued innovation and addressing potential risks.""I think that regulation is going to catch up if it isn't behind,” said Luis-Gomes. “I just think that if you think about where we were a year ago and where the technology has moved right now, we're all in a little bit of a catch-up mode.""The Grocery Industry's Progress in AI Adoption: Luis-Gomes expressed optimism about the grocery industry's adoption of AI, noting its data richness as a foundation for applying AI at scale. He acknowledged the challenges, such as the need for engineering talent, but highlighted the industry's quick adoption of technology, likely because the grocery industry is less regulated than healthcare or financial services for example.""Compared to many others, we actually have a phenomenal foundation to really apply AI at scale, so I'm really bullish about [the grocery industry’s] ability to do that.”Data's Role in AI: Baker asked about the need for clean, accurate, unified data to effectively power AI. Luis-Gomes acknowledged the importance of good data but also highlighted AI's ability to create data and presented an example of using AI to enhance product attributes. He noted the company worked with one retailer with over a hundred million products, and the company built out 1.2 billion attributes for them, taking the average attribute for every product from about 1.5 to around 12. This enabled the retailer to drive much better personalization, both in search and recommendation. “Good data is super important,” said Luis-Gomes. “The great news is, and I'm probably going to use this catchphrase, is that AI can now also create the data for you.

If 2023 was the breakout year for artificial intelligence, then 2024 will be the year it starts to mature, with new jobs focusing on AI. This happens inevitably with every technological revolution -- technology takes off at a gallop and areas such as security and management must catch up.







In 2024, there will be a greater focus on data integrity, security and privacy. There will also be greater interest in the part of content creators on their data being used or not used for generative AI. In late 2023, The New York Times sued Microsoft and OpenAI over the use of Times' content in ChatGPT.
In addition, models are expected to both grow and shrink. They will grow as AI tries to become more comprehensive and helpful, but they will also shrink to become focused on one area of specificity.
They will also shrink because AI processing is moving off giant GPU farms and onto desktops and handheld devices. Intel, AMD and Qualcomm are all making processes with AI accelerators for desktop and laptop PCs. Inevitably, smartphone handsets will also be doing AI processing.



This article is part of
A guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise 

Which also includes:
10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024
10 top artificial intelligence certifications and courses for 2024
The future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years




All this AI growth means more jobs. Below is a list of what might be the 10 hottest AI jobs and skills for 2024.

Top AI job skills
Being a successful AI developer requires more than just coding skills. Of course, proficiency in a core AI developer language such as Python, Java and R, along with emerging languages such as Julia or Scala, is essential.
AI jobs require knowledge of data modeling and engineering to structure and preprocess data for efficient AI training and analysis. Individuals also need to understand machine learning and deep learning, and be knowledgeable in various algorithms, model architectures and optimization techniques.
In addition to programming skills, individuals need to know libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn and scikit-image, and have a strong background in mathematics and statistics.
AI jobs require critical thinking skills to solve problems and analyze user input. The same practices apply to code. Having strong mathematical skills can help people develop advanced algorithms for programs.
AI is also unique because it requires some knowledge of psychology. To create AI, people need to understand how humans think and how they might behave in different situations. AI simulates human behavior.
Finally, with an emphasis on AI security, privacy and data integrity, individuals need to know the best practices behind security and ethics.
Some industries are embracing AI faster than others. These include the following:

Technology. Tech firms of all types are adding AI to their products to enhance their use and make them simpler and more user-friendly. Hyperscalers, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are all actively hiring AI specialists to build services.
Finance. The finance industry is making broad use of AI with simple tasks, such as automation, and more advanced uses, such as improving risk management and making better investment recommendations and decisions.
Healthcare. The healthcare industry is also rapidly embracing AI at all levels. On the low end, AI is being used for automation to avoid human error and for tasks such as billing and record management. On the high end, AI is being widely touted for early detection of serious illnesses, such as cancer, because the AI can spot signs that humans might miss.
Retail. The retail industry is making wide use of AI for operational efficiency. AI can be used for areas such as inventory management, loss prevention, trend spotting, more personal shopping experiences and fraud prevention by finding suspicious spending patterns or transactions.
Manufacturing. The manufacturing industry is embracing AI for operational efficiency. AI can spot early detection of potential equipment failure and help machinery run efficiently.
Cybersecurity. The cybersecurity market is embracing AI to monitor around the clock and avoid human error. AI applications can be programmed to detect unusual activity quickly for swift action.






10 top AI jobs
AI jobs are changing at a fast pace, just like technology. In 2024, specialists are more sought after than generalists. Deep knowledge of one aspect of AI is more valuable than shallow knowledge across many areas. Here are a few of the top AI jobs to check out.
1. AI product manager
An AI product manager is similar to other program managers. Both jobs require a team leader to develop and launch a product. In this case, it is an AI product, but it's not much different from any other product in terms of leading teams, scheduling and meeting milestones.
The technological demands of this job are a little higher than most product manager positions. AI product managers need to know what goes into making an AI application, including the hardware, programming languages, data sets and algorithms, so that they can make it available to their team. Creating an AI app is not the same as creating a web app. There are differences in the structure of the app and the development process.
2. AI research scientist
An AI research scientist is a computer scientist who studies and develops new AI algorithms and techniques. They develop and test new AI models, collaborate with other researchers, publish research papers and speak at conferences. Programming is only a small portion of what a research scientist does.
The tech industry is extremely open to self-taught and non-formally trained programmers, but it is an exception for AI research scientists. They need to have a strong understanding of computer science, mathematics and statistics. Typically, they need graduate degrees.
3. AI ethics specialist
As stated earlier, ethical use of data used in generating models is going to become a foremost concern in 2024. Dedicated specialists will be needed to ensure responsible development and deployment of AI. Companies might also look to add an AI ethics committee made up of employees with various experiences and specialties including lawyers, engineers, ethicists, public representatives and business strategists.
An AI ethics specialist will help develop ethical guidelines and policies for AI projects and complete ethical reviews of these projects. They might report any findings to the AI ethics committee. Skills needed for this position include critical thinking, effective communication and familiarity with AI frameworks and regulations.
4. Cybersecurity analyst with AI expertise
AI has found a home in cybersecurity, particularly in intrusion detection. However, the threat actors also use AI. This is a field where specialists are needed who are both fluent in cybersecurity and in the skill sets to use AI to combat things such as ransomware and intrusion detection.
5. Computer vision engineer
A computer vision engineer is a developer who specializes in writing programs that utilize visual input sensors, algorithms and systems. These systems see the world around them and act accordingly, such as self-driving and self-parking cars and facial recognition.
They use languages such as C++ and Python, along with visual sensors, such as Mobileye from Intel. Examples of use cases include object detection, image segmentation, facial recognition, gesture recognition and scenery understanding.
6. Data scientist
A data scientist is a technology professional who collects, analyzes and interprets data to solve problems and drive decision-making within the organization. They are not necessarily programmers, although many do write their own applications. Mostly, they use data mining, big data and analytical tools.
Their use of business insights derived from data enables businesses to improve sales and operations; make better decisions; and develop new products, services and policies. They use predictive modeling to forecast future events, such as customer churn and data visualization to display research results visually. Some also use machine learning to build models to automate these tasks.
7. Machine learning engineer
A machine learning engineer is responsible for developing and implementing machine learning training algorithms and models. Training is the demanding side of machine learning and is the most processor- and computation-intensive aspect of machine learning. Therefore, it requires the highest level of skill and training.
Because of the need for advanced math and statistics skills, most machine learning engineers have advanced degrees in computer science, math or statistics. They often continue training through certification programs or a master's degree in machine learning, deep learning or neural networks.
8. Natural language processing engineer
A natural language processing (NLP) engineer is a computer scientist who specializes in the development of algorithms and systems that understand and process natural human language input.
One of the big differentiators between traditional search engines and generative AI interfaces, such as ChatGPT, is that search engines use keywords and gather information from large amounts of existing online data. Generative AI creates new content based on other examples and patterns, and it answers queries in a chat-type format.
Like machine learning engineers, NLP engineers are not necessarily programmers first. They need to understand linguistics as much as they need to understand programming. NLP projects require machine translation, text summarization, answering questions and understanding context.
9. Robotics engineer
A robotics engineer is a developer who designs, develops and tests software for running and operating robots. Robotics has advanced significantly in recent years, such as automated home cleaners and precision cancer surgery equipment. Robotics engineers might also use AI and machine learning to boost a robotic system's performance.
As a result, robotics engineers are typically designing software that receives little to no human input but instead relies on sensory input. Therefore, a robotics engineer needs to debug the software and the hardware to make sure everything is functioning as it should.
Robotics engineers typically have degrees in engineering, such as electrical, electronic or mechanical engineering.
10. AI for healthcare specialist
If ever there was an industry that needed a bridge between the technological side and the professional side, it is healthcare. Technology can help doctors and patients alike in many ways, but it is also one of the most sensitive fields when it comes to data privacy.
AI offers several opportunities for helping the medical profession, such as diagnosing diseases and identifying the best treatment plans for patients with critical medical decisions. Another example of AI in healthcare is the AI-powered robotics in the operating room that assist with surgery.
AI jobs in healthcare require a deep understanding of medical conditions and terminology as much as it requires AI expertise.

What do we know about the future impact of AI on jobs? Nothing much, simply because we know nothing about the future, whether the next minute or the next ten years. This inconvenient truth has never stopped us—intelligent human beings—from making predictions, with or without the assistance of artificial intelligence, be it crystal balls, computers, statistical analysis, or economic models.


There has been no dearth of predictions regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs since the business adoption of computers and the popularizing of the term “automation” in the early 1950s. More recently, the widespread popularity of “AI” has led to rampant speculation, mostly by academic researchers, about the possible elimination of many current occupations by increasingly smart machines, which some, mostly AI entrepreneurs, predict will match or surpass humans in the very near future.

The just-released MIT CSAIL Working Paper, “Beyond AI Exposure: Which Tasks are Cost-Effective to Automate with Computer Vision?” aims to set the record straight on predictions regarding AI and jobs. The good news? Only 23% of wages linked to vision-related tasks could be feasibly cost-effectively replaced by AI.

PROMOTED
“Anxieties about AI,” say the MIT researchers, result from the widespread use among academics attempting to measure the impact of AI of the notion of “AI Exposure”—the classification of occupational tasks by their “potential for automation.” The problem with this matching of AI capabilities with what’s required to perform a specific task is two-fold: No consideration of the “economic viability” of AI and conflating full automation and the resulting replacement of workers with partial automation which could result in work augmentation.

To address these shortcomings and construct what they call the “first end-to-end AI automation model,” the MIT researchers focused on vision-related tasks where the cost estimates for AI systems are more developed. The model evaluates the level of proficiency needed for a task based on surveys of the relevant workers, the cost of achieving that proficiency via human workers or AI systems (which are expensive to develop), and the economic decision by firms whether or not to adopt AI for a particular task.

Using the new and improved model, the MIT researchers found that “only 23% of worker compensation ‘exposed’ to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.” Lowering the cost of AI development and/or the cost of AI deployment (by increasing scale, possibly by using an AI-as-a-service platform), would lower these costs. However, “even with rapid decreases in cost of 20% per year, it would still take decades for computer vision tasks to become economically efficient for firms.”

The MIT researchers argue that their findings apply also to generative AI or the automation of language-related tasks. All areas of AI deployment require fine-tuning or customization “to adapt them to firm-specific characteristics,” a crucial cost factor and an obstacle for rapid adoption.

Another obstacle to adoption, not always considered by economists (and other prognosticators) is what another study calls “the societal acceptability of AI… Some professions may seamlessly integrate AI tools, while others could face resistance because of cultural, ethical, or operational concerns.”
That study was conducted by the International Monetary Fund and released to coincide with this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, where AI was the major topic of discussion. Squarely in the research tradition the MIT paper criticized, the IMF study estimated that almost 40% of global employment is ”exposed” to AI. “In advanced economies,” says the IMF, “about 60% of jobs may be impacted by AI. Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”
Moving beyond economic models, another study released on the eve of the Davos meeting gathered data directly from the people in charge of creating and eliminating jobs. Accounting firm PwC conducted a survey of 4,700 CEOs in 105 countries and found that about a quarter of the CEOs expected the deployment of generative AI in their own businesses would lead to job cuts of at least 5% this year. Almost 75% predicted generative AI would significantly change their business in the next three years, requiring training employees in new skills, and managing new cybersecurity risks, misinformation, and bias towards specific groups of customers or employees.
The CEOs may have intuitively grasped (but not directly asked about) the “societal acceptability” of AI. As with any other new computer capability and functionality emerging over the last seven decades, the social factor is largely neglected in speculations about its impact on jobs and the nature of work.
In his commentary on the IMF study, Harry Law saw this as the “broader problem with this style of analysis.” Because of the problem of quantifying and assessing (my words) the “contextual, reputational, bureaucratic, and social elements of AI adoption,” what we have here is “more or less a guessing game.” It reminds Law, who happens to work at DeepMind, “of one of the core issues with model evaluations, which is that they are generally great at determining whether a model can do X but not so good at telling us how well a model does X in the real world.”
When you try to predict AI performance or its impact on jobs, the real world indeed disrupts the best models, AI or otherwise. The real world doesn’t follow expert predictions. Especially, when these predictions are about what people will do (or not do) with new technologies.
It was very difficult, maybe impossible, to predict the impact of PCs on the nature of work, how work will be organized, and how specific tasks will change. What all prognosticators missed was what managers would do with their new word processing, communicating, calculating machine.
Amazingly, they willingly took over some of the “dull” secretarial tasks that no self-respecting manager would deign to perform before the 1980s. The typing of memos (later emails), the filing of documents, the recording and calculating, a large part of the management of office information, previously exclusively in the hands of secretaries, became in the 1980s (and beyond) an integral part of the work of business executives. Why? Because now executives could do all of this “secretarial” work with a new “cool” tool, the PC, which conferred on them the leading-edge, high-status image of this new technology. What mattered was that you were important enough to have one of these cool things, not that you performed with it tasks that were considered beneath you just a few years before.

Customer service is proving to be one of the most popular applications of generative AI. But how exactly can generative AI aid customer service teams (without alienating customers)? And which companies are already making great use of generative AI? Read on to find out.


The Capabilities Of Generative AI
One of the obvious uses of generative AI is customer-facing chatbots. If you’ve ever had a frustrating interaction with a chatbot that is not particularly helpful, take heart because, with tools like ChatGPT, organizations can create chatbots that better understand customer queries and respond with much greater accuracy and nuance. They can also handle a large volume of queries efficiently and provide more personalized responses over time.

Traditional AI offerings (like some of the not-very-intelligent chatbots you might have interacted with) rely on rules-based systems to provide predetermined responses to questions. And when they come up against a query that they don’t recognize or don’t follow defined rules, they’re stuck. And even when they do give a helpful answer, the language is typically pretty stiff. But a tool like ChatGPT, on the other hand, can understand even complex questions and answer in a more natural, conversational way.

PROMOTED
In fact, ChatGPT is so good that UK energy supplier Octopus Energy has built conversational AI into its customer service channels and says that it is now responsible for handling inquiries. The bot reportedly does the work of 250 people and receives higher customer satisfaction ratings than human customer service agents. This is a prime example of how contact centers will increasingly incorporate generative AI chat and voice tools to deal with straightforward, easily repeatable tasks. And, of course, these tools give customers 24/7 access to support, 365 days a year, via multiple channels (such as phone, online chat, and social media messaging).

But answering customer questions isn’t the only way generative AI can add value in customer service. Some of the other tasks that generative AI can do or assist with include:
· Giving customers personalized recommendations based on the customer’s data and previous interactions further helps to enhance the customer experience.

· Providing conversational search functions for, say, FAQs online. Generative AI can take natural language prompts like “Where’s my package?” and either direct the customer to the correct FAQ response or deliver a tailored response. Plus, this can be done in multiple languages.

· Optimizing data to support customer service operations. Generative AI can handle vast amounts of data and turn that information into actionable insights – insights such as “Which are our most common complaints?” It can also track and categorize customer trends.

· Supporting human customer service agents. Generative AI can help human agents be more productive. For example, it can automatically generate responses to common queries, provide summaries of previous complaints and resolutions that agents can use in conversations, and generate product recommendations.
In this way, generative AI can support the work that human agents do and free them up to focus on more complex customer interactions where they can add the most value.
How John Hancock Has Boosted Its Customer Service With Conversational AI Tools
We’ve already seen how one company has improved its customer service function with generative AI. Now, let’s turn to another example. John Hancock, the US arm of global financial services provider Manulife, has been supporting customers for more than 160 years. But this doesn’t stop the life insurance company from embracing the latest technology.
The company has partnered with Microsoft to implement conversational AI tools, including Azure Bot Service, to provide support for common customer queries and issues. Like many companies, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, John Hancock contact centers saw a spike in calls, meaning the company needed new ways to help customers access the answers they needed. So they turned to Microsoft to help set up chatbot assistants that could handle general inquiries – thus reducing the total number of message center and phone inquiries and freeing up contact center employees.
In other words, this allows human contact center workers to focus their efforts on more complex cases – those calls that really require their expertise, as opposed to generic queries like “How do I reset my password?” As a result, team members enjoy a better work experience and more manageable workloads – while customers enjoy reduced wait times and a better service experience. As Tracy Kelly, AVP of contact center and LTC operations, puts it, “The call reduction due to chatbot innovation equates to impressive cost savings we’ve been able to reinvest in our customer contact centers…”
Plus, as an added bonus, the customer service team is being upskilled in valuable AI skills, thereby helping to future-proof their jobs.
It’s no wonder customer service has become CEOs’ number one generative AI priority, according to the IBM Institute for Business Value, with 85 percent of execs saying generative AI will be interacting directly with their customers within the next two years. Those companies that ignore the generative AI trend clearly risk being left behind.

In a powerful new survey conducted by Canva, a multi-purpose digital suite, and Sago, a quantitative research firm, nearly half of all job seekers today are using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to improve their résumés. As reported in Yahoo news, the survey included 5,000 hiring managers and 5, 000 job seekers from the US, UK, India, Germany, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil. According to the results, 45% of job seekers have used generative AI to build, update or improve their résumés. But the really surprising statistic? Hiring managers are encouraging the use of AI for the creation of job search documents. Not surprisingly, in 2023, Canva’s AI-powered Magic Write tool for résumé template was used five million times. Grammarly has attracted 30 million users to its AI Resume Skills Generator. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.


Does HR Prefer AI-Generated Résumés?
For hiring managers, 90% say that it’s acceptable to use generative AI in application materials. Nearly half (44%) say that it’s OK to use AI to create any content related to the interview process. And a majority of hiring managers (67%) believe that they can tell when they are reading an AI-modified résumé.

But that last stat feels sort of like the number of people who feel that they are good drivers. Notice the difference: there’s how you feel about your driving, and there’s what I just experienced on the freeway. Perhaps our ability to spot AI is a little over-stated?

PROMOTED
At any rate, there’s a new résumé trend for 2024 emerging, and that’s the use of visual components. Nearly 60% of hiring managers prefer CVs (curriculum vitae, another way of saying résumé) with visual elements. In fact, 71% of respondents say that purely text-based résumés will be obsolete in five years.

Why It’s a Good Idea to Use AI for Your Résumé and CV
Amy Schultz, global head of talent acquisition at Canva, told FOX Business that candidates should feel reassured by this survey that they can continue to use AI as “a sort of great jumping off point.”

“We know that job seeking can be really hard, it can be really daunting, so if there’s something that can make you feel better about that experience, then I think that folks should lean into that,” she continued.

On average, this survey says that recruiters spend an average of just 7.4 seconds scanning a résumé. That’s generous, according to reports from CNBC. Simon Taylor, a former recruiter at Disney, says the number is more like three to five seconds. “Five is generous,” says Taylor, the author of the upcoming leadership book, Build Smart.

Artificial intelligence will change the nature of work in the coming years, interacting with demographics and remote work desire.

There is no one future of work that applies to all jobs, but for any specific job, the future depends on how important location is and how much AI will impact the tasks involved. But for all work, the ongoing tight labor market will loom large.


Demographics Of A Tight Labor Market
Today’s tight labor market comes not from pandemic-related changes but from long-standing demographic trends. Hiring new workers was difficult and unemployment was unusually low in 2018 and 2019, before the coronavirus arose. The problem was low growth of the working-age population. The change, from one census to the next, of the population aged 25 to 65 is currently the lowest since the Civil War! The history is shown in my article, “The Scariest Chart For Business In The Coming Decade: Workers Not Available,” published in 2018. Since that article was written, foreign immigration has proved lower than projected, pulling our working-age population projections down even lower than before.

The era of huge gains in working-age population, from 1970 through 2010, coincided with large increases in the female labor force participation rate. That accentuated the abundance of job-seekers. Since 2009, however, female interest in working has leveled off. So the labor force has been roughly stagnant.

PROMOTED
The demographics argue for a continuing tight labor market. That will ease—just a little—in the decade from 2030 to 2040. In the meantime, workers will be in short supply.

Remote Work In The Future
The Covid pandemic introduced many office workers to the possibility of remote work. Independent consultants and free-lancers had been working from home for years, but corporate employees had to work remotely during lockdowns. And many of them liked it. Some missed the comradery around the coffee pot and celebrating team members’ birthdays, but others felt relieved not to commute in. Some were more distracted without a boss looking on, but others concentrated more without hearing co-workers chatting in an open office or cube farm. The bottom line is that a significant number of office workers, but not all, want to work from home.
Managers have a different opinion: they believe remote workers accomplish less. A recent Harvard Business Review article highlighted managers’ lower estimates of remote work productivity than employees’ estimates. Also notable, though, is that nearly half of both employees and managers think productivity is about the same working remotely as in the office. Recently evidence arose of remote workers less likely to be promoted.

Forty years ago the managers would have won the battle. Job applicants were plentiful due to population growth and women entering the workforce. Today, though, the manager who insists on in-office work loses out on talented workers. Elon Musk had to walk back his hardcore office work policy at Twitter. Managers will balance their estimates of productivity versus the salaries needed to get people into the office. Remote work looked to be a major part of the future of work for office occupations. But what about . . .

AI And The Future Of Work
Now throw artificial intelligence into the mix. The impact will be different depending on whether the work is clerical and administrative or hands-on. For most office workers, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, will increase productivity, lowering the demand for such workers. The tight labor market for these occupations will not be so tight, and worker bargaining power will be lower. Wage growth in this sector will be slower, but the preference for remote work will remain. Managers who insist on office work will still have to pay up to get employees, but from a lower base. The managers who will make the best decisions will have solid data on productivity rather than gut feel and tradition. However, productivity is difficult to measure in many fields.
AI will have less impact on hands-on work: construction, stocking shelves, manufacturing, cooking and serving food, cleaning offices and hotels. Robotics have helped automate much factory work, but their limitations have become apparent. Speaking with several robotics engineers I learned that the machine learning techniques behind artificial intelligence require lots of data. That data is harder to acquire in the physical world. For example, robot welders in the automobile industry work on the exact same weld, in the exact same environment, time after time. The welder on a high-rise office project make different welds in varying temperature and wind conditions. The AI could help do the job—after it collects a million or so observations of actual work. Right now it seems that robotics development has plateaued, with the most talented computer scientists shifting to large language models. Robotics will probably achieve some breakthroughs in the future, but it’s hard to see a major revolution coming quickly.
AI I The Hands-On World
Artificial intelligence can certainly help with many parts of the hands-on world. Carpenters will still cut boards, but the contractor’s cost estimate and bill of materials will be created with the help of AI. The computer won’t cook a steak, but the AI can help figure out how many steaks diners will order tomorrow, reducing expensive waste.
AI, combined with sensors, can help get the right worker to the right place at the right time. Restrooms will still be cleaned by hand for many years to come, but they won’t sit dirty for long with good AI-driven monitoring systems. Potholes may be filled before they become large.
The Future Of Work Summary
The future of work will be very task-specific. Demand for hands-on workers will grow while supply won’t, pushing wages up and leading employers to offer better working conditions. Office roles will be assisted by specialized tools using artificial intelligence, reducing demand for such workers. The resulting equilibrium could entail falling wages, though greater productivity will lower consumer cost of living across the board. Remote work will become part of the wage bargain, with employers offering that option to keep their costs down.

Maybe Not Just Yet, One Study Says - TIME",2024-01-22,TIME,https://time.com,"Artificial intelligence began to reshape music, movies and art in 2023, sparking both enthusiasm and panic.",,A new paper published by MIT researchers suggests automation in the workforce might happen slower than some expect.,A new paper published by MIT researchers suggests automation in the workforce might happen slower than some expect.,,,"By Billy PerrigoJanuary 22, 2024 9:00 AM ESTWill artificial intelligence take our jobs? If you listen to Silicon Valley executives talking about the capabilities of today’s cutting edge AI systems, you might think the answer is “yes, and soon.”But a new paper published by MIT researchers suggests automation in the workforce might happen slower than you think.The researchers at MIT’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory studied not only whether AI was able to perform a task, but also whether it made economic sense for firms to replace humans performing those tasks in the wider context of the labor market. They found that while computer vision AI is today capable of automating tasks that account for 1.6% of worker wages in the U.S. economy (excluding agriculture), only 23% of those wages (0.4% of the economy as a whole) would, at today’s costs, be cheaper for firms to automate instead of paying human workers. “Overall, our findings suggest that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual—and therefore there is room for [government] policy and retraining to mitigate unemployment impacts,” the authors write.Tasks like analyzing images from diagnostic equipment in a hospital, or examining trays to ensure they contain the right items, are given in the paper as examples of the kind of “vision tasks” that today’s AI could feasibly achieve. But tasks like these are often so fragmented, the authors argue, that it is uneconomical to automate them.“Even though there is some change that is coming, there is also some time to adapt to it,” Neil Thompson, the study’s lead author, tells TIME. “It’s not going to happen so rapidly that everything is thrown into chaos right away.”Unless it does. The study only focused on computer vision AI—systems that are able to recognize and categorize objects in images and videos—rather than more flexible systems like multimodal large language models, of which OpenAI’s GPT-4 is an example. A recent study from OpenAI estimated that 19% of U.S. workers could see 50% of their workplace tasks “impacted” by GPT-4 level systems—a far higher estimate than the MIT researchers’ study that focuses solely on computer vision. A crucial question for the economy in the age of AI will be whether the MIT study’s findings apply to more “general” AI tools—ones that promise to automate most forms of cognitive labor that can be done behind a computer screen.The MIT researchers found it can be expensive for companies to “fine tune” computer vision systems to make them suited for a specific, specialized task. While such an investment may make economic sense for the largest companies, it is often not cheaper for a small outfit that could simply retain a trained worker who already performs the task well. This dynamic is a key reason, according to the MIT paper, that not all tasks AI is capable of doing today are also economically viable to replace humans in. (The paper, submitted to the journal Management Science, has not yet been peer-reviewed.)But it’s unclear whether this dynamic will carry over to language tasks. To “fine tune” a computer vision model to, for example, distinguish specific types of medicine bottle from one another to a 99.9% degree of accuracy, you would need to collect large quantities of labeled images of different medicines, which can be a costly and cumbersome process (even if low-wage workers in impoverished countries were drafted in to do it on the cheap). You would then have to pay the significant computing costs of fine-tuning an AI model on that large store of data.Read More: OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less ToxicOn the other hand, fine-tuning a cutting-edge language model to carry out a specific task can simply be a matter of giving it a detailed list of written rules. An OpenAI study from August last year found that GPT-4 was able to effectively carry out the task of content moderation on digital platforms after being fine-tuned using a detailed policy document and just a few labeled examples. Those findings suggest that large language models can be applied to a wide range of economic tasks far more quickly, and cheaply, than computer vision models.  Fine-tuning for GPT-4 is still in a restricted beta mode, as OpenAI works to mitigate the significant safety challenges this level of customizability can present. But as OpenAI and its competitors begin allowing customers to fine-tune their most advanced models, the economy may begin to see levels of automation, or augmentation, that progress faster than the MIT study predicts.“It is certainly plausible that customizing large language models may be easier than customizing computer vision systems and that this could lead to more adoption in the economy,” Thompson tells TIME. But, “so long as a small engineering team is needed to integrate the system into the company’s workflow, costs are still restrictive.”",https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,,,,,AI's Impact on Culture in 2023,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/4QAoZP1p/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,2023-12-15T20:34:28.000Z,PT5M13S,https://time.com/6565026/ai-job-replacement-mit-study/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6565026/ai-job-replacement-mit-study/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/4QAoZP1p.m3u8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The legal sector has typically been characterized by a cautious, conservative approach to tech adoption. But emerging generative AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are quietly gaining traction among attorneys.







Although ChatGPT and other powerful large language models are relatively new, they've already seen surprisingly widespread adoption in the legal sector. More than 40% of attorneys surveyed by legal data and analytics company LexisNexis said they currently use or plan to use generative AI in their legal work, according to an August 2023 report.
""It's been probably the most interesting 12 months in my 20-year legal tech career,"" said Cheryl Wilson Griffin, CEO of Legal Tech Consultants, which advises law firms and other legal clients on technology issues.

The evolving role of generative AI in law
The term generative AI refers to sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can produce new content, such as text, images or code, after training on enormous amounts of data.
Generative AI's ability to create highly specific content in response to users' queries has piqued interest within the legal industry. In the aforementioned LexisNexis report, nearly all lawyers surveyed (89%) had heard of generative AI such as ChatGPT, and 41% had tried out a generative AI tool themselves. But historically, lawyers haven't always been quick to adopt new technologies.
Jake Heller is an attorney and CEO of legal AI company Casetext, acquired by Thomson Reuters in November 2023. He grew up in Silicon Valley and started coding at a young age. Upon becoming a lawyer, Heller found himself frustrated by the lackluster state of legal technology, particularly juxtaposed with consumer counterparts such as food delivery apps.
""It felt really imbalanced to me that the technology to support you for finding Thai restaurants was super good and the technology for saving businesses, saving people from prison and so on was so backwards and bad,"" he said.
Although legal still has something of a reputation for outdated systems and resistance to change, generative AI has been harder for the sector to ignore than other tech advancements of recent decades, such as cloud or big data analytics. The release of ChatGPT marked a significant shift in lawyers' attitudes toward AI -- something Heller described as a ""moment of awakening.""
""I think the thing that's been really interesting about this, and different than other technologies that have tried to disrupt or change legal, is that there's a consumer side,"" Griffin said.
Like Heller, Troy Doucet, founder of legal AI startup AI.law, found his way to legal tech through his background as an attorney. Law firms like Doucet's, which focuses on foreclosure defense and consumer protection, often feel pressure to maximize efficiency due to the economic challenges facing small firms.
When Doucet began exploring AI's ability to automate legal processes, he was initially interested in issue spotting -- determining whether a potential client's narrative gives rise to legal claims. Issue-spotting software for an employment attorney, for example, might analyze whether a set of facts supports a claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Doucet began exploring this use case around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately hiring an employee in a data role to help develop an AI product. What started as an efficiency tool within Doucet's firm gradually evolved into a broader project. But early on, his ambitions were hamstrung by technical limitations.
""It didn't turn out because the technology just wasn't there for it,"" Doucet said.
The advent of ChatGPT was a game-changer, however, Doucet said, enabling him to easily work with OpenAI's GPT models to perform issue spotting within his own firm. Down the line, as legal AI becomes more sophisticated, he believes such tools could revolutionize legal services: Increased efficiency would reduce legal costs, which in turn could expand access to justice.


The benefits of generative AI in law
Doucet's AI.law software and Casetext's flagship tool, CoCounsel, are positioned as AI legal assistants or colleagues, in line with the ""copilot"" approach taken in other disciplines. Overall, their creators say, the goal isn't to replace real legal professionals, but rather to delegate complex tasks, aiming to achieve faster and higher-quality outcomes.
The most time-consuming areas of litigation are, unsurprisingly, among the most appealing for automation. Griffin described discovery as the ""highest-risk, highest-reward"" area for introducing generative AI, and it's one of the areas Doucet targeted first with AI.law.
""Every partner gives junior associates the job of drafting discovery responses, because it's a very tedious and unenjoyable aspect of the job,"" Doucet said. ""We have that down to about two minutes from four to eight hours.""
Similarly, CoCounsel includes features, such as reviewing documents and editing contracts, that are particularly effective when lawyers need to review vast amounts of information quickly.
""Sometimes the things that get in the way of us doing more aren't the most important and pressing, highly strategic pieces,"" Heller said.
Instead, it's tiresome, repetitive tasks such as formatting citations and extracting relevant material from thousands of pages of documents. As an example, Heller described using an AI tool in an investigation to parse years' worth of emails, Slack messages and texts in a matter of days, as opposed to weeks or even months.
""The idea of reviewing millions of documents over a few days before this technology was kind of unthinkable,"" he said.
Griffin also pointed out that generative AI can help firms in areas that don't involve the direct practice of law, such as HR and operations. ""I think there's a lot of opportunity to automate some back-office stuff,"" she said. ""There's so much stuff that we're paying a lot of money for now because it's just wildly inefficient.""


Limitations of generative AI in law
Despite the various benefits of generative AI in law, actual adoption still appears to be lagging behind interest. There's often a ""difference between what [firms] are saying out loud and in PR, and what they're doing and actually what's happening in the real world,"" Griffin said. ""There's such a small percentage of firms that have actually bought or tried to implement anything.""
This is consistent with broader findings in the industry. August 2023 research from TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group found that 4% of organizations surveyed had implemented a mature generative AI initiative in production, though many more expressed interest in the technology or had explored it through pilot projects.



That hesitance isn't necessarily a bad thing, as buying generative AI tools without a clear plan for how they'll be used often ends in disappointment and disillusionment. Sometimes, Griffin said, her clients will find that they bought the tech without a problem for it to solve. Instead, she advises law firms to look at their needs first, then decide whether AI could meet those needs.
""From a best practice standpoint, always start with the problem first,"" she said. ""Don't just buy the tech and say, 'What can we do with it?' ... Make sure you have a plan before you buy.""
Moreover, generative AI still has notable limitations, particularly for complex areas such as litigation compared with formulaic tasks such as contract drafting. Griffin highlighted writing motions as an example of a less boilerplate task that remains difficult for generative AI to perform well.
""[Motions] are so much less standardized that it makes it really hard, I think, to develop a product that fills enough of the market's needs that people want to use it,"" she said.
Heller noted that there's a subset of tasks that humans currently perform much better than AI -- and perhaps always will. These include big-picture strategizing, such as deciding how to pursue a case or interpret a long history of business context, as well as interpersonal skills such as picking up on suspicious behavior in a key witness or speaking persuasively in the courtroom.
""If you think about what these AIs have been trained on, the data is what's on the internet,"" such as books and articles, Heller said. ""But anybody with real experience in law practice knows there's a lot you can't capture in a book. It comes through experience and training and observing.""


The issue of hallucinations
Accuracy is paramount in law practice and judicial decision-making. A document that includes hallucinations -- incorrect content output by a generative AI model -- could lead to misinterpretations of statutes, precedents or facts.
A model might easily come up with an explanation of a major Supreme Court case such as Brown v. Board of Education, a well-known decision about which there's extensive publicly available internet data. But a holding on a niche point of law from a specific district court is much less likely to be among the information the model has gradually memorized.
The problem is that LLMs are trained to predict the most statistically likely combination of words in response to a prompt, not to provide accurate factual information. This means that their tendency is to offer some response, even if the correct answer to a user's question isn't contained in their training data.
""There's always an incentive to answer,"" Heller said. ""[Generative AI models] are never going to say, 'I don't know.'""
More dangerously, generative AI models can be wrong while sounding very convincing. If taken at face value, hallucinations could potentially affect the outcome of legal cases. And if a judge realizes that an attorney has introduced AI-hallucinated content in a court filing, it could have serious consequences.
""If you're a lawyer and something bad happens, your licensure is on the line,"" Griffin said.
The ethical implications of using a tool that might generate false or misleading information are substantial, particularly in a legal context where every word can carry significant weight. Although it's not always clear who should be responsible for the inaccuracies in generative AI models' output, early examples suggest that lawyers could be on the hook.
In June 2023, a federal judge sanctioned attorneys Peter LoDuca and Steven Schwartz for relying on nonexistent case law invented by ChatGPT in a legal brief. Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York emphasized that the issue wasn't that the lawyers had used an AI tool; it was that they hadn't verified the AI-generated output and had failed to disclose their use of ChatGPT when the made-up cases were first identified.
""[T]here is nothing inherently improper about using a reliable artificial intelligence tool for assistance,"" Castel wrote in his order sanctioning LoDuca and Schwartz. ""But existing rules impose a gatekeeping role on attorneys to ensure the accuracy of their filings.""
It's also currently unclear how using AI tools that can hallucinate could affect compliance with laws and regulations. Attorneys must adhere to strict professional standards and regulations around handling and presentation of evidence as well as the accuracy of legal advice. At minimum, it's crucial to implement stringent validation and verification processes for AI-generated content in legal settings.


How legal professionals can integrate generative AI responsibly
One method for handling hallucinations is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a technique in which LLMs can access data from external sources to improve the accuracy and relevance of their responses. Heller, whose Casetext software uses RAG, compared introducing RAG to switching from a closed-book to an open-book exam: With RAG, the model can look up information in real time that it wouldn't otherwise be able to access.
Although this helps ensure that AI responses are based on actual legal documents and case law, Heller cautioned that no AI tool is infallible. For example, even an AI tool using RAG could misinterpret a particularly dense, complicated text. In short, attorneys shouldn't assume that AI is more likely to be objective or correct than a person.
""Because we work with humans, we're used to working with imperfect beings,"" Heller said. ""This is one of them.""
More broadly, Doucet, Heller and Griffin all emphasized the growing importance of management skills for legal professionals working with AI. This goes beyond accuracy checks to combat hallucinations: Lawyers will need to learn how to effectively delegate, provide clear instructions and strategize using AI tools.
""Now, for the first time, everyone -- including your youngest associate and paralegal -- can have this AI assistant they can delegate tasks to,"" Heller said. ""But learning how to manage is actually really tough."" He pointed to skills that are familiar from managing human beings in the workplace, such as expressing instructions clearly, delegating tasks and giving useful feedback.


4 best practices for using generative AI in law
Although introducing generative AI into law practice carries certain risks, legal professionals can take steps to implement generative AI as responsibly and safely as possible.
1. Understand AI's capabilities and limitations
Before integrating AI into the day-to-day practice of law, it's essential to understand what AI can -- and just as importantly, can't -- do. Learning about the potential for errors, biases and hallucinations helps clarify where human oversight is needed.
2. Use AI to support, not replace, human workers
In its current state, generative AI is far from fully replacing a trained attorney or paralegal. Although AI is often useful for initial drafting, preliminary research and large-scale data analysis, AI-generated content should never go out without review. Keep final decisions and fact-checking in the hands of human experts.
3. Protect clients' data and privacy
Although AI regulation is a complicated, fast-evolving area, AI use is almost certainly covered by existing data privacy laws and client confidentiality agreements. Be cautious about what data is fed into AI systems, especially sensitive client information; for example, the consumer version of ChatGPT saves all data by default for retraining OpenAI's models.
""The key thing is understanding what [an AI model] is built on and understanding what you're trying to do with it, and then defining the risk around that in the same exact way you would with any other technology,"" Griffin said.
It's also important to be transparent with clients about how AI is used in their cases, including the potential benefits and risks. Make a plan for how to respond to clients' concerns about generative AI use, as not all clients will be comfortable with the use of such technology.
4. Learn about AI and stay up to date on the field
Stay informed about the latest developments in AI and their implications for law practice through online research and conversations with AI experts. Increasingly, bar associations are also offering AI education as part of professional development. Last fall, the New York City Bar Association hosted an Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Summit for local attorneys that offered continuing legal education credits.
""In any revolution, there's job loss, but I think there's also an equal amount of opportunity created,"" Griffin said. ""Be the first one to learn it, and you'll be indispensable.""

Generative AI can empower advertisers from streamlining campaign creation to increasing the effectiveness of ads as the consumer Search experience evolves. Last year, we introduced a new era of AI-powered ads along with a commitment to ensuring advertisers have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys. Today, we’re sharing an update on our progress.




Building better Search campaigns through Gemini-powered chatAs we announced last month, Gemini, our largest and most capable AI model, will expand to more of our core products in the coming months, including Google Ads. We’ve been actively testing Gemini to further enhance our ads solutions. And, we’re pleased to share that Gemini is now powering the conversational experience. It’s the first of many Gemini integrations to come.Beta access to the conversational experience in Google Ads is now fully available to English language advertisers in the U.S. and U.K. It will begin rolling out globally to all English language advertisers over the next few weeks. We’re excited to open up access in additional languages in the months ahead and look forward to hearing your feedback.The conversational experience workflow is designed to help you build better Search campaigns through a chat-based experience. It combines your expertise with Google AI. All you need to start is your website URL and Google AI will help you create optimized Search campaigns by generating relevant ad content, including creatives and keywords.Over the last few months, we’ve been testing the conversational experience with a small group of advertisers. We observed that it helps them build higher quality Search campaigns with less effort. One of the ways we measure this is with a metric called Ad Strength that looks at the relevance, quality and diversity of your ad copy and gives you a score from “Poor” all the way up to “Excellent.”





I found the conversational experience very easy to use. It helped me create even more high-quality ads with ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ Ad Strength, which has further improved the performance of my campaigns.

As Search becomes more visual, we’ve heard advertisers tell us that it can be challenging to create compelling images that drive performance. That’s why we designed the conversational experience to suggest images tailored to your campaign using generative AI and images from your landing page. This capability will be added over the coming months. Advertisers approve assets — including images — before the campaign goes live.All images created with generative AI in Google Ads, including the conversational experience, will be identified as such. We’re using SynthID to invisibly watermark these images and they will include open standard metadata to indicate the image was generated by AI.

Chat your way into better performance with the conversational experience in Google Ads



Our data shows that small business advertisers that use the conversational experience in Google Ads are 42% more likely to publish Search campaigns with “Good” or “Excellent” Ad Strength.1 This is significant because we’ve found a strong correlation between Ad Strength and conversions. For example, advertisers who improve Ad Strength for their responsive search ads from “Poor” to “Excellent” see 12% more conversions on average.2




Taking a bold and responsible AI approachWe share the industry’s enthusiasm for AI’s potential to unlock value for consumers and advertisers alike. New use cases — and opportunities — are emerging on a regular basis as AI continues to evolve quickly. And that’s why we think AI will continue to make our products even more useful.As we continue to explore what’s possible with AI, we remain committed to developing and applying this new technology responsibly. We believe the best way to do this is by upholding our AI principles that we established in 2018.Stay tuned for more AI-powered updates to Google Ads in the year ahead.

Nearly Half of Job Seekers Using AIArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way we work, and the realm of recruitment is no exception. Crafting the perfect CV is an arduous task for many, therefore it’s no surprise job seekers are welcoming the host of free and paid AI-powered resume tools which take the heavy lifting out of the task.The online graphic design platform, Canva teamed up with research company, Sago, to survey 5,000 hiring managers and 5,000 job seekers to uncover the latest trends in both job seeking and candidate hiring.The headline finding from the survey was that 45% of job seeker respondents said they had used generative AI to build, update or improve their CV.The survey respondents came from the U.S., United Kingdom, India, Germany, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil, with job candidates in India utilising AI to bolster their resume the most (74%) followed by Brazil (50%), in France and Spain however, job seekers preferred good old fashioned methods, with their AI uptake sitting in the low-to-mid thirties. Hiring Managers Actually Like AI-Enhanced CVsIt may feel counterintuitive to the popular belief that using AI to build your CV is in some way cheating, the survey found that a staggering 90% of hiring manager respondents said it is acceptable to use generative AI in application materials.Of those hiring managers surveyed 46% said it should be used minimally to augment an applicant’s ideas and content, and 44% said it can be used to create any content.🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if you're in another country?Get a huge 86% off Surfshark with this special tech.co offer. What’s more, 57% of all hiring managers prefer CVs with visual components rather than text-only CVs, with 71% of respondents saying the latter will be obsolete within five years.Amy Schultz, global head of talent acquisition at Canva, told Fox Business that candidates should feel reassured by this survey that they can continue to use AI as “a sort of great jumping off point.”“We know that job seeking can be really hard, it can be really daunting, so if there’s something that can make you feel better about that experience, then I think that folks should lean into that,” she continued.Can Hiring Managers Detect AI Created CVs?One question that comes to mind is whether or not it’s obvious to recruiters when candidates have used AI to enhance their CV.The survey found that an overwhelming majority (67%) of hiring managers believe they can tell most or all of the time when they are reading an AI-modified resume.Whilst Schultz was positive about the benefits for both candidates and recruiters using AI, she did caveat that candidates should always proofread what AI resume tools output to ensure it’s correct and inline with their tone of voice and experience.Make it Stand Out: Hot Tips for CandidatesSchultz said that recruiters spend an average of just 7.4 seconds scanning at CV before deciding whether or not to spend time reading it in more detail. For candidates that means that their CV must grab the hiring manager’s attention visually right away to give themselves a higher chance of making the shortlist.AI Resume Builder TipsA virtual graphic designer for everyoneWhilst it’s possible to design an attractive resume without the use of artificial intelligence, it’s certainly much more time consuming and the results are likely not going to be as polished unless you’re a graphic designer! Using an AI tool to do this part will save significant time and will lay out your content in the most visually appealing way that will get more eyeballs on your actual experience.Keyword optimization is essentialAs AI becomes an integral part of the hiring process, many HR teams are also turning to AI to sift through CVs and find the most relevant candidates. Therefore it’s vital that your CV encapsulates the keyword and terminology that are present on the job listing. This will often occur naturally however, an AI tool will save you time fine-tuning the language and technical terms used in each job description and tailor your application to each position, giving you a higher chance of actually getting your CV in front of a human.Embrace but don’t replace AI can be a valuable asset, but it’s crucial to remember that your resume is a representation of you. Proofread any AI-generated content carefully to ensure accuracy and authenticity. Personalise your resume so it showcases your unique value proposition and your personality and maybe think again before using it for the cover letter as well.

Watch to hear Merrin Mueller from RPM Pizza discuss how text messaging and chatbots can improve the recruitment process. 

Mueller works in the food industry, an industry that already faces high turnover. She recalls how her business decided to use TextRecruit, a service that reaches out to candidates via text message. 

Mueller also explains how her HR team utilized a chatbot named Dottie to interact with applicants via text. After some training, 'Dottie' became the official recruiter face of RPM Pizza. She was not only able to interact with possible candidates, but also conduct pre-screenings to narrow down the pool. AI-based HR technology like 'Dottie' can drive efficiency and ease the recruiting process.

Top AI recruiting tools and software of 2024


AI is infiltrating every corner of recruiting and talent acquisition. Here's how to evaluate AI tools, and 13 that merit serious consideration.

AI is everywhere. According to a 2023 survey by HR software vendor Engagedly, AI adoption is growing rapidly, automating repetitive tasks and improving decision-making processes as well as the overall employee experience. In the survey, 81% of HR leaders have explored or implemented AI to improve process efficiency in their organizations while around 45% of HR professionals are using AI for HR management and 39% plan to use it in the near future. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said AI has greatly improved efficiency and productivity in HR.







Buyers have every right to be confused. In recruiting alone, there are well over 100 AI-based talent acquisition products in the market. AI now underlies at least part of the familiar names in talent acquisition -- for example, ICIMS, Oracle Recruiting Cloud and Workday -- as well as smaller relative newcomers, such as Onwelo's Hello Astra, Wade & Wendy, CVViZ, Findem, AmazingHiring and Manatal.
To a certain extent, AI-based recruiting products are more similar than different. A buyer is likely able to successfully source, engage, screen, hire and onboard job candidates with almost any of the popular systems, and most provide personalization capabilities, chatbots and sophisticated content creation tools. AI provides the ability to search more widely across many more sources of candidates than humans have time for, creating talent pools that are more diverse. AI can match and rank candidates to requisitions in an instant as well as search the employee population for internal candidates.
In addition, candidate engagement is improved by intelligent chatbots, which are often able to understand spoken input as well as text -- and by the newfound ease of customization from using AI for correspondence.

Of the 172 HR practitioners who responded to IDC's November 2022 AIPath survey, 32% named candidate matching and selection as the top AI use case for their organization. Respondents reported that when used for recruiting, AI immediately made HR's job easier, provided good insights and improved the employee experience. It also streamlined tasks and made the manager's job easier, resulting in greater efficiency, fewer steps and reduced operating costs.
Also of interest, however, is how quickly AI has spread from recruiting platforms to broader-use talent management platforms. Now, AI goes beyond focusing on ascertaining skills in initial hiring to identify skill gaps and recommend solutions, thus facilitating employees' career development. Today's most competitive AI-based applicant tracking systems (ATSes) have crossed that barrier into post-hiring skill identification and development, a promising aid to internal mobility, succession planning, and ultimately, employee retention.

Engaging engagement
Generative AI is a breakout product that has made significant headway this year, especially in areas of great use to recruiters, such as candidate engagement. With the ChatGPT bot as its poster child, generative AI excels at content creation, whether it be text, images, artwork or even videos. This is proving a godsend to both recruiters and hiring managers, who can use the technology to make job reqs more appealing, more easily customize candidate communication, and personalize job-offer and rejection letters.
Generative AI is both a time saver for recruiters and a source of inspiration for anyone seeking a kickstart to creating compelling prose, be it for formal communication, email, chatbot or text correspondence. Uses are not limited to candidate communication, however. Today's AI-based applications can generate customized pre-screening questions as well as interview guides focused on the position and candidate in question.
The key here, as always, is that human input, monitoring and sometimes intervention are required. Other AI applications are more specific and intended to augment the functionality in a traditional ATS. Examples include Eightfold AI for skills and insights; Fuel50 for workforce mobility and talent management; VONQ for branded recruitment marketing; HiredScore, which has a strong focus on compliance and ethics; and Textio, which provides language guidance for inclusive and diverse hiring.
Some products are more tailored to specific industries. HireEZ (formerly Hiretual), for example, targets healthcare and technology professionals, and stores data on relationships of people and places. Staffing Engine is designed for use by staffing firms, while Codility and HackerRank (hardly a newcomer) are used to objectively assess software developer skills.



Performance reviews and recruiting are two of the more common early applications of generative AI in HR.







Using chatbots for recruiting is now mainstream
Conversational chatbots were early common applications of AI in talent acquisition products. Widely available for mobile devices, career sites and sometimes smartwatches, bots are increasingly relied upon to get potential candidates the focused information they need and walk them through job discovery, the application and often the onboarding process.
Chatbots, such as Paradox's Olivia, Eightfold AI's Amy and StepStone's Mya are increasingly sophisticated and friendly. Most bots can help navigate career sites, bringing pertinent jobs to the site visitor, and assist in the application process. They then manage interview scheduling, calendar coordination and sending reminders to relevant parties.
AI-based sourcing products -- Arya by Leoforce is one example -- provide a consolidated candidate communication dashboard, an essential tool for engaging and keeping track of voice, text, email and chatbot conversations. This capability is important because too often, candidate communication is lost in Post-it notes.
Using AI to funnel the most likely candidates to recruiters has become universal, without the biases surrounding age, gender, religion, race or ethnicity. This basic source, post, search, parse and match capability underlies all the talent acquisition products reviewed here and the majority in the market.


How is AI used in recruiting?
AI technology can look like old-fashioned search on steroids, and indeed, AI-enabled sourcing software can locate, deliver and filter huge volumes of data -- but more rapidly and accurately than ever before possible. Referred to as traditional AI by some, this data-provision capability is different from the generative AI that has been top of mind in the past year. Generative AI (ChatGPT is just one example) is the kind that is so useful in creating job descriptions and personalized correspondence.
It is important to understand how the engines work. To provide Day One value, the vendor has to have done extensive back-end work to avoid a cold start for the customer.
From the millions of records from which the engine learns, the vendor will create a model that will need to be validated repeatedly to ensure accurate results. This pretrained model and companion language-processing software ""know"" how to use a customer's own data to build a model tailored to that customer. More importantly, buyers need to understand that the model will continue to learn through their curation, use and periodic ingestion of new data -- hence the machine learning aspect -- to ensure relevancy, accuracy and freshness over time. Buyers should evaluate a vendor's ongoing support capabilities for that effort.
Vendors love to boast about the huge number of records their engine has ingested, records gleaned from many sources and of varying types. This is fodder for the engine, the substance from which it learns and from which a workable model is created. The real value of all this is in the relevance of the output, be it recommended candidates, suggested coursework or career paths.
In some cases, though, vendors can deliver pools of talent to the buyer. This is a different matter. The number referred to previously relates to the volume of data that the engine ingested to build a reliable model for the task at hand. The second is basically a virtual data lake of potential candidates available to the buyer, filtered by the trained AI engine, which avoids the Day One problem.
The continual ingestion of new records requires that the vendor assist with ongoing data curation and algorithm checks to guard against drifts into irrelevancy or inaccuracy.


But will it integrate?
Challenges in integrating diverse products always haunt buyers. Perhaps the closest thing to good news on this front is that the code for AI engines, while not standardized, is generally very similar from engine to engine. The products included here all claim to integrate with ATSes, and many offer bidirectional integration (Eightfold AI, for one). Some companies rely on partners to augment their systems. SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting integrates with Eightfold AI, Paradox's Olivia, Skillate and JobHopin, for example. These products add AI support to the core recruiting system for areas such as intelligent matching and shortlisting, salary information, chatbots and candidate ranking.



AI brings major benefits to recruiting but also carries significant risk.







Introduction to AI recruiting tools
There are many ways to evaluate products and vendors: breadth or depth of functionality provided, technology used, price, global availability, the software's sophistication, the degrees of support and training provided, the vendor's reputation for integrity or eco-consciousness and no doubt others. Here, products that rose to the top are considered; some are total ATSes and some are talent augmenting systems.
The products reviewed in this section tend to address the needs of at least three distinct user groups: candidates, recruiters and hiring managers, and often already-hired employees. The ATSes in general all support sourcing, job posting, data parsing, candidate shortlisting or ranking, multichannel communications, career site and mobile device chatbots, and intuitive UIs geared to the needs of the candidate, hiring manager and recruiter. All deliver analytics relevant to their product scope. They also provide bot-supported scheduling of interviews and follow-up conversations, a great boon to both candidates and recruiters. Several have extended their capabilities to current employees to meet the growing demand for career growth and mobility.
Serious buyers of new AI-powered recruiting software should not neglect products from longstanding vendors such as Oracle, ICIMS and Workday. These companies are deeply vested in recruiting and talent management expertise and have the support teams, cloud infrastructure, secure platforms and deep pockets startups generally lack. While startups are still in the early stages of their product releases, these older companies have developed and refined their AI software and support for customer initiatives. They also offer more complete products, reflecting their time in the market. Many of the products reviewed here, in fact, augment rather than replace products from these established firms. A further consideration when buying AI-powered recruiting tools is vendor longevity: Will your chosen vendor be acquired by another right in the middle of your implementation?
The goal here is not to cover every feature or function; the vendors' websites have product briefs with that information. Again, because the requirements of the recruitment process are clearly defined, the products are more similar than different. Therefore, points of uniqueness or specific strengths form the basis of differentiating the vendors here, in alphabetical order, not ranked.


Arya by Leoforce
The vendor claims ""Arya goes beyond conventional AI with artificial intuition, a deeper, multidimensional understanding of people, jobs and what makes them compatible,"" but doesn't say how the product does this. (Perhaps a clue is in the name: ""Arya"" means illustrious or spiritual in Sanskrit.)
Arya uses AI to source from internal databases, job boards and social networks, and provides one-click job ad placement, as do most similar products. Recruiters can engage with potential applicants via phone, text, email and bots from one integrated candidate communication dashboard. This desirable feature supports automation of personalized messages and streamlines communication throughout the entire process to facilitate contact with candidates. ATS integration is supported.
New in 2023 is a score details feature that delivers an explanation and analysis of a candidate's resume along with the overall score the system used for ranking suitability for a particular position, and Scouting Agent, an AI-driven search tool that can update candidate profiles every 24 hours. This followed the release of Candidate 360, a feature for recruiters that purports to provide a 360-degree view of a candidate's professional journey.
Arya includes candidate relationship marketing in its support for drip campaigns, a series of automated emails sent to candidates who take certain actions on a website. It can track the number of emails sent, opened, unopened and clicked, and supports one-to-one or one-to-many communication via email, text and direct dial -- features some ATSes don't have.
There are four versions. With Arya Quantum, Leoforce notably adds neurodiversity to its bias mitigation list. This should be a call-out capability in all talent acquisition products.
The Arya Pulse service provides agency-quality candidates without high staffing agency fees or long-term contracts. The cost can be as low as $599 per job to get a list of interview-ready candidates.
Another service, which signals that Leoforce is more than a software vendor, is Arya Concierge, in which the customer works with one dedicated recruiter expertly trained in using Arya to find highly compatible job candidates. Leoforce then engages with and qualifies the most compatible candidates, adding more of a traditional headhunter service to the offerings. The customer also receives all the qualified profiles Arya sourced, for future recruiting.


ICIMS Talent Cloud
ICIMS Talent Cloud deploys its AI engine to search for, opportunity match and recommend potential job candidates. Its conversational AI bot enables candidates to receive answers to FAQs, learn from employee-generated videos and schedule interviews in over 20 languages. In an attempt to make recruiter-relevant use of what may be sparse data, the digital assistant can parse an applicant's resume, creating a dynamic talent profile augmented with publicly available third-party information from external systems such as LinkedIn, if the customer has a partnership with the source, or from core HR systems. It then infers related adjacent skills the applicant may not have noted explicitly. The digital assistant integrates with communication platforms such as SMS text messaging, web chat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Microsoft Teams.
The product's intelligent search for career sites can deliver positions for applicants to consider that otherwise might not appear due to inconsistencies in spelling, acronyms or job titles. When applicants upload their resumes, Talent Cloud's AI recommends roles that align with their skills and experience.
ICIMS Talent Cloud offers the full set of recruiting and hiring analytics in an intuitive dashboard, updated regularly. Research by Apps Run the World in 2022 reported ICIMS as having the largest market share of any single ATS vendor. Oracle was second and Workday third.


Oracle Recruiting
For organizations using Oracle Cloud HCM for core HR, this closely integrated recruiting product makes sense. Thanks to its long time in the market and experience in hiring-management applications, Oracle provides sophisticated breadth and depth to address candidate relationship management and hiring management. It also applies a wealth of experience in UI creation, outshining some newer market entrants. Both traditional and generative AI span the Oracle human capital management (HCM) products, with examples as follows:
Recruiting

Job postings. Generative AI helps create engaging job descriptions that convey a position's requirements and success criteria.
Candidate recommendations. AI intelligent matching helps identify and recommend the best applicants for open positions, rank applicants and find similar candidates.
Time-to-hire prediction. AI-based predictive modeling benchmarks and predicts how long it will take to fill a job based on past hires.
Candidate summaries. Generative AI helps produce a concise summary that describes a candidate's best-fit capabilities and attributes for a position.

Skills growth and career development

Employee profile. Generative AI helps employees develop a summary of their role and work experience for their public profile.
Skills management. AI can keep an organization's skills inventory current, identify gaps and support talent planning decisions.
Skills recommendations. AI offers new skill recommendations to help employees grow and develop their careers, identifies skills to advertise on job requisitions and helps candidates uncover implicit skills so they submit their best, most relevant skills on job applications.
Career paths. AI helps employees understand their career-growth possibilities by making it easy for them to discover different career options and roles.

Performance management

Goal setting. Each employee has a generative AI assistant that suggests goal descriptions and metrics for success.
Performance summary. Summarizes performance reviews by analyzing multiple data sources to support performance conversations.
Peer recognition. Generative AI drafts comments that acknowledge an employee's success in a style that aligns with the corporate culture.

HR service delivery

Employee surveys. AI-suggested survey questions help drive higher response rates and give managers a better understanding of employee needs and sentiment.
Support. Employees get answers and complete workflows by conversing with an AI-powered digital assistant.
Intuitive knowledge base. Workers access a knowledge base with AI-powered search to help resolve routine inquiries.
Knowledge management. Generative AI creates knowledgebase articles to answer frequently asked questions.

Across all its AI-enhanced products, Oracle ensures that no personally identifiable information is ingested or displayed, the platform never publishes data out of the customer's HR system and all sensitive and proprietary information is protected.


Phenom Intelligent Talent Experience
Phenom goes beyond recruiting to follow-on talent management that includes employee career pathing and support for internal mobility. The company uses ""job zones"" as defined by the Occupational Information Network to group jobs based on the level of preparation required, such as education, training and experience, on a scale of 1 to 5.

Zones 1 and 2 include jobs like cashiers and drivers. The focus is on automation, giving organizations the ability to dictate where in the hiring process tasks should be automated to allow the recruiter and manager to focus on more value-adding activities. A high-volume hiring feature allows companies to engage candidates via chatbot, letting them search for jobs, apply, complete an assessment, submit a video and schedule an interview without interacting with recruiters. The assessment feature is a newer addition built by Phenom's industrial-organizational psychologists to succinctly capture the qualifications needed for frontline jobs in several industries.
Zone 3 roles require medium preparedness, with some education and certifications such as for electricians and medical assistants.
For zones 4 and 5, candidates need more engagement during their job search, while recruiters and managers require more AI-driven analysis during the interview process.

To improve the candidate experience, Phenom Talent Companion employs an AI chatbot that creates a streamlined but highly personalized engagement with knowledge worker candidates to find relevant jobs and get them through the application process faster.
Post-application, Interview Intelligence provides a centralized location for the hiring team to evaluate potential hires. Interviewers are provided with an AI summary of the interview, highlighting areas of interest based on the job requirements, as well as potential biases of the interviewer.
The AI assistant, Phenom X+, helps generate interview guides for keeping interviewers on track and avoiding bias or potentially illegal questions. X+ also enables recruiting teams to improve efficiency by automating repetitive tasks like scheduling interviews, adding notes to candidate profiles, drafting individual emails and generating job descriptions.
Phenom also provides customers with the tools they need to grow and retain hires. Skills are central to the technology that drives the entire platform, and they are especially relevant to Phenom's workforce intelligence system. This holistic suite of products is meant to engage employees and managers in talent management to facilitate personalized talent development, mentorships and internal mobility. With a skills ontology almost 15 years in the making, workforce intelligence makes it easy for HR to identify and fill skills gaps, managers to designate successors and promote career progression, and employees to gain visibility into opportunities that might help them excel in the organization.



Phenom's talent analytics shows metrics such as the number of candidates in the hiring pipeline and comparisons of recruitment marketing campaigns.





All of this ties back to talent acquisition activities as well, letting recruiters employ skills technology to quickly find the best fit for an open role, whether inside or outside the organization. The AI does the heavy lifting but keeps the human in the loop by letting recruiters and managers incorporate their needs when a role opens.


Skillate
Skillate is now part of Sense, which makes AI talent engagement software for recruiting that targets the staffing industry. Skillate provides an AI-powered matching engine, chatbot screening, resume parsing and automatic interview scheduling.
Skillate starts with writing the job description itself, offering assistance by suggesting better keywords and skills. It provides the resume-to-req matching and resume parsing that are the basis of all the products reviewed here. The product collects resumes from potential sources -- such as its internal database, third-party ATSes, Google Drive, mailboxes, referrals, external agencies and career pages -- and runs incoming resumes against its machine learning model, ranking and scoring them for their fit with the job at hand. Skillate reports its AI algorithms have been trained with a data set of 120 million profiles.
First-round screening is AI-enabled here: The chatbot automatically screens the candidates for information beyond resumes, such as notice periods, intent to relocate and salary expectations.
Skillate integrates with SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, Workday, SmartRecruiters, and Oracle Taleo.


TurboHire
TurboHire bills itself as a recruitment automation platform, adding AI to the tasks all recruiters face: job marketing and screening, interview scheduling, feedback collection, and candidate engagement and inquiry. It accommodates global and high-volume hiring through bulk email campaigns and WhatsApp and text integration. Like in other products reviewed here, customizing is possible without touching code, so recruiters can adapt it for their preferred practices. The software has an integrated agency-management portal that enables partners to contribute candidates, track their status and manage compliance, which is key to recruiting in much of Asia.
TurboHire has AI-enabled many of the standard workflows of recruiting and hiring, delivered in a series of modules. Like most such products, the focus is on productivity and efficiency. The company claims to have automated 85% of manual recruiting activities. Its platform integrates with solutions from companies such as Oracle and SAP SuccessFactors. Single sign-on is accommodated with Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace.





AI in talent sourcing
Locating potential employees, especially passive candidates, is its own challenge. Products that use AI in sourcing have the advantage of searching huge and widespread sources of talent almost instantly. While this kind of AI is part of most ATSes, some products that augment ATSes are worth calling out. As the first product offerings from their respective vendors, these may grow into full-fledged ATSes over time, be acquired and added to an ATS player's product, or remain as a separate tool for at least the short term.


Fetcher
If there were a reward for clever product names, Fetcher might win because it does just that: fetches potential applicants. Fetcher is a candidate sourcing and scheduling tool with the recruiting analytics buyers expect. Used by small businesses with English-only needs, it identifies candidates based on AI-powered keyword matches. Over time, it learns a company's candidate preferences and then identifies potential talent accordingly.
The platform automates the standard requirements for email outreach campaigns, provides a duplication option to reuse previous search criteria and has a notes feature for recruiter feedback. The information provided is piped directly to the vendor's internal teams, to further tailor the search, enhance the algorithms and help Fetcher find and deliver the candidates sought. The scheduling plugin allows for rapid company-branded scheduling of telephone screens and interviews.
While the sourcing functions of this product are not unique, it is nonetheless an intuitive tool for recruiters in small businesses. It integrates out of the box with Ashby, Fountain, Greenhouse, Lever, JazzHR, Oracle Taleo, Recruitee, SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, SmartRecruiters and Teamtailor.


SeekOut
SeekOut provides an AI-powered talent search engine to help recruiters quickly find and hire the most qualified passive candidates. It appears to be Boolean-based, a potentially limiting approach that can be hard to use. The company says it provides access to hundreds of millions of candidates from potentially untapped talent pools, including public profiles, GitHub, the papers and patents of experts, employee referrals, company alumni and candidates already in the organization's ATS. There are more than 100 searchable fields that include skill sets, background, experience, education and diversity, as well as fields such as security clearance, which is useful for U.S. federal government positions. A healthcare talent pool, for example, includes 5.5 million healthcare professionals. In all, the company claims to have over 800 million public profiles, 330 million of which are underrepresented candidates.
SeekOut supports the concept of a total talent pool as well as individuals. Recruiters can see total amalgamated talent by location and specific people with that talent in that location. This is a potentially valuable feature many other platforms lack.
SeekOut's ability to locate and screen tech talent should be a draw for organizations that need technologists. From GitHub, the app can provide and review actual code to better evaluate a potential applicant's technical prowess. It appears to be easy and intuitive to use, albeit with a slightly underwhelming UI for people accustomed to today's glitzier applications, and is definitely worth considering.


XOR AI Recruiter
Much of the recruiting industry focuses on white-collar and professional hiring and only adds large-volume hiring as an afterthought, often glossing over this important employee segment. Addressing this, XOR says it provides a digital recruiting assistant that enables its platform to deliver blue-collar workers for only $500 a hire in less than five days.
XOR AI Recruiter employs the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of ChatGPT to provide a conversational recruiter chatbot and consolidated communication platform with tools for text messaging, WhatsApp, live chat, phone calls and video to drive engagement. It uses the AI chatbots to automate repetitive tasks such as screening, scheduling, reengagement, onboarding and rehiring. Availability in more than 100 languages enhances its use for multinational corporations -- for example, Ikea is a customer.
It offers bidirectional integration with several prominent ATS systems. XOR sources candidates from job boards, text conversations, career sites, the ATS itself and, with added extensions, other websites.
XOR AI Recruiter is more of an automated service than a purchasable product. In addition to targeted digital marketing for advertising campaigns and virtual career fairs, the vendor uses nonconventional sourcing channels, such as multilevel referral programs, and relies on influencers in local communities to spread the word about hot job openings and motivate candidates to apply. The XOR system then connects and interacts with the candidate directly rather than through job boards.
Similar to the functionality of other products discussed here, once recruiters select the essential requirements for candidates, XOR AI Recruiter will screen them, assign scores and automatically schedule and remind them about their upcoming interview.


Skills-based talent decisions for today and tomorrow
Few areas are getting more attention from business executives than skills. It's the ground zero of talent management, and fears about the skills gap are deep-seated. The pandemic didn't help, as many companies failed to use the time to upskill employees. The supposed Great Resignation (the baby-boom generation retiring), the perception that high school and college graduates lack necessary skills, and the advent of new technologies that require new, different and often sophisticated skills have all contributed to a skill malaise. Reskilling has been a hot topic, but little evidence of widespread results has been forthcoming.
The issue is longstanding. Traditional HR systems of record have disparate data about each candidate and employee that is often fragmented across systems and self-reported based on each person's recollection of what they accomplished. It never encapsulates the depth and breadth of what they have done -- and most certainly does not yield insight into their potential. Businesses know frightfully little about the skills their employees really have, and often even the exact skills the business needs.
Here are two noteworthy products, among many in the market, that use AI in ascertaining and improving skills.


Eightfold AI Talent Intelligence suite
Eightfold calls its product a talent intelligence platform that enables ""holistic"" talent strategies, and it could be among the first of an emerging product category. Eightfold has a proprietary global data set of more than 1.5 billion talent profiles from which its AI generates recommendations to help employers decide how and when to build, buy or borrow talent. It employs a skills-based framework that matches people to opportunities, including full-time, part-time, project and gig work. Eightfold uses that data to understand the availability, maturity, relevance, learnability and evolution of skills in specific organizations and throughout the global market.
Eightfold's Job Intelligence Engine powers skills-based talent decisions about the job requirements needed for every role in an organization. This skills-based approach drives decision-making around upskilling, reskilling, hiring, staffing of contractors and attaining diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals. Additionally, the job intelligence engine examines skill adjacency and context to determine future capabilities and needs as organizations grow. The platform also enables self-learning, data-driven updates that help to ensure consistent, unbiased evaluations of individual capabilities and ability to learn against globally standardized job descriptions and requirements.
One of the products in the Eightfold platform, Eightfold Talent Management, is available in more than 24 languages. Employees can use it to find reskilling and upskilling opportunities across courses, mentors and projects based on current skills and career aspirations. The goal of people developing their own skills and assuming responsibility for their career growth is addressed through curated opportunities for continuous learning. By using Eightfold, organizations can better understand the potential of their workforce on a global scale and guide individual employees to further learning, skill development and career opportunities.
Eightfold integrates with Workday, SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, Oracle Taleo, Oracle Recruiting Cloud, Greenhouse and others.


Fuel50
Most of the products that play a part in recruiting begin with the job or role. Fuel50 turns that premise on its head, looking first at the skills across the organization and how to better position them. This requires reviewing every job description and updating it with the talents and skills needed for each role, rather than the degrees, years of experience and certifications required. Fuel50 helps people identify their talents and skills and supports their growth with career development actions, feedback and learning. The result is not just internal talent mobility but also workforce agility.
A woman-owned company founded by Anne Fulton, Fuel50 provides an AI-driven talent marketplace that also fuels engagement and employee retention with global coverage. Its tool helps organizations understand their bench strength, build talent pipelines, predict skills shortages and conduct workforce mapping.
Fuel50's AI architecture uses validated career frameworks to fast-track the rebuilding of an organization's career framework to eliminate the manual process of creating and maintaining job profiles, which change often in growing companies.



AI plays a role in many steps of the recruiting process, especially job posting, candidate screening and interview scheduling.







Other notables
Dozens and dozens of stellar AI products for talent acquisition and longer-term talent management are not complete ATSes yet definitely merit consideration. Here's a sample of those that have risen to the top.


HireVue
HireVue calls its product a ""talent experience platform"" designed to automate workflows and scale hiring. Long noted for its video interview capabilities, HireVue has made them less bias-prone by using natural language translation to provide a transcript for hiring managers and recruiters. The process creates a blind interview and eliminates potential discrimination by race, gender, color, appearance, dialect, name, age, etc.
HireVue's AI recruiting assistant bot is text-only and provides chat-based job matching. It supports mobile devices and smartwatches via text messaging and WhatsApp.
However, what merits attention here is the vendor's documentation, which is prominently placed on its website. HireVue has done something I have nagged vendors about for half a decade: explain how its AI engine works to mitigate adverse impact on protected groups. It has articulated a very clear, detailed and understandable ""Explainability Statement"" providing the transparency that is essential when using AI-based products for hiring and assessment. In addition, a second statement, ""Bias, AI ethics and the HireVue approach,"" documents HireVue's approach to ethical AI in online hiring.
Every purveyor of AI in talent acquisition should make sure buyers have such an understanding.


Paradox
My favorite part of Paradox, I confess, is Olivia, a multilingual recruiting assistant chatbot named after the founder's spouse. I am putting Olivia in the best bot category. According to the company, Olivia can answer tens of thousands of candidate or employee questions accurately, consistently and at any time of the day. As with all the talent acquisition bots included here, Olivia was developed as an assistant to offload repetitive chores and question answering from busy recruiters. This she does, but Olivia also solves the logistical challenge of interview scheduling and can review hundreds of hiring managers' calendars to schedule interviews in seconds. The bot's automated text reminders help to reduce interview cancellations and no-shows, potentially saving time for recruiters. Olivia can also schedule large events, onboarding sessions, seasonal hiring and orientation, and manage registration and reminders.
While Olivia offloads work for recruiters, the Experience Assistant focuses on the potential applicant. Apparently now part of a bot team with Experience Assistant, Olivia becomes a dynamic content-discovery engine that makes any career site experience feel like it was built specifically for that candidate, allowing personalized interaction on mobile and desktop devices. When people start a conversation with Olivia, the chatbot uses candidate responses, geolocation, resume data and more to create an immersive, hyper-personalized experience that serves only the most relevant jobs and content to each person. The experience works with any career site provider and provides the UI that candidates have come to expect on consumer apps like Instagram and Snapchat.
In a slightly different vein, after acquiring Traitify, a personality data company that was building the personality data genome for the employment marketplace, Paradox debuted Animated Assessment. Starring a character named Ash, the two-minute mobile phone app measures a person's openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism through ""me"" and ""not me"" responses. Recruiters can then use the results in ascertaining the fit with their current openings.


An AI caveat for buyers
If you are in the market for a new talent acquisition system or are augmenting an existing system, you will very likely be looking at a product that has AI. AI capabilities can greatly assist recruiters and hiring managers because of the speed and accuracy with which open reqs can be addressed. But as mentioned, buying a product with the machine learning you need means it is not necessarily plug-and-play. Most buyers need training and assistance with the ongoing learning that the AI will have to do to ensure that the requirements of the specific organization are addressed, DEI goals are met and the system doesn't go rogue or lose relevancy over time.
This means carefully evaluating the vendor in addition to the product by asking the following questions:

How large is the support team that works with each customer on their organizationally specific machine learning?
How often is the system refreshed with new learning?
What is the AI development team's roadmap for the year ahead?
Will AI-savvy support teams be spread too thin to accommodate a growing customer base?
What customer education is provided about how the system works?
How does the vendor support the AI transparency essential to explainability?
What is the model for anomaly detection?
How often do the vendor's data scientists monitor the system for signs it has drifted away from intended outcomes?

There is yet another point vital to technology considerations. A study by Madeline Laurano, founder of Aptitude Research, found that one in two recruiters would join another organization if it had better technology. (The study also reported that one in three recruiters were looking for new jobs.) Dated talent acquisition software can well lead to attrition in an organization's recruiting professionals.


An AI caveat for recruiters
Recruiters obviously aren't the only ones with access to AI. Applicants also have easy, cost-free access and can use generative AI and other tools to their benefit -- and in some cases, to the detriment of recruiters. Resumes can be more easily tailored to the job at hand (which can be good) but an applicant can also figure out how to apply for hundreds, even thousands, of jobs at once, which makes gauging actual interest difficult.


Conclusion
The quest for superior talent is never-ending. Through smart technology choices that include AI, machine learning and NLP, recruiters will be able to accomplish this faster and more easily. As important, through wise purchasing decisions, they can also ensure their ability to ethically hire a diverse employee base.
Today's tools cover every aspect of talent acquisition, from recruitment marketing to sourcing, job description management, candidate assessment and pre-screening; recommending other positions in an organization to qualified applicants; offer and rejection management; skill assessment; and career and learning assistance and direction -- all with far more sophisticated analytics than were available in the past.
AI in talent acquisition can provide a hands-free approach to time-intensive tasks such as interview scheduling and initial qualification screening, much like robots in factory-floor automation. Currently, however, the technology is applied more as helping hands, adding speed and efficiency to the same work recruiters have always done. While this may help organizations get by with fewer recruiters, it also can support scenarios where more human contact, not less, is needed.
Editor's note: The products included here rank high in web search results, are comprehensive, have strong integration or are from established vendors of HCM suites.

In Brief


Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, and others can improve the efficiency of common language generation tasks performed by CPAs, but using LLMs entails certain risks. To help CPAs reap the benefits while minimizing the risks of this emerging technology, the authors suggest six principles to guide CPAs as they incorporate LLMs into their work.
Recently, the topic of artificial intelligence (AI) has captured the imagination of the public and professionals alike. Image generators like Dall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion have challenged the definition of art. The increased use of self-driving cars has challenged the role of human drivers. Large Language Models (LLM), including ChatGPT (by OpenAI), Bing Chat (Microsoft), and Bard (Google), have emulated human conversation and facilitated professional and creative writing. LLMs have been quickly adopted by the public. For example, ChatGPT surpassed 100 million users within two months of its release in November 2022, smashing the adoption record previously held by Google, which took one full year to draw the same number of users (“ChatGPT Statistics for 2023: Comprehensive Facts and Data,” DemandSage, 2023, https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/). Nearly 30% of professionals acknowledge having used ChatGPT at work, according to a survey by Fishbowl, a Glassdoor product (“Almost 30% of Professionals Say They’ve Tried ChatGPT at Work,” Bloomberg News, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/3jfempyh). In March 2023, ChatGPT and Bard were the most well-known and used LLMs for public use, with many considering ChatGPT to be more useful (“How ChatGPT and Bard Performed as My Executive Assistants,” New York Times, Brian Chen, March 29, 2023; https://tinyurl.com/4dt98mrm). As of August 2023, the most prominent LLMs are ChatGPT (by OpenAI), Bard (Google), Bing Chat (Microsoft—built using ChatGPT), LLAMA (Meta), Bloom (Big-Science), and Dolly (Databricks) (“Popular Open-Source Large—Language Models,” Analytics Insight, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/5fb3h9e3).
An LLM is best thought of as an extremely fluent extension of predictive text. Just as a smartphone or e-mail client can suggest one or two words based on the context of the sentence being written, an LLM utilizes its training on a vast body of text (its “corpus”) to generate text in response to a user’s prompt. Instead of merely predicting the next two or three upcoming words to complete a phrase or sentence, LLMs can reply to a user’s prompt with several paragraphs of coherent (and often accurate) text across many domains. As of August 2023, LLMs can accept input files and create text (including computer code) from those inputs. One of the primary features of LLMs that distinguish them from other AI models is that LLMs can generate a response to a prompt on an unknown (to them) topic. The response may be highly inaccurate, but the response is based on LLMs’ contextual knowledge of (what they deem are) similar topics.








LLMs in Accounting
LLMs are adept at interpreting, synthesizing, and expressing results in natural language. These capabilities have been applied in a variety of fields, including writing product recommendations for retailers, reading transcripts and summarizing earnings calls, and preparing marketing copy. CPAs—especially at firms with limited resources—may be curious to experiment with LLMs to improve the efficiency of common language generation tasks. For example, LLMs can be used to form a rough draft summarizing tax issues to a taxpayer client, prepare a memo to staff, draft a courteous e-mail to an audit client, describe how to conduct a particular process, conduct research into technical topics, or quickly gain an understanding of the risks and opportunities facing a particular industry.

Using LLMs effectively requires an appreciation of the risks of this technology. One of the major risks is data privacy. CPAs have a responsibility to protect client data, and need to practice extreme caution when using LLMs with client data. LLMs have many features (for example, as of August 2023, ChatGPT has the ability to accept multiple input files of data; “ChatGPT—Release Notes,” OpenAI, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/25a27fhd) that make it easy and enticing to input client data into the LLM, but uploading data entails significant data security risks. Other risks associated with LLMs include their limited ability to provide useful responses in specialized bodies of knowledge, their struggle to adequately process facts that adhere to a timeline, the difficulty in sorting fact from fiction in their responses, the need to critically assess the rationale for their answers, their struggle to cite their sources, and determining which degree of confidence should be placed in their answers.
The accounting profession is currently navigating the tension between the advantages offered by LLMs and their risks. For example, in February 2023, PwC Australia encouraged their staff to “experiment with ChatGPT personally, and to think about the role generative AI could play in our business” (“PwC Warns Staff against Using ChatGPT for Client Work,” Australian Financial Review, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/43de5crw), but cautioned:

It is important that we navigate the risks and limitations of using [LLMs]… They are stochastic in nature (meaning you could get a different answer every time you ask the same question), they can present inaccuracies as though they are facts, and they are prone to user error. They will require review and oversight and cross-validation of results before they can be relied upon for tasks that demand precision.

Six Principles for the Effective Use Of LLMs



Research on the performance of LLMs in the accounting domain is rapidly emerging. In January 2023, a team of 327 researchers compared the performance of ChatGPT 3.5 to university students. They found that, although students outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 by an average score of 76.7% versus 56.5%, ChatGPT 3.5 performed better than students on a not-inconsiderable 15.8% of assessments (David A. Wood, et al., “The ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence Chatbot: How Well Does It Answer Accounting Assessment Questions?”, Issues in Accounting Education, November 2023). However, four months later, Eulerich, Sanatizadeh, Vakilzadeh, and Wood found that the next generation of ChatGPT (ChatGPT 4.0) was able to “easily pass” the CPA, CMA, CIA, and EA (enrolled agent) exams with an average score of 85.1% (“Can Artificial Intelligence Pass Accounting Certification Exams? ChatGPT: CPA, CMA, CIA, and EA?”). A related line of literature applies LLMs to hypothetical or actual accounting practice. Street and Wilck applied ChatGPT 3.5 to the forensic accounting domain and concluded that forensic accountants need to apply their own accounting expertise to critically evaluate LLM responses for shortcomings (Daniel Street and Joseph Wilck, “‘Let’s Have a Chat’: Principles for the Effective Application of ChatGPT and Large Language Models in the Practice of Forensic Accounting,” Journal of Forensic and Investigative Accounting, July–December 2023, http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4351817). Emett et al. documented the application of ChatGPT 3.5 in a large energy company’s internal audit function and estimate efficiency gains of 50-80% (Scott A. Emett, Marc Eulerich, Egemen Lipinski, Nicolo Prien, and David A. Wood, “Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhancing the Internal Audit Process–A Real-World Example from a Large Multinational Company,” 2023, working paper, http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4514238). Notably, each of these articles identified risks and challenges facing accountants seeking to benefit from LLMs.
Grounded in this recent research, this article provides six principles to guide CPAs as they incorporate LLMs into their workflow. Applying these principles will enable CPAs to minimize the risk of this emerging technology while still reaping the available benefits of increased efficiency and effectiveness. After describing each of the six principles, this article provides an illustration that demonstrates how applying these principles improves the performance of LLMs on a tax accounting task.


The Six Principles

1. Develop Specific Questions and Avoid Broad Requests
LLMs are trained on a broad corpus of text and have a wide range of domain knowledge. This can make them very effective tools, but asking the right questions in the accounting domain takes practice. Prompts (questions) for LLMs are most effective if they are specific and reference the context of the prompt. For example, the prompt “How should a building be valued on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP?” will be more effective than “How should a building be valued on a balance sheet?”. CPAs should also either avoid or define ambiguous terms within the prompt. “How do I account for the purchase of a bond as an investment?” is more likely to be effective than “How do I record a bond transaction?”, because “bond” could either refer to the transaction in which a bond is issued or purchased. Users can also provide an example in the prompt and request that the LLM use a specific framework (e.g., “Prepare an expected credit loss schedule for my receivables using the following table format”).
In summary, we recommend that CPAs provide LLMs with prompts that are specific, provide the context for the question, explain or define ambiguous terms, and provide an example (if applicable).


2. Actively Monitor the Inquiry and Interpretation Process by Breaking Down Complex Tasks into Verifiable Subtasks
The breadth of information in an LLM’s corpus can lead to problems when different accounting bases or tax standards can apply to a given prompt. For instance, unless instructed clearly, an LLM could provide information from either U.S. GAAP or IFRS; thus, it is critical that CPAs must exercise skepticism and utilize their expertise to ensure that the proper concepts have been applied in the output of the LLM. Only with sufficient expertise will an accountant recognize when IFRS standards are being applied, but U.S. GAAP standards are needed. (Different LLMs have different strengths and weaknesses: It’s worth noting that, as of August 2023, ChatGPT does not reliably cite its sources; in fact, sometimes when you ask ChatGPT to cite sources, it makes up sources that don’t exist. On the other hand, Bing Chat reliably cites its sources by providing web links.) In other words, LLMs are subject to significant rates of “Type 2 error”: LLMs may provide responses that appear relevant and accurate on their face, but are inaccurate when reviewed more carefully. Therefore, we recommend that CPAs maintain a high degree of concept skepticism, critically assessing whether the concept that the LLM has applied in a given response is indeed the correct concept expected to be applied (with respect to accounting basis, framework, or standard).
LLMs are trained on a corpus of data that spans time. Although this provides them with an impressive breadth of knowledge, LLMs struggle to differentiate between information over time. An LLM might provide the current accounting and tax standard information, or it might provide outdated and superseded information. CPAs should also understand and carefully consider the extent to which the LLM they employ has access to current information. The corpus supporting ChatGPT 3.5, for example, only consists of information through the end of 2021; ChatGPT 3.5, therefore, will not be able to provide tax or accounting information that has changed since that time. Its response to a request for the IRS mileage rates or the deductibility of medical expenses may or may not contain correct information for the proper tax year. Similarly, it will not be able to describe the impact of any current economic or business events occurring after that date. Other LLMs including Bing Chat and Bard have access to Internet information sources, and can more reliably refer to current information. We recommend that CPAs critically assess whether the information that the LLM has provided indeed applies to the proper time period.
In the authors’ experience, LLMs provide more accurate responses to specific tasks and questions rather than large or complex tasks. For example, ChatGPT 3.5 provides more accurate responses when prompted to generate the assets, liabilities, or stockholders’ equity portions of a balance sheet separately rather than preparing an entire balance sheet at once. We recommend that CPAs break down large tasks into smaller portions and ask LLMs to perform those smaller tasks in sequence. This also allows for a user to verify the correctness of each smaller task before beginning the next step in the process.


3. Understand LLMs’ Contextual Boundaries, and Do Not Input Private, Sensitive, or Proprietary Information
In addition to the data provided in its corpus, an LLM can receive and respond to user-submitted text and data. Although this feature facilitates the broad functionality of LLMs, inputting private, sensitive, or proprietary data input into an LLM, raises serious concerns about data storage and privacy issues. For example, LLMs could incorporate user-submitted data into their knowledge and then synthesize and provide this information to other users without the right to this data. Until and unless LLMs are implemented with reliable privacy safeguards (including an “on-premise server” or a “private instance” for a particular company or firm), the authors recommend that CPAs do not input private, sensitive, or proprietary information into LLMs.
LLMs are designed to have natural conversations with users. ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard all attempt to remember the context of a conversation and, once effectively prompted, stay within the scope of the topic. If the LLM misinterprets a prompt or additional information is needed, users can ask follow-up or clarifying questions and the LLM will consider them within the context of the earlier questions within the conversation. For example, if you ask an LLM about how a building should be valued under U.S. GAAP and then in a subsequent question ask, “Which depreciation methods are acceptable?”, it is likely to tailor its responses to depreciation methods common for buildings. Therefore, we recommend that users ask follow-up questions and provide clarifications and directions within a given conversation. But exercise discretion with feedback—LLMs can learn from user feedback and incorporate it into its base of knowledge.
As of August 2023, ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard all have the ability to save previous chats (known as “chat history”). However, ChatGPT does not actively remember the context of previous chats when answering responses in a new chat (OpenAI Developer Forum, April 2023, https://community.openai.com/). Similar documentation for Bing Chat is unavailable, but it is reasonable to expect that Bing Chat also does not remember the context of previous chats when responding to a new chat; by contrast, Google Bard was designed to remember previous conversations. Bard’s capability is limited by the amount of computing memory and available capacity; thus, its recollection may not be very good (Bard FAQ Page, August 2023, https://bard.google.com/faq). Because many LLMs cannot access context developed in other conversations, the authors recommend that CPAs create a new conversation when switching to a new task or topic.


4. Carefully Scrutinize and Recalculate Quantitative Responses
Although impressively fluent with text, LLMs are quite poor at any but the clearest quantitative tasks. It is important for CPAs to remember that the fundamental task of an LLM is to suggest a sequence of text that best responds to the user’s prompt. LLMs are not designed to produce quantitative responses, nor are they skilled at mathematical procedures, although they will provide numeric text if that text is predicted to be the best in a given response. For example, when the authors tasked ChatGPT with creating an income statement based on several business transactions, a portion of its response asserted that $2.00 + $5.50 + $7.50 = $17.50. Similarly, when preparing a partial balance sheet, it asserted that fixed assets “have a total value of $1,775.00 but also have been depreciated by $1,055.00. The net value of the fixed assets after depreciation is $4,720.00.” CPAs are much better off utilizing spreadsheet software, business calculators, or nearly any other alternative software rather than relying on an LLM to conduct mathematical procedures. CPAs can ask LLMs to suggest, identify, or describe the mathematical process to be used for a given scenario, but we recommend that CPAs do not use LLMs to actually perform mathematical calculations.


5. Rely on Other Sources for Factual Information, Especially for Less Prominent Topics
Like many other LLMs, ChatGPT was trained on a large corpus that included both fact and fiction across many knowledge areas. Approximately 3% of ChatGPT’s corpus consists of “facts” from Wikipedia and an additional 38% has been vetted by humans beyond the original author. [ChatGPT’s corpus consisted of a general “crawl” of the Internet (60%), websites with a certain level of upvotes (22%), books (16%), and Wikipedia (3%) (“Language Models are Few-Shot Learners,” Tom B. Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, et al., 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). Although the general “crawl” provided the largest amount of data included in the corpus, Wikipedia data was given the highest weight, followed by websites with the most up-votes. ChatGPT’s crawl of the Internet allowed it to learn how to use conversational language across a wide breadth of content.] In addition to factual knowledge, ChatGPT has been designed to engage in human-like conversation and is capable of creating new answers; it can create new computer code, write a poem, or speak in a given person’s style. Its training encouraged it to communicate facts as well as to communicate with human-like creativity. Unfortunately, ChatGPT does not articulate to the user whether it is conveying facts or displaying creativity; hence, it may lie. Other LLMs have different training and reward structures, and are capable of providing references for facts.
The “knowledge” of an LLM is probabilistic. The authors have encountered situations where ChatGPT’s responses have disagreed with each other, even in the same conversation. For example, the authors have observed ChatGPT state that an event has occurred in one year, but when asked again, it states that the event actually occurred in a different year. Certain firms have prohibited the use of ChatGPT due to concerns over factual accuracy (“PwC Warns Staff against Using ChatGPT for Client Work,” Australian Financial Review, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/43de5crw). We recommend that CPAs seek “knowledge” or “facts” from sources other than an LLM. CPAs should evaluate and cross-check any factual claims provided by an LLM using a reliable alternative source.
The more frequently an item appears in an LLM’s corpus, the more knowledgeable the LLM will be about that topic. More prominent concepts, events, and firms appear more frequently in the corpus, and allow the LLM to respond more capably to prompts on these subjects. For example, an LLM is much more capable of addressing questions about federal tax law than about municipal tax regulations. Therefore, we suggest that CPAs rely more on the responses provided by LLMs for topics that are more prominent.


6. Use LLMs to Enhance Rather than Replace Human Expertise
LLMs can make the work of a CPA more efficient and potentially more effective, but they cannot replace a CPA’s expertise. The authors have successfully used LLMs to enhance our work by having them:

 Draft memos or e-mails
 Structure sensitive and effective feedback
 Overcome writer’s block and jumpstart creativity
 Gather information on technical accounting topics
 Generate understandable descriptions of technical issues in auditing
 Provide introductory information about opportunities and threats facing particular industries
 Review notable historical and economic events
 Produce creative text.

Although the authors recommend that accountants use LLMs to enhance their work on a variety of tasks, we do not predict the “death of accounting” at the hands of LLMs anytime soon, for at least four reasons:

 LLMs cannot be relied upon as a trustworthy subordinate or specialist because they fail to comply with the expertise, objectivity, and independence requirements of auditors (AICPA Code of Professional Conduct section .300.050.01-02 and AU-C section 620, “Using the Work of an Auditor’s Specialist”), nor can LLM output serve as audit evidence because its work is not reproducible, nor guaranteed to be sufficient and appropriate (AU-C section 500, “Audit Evidence”). If LLMs cannot truly be objective and independent, nor can they produce reliable audit evidence, they cannot be relied on as a trustworthy subordinate or specialist.
 Even if LLMs are improved technically to understand the nuanced context of accounting events and to properly perform the required mathematical operations, LLMs will not be able to exercise the professional judgment of a CPA when it comes to the qualities of decision-useful information.
 Although broadly trained, LLMs are unlikely to be able to tailor their responses to the particular institutional features and dynamics of a specific topic, especially if it is small or unique.
 At best, LLMs are trained on recent data, but they will always be based on historical training and will struggle to provide innovative, future-oriented advice.




An Illustration Applying the Six Principles
To illustrate how CPAs can apply these six principles in practice, consider the following hypothetical situation: The year is 2021. You sent an update to your client list about eligibility for the California Young Child Tax Credit. One of your clients falls within the phase-out range for this credit (Regina Jenkins, a W2 employee with AGI of $28,000 and single mother of two qualifying children, a 3-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son). Regina has heard a lot about the Federal Advance Child Tax Credit Payments in 2021, so she sent you an e-mail asking whether she’ll be receiving monthly checks for this California credit, and if so, whether and how she should opt-out.
Prompt 1:

I sent all of my clients an email about an upcoming tax credit [1] that they may qualify for. [2] Regina Jenkins [3], my client, has an adjusted gross income of $28,000. Regina told me that she is eligible for the tax credit. Does that mean she’ll receive a check immediately? [4] How much would the check be? [5] Should she opt out of the payment? [6,7]

Principles Violated by Prompt 1:

This prompt was not specific enough, violating Principle 1 in several ways. First, the prompt used the ambiguous term “tax credit” rather than specifying the credit. Second, information was sought about the California Young Child Tax Credit rather than the Federal Advance Child Tax Credit, but this was not made clear.
Seeking information on a California credit violates Principle 5 by asking for information related to a niche rather than a prominent topic.
Providing our client’s name violates Principle 3 by giving the LLM private and sensitive client information.
This question violates Principle 5 because it asks ChatGPT for reliable, factual information.
Asking ChatGPT to provide an inherently quantitative response violates Principle 4.
This question cedes responsibility to ChatGPT rather than being used to leverage the CPA’s own expertise, violating Principle 6.
Asking all three of these questions at once violates Principle 2 and does not leverage LLMs contextual boundaries (discussed in Principle 3).

Performance of selected LLMs on Prompt 1. The authors input “Prompt 1” into ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard in August 2023.
ChatGPT. ChatGPT responded about tax credits broadly, rather than seeking clarification about which tax credit information was sought. Although each of the questions in the prompt was addressed in the response, the answers were not sufficiently precise. A portion of the response provided by ChatGPT follows: “The eligibility for a tax credit doesn’t necessarily mean that the individual will receive a check immediately. Tax credits can affect a person’s tax liability, which could result in a refund or reduced tax owed when they file their tax return for the relevant tax year.” (ChatGPT 3.5, OpenAI, https://chat.openai.com/). At the end of its response, ChatGPT acknowledged its limitations and caveated its response with a recommendation that Regina should “reach out to a tax professional who can guide her based on her individual circumstances and the specific tax credit in question.”
Bing Chat: Rather than providing information about a given tax credit or about tax credits broadly, Bing Chat requested more specific information from the user. A portion of its response follows: “It is not clear which tax credit you are referring to. There are many tax credits available, and the amount and eligibility requirements vary depending on the specific credit. Could you please provide more information about the tax credit you mentioned in your e-mail to your clients? That way, I can better assist you with your question.” (Bing Chat, Microsoft, https://www.bing.com/search/)
Google Bard: Google Bard assumed we sought information about the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Based on this assumption, it attempted to calculate Regina’s EITC, then stated that Regina would not receive an advance payment. A portion of its response follows: “The tax credit you are referring to is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Regina is eligible for the EITC because her adjusted gross income (AGI) is below the threshold for her filing status. The maximum EITC for a taxpayer with an AGI of $28,000 is $480. Regina will not receive a check immediately. The EITC is a refundable tax credit, which means that it can reduce Regina’s tax liability to zero and she will receive any remaining credit as a refund. Regina should not opt out of the payment. The EITC is a valuable tax credit that can help Regina reduce her tax burden and get a larger refund.” (Bard, Google, https://bard.google.com/).
By contrast, Prompt 2 adheres to the above principles by relying on the CPA’s judgment and expertise at quantitative tasks while leveraging LLMs’ fluid writing abilities. In the following prompt, the underlined portions in the following prompt demonstrate how the prompt adheres to the six principles, which are specified in brackets. (Neither the underline formatting nor the bracketed contents were provided to the LLMs.)
Prompt 2:

I have a client [Principle 3] who is eligible for the 2021 California Young Child Tax Credit [Principle 1]. They are subject to a phaseout [Principles 5, 6] because their income is between $25k and $30k. Because of the phase-out, they are eligible for a total annual refundable credit of $434 [Principle 4] on their year-end tax return rather than the maximum possible credit of $1,083. Please draft an e-mail to send to my client to explain this situation. [Principles 1, 7]

Performance of selected LLMs on Prompt 2: The authors input “Prompt 2” into ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard in August 2023. ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard each generated an e-mail template in a matter of seconds. The responses from each of the tools were noticeably more accurate than those provided in response to Prompt 1.
ChatGPT: ChatGPT provided a well-written, professional e-mail that cogently communicated the impact of the phase-out on Regina’s credit amount. A portion of that response follows: “Given your income level, I want to clarify the specifics of how the phaseout affects your eligibility and the resulting credit amount. The maximum possible credit for the California Young Child Tax Credit is $1,083. However, due to your income being within the aforementioned phase-out range, your eligibility is adjusted accordingly. Based on your income and the phaseout rules, you are eligible for a total annual refundable credit of $434. This means that when you file your year-end tax return, you can claim this credit, which will contribute to reducing your tax liability or increasing your refund. While this amount is less than the maximum credit, it still provides a valuable benefit to your financial situation.” (ChatGPT 3.5, OpenAI, https://chat.openai.com/).
Bing Chat: Bing produced a similarly cogent, considerate, and professional e-mail. A portion of that response follows: “Based on the information you provided, it appears that you are subject to a phaseout because your income is between $25,000 and $30,000. As a result, you are eligible for a total annual refundable credit of $434 on your year-end tax return, rather than the maximum possible credit of $1,083. I understand that this may be disappointing news, but please know that this credit is still a valuable benefit that can help reduce your tax liability. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.” (Bing Chat, Microsoft, https://www.bing.com/search/).
Google Bard: Bard’s response was very similar to that provided by the other two LLMs, but it provided incorrect information about the age requirement for a qualifying child in California. A portion of its response follows: “I’m writing to you today to discuss the California Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC) that you may be eligible for. The YCTC provides a refundable credit of up to $1,083 per eligible tax return for families with a qualifying child under the age of 6. [sic] I understand that your income is between $25,000 and $30,000, which means that you are subject to the YCTC phaseout. This means that your credit will be reduced as your income increases. In your case, your credit will be reduced to a total annual refundable credit of $434. I know that this may be disappointing, but I want to assure you that you are still eligible for a significant credit. The YCTC can help to offset the cost of raising a young child, and it can also help to make your tax return more affordable.” (Bard, Google, https://bard.google.com/).
The inaccuracy in Bard’s response (the age limit for a “qualifying child” according to the California YCTC in 2021 was 19 if not a full-time student and 24 if a full-time student) emphasizes the need for Principles 2 and 6. It is critical that CPAs verify the accuracy of each subtask completed by an LLM and apply their own domain expertise. This weakness aside, each of the LLMs produced an effective first draft of the client email in a matter of seconds, illustrating significant efficiency.


Take a Careful Approach
Since beginning our research on ChatGPT, the authors have been asked to provide a summary of the usefulness and impact of LLMs in the domain of accounting. Some academics and professionals that we spoke with wonder if LLMs like ChatGPT are a panacea—after all, there have been widespread reports about its remarkable capabilities—while others dismiss LLMs as unreliable, unhelpful, and overblown. The authors believe that neither extreme perspective is accurate; rather, we believe that CPAs who appropriately incorporate LLMs into their work can improve both their efficiency and effectiveness. Appropriately incorporating LLMs into accounting requires a careful, strategic approach. Therefore, CPAs are encouraged to utilize the principles provided in this article to appropriately leverage LLMs in their work.

            As anxiety about artificial intelligence tools putting workers out of jobs reaches a global fever pitch, new research suggests that the economy isn’t ready for machines to put most humans out of work.
    

            The fresh research finds that the impact of AI on the labor market will likely have a much slower adoption than some had previously feared as the AI revolution continues to dominate headlines. This carries hopeful implications for policymakers currently looking at ways to offset the worst of the labor market impacts linked to the recent rise of AI.
    

            In a study published Monday, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab sought to quantify the question of not just will AI automate human jobs, but when this could happen. Researchers ended up finding that a vast majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI are not economically beneficial for employers to automate at this time.

            One key finding, for example, is that only about 23% of the wages paid to humans right now for jobs that could potentially be done by AI tools would be cost-effective for employers to replace with machines right now.
    

            While this could change over time, the overall findings suggest that job disruption from AI will likely unfurl at a gradual pace.
    

            “In many cases, humans are the more cost-effective way, and a more economically attractive way, to do work right now,” Neil Thompson, one of the study’s authors and the director of the future tech research project at MIT’s Computer Science and AI Lab, told CNN in an interview.

            “What we’re seeing is that while there is a lot of potential for AI to replace tasks, it’s not going to happen immediately,” Thompson added, saying that amid all the headlines about robots taking jobs, “It’s really important to think about the economics of actually implementing these systems.”
    

            In the study, Thompson and his team analyzed the majority of jobs that have been previously identified as “exposed” to AI, or at risk of being lost to AI, especially in the realm of computer vision. The researchers then looked at the wages paid to workers currently doing these jobs, and calculated how much it might cost to bring on an automated tool instead.
    

            A retail worker, for example, might currently be responsible for visually checking inventory or ensuring that the prices listed throughout a store on specific merchandise is accurate. A machine trained in computer vision could technically do this job, Thompson notes, but at this stage it would still make the most economic sense for an employer to pay a human worker to do it.
    

            “There’s a reason that AI has not been everywhere immediately,” Thompson said. “There’s an economics behind that.”

            “And I think this actually should be very reminiscent of things that we’ve seen with other technologies,” he added.
    

            Like previous high-profile technological disruptions to the labor market, such as the rise of manufacturing economies replacing agricultural economies, the AI disruption to jobs will likely be more gradual than it is abrupt. This could mean that policymakers, employers and even workers can start best preparing and adapting for these coming changes now.
    

            Just last week, the International Monetary Fund warned that almost 40% of jobs globally could be affected by the rise of AI and that this trend will likely deepen existing inequality.
    

            In a blog post last week warning of their latest projections, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to work on establishing social safety nets or retraining programs to counter the impacts of AI’s disruption.
    

            The new research from Thompson and his team at MIT can give these policymakers a better understanding of the timeline they should be thinking about as they look for solutions to ameliorate the worst of AI’s impacts to the labor market.
    

            “[The study] gives us this ability to start being a little more quantitative of how rapidly we expect worker displacement to happen,” Thompson said. “And that will allow people to start building plans that are much more concrete in terms of the retraining that needs to be done.”

Similar to these global counterparts, the Indian government recognizes AI&rsquo;s potential to have a sweeping impact on society, including negative impacts such as bias and privacy violations. In the last several years, India has introduced initiatives and guidelines for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, but there are currently no specific laws regulating AI in India. </p>
<p><strong>Defining Principles and Frameworks</strong></p>
<p>The Indian government tasked the NITI Aayog, its apex public policy think tank, with establishing guidelines and policies for the development and use of AI. In 2018, the NITI Aayog released the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://indiaai.gov.in/research-reports/national-strategy-for-artificial-intelligence/"" target=""_blank"">National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence #AIForAll</a> strategy, which featured AI research and development guidelines focused on healthcare, agriculture, education, &ldquo;smart&rdquo; cities and infrastructure, and smart mobility and transformation. </p>
<p>In February 2021, the NITI Aayog released <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://indiaai.gov.in/research-reports/responsible-ai-part-1-principles-for-responsible-ai"" target=""_blank"">Part 1 - Principles for Responsible AI</a>, an approach paper that explores the various ethical considerations of deploying AI solutions in India, divided into system considerations and societal considerations. While the system considerations mostly deal with the overall principles behind decision-making, rightful inclusion of beneficiaries, and accountability of AI decisions, societal considerations focus on the impact of automation on job creation and employment. In August 2021, the NITI Aayog released <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://indiaai.gov.in/research-reports/responsible-ai-part-2-operationalizing-principles-for-responsible-ai"" target=""_blank"">Part 2 - Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI</a>, which focuses on operationalizing principles for responsible AI. The report breaks down the actions that need to be taken by both the government and the private sector, in partnership with research institutes, to cover regulatory and policy interventions, capacity building, incentivizing ethics by design, and creating frameworks for compliance with relevant AI standards. </p>
<p>The government of India also recently enacted a new privacy law, the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2023/08/india-enacts-new-privacy-law-the-digital-personal-data-protection-act"" target=""_blank"">Digital Personal Data Protection Act</a> in 2023, which it can leverage to address some of the privacy concerns concerning AI platforms. </p>
<p><strong>Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence and International Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, India is a member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI). The 2023 GPAI Summit was recently held in New Delhi, where GPAI experts presented their work on responsible AI, data governance, and the future of work, innovation, and commercialization. The <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""http://www.gpai.ai"" target=""_blank"">GPAI website</a> provides that &ldquo;as a vital branch of the initiative, GPAI&rsquo;s Experts produce deliverables that can be integrated into Members&rsquo; national strategies to ensure the inclusive and sustainable development of AI. Under the 2023 themes of climate change, global health and societal resilience, Experts worked to ensure that AI is used responsibly to address current challenges around the world. GPAI&rsquo;s Members, on the other hand, adopted the 2023 Ministerial Declaration, reaffirming their commitment to the trustworthy stewardship of AI in line with the OECD AI Principles, as well as their dedication to implementing those principles through the development of regulations, policies, standards and other initiatives. In doing so, they highlighted efforts to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and advance AI that is responsible, sustainable, and inclusive for all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Other Indian agencies are also working on AI policies for the country, including the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which has created committees on AI that have submitted <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/artificial-intelligence-committees-reports"" target=""_blank"">reports on the development, safety, and ethical issues related to AI</a>. The Bureau of Indian Standards, which is the national standards body of India, has also established a committee on AI that is proposing <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.services.bis.gov.in/php/BIS_2.0/dgdashboard/Published_Standards_new/standards?commttid=Mzg2&amp;commttname=TElURCAzMA%3D%3D&amp;aspect=&amp;doe=&amp;from=2022-07-21&amp;to=2023-07-21"" target=""_blank"">draft Indian standards for AI</a>. </p>
<p>While the government of India has taken steps to regulate AI, its approach has mainly been one of pro-innovation with the development of policies and guidelines that acknowledge the ethical concerns and risks around the use of AI that may require the adoption of best practices. Given India&rsquo;s advantage of having a robust software development industry, this approach makes sense until the government formally enacts AI regulations. </p>
<p><strong>International Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>The AI landscape in India is continuously evolving. Uncertainty, however, has not stopped both local and international interest and growth in this space. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. announced a partnership with an India-based AI company, 114ai, to develop advanced technology for complex military systems. In September 2023, the US-based chip firm NVIDIA Corporation announced partnerships with Indian conglomerates Reliance Industries Ltd. and Tata group to develop cloud infrastructure and language models, wherein NVIDIA will provide the computing power required for building a cloud AI infrastructure platform.</p>
<p>An entity looking to enter the AI space in India should carefully consider the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/01/india-emerging-as-a-manufacturing-powerhouse#:~:text=India%20is%20the%20world's%20fifth,companies%20on%20a%20global%20scale.#:~:text=India%20is%20the%20world's%20fifth,companies%20on%20a%20global%20scale."" target=""_blank"">best legal route</a> for such entry, whether through a joint venture, a strategic alliance, or a wholly owned subsidiary. Each route can be leveraged, and structures can be put in place depending on the level of investment and control required by the investing foreign entity. This is particularly important in a dynamic space like AI, where regulation is continuously evolving. Issues such as liability for harm caused, rights to intellectual property for AI systems, and privacy and data protection have not been fully fleshed out in regulations. Therefore, entities looking to enter this space should carefully consider the best legal and contractual protections. </p>

How will artificial intelligence impact the workplace? 











How will artificial intelligence impact the workplace?
16:42

Technology companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and some workers are already paying the price.SAP is the latest big tech player to cut jobs as it pours money into AI, with the German software giant announcing this week that it is investing more than $2 billion to integrate artificial intelligence into its business as part of what it called ""transformation program."" At the same time, the company said Tuesday it plans to restructure 8,000 roles. Some of the workers will be laid off, while others will be re-trained to work with AI. The company said it expects to employ roughly the same number of workers at year's end as it does now.  






SAP is not an outlier. In the little more than a year since generative AI tools like ChatGPT, based on so-called large language model technology, have been available to the public, a number of large tech companies have announced plans to plunge into AI — job cuts often follow. ""I would counsel folks to watch what the firms do, and if they are saying the presence of large language models is allowing them to lay people off, that has to be taken into account,"" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies the interplay between technology and people. ""There is no doubt forthcoming work is going to show that coding and many engineering type occupations have very high exposure levels [to AI]. So we should take them at face value on this.""

Last week, Alphabet-owned Google said it laid off hundreds of workers from its ad sales team as it further invests in AI. Although Google did not directly attribute the layoffs to AI, in a memo to employees obtained by Business Insider Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, referred to the ""profound moment we're in with AI"" in announcing the cuts. Microsoft is also doubling down on AI, investing billions in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it slashes jobs. And language learning platform Duolingo acknowledged a 10% reduction in its contractor workforce at the end of 2023, but denied that all of the cuts were related to increased AI usage.""In some cases, this was because the contractor's project concluded, and in some cases this was because the contractor's work was no longer needed due to changes in how we generate and share content between our 100+ language courses,"" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. Duolingo added that it does sometimes use AI to generate sentences and translations and that AI can help contractors work faster. 


Is AI already replacing people?To be sure, some of the companies are redirecting their investments into AI while cutting spending in other areas of their business, leading to layoffs. Columbia University business professor Oded Netzer cautioned against linking rising corporate investment in AI to worker layoffs. ""We know 2023 was the year of generative AI and companies invested in it heavily,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""That means there are some jobs they've decided to invest less in, and they may be laying off workers. But it also means the jobs they're hiring for are related to AI. That's not to say AI replaces jobs."" In Netzer's view, companies are simply doing what they typically do — hiring more workers that specialize in fast-growing parts of the business, while laying off those whose skills may be less useful or contribute less to revenue growth. For example, he said, as Microsoft invests in AI it might decide to scale back its production of computer hardware, like keyboards. Still, recent tech layoffs may be a troubling sign for employees who were told that AI would eliminate some of the rote work associated with their jobs, freeing them up to engage in more creative or productive work. Because technology is diffused across all types of companies in different sectors, big tech corporations can serve as a bellwether for the rest of the economy. ""All sort of firms use digital technologies, so I think this is a sobering signal. It does appear these impacts are occurring quite rapidly,"" Muro of Brookings said.Eliminating workers as they invest in AI is ""low hanging fruit"" for companies, he added. Yet a lot remains to be seen about how the AI revolution plays out in the workplace. ""A lot of training and re-skilling may be a common outcome. There may be some layoffs with the enhancement of other jobs,"" he said. 






AI could replace 30% of work hours by 2030, new research finds
06:19

Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch that AI tools are not yet sophisticated enough to replace workers entirely. They may be able to perform certain job functions, but still require human input and supervision. The layoffs are also likely tied to companies consolidating their workforces after going on hiring sprees during the pandemic, he added.


""They are rebalancing after the huge hiring burst we saw couple years back during the pandemic when people were at home, consuming more tech products than they normally would have,"" Stahle said. ""Now they are back out flying and staying at hotels, and the shift in consumer demand is necessitating an adjustment at these tech companies."" If AI were really the culprit, layoffs would be far more widespread across diverse industries, according to Stahle. ""And we haven't seen that happen yet,"" he said. Also contributing to tech company layoffs are high interest rates. ""Tech companies are always very sensitive to high interest rates and layoff people during high interest rate environment,"" said Columbia University Business school professor Tania Babina.  ""When money is cheap, tech firms pile on hiring; when money is expensive, they tighten the belt. So far, there is no systematic empirical evidence that firms use AI to replace labor,"" she said.

Generative AI, like ChatGPT, could inject as much as $1 trillion into the US economy over the next decade.That's according to a study on the economic impacts of generative AI published on January 10 by tech solutions corporation Cognizant, in collaboration with Oxford Economics.The study also found that over half of all jobs driving the US economy will be significantly impacted by AI, with a small percentage of workers losing their jobs and struggling to find new employment.

The study used a model to simulate three levels of AI business adoption — low, middle, and high — and how those rates could impact jobs and careers.

Companies will quickly adopt AI technology, impacting jobsThe model first examined how quickly businesses will adopt AI.The authors described the 2023 level of AI usage as the ""experimental phase,"" with 13% of companies already using the technology. This came just months after OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022.However, that use is expected to grow quickly to 31% in the next four to eight years, depending on the level of aggression used in the model, and nearly 50% in 10 years.Adoption rates are projected to slow after 10 years but will continue to grow for another 20 years as they approach 100% adoption under all three models.

The study's model also looked at 18,000 tasks that the researchers identified as drivers of the US economy, such as content generation, market analysis, image generation, reports, and emails. Then, they looked at the impact of generative AI on the about 1,000 jobs that use these tasks, like management, sales, design, media, and legal positions.The model looked at the percentage of tasks that AI could automate for each job.90% of jobs will have at least 5% of their high-value tasks automated by AI.52% of jobs will have at least 25% of their high-value tasks affected by AI. About 8% of jobs were at this level in 2023.The model showed that AI could lead to 9% of the US workforce losing their job in the next 10 years. What's more, about one out of every nine displaced workers — about 1% of the total US workforce — will struggle to find new work after being pushed out because the skills needed for their current jobs will not translate to an AI-dominated workforce.

Other studies have also projected large disruptions to the workforce, both in the US and worldwide.A Goldman Sachs report in March estimated that over 300 million jobs worldwide could be disrupted by AI. A report from McKinsey estimated at least 12 million Americans would be forced to find a new job by 2030.AI will cause an economic boomThe surge in AI adoption by companies signifies a huge impact on the US economy, the study found.US productivity is projected to grow by at least 1.7% and as much as 3.5% over the next decade due to AI. This growth translates to an increase in the US GDP by $477 billion to $1 trillion annually over the next decade.

""The research findings showcase just how quickly this technology might disrupt the trajectory of the US economy, offering invaluable insights for leaders to harness its potential and adapt swiftly,"" Cooper wrote when announcing the study.AI's disruption will be different than other advancesThe researchers noted that AI will impact the workforce differently than previous technological advancements.Instead of replacing manual labor jobs and ""process-centric knowledge work,"" like data entry, AI is expected to have a bigger effect on knowledge work, such as credit analysis, computer programming, web development, database administration, and graphic design.

According to the study, some of these careers have already seen 50% of their most important tasks replaced by AI, which could grow to 80% in 10 years.This was echoed in a June report by McKinsey that found high earners could experience the biggest impact of generative AI automation.

The ripple effect even extends to CEOs. The Cognizant and Oxford Economics study found that at least 25% of a CEO's tasks could be automated by AI, helping with things like reviewing reports, analyzing operations, conducting competitive assessments, and making strategic decisions.The study's authors noted that this paradigm shift should not be considered all doom and gloom for workers. Rather, they noted that this is an opportunity for rethinking skills and training, marking a new phase of employee development and business strategy.

This is supported by a recent McKinsey study showing that AI is more likely to enhance jobs than replace them.""As this technology becomes commonplace in the workforce, new employee skills will be in demand to support areas including business strategy and AI management,"" the Cognizant and Oxford Economics authors wrote. ""Reskilling programs, once seen as a tactical add-on to an employee's career path, will become an essential part of the workday, with time allocated for training and education.""

There are still narrow limits to the use of the technology. But it has the potential to change entire pricing structures.,,,,"How artificial intelligence is changing work in law firms

Translating documents overnight, studying files for hours on end, time-consuming research into contracts – many lawyers have already had to deal with unpleasantly tedious tasks in the course of their career. At least some of these tasks can be increasingly automated. Legal tech applications are not a new topic for lawyers, but since the OpenAI bot ChatGPT began its triumphal march just over a year ago, applications with artificial intelligence (AI) have received a further boost.


""The offerings are surprisingly powerful when it comes to summarising legal texts and documents and explaining them in a structured way,"" says Tom Braegelmann. The lawyer from the law firm Annerton has been involved with the use of technology in law firms for many years and has himself worked for a legal tech company for a time. A hundred-page decision by the Federal Network Agency, for example, can be summarised by ChatGPT in a very short time – with one major caveat: ""You have to check all the results,"" emphasises Braegelmann. ""However, familiarising yourself with the facts of a case is quicker if you already have a summary.""


The business law firm Allen & Overy uses several AI tools, including Harvey, which has been specifically trained for the legal context. Harvey, like the latest version of ChatGPT, is based on OpenAI's GPT-4. ""You can ask Harvey legal questions such as 'What is the legal nature of banking secrecy in German law?' and have it provide sources to verify the result, similar to the traditional process without the use of AI,"" explains Associate Niklas Germayer. Feeding the AI with existing documents is also becoming more effective. In this process, search results are not created based on the AI model in connection with the internet but primarily based on the information in the document itself. The tool is significantly more powerful in using GPT-4 compared to its predecessors.

Broader application

However, Germayer also believes that careful monitoring is essential. For Alexander Behrens, Partner at Allen & Overy, the rapid developments in AI are a double-edged sword: ""On the one hand, the applications are a good help. But of course, some lawyers are worried that the technology will one day completely replace legal work."" But that is a long way off. The lawyers are convinced that even powerful AI models cannot replace legal work at the present time. Rather, it is about supporting and automating highly standardised activities.


Eric Wagner, Partner at Gleiss Lutz, sees the broader range of applications as the greatest advance of the latest generation of AI tools. ""Until now, many legal tech offerings have been heavily focussed on individual areas of application such as text recognition or data analysis,"" he says. The new generation can fulfil different tasks without the lawyer having to switch between different applications. ""This increases acceptance within the team and leads to more routine handling – and therefore better results,"" says Wagner.


In the future, technology could lead to law firms increasingly switching to fixed prices.
Tom Braegelmann, Annerton

Marc Geiger heads the Legal Operations & Business Technologies department at the law firm. Around 80 employees work there, providing training on AI and legal tech, for example, but also developing their own digital solutions and keeping an eye on cyber security. For Geiger, the latest generation of applications with generative AI is a kind of universal platform: ""Lawyers use them like an assistance system. The interest and potential applications are huge.""


AI could change not only the way lawyers work but also the way lawyers are paid. Until now, the hourly rate has been the benchmark for payment for legal services. However, AI is particularly good at preparing lengthy routine tasks, such as translations. This reduces the billable hours. ""In the future, the technology could lead to law firms increasingly switching to fixed prices,"" expects Tom Braegelmann.

Clients ask for AI tools

AI tools have not yet reached the point where it is possible to realise significant efficiency gains, says Eric Wagner from Gleiss Lutz. However, the better the systems become, the greater the pressure for change in the market. On the one hand, law firms have high investment costs to acquire the technologies. But how much is a client prepared to pay if at least some of the pleadings have been created by an algorithm? ""There is currently an imbalance,"" admits Wagner.


However, he believes that some mandates could probably no longer be won without investing in new technologies: ""Many clients specifically ask in pitches which legal tech and AI tools the law firm uses."" Wagner would not rule out that the price structure will shift more towards fixed prices that include the use of AI tools for certain use cases. ""We may even get to the point where clients accept a certain error rate in the interest of increased efficiency.""


AI does not know law. It is good at interpreting data.
Marc Geiger, Gleiss Lutz

It will not work without lawyers in the future – however, the areas where they can provide added value are shifting. For instance, linguistic clarity may become less important as a differentiation criterion. This is because an AI can handle the linguistically appealing presentation of facts. ""The performance will lie in using a suitable AI tool, for example, for repetitive tasks to work more efficiently and create space in other areas,"" expects Wagner. AI ultimately remains to be a technology. ""AI can't do law. It can interpret data well,"" emphasizes his colleague Marc Geiger.

It's challenging without data

However, if an issue cannot be broken down into data, AI quickly reaches its limits: ""Some issues have to be assessed without a database. This then requires empirical knowledge,"" says Braegelmann. ""Lawyers are experienced in dealing with authorities, they know the local labour, insolvency and other courts, and they can mediate in disputes between shareholders. Clients will continue to be willing to pay for this added value,"" the lawyer is certain.


Despite all the interest in the new possibilities – lawyers can't just try it out like private users do with ChatGPT. Data protection and legal professional privilege place strict limits on the use of AI tools. At Allen & Overy, AI tools are programmed in such a way that they do not store any data; the principle is called ""zero data retention"". ""The tool does not learn from the data,"" explains Partner Behrens.


Today's AI models are no longer primarily concerned with large volumes of data, explains Marc Geiger from Gleiss Lutz. This is due to the way they work: Early approaches in machine learning used numerical tables to represent words. The tools could not map relationships between words – for example, they did not recognise when two words had a similar meaning. In large language models (LLM), which are used today, such relationships are represented by word embeddings using vectors. Put simply, words that have similar meanings are closer together in the vector space than others. ""With machine learning, the principle was: the more data, the better the algorithm,"" says Geiger. ""With LLM tools, on the other hand, you can also improve the quality of the results by weighting certain vectors differently. The amount of data is less decisive."" Many projects are currently underway at large law firms, in particular, to test use cases for artificial intelligence. Hogan Lovells, for example, has just developed the chatbot ""Eltemate Craig"" with its legal tech subsidiary Eltemate. It should be able to draft legal texts and summarise large amounts of information in a structured manner. KPMG Law is also working with its own AI-supported chatbot.

Between fax machines and legal tech tools

However, the world of justice is not regarded as a digital pioneer; hardly any other sector still uses the fax machine so intensively. In order to establish AI on a broad scale, lawyers need to utilise the technology. ""There have been a few cases in recent years where law firms have euphorically invested in legal tech tools that were then left untouched by employees,"" reports Braegelmann, who also offers training courses on the use of AI for lawyers. This reluctance was often due to uncertainty or fear of embracing something new. However, nobody needs to worry about being exposed by artificial intelligence: ""The algorithm can do no more than the lawyer. But it can help lawyers save time.""


At Allen & Overy, 800 to 900 of the 3,000 lawyers currently use an AI application every day. ""That's a pretty good rate,"" says Behrens. A simple trick has driven the usage figures up significantly: ""The first AI tools ran in a separate browser and received far less attention,"" recalls Behrens. In the meantime, the law firm has developed its own AI application called ""Contract Matrix"" and integrated it directly into Word.


It's not about bringing the user to the technology. It is more promising if the technology comes to the user.
Alexander Behrens, Allen & Overy

Access to the contract negotiation tool, which the law firm also provides to clients, has significantly increased since then, and the tool can be more efficiently utilized in transactions. For Behrens, this is an important realization: ""It's not about bringing the user to the technology. It is more promising when the technology comes to the user.""

With the advent of artificial intelligence technologies such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, which can perform a variety of tasks with a single text prompt, these fears have become even more profound. What's more worrying is that even the creators of these technologies, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman, have previously suggested that the job market is unlikely to stay the same as generative AI technology improves.Golman Sachs had previously estimated that AI could lead to the automation of around 25% of the global workforce in the coming years, while a McKinsey analysis found that nearly 50% of all work will be done by AI by 2025, TechCrunch reported. In addition, an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania, NYU and Princeton previously found that ChatGPT alone could impact nearly 80% of the workforce.Now, a new analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has analyzed not only if a job can be replaced by AI but also if it is economically feasible to automate such tasks. The 45-page study found that only 1.6% of worker wages in the US economy are capable of automation and only 23% of those tasks (0.4% of the total tasks) are feasible enough to automate.&nbsp;Talking about the potential of new age AI technology, the study noted, ""“Machines will steal our jobs” is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, GPT-4) that show considerable skill in tasks where previously only human beings showed proficiency""“Computer vision, as it stands today, only has an economic advantage in 23% of vision tasks at the firm-level and barriers to AI-as-a-service deployments exist, there will most likely need to be a sharp reduction in cost for computer vision to replace human labor… Even with a 50% annual cost decrease, it will take until 2026 before half of the vision tasks have a machine economic advantage and by 2042 there will still exist tasks that are exposed to computer vision, but where human labor has the advantage.” the study stated.On the possibility of AI job loss, the study noted, “Our findings suggest that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual – and therefore there is room for policy and retraining to mitigate unemployment impacts.”&nbsp;","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools has nearly half of job seekers utilizing such tools to help improve their resumes according to a new survey from Canva. Canva partnered with Sago to survey 5,000 hiring managers and 5,000 job seekers from the U.S., United Kingdom, India, Germany, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil to assess the latest trends influencing the job searching and hiring process. The survey found that about 45% of job seekers have used generative AI to build, update or improve their resumes. That figure was highest in India (74%) and Brazil (50%) while it was lowest in France (33%) and Spain (34%).The survey also showed that hiring managers are receptive to the use of AI by candidates looking to make their resumes more creative. It found that 90% of hiring manager respondents said it’s acceptable to use generative AI in application materials, with 46% saying it should be used minimally to augment an applicant’s ideas and content, and 44% saying it can be used to create any content. SHOULD BUSINESSES DISCLOSE THEIR USE OF AI? MOST AMERICANS SAY YES      Nearly half of job seekers surveyed by Canva and Sago said that they used AI to help put their resume and job applications together.

((Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) / Getty Images)A 67% majority of hiring managers responded that they can tell if an applicant has used generative AI all or most of the time, and Schultz noted that applicants should take steps to verify the output of AI tools to ensure there aren’t any surprises when it comes time for an interview.""I think you should always proof what you’re getting back from whatever generative AI tool that you’re using and ensure that it reflects your tone of voice, your kind of experience, and that when it comes to an interview that you’re ready to speak to that,"" Schultz said. The survey also found that 71% of recruiters believe that text-only resumes to become obsolete in the next five years, and 57% of hiring managers prefer resumes with visual elements as opposed to all-text resumes. Schultz noted that Canva’s AI-powered Magic Write tool was used 5 million times in resume template designs last year, so job seekers are looking for an edge to help their application stand out.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE""On average, a recruiter is spending probably about 7.4 seconds visually looking at a resume before deciding whether that’s a resume that they want to spend more time on or move forward with,"" Schultz said. ""So if you’re able to grab the attention of a recruiter in those 7 to 8 seconds through using logos or even doing some research on the company’s corporate colors that they use and then using those colors in your template."" ""You can even get a sense from looking at company websites around the font style they use, the tone of voice – there’s so much information out there that candidates just by spending 5 or 10 minutes doing some quick research and then personalizing the cover letter or their resume to either reflect the company or the industry, that can go such a long way,"" she added.

PARIS:
      Recent advances in artificial intelligence look set to change or render obsolete millions of jobs. While this prospect is raising fears among workers, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe that AI is unlikely to put too many humans out of work in the immediate future.
This is largely because artificial intelligence tools are too costly for companies to deploy on a large scale. It would not be in their financial interest to dispense with certain roles that are deemed suitable for automation.
MIT researchers came to this conclusion after examining the cost-effectiveness of computer vision software – computer programs that extract meaningful information from images, videos and other visual inputs.
The academics found that employees who perform similar tasks are a far better investment for the companies that employ them than the AI tools that are designed to replace them.AdChoicesADVERTISING
We find that only 23% of the wages being paid to humans for doing vision tasks would be economically attractive to automate with AI. Humans are still the better economic choice for doing these parts of jobs, one of the study’s co-authors, Neil Thompson, told TechCrunch.
Since the very concept of computer vision may seem rather abstract to the average person, the academics use the example of a baker to illustrate their point.
A baker spends around 6% of their time checking the quality of food, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. This aspect of the job could, in theory, easily be automated by AI.
In the case of a bakery employing five people, each with an annual salary of $48,000, automating quality control could save US$14,000 a year.
But, deploying an AI tool to perform this task would cost US$165,000. On top of that, the bakery’s owners would have to pay US$122,840 a year to maintain the computer system. Which just goes to show that this is not a financially astute decision.AdChoicesADVERTISING
While this study has methodological limitations, it does provide some answers as to the potential impact of artificial intelligence on employment.
Several reports, including one by the consulting firm McKinsey, estimate that this technology will wipe out many jobs. This has given rise to a feeling of unease – and even anxiety – among some workers, who fear their skills will be made redundant.
For the time being, however, it seems that unemployment is unlikely to rise significantly as a result of AI, even if there is no doubt that the technology will rapidly spread through companies in all kinds of sectors.Stay current - Follow FMT on WhatsApp, Google news and TelegramWhatsAppGoogle NewsTelegram",https://schema.org,WebPage,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/90867a75-lifestyle-ai-emel-pic-260124.jpg', 'url': 'https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/90867a75-lifestyle-ai-emel-pic-260124.jpg', 'height': 500, 'width': 800, 'representativeOfPage': True, 'caption': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon', 'contentUrl': 'https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/90867a75-lifestyle-ai-emel-pic-260124.jpg', 'creditText': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon', 'license': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/privacy-policy/', 'acquireLicensePage': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/privacy-policy/', 'creator': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Free Malaysia Today', 'url': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/'}, 'copyrightNotice': '© Free Malaysia Today, 2024'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'ETX Daily Up', 'url': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/author/etxstudio/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/author/etxstudio/', 'affiliation': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Free Malaysia Today', 'url': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/'}}]","{'@context': 'https://www.schema.org', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'additionalType': 'Organization', 'name': 'Free Malaysia Today', 'legalName': 'FMT Media Sdn Bhd', 'slogan': 'Free and Independent Malaysian news in English & Malay', 'url': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/', 'foundingDate': '2009-11-01', 'contactPoint': {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'customer support', 'telephone': '+60378872888'}, 'email': 'mailto:admin@freemalaysiatoday.com', 'knowsLanguage': ['Malay', 'English'], 'aggregateRating': {'@type': 'AggregateRating', 'ratingValue': 4.3, 'ratingCount': 18}, 'numberOfEmployees': {'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'minValue': 100, 'maxValue': 500}, 'isAccessibleForFree': True, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064467980422', 'https://www.instagram.com/freemalaysiatoday', 'https://x.com/fmtoday', 'https://t.me/FreeMalaysiaToday', 'https://www.youtube.com/@FreeMalaysiaToday', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/fmt-news/', 'https://www.tiktok.com/@freemalaysiatoday', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Malaysia_Today', 'https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Malaysia_Today'], 'logo': {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/icon-512x512.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/icon-512x512.png', 'width': 512, 'height': 512, 'creditText': 'Free Malaysia Today', 'license': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/privacy-policy/', 'acquireLicensePage': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/privacy-policy/', 'creator': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Free Malaysia Today', 'url': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/'}, 'copyrightNotice': '© Free Malaysia Today, 2024'}, 'description': 'Explore 24/7 news on politics, economy, and more with Free Malaysia Today.

While this prospect is raising fears among workers, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe that AI is unlikely to put too many humans out of work in the immediate future.This is largely because artificial intelligence tools are too costly for companies to deploy on a large scale. It would not be in their financial interest to dispense with certain roles that are deemed suitable for automation.MIT researchers came to this conclusion after examining the cost-effectiveness of computer vision software &#8211; computer programs that extract meaningful information from images, videos and other visual inputs.The academics found that employees who perform similar tasks are a far better investment for the companies that employ them than the AI tools that are designed to replace them.&#8220;We find that only 23% of the wages being paid to humans for doing vision tasks would be economically attractive to automate with AI. Humans are still the better economic choice for doing these parts of jobs,&#8221; one of the study&#8217;s co-authors, Neil Thompson, told TechCrunch.Since the very concept of computer vision may seem rather abstract to the average person, the academics use the example of a baker to illustrate their point.A baker spends around 6% of their time checking the quality of food, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. This aspect of the job could, in theory, easily be automated by AI.In the case of a bakery employing five people, each with an annual salary of $48,000, automating quality control could save US$14,000 a year.But, deploying an AI tool to perform this task would cost US$165,000. On top of that, the bakery&#8217;s owners would have to pay US$122,840 a year to maintain the computer system. Which just goes to show that this is not a financially astute decision.While this study has methodological limitations, it does provide some answers as to the potential impact of artificial intelligence on employment.Several reports, including one by the consulting firm McKinsey, estimate that this technology will wipe out many jobs. This has given rise to a feeling of unease &#8211; and even anxiety &#8211; among some workers, who fear their skills will be made redundant.For the time being, however, it seems that unemployment is unlikely to rise significantly as a result of AI, even if there is no doubt that the technology will rapidly spread through companies in all kinds of sectors.","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.headline', '.news-content']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'name': 'PARIS'}",,,,Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon - Artificial intelligence tools are too costly for many companies to deploy on a large scale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PT3M,,"[{'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'name': 'Total Views', 'interactionType': 'https://schema.org/ViewAction', 'userInteractionCount': 246, 'description': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon has been viewed 246 times.'}, {'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'name': 'Total Shares', 'interactionType': 'https://schema.org/ShareAction', 'userInteractionCount': 0, 'description': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon has been shared undefined times on social media.'}, {'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'name': 'Facebook Shares', 'interactionType': 'https://schema.org/ShareAction', 'userInteractionCount': 0, 'interactionService': {'@type': 'WebSite', 'name': 'Facebook', 'url': 'https://facebook.com/freemalaysiatoday'}, 'description': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon has been shared undefined times on Facebook.'}, {'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'name': 'Twitter Shares', 'interactionType': 'https://schema.org/ShareAction', 'userInteractionCount': 0, 'interactionService': {'@type': 'WebSite', 'name': 'Twitter', 'url': 'https://x.com/fmtoday'}, 'description': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon has been shared undefined times on X (Formerly Twitter).'}, {'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'name': 'WhatsApp Shares', 'interactionType': 'https://schema.org/ShareAction', 'userInteractionCount': 0, 'interactionService': {'@type': 'WebSite', 'name': 'WhatsApp', 'url': 'https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va78sJa96H4VaQu6580F'}, 'description': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon has been shared undefined times on WhatsApp.'}, {'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'name': 'Email Shares', 'interactionType': 'https://schema.org/ShareAction', 'userInteractionCount': 0, 'description': 'Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon has been shared undefined times via Email.'}]",,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'name': 'Breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'CATEGORY', 'item': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'LEISURE', 'item': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'name': '2024', 'item': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2024/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 5, 'name': '01', 'item': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2024/01/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 6, 'name': '26', 'item': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2024/01/26/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 7, 'name': 'WHY AI IS UNLIKELY TO STEAL YOUR JOB ANYTIME SOON', 'item': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2024/01/26/why-ai-is-unlikely-to-steal-your-job-anytime-soon/'}]}",Why AI is unlikely to steal your job anytime soon - Artificial intelligence tools are too costly for many companies to deploy on a large scale.,"{'@type': 'Country', 'name': 'Malaysia'}",News_Website

They discovered that AI is too costly to replace jobs, and only 23% of workers, assessed in terms of dollar salaries, could be efficiently replaced. In other circumstances, people performed the task more efficiently because AI-assisted visual identification is costly to install and maintain..The adoption of AI across businesses surged last year after OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative tools demonstrated the technology's capabilities. Tech companies ranging from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. in the United States to Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in China launched new AI services and increased development plans at a rate that some industry executives said was too rapid. Concerns regarding AI's influence on jobs have long persisted..&quot;'Machines will steal our employment' is a common concern stated during periods of fast technological progress. &quot;Such anxiety has resurfaced with the creation of large language models,&quot; the researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory said in the 45-page report titled Beyond AI Exposure. &quot;We find that only 23% of worker compensation 'exposed' to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.&quot;.Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows machines to extract meaningful information from digital photographs and other visual inputs. Its most common applications include object identification systems for self-driving cars and photo categorization on smartphones..Computer vision has the best cost-benefit ratio in categories such as retail, transportation, and warehousing, all of which are dominated by Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. According to MIT research, it is also practical in the healthcare environment. According to the authors, a more aggressive AI rollout, mainly through AI-as-a-service subscription options, might scale up and make additional applications more viable..The MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab supported the study, which employed online surveys to collect data on about 1,000 visually-assisted activities from 800 jobs. Only 3% of such jobs can be automated cost-effectively today, but the researchers predict that figure will climb to 40% by 2030 if data prices decrease and accuracy improves..The sophistication of ChatGPT and rivals such as Google's Bard has reignited concerns about AI taking employment, as the new chatbots demonstrate competency in activities that people were previously capable of completing. The International Monetary Fund stated this week that over 40% of global employment will be affected and that authorities must carefully balance AI's promise with the negative consequences..Many debates at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week centered on AI's potential to replace workers.

Singapore Post is working with Google Cloud to empower SingPost employees with easy-to-use AI-powered tools, and help them boost productivity, streamline repetitive tasks, and foster seamless collaboration with external partners and customers.
Noel Singgih, group CIO at SingPost, said their engagement with Google Cloud to develop an AI solution—through their joint AI Trailblazers initiative with the Singapore government—gave us the confidence to embark on the next step of this journey with them as our strategic cloud services provider. 
“Google Cloud’s industry leadership in responsible AI, sustainable technology innovation, and cybersecurity will be core tenets in establishing SingPost as a trusted and customer-centric logistics leader in the Asia-Pacific region,” said Singgih.
SingPost has migrated all IT workloads hosted in its on-premises data centers to Google Cloud and is in the process of harmonizing and consolidating its technology stack, establishing a robust and secure foundation to power accelerated AI-driven innovation. 
This strategic move has not only yielded substantial cost savings of 30% in IT operations, but also allows SingPost to take advantage of Google Cloud’s AI-optimized infrastructure, purpose-built to handle complex AI workloads, while ensuring cost-efficiency, scalability, and sustainability. 
To further safeguard its enterprise data and applications, SingPost is also deploying Google Cloud’s BeyondCorp Enterprise platform to enforce zero trust security principles like multi-factor authentication and device verification, ensuring that only authorised staff can access proprietary company information.
A successful participant in the AI Trailblazers initiative, SingPost has developed an AI solution prototype to streamline its eCommerce logistics operations. 
This solution eliminates the administrative burden of manually re-entering partner and supplier information from trade documents—including those with handwritten inputs—into its database. It also liberates employees from the drudgery of digging through document archives to find the information they need, enabling them to focus on making strategic decisions and delivering high-quality customer interactions.
SingPost’s AI solution transforms unstructured data from trade documents into a searchable repository, with a gen AI-powered chat interface that comprehends natural language queries and surfaces accurate and relevant information.
In collaboration with Google Cloud, SingPost will scale the use of its solution, with the goal of optimizing supply chain orchestration across its logistics network and facilitating faster deliveries. 
Additionally, SingPost is leveraging Vertex AI to explore solutions for several other use cases, including automating internal legal document reviews and providing more personalized interactions to enhance customer care.
SingPost is replacing previous legacy productivity tools with Duet AI in Google Workspace to help its employees write, visualize, organize, and connect more meaningfully. With Duet AI, SingPost’s sales teams can produce memos and presentation decks with greater velocity in response to requests for proposals (RFPs), while marketing and customer support teams can speed up marketing copy development and reduce average response times to customer inquiries.
Mark Micallef, Google Cloud managing director in Southeast Asia, said that by investing in AI development and collaborator platforms with built-in privacy, control, security, and compliance capabilities, SingPost is empowering every employee—regardless of their role or function—to identify and capitalise on new opportunities for work optimisation. 
“This serves as a strong example of how a large enterprise can move swiftly to extract diverse benefits from gen AI adoption,” said Micallef.

The company piloted a lot of strides in customer relationship management when it was founded, some 24 years back (along with SaaS and cloud) and did it so well, everybody knows Salesforce as “the CRM company” today. With AI, it wants to do the same thing, in fact, it wants to champion the cause and by extension, help its customers stay ahead of the curve. It’s all connected. The numbers seem to suggest, it’s winning. Senior company executives say compared to peers like Microsoft, Salesforce has accomplished a lot more in a much shorter span of time and so, the aim —now— is to be the “fastest to 50 billion [in revenue].” The company may have its roots in San Francisco, California, but its India story is starting to get a lot more interesting and while you may not have considered India as very tech-savvy in the past, in the present day and into the future, it is cruising. No wonder, Salesforce is looking at India as a big opportunity both in terms of talent and growth. Speaking exclusively to FE.com’s Saurabh Singh, Arun Kumar Parameswaran, Senior Vice President &amp; Managing Director, Salesforce India, takes us through the journey on the sidelines of the launch of the company’s latest State of Data and Analytics industry report. Excerpts. Salesforce in India – what is the story so far? Arun: In India, we&#039;ve quadrupled in size in the last four years from 2,500 to 10,000. We have centres of excellence in Hyderabad. We do a lot of cutting-edge engineering development work for our customers. We see a huge growth story in India. I think there&#039;s a generational opportunity. Honestly, in the last 30 years, I haven&#039;t seen a demand pipe that is this robust, and that cuts across all industries, all segments, and all customer sizes. I&#039;ve seen secular growth trends in the past, but they were specific to certain industries, like when you saw the whole wave around 4G happening, it was predominantly a telco wave. Then there were waves around financial services, but we’ve never seen anything that is so massive in terms of the breadth of demand, if you will. And I think that the country is also uniquely positioned with a lot of the macroeconomic environmental factors in our favour. It almost feels like there&#039;s the rest of the world and there&#039;s India, a public digital infrastructure stack that is second to none today. In fact, I think we&#039;re leading the world in terms of what we’ve done building that digital infrastructure to scale. And that&#039;s helping every company whether you&#039;re a 10-man organisation, or a 10,000-man organisation, aspire to be digital. Also ReadIndia is critical for our success, working hard on affordable foldables: Samsung Mobile head TM Roh   Salesforce in India – where do you go from here? Arun: We are the largest Salesforce entity outside the US. The beauty is that Salesforce is looking at India, not just from one dimension, but multiple dimensions. One dimension is the talent pool. The second dimension is the market itself. If you think about the different parts of the world, the macroeconomic picture is so dire when you look at it and then [when] you look at India, it feels like you&#039;re in two different universes altogether. India has a very strong macroeconomic foundation and hopefully it&#039;s our decade. From a company perspective, there&#039;s a very clear view that we should be front and centre [here]. If you [can] solve problems for India, that pretty much works everywhere in the world. That’s the other incentive for the company to continue to innovate for India, or Bharat, which is again turning out to be an interesting, almost secular trend by itself. That then becomes a complete pivot into the rest of the world, if you will. It’s always encouraging to get this kind of view from leaders like yourself. It&#039;s fantastic how far India has come and how well Salesforce is doing. Do you want to take us through the report now. We can’t help but point out, it’s coming at an interesting moment in time. Arun: You’re right. Our latest State of Data and Analytics report comes at a time where it couldn&#039;t be more relevant because at the end of the day, data powers everything from a machine learning and an AI perspective. And trusted data is probably the biggest challenge that every C-suite executive is grappling with. We&#039;ve surveyed over 10,000 folks in the line of analytics, IT, and business leaders from 18 countries. We had about 300 odd people from India who participated in this. We found that there&#039;s an absolute gold rush for making sure that people have their ducks lined up in a row in this space because more than anything, they are worried about what they&#039;re going to miss out on. More than 92 percent of the leaders believe that advancements in AI, specifically generative AI, make data management a much higher priority than where it was before. More than 75 percent are worried about how competition is going to have a leg-up on them, if they don&#039;t have the initiatives to drive the insights from this data with AI. A lot of questions are coming up on security and trust as well. The other big piece is that generative AI is cool in a lot of ways, but it can also provide a lot of inaccurate information. And so, data accuracy, how do you cut out the noise, how do you remove bias, a lot of these things are top of the mind, as people start putting this to meaningful use that is much beyond writing poems and creating marketing campaigns. The moment you want to start trusting AI to be as autonomous as you think it can be, now, you have to worry about ten other pieces. I also think that governance is top of mind. What is your position on AI regulation as a company? Arun: We&#039;re one of the top five software companies in the world and so, we get invited to a lot of conversation in this area. In fact, I know that our CEO Marc Benioff and a few others were invited to the White House when they had a closed-door conversation around AI, and what&#039;s happening in the larger domain. We participated in a similar one in the UK. And so, we&#039;re part of a lot of these conversations around ethical use of AI, in fact, we have an executive whose role is just to make sure that as we embed AI into the core of everything that we do, we are acutely focused on also making sure that we&#039;re not crossing lines that we should not. I think it&#039;s still very early days, in terms of where this is heading from a regulation perspective. People and companies are rushing to deploy and use AI, a subject that’s still new and evolving— and prone to risk. What is Salesforce doing to minimise that risk? Arun: We&#039;re not saying AI just for AI’s sake. We&#039;re saying, think about AI in combination with data and trust, and more importantly, customer relationship management (CRM), because at the end of the day, the heart of all your customer data sits in your CRM platform. Our view is that the best answers you&#039;re going to get from AI, generative or predictive, are going to come from a combination of data that you trust the most, which is your customer data, which we as a SaaS vendor, have an obligation and a commitment to make sure we take care of. It doesn&#039;t matter whether you&#039;re a Mayura Bakery in Bangalore, or you&#039;re the National Security Agency. Both these customers get the same level of security, trust, and enforceability from a Salesforce platform perspective. Today, we make probably two trillion predictions per day from a predictive AI perspective on our Einstein platform at Salesforce. When we take you on that journey, it will include multiple things including your own large language model or it could be a public LLM that you&#039;re using, the way we work with that is we don&#039;t keep copies of your data. We will only look for veracity of the data and the accuracy of the information we&#039;re providing. Every customer in the world has access to the same capabilities across the board. It&#039;s a huge differentiator for us. And particularly in the world that we come in, where you have people who are sitting on versions that are five generations behind, our promise is we will keep you current, and we&#039;ll keep you where you need to be. Your views on India’s AI-readiness, adoption, opportunities, and challenges? Arun: Because of India’s inherent scale, we will find unique use cases and solutions that the world will probably not see or not want. That will propel us to the top of the chart. A lot of the demographics in India are crying for help on automation and AI is going to solve a lot of problems that otherwise we would have no way of solving. So, in some ways, I would almost say that our demographics are going to force adoption faster. What we don&#039;t know is at our scale, how would the pricing economics work. I think that&#039;s the piece that needs to be seen. Right now, if you look at all the use cases, a lot of it is in customer service, a lot of it is around content, how can we make things autonomous, etc. If you truly start trying to solve some of India’s problems at scale, that&#039;s going to put a lot of stress on the resources. The cost of being able to deliver that is what we need to see as we evolve into those large-scale solutions that will solve large problems for the society here in India. Then we&#039;ll have to see how economically viable it becomes for us to do it. It’s still early. But I foundationally believe that, like a lot of the leapfrogs that we&#039;ve seen in technology over the last 20 years, India will leapfrog in a number of ways because of this AI growth curve that we&#039;re seeing. Also ReadFE Exclusive: Vivo wants to not chase numbers, but shoot for the sun with X100 series I don&#039;t know the exact numbers, but India probably already has more users on DigiYatra, than CLEAR has had in the US over the last 10 years. I use CLEAR because I travel a lot to the US and it makes my life so much simpler at security checkpoint, but I&#039;ve been paying USD 150 for that service. And I am thinking about what we&#039;ve developed with DigiYatra, here in India. You can imagine that, in less than 12 months, if we&#039;ve done more at essentially the cheapest cost possible to make this a free public digital infrastructure, here&#039;s a classical example of where we bought AI to solve a problem at large scale that India represents. It’s not like we are saying that at some point we&#039;re going to start charging for this either. It looks like it&#039;s going to be a free service, primarily because we want to solve the congestion problem in airports and enhance customer experiences. We can see how AI is helping to solve large-scale problems, that otherwise, we had no other way of solving other than throwing more bodies at the problem, which can become a huge challenge at some point. DigiYatra for me is AI at work, every day. What is the talent pool like in India right now in terms of people who are educated and capable in this space? More importantly, are you hiring? [At a time when Big Tech layoffs are becoming increasingly commonplace, we believe that’s a pertinent question.] Arun: One of the good things that&#039;s happened in India over the last five years is the number of data scientists, data analysts and people who can work on data models has absolutely gone through the roof. So, the foundation from a data perspective is there. If you were to think about innovation in generative AI, core large language models, a lot of that is still predominantly, Silicon Valley, West Coast [between Silicon Valley and Seattle] that probably comprises 80 percent of the innovation that&#039;s happening today. But I think India is catching up fast and furious. We&#039;re hiring across the board with a very clear view that every platform of Salesforce will have these capabilities embedded in it. When mobile became the latest fad, 12-14 years back, we said, we&#039;ll make every platform fully mobile capable. When we got into predictive AI, 5-6 years back, we said, okay, Einstein is going to be embedded in everything we build, and therefore, everybody who comes on board should have these capabilities. And you&#039;ll see that we will continue to hire in this space across a multitude of capabilities. In terms of where that talent is, I&#039;d probably say in early stages, but again, you know how this country works, people spot a gold rush and then everyone will be heading in that direction. So, in a couple of years’ time, I think we will start seeing meaningful contributions and innovations coming out of India. Conversely, what is your take on concerns that AI will take away jobs? Arun: Every technology shift that&#039;s come in the last 30 years, has come with the first worry that it&#039;s going to take away jobs. If you look at what&#039;s happened subsequently, it&#039;s not just not taken away jobs, if anything, it has spurred an entire generation of new jobs. What you can expect is a little bit of volatility in the short and medium term. Automation has always gone after low-value repeatable jobs that can be replaced. What AI is threatening to do is exactly that, which is, if you&#039;re in a space where you&#039;re doing something that&#039;s of relatively low value that the system can accomplish, you should expect that it is going to be taken over. But it doesn&#039;t mean that there is no role for those people. There is still going to be a whole bunch of jobs that will be created for managing those platforms. Yes, if you&#039;re in an industry where you&#039;re doing certain things that can be automated at scale, then there is going to be disruption. But there are also going to be new roles and new jobs that are going to be created over the course of the next 3-5 years. If you look at the stages of AI, today, it&#039;s predominantly a user intervention driven AI model, and the future being autonomous general insurance at some point, which people are saying anywhere between 2027-2030. That&#039;s a very long road to getting to a point where you&#039;re going to have Autonomous General Intelligence (AGI) come into play in the mainstream. In that process, we will see roles and jobs evolve, new capabilities, and more enablement for people to take up some of these things and move away from what they know is going to get disrupted.

Indian engineers have nothing to worry about, Salesforce’s Deepak Pargaonkar says And what about concerns of AI becoming larger than life and taking over humanity— from reel to real? Arun: Technology has been and will continue to remain a force for good. And I think the benefits far outweigh the downside risks of how technology can be used. But companies need to take a step back on behalf of their customers and have conversations around security, trust, the ethical use of AI, and put guardrails to make sure that this technology [remains] a force for good. That is why a lot of companies, like Salesforce, are taking very measured, but very agile steps to make sure that our customers benefit from this revolution but are also secure in making decisions. You can&#039;t underscore the threat, but I would want to point backwards to history and say this is not the first time we&#039;ve seen a technology that has the potential not just to be a force for good, but also to bring unintended consequences. We&#039;ve always found a way to make sure that it stays on the right side of that line. There have been guardrails around how technology has evolved and deployed in the past, and there&#039;s no reason to believe that we can&#039;t do the same with AI. We&#039;re in the very early stages of a hype curve, but the only difference between this hype curve and the rest is that this can get past the chasm of uncertainty or where people don&#039;t get the benefits, because the benefits are going to be obvious in this case. We will see some very striking benefits for businesses and therefore it will quickly cross the chasm and go into a quick adoption curve. This technology revolution is very different from what we&#039;ve seen in the past, and it&#039;s going to come at a cost that is going to be very affordable, at least from what we can see right now. How do you see (and deal with) competition, which is frankly starting to get tighter in this space? Arun: I go back to the famous Intel CEO [Andy Grove], quote, “Paranoid, alone survive”. We must be paranoid, not just to survive, but to thrive. For a company of our size, complexity, and size of customer base, [if you] look at our growth rates, and look at the pace at which we are innovating, I think that&#039;s truly impressive. But the reason we are there is because we&#039;re constantly paranoid about the fact that if we don&#039;t innovate, we won&#039;t grow. If we won&#039;t grow, we can&#039;t invest, which means we can&#039;t innovate. It&#039;s a vicious cycle. And so, we&#039;re constantly looking at everybody around us and saying, are we innovating ahead of competition? Secondly, as companies grow bigger, the inevitable issues of how easy you are to do business with comes up and it&#039;s something that we&#039;re very acutely focused on inside the company in terms of how we engage with customers, both internally and externally. There are multiple lenses with which we look at competition. At the end of the day, competition is what keeps you alive, keeps you on your toes, and it&#039;s required. The opportunity is so large that there is enough for everybody here.
