Photograph: dima_sidelnikov/Getty Images/iStockphotoArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 2 years oldUK data watchdog investigates whether AI systems show racial bias This article is more than 2 years oldICO says AI-driven discrimination can lead to job rejections or being wrongfully denied bank loans or benefitDan Milmo Global technology editorThu 14 Jul 2022 01.01 EDTShareThe UK data watchdog is to investigate whether artificial intelligence systems are showing racial bias when dealing with job applications.The Information Commissioner’s Office said AI-driven discrimination could have “damaging consequences for people’s lives” and lead to someone being rejected for a job or being wrongfully denied a bank loan or a welfare benefit.It will investigate the use of algorithms to sift through job applications, amid concerns that they are affecting employment opportunities for people from ethnic minorities.“We will be investigating concerns over the use of algorithms to sift recruitment applications, which could be negatively impacting employment opportunities of those from diverse backgrounds,” said the ICO.The investigation is being announced as part of a three-year plan for the ICO under the UK’s new information commissioner, John Edwards, who joined the ICO in January after running its New Zealand counterpart.In a speech on Thursday Edwards is expected to say that the ICO will be “looking at the impact AI use could be having on groups of people who aren’t part of the testing for this software, such as neurodiverse people or people from ethnic minorities”.The CEO of ZipRecruiter, a jobs website, told the Guardian this year at least three-quarters of all CVs submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms. A survey of recruiting executives conducted by the research and consulting firm Gartner last year found that almost all reported using AI for part of the recruiting and hiring process – for instance sifting applications before they are seen by a person.Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation, which is enforced by the ICO, people have a right to non-discrimination under the processing of their data. The ICO has warned in the past that AI-driven systems could produce outcomes that disadvantage certain groups if they are not represented accurately or fairly in the data set that the algorithm is trained and tested on. The UK Equality Act 2010, also offers individuals protection from discrimination, whether caused by a human or an automated decision-making system.Dr David Leslie, director of ethics and responsible innovation research at The Alan Turing Institute, said: “The use of data-driven AI models in recruitment processes raises a host of thorny ethical issues, which demand forethought and diligent assessment on the part of both system designers and procurers.“Most basically, predictive models that could be used to filter job applications through techniques of supervised machine learning run the risk of replicating, or even augmenting, patterns of discrimination and structural inequities that could be baked into the datasets used to train them.”Elsewhere in its three-year plan, the UK watchdog will look at whether to prioritise the public interest when considering complaints about freedom of information requests. The ICO said changes to the complaints process for the FoI regime – which grants members of the public the legal right to request official information from public bodies – are necessary due to rising complaints and fewer resources to deal with them.Edwards said the current system for dealing with FoI complaints – for reasons that include late responses or incomplete information disclosures – was not working and it would consult on a new regime. The number of complaints reached 6,361 in the year to 30 April 2022, which was a slight dip on the prior year but compares with 5,433 in 2016/17.“I want to explore whether we should be able to elevate some cases or pull some out and say: this goes on a fast track, because it’s in the public interest,” said Edwards.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTEdwards said the organisation expected to avoid accusations of bias in what it prioritised by publishing a list of criteria for sifting through complaints.Edwards said the ICO would consider prioritising submissions from journalists and MPs, although it would also weigh a “blind applicant” system where the identity of the person or organisation making the submission was concealed. Information held by Scottish public authorities is covered by the country’s own commissioner and Freedom of Information Act.“Should we differentiate between who’s making the request … and say a journalist is acting on behalf of the wider public to illuminate a particular issue. So therefore, they get extra points. A member of parliament, for example, has a very particular role in holding the executive and public authorities to account so maybe there’s a case for adding extra weight to those [requests].”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingDiscrimination at workWork & careersRaceInformation commissionerData protectionnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedIsrael shaken as fatal Houthi drone hits Tel Aviv after interception failureLiveThird Democratic US senator and four more House Democrats call for Biden to step aside in 2024 race– liveDance, spend time in nature, and get naked! 17 body confidence tips from people who have itLiveWindows IT outage live: CrowdStrike CEO ‘deeply sorry’ for global chaos caused by update and warns fix may take time to work‘Largest IT outage in history’ hits Microsoft Windows and causes global chaos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employers are turning to artificial intelligence to identify fraudulent job candidates as remote hiring and a labor shortage fuel a rise in opportunities for dishonesty on the part of applicants. Deception takes new forms in the era of remote recruitment: Some prospective hires have been known to receive interview answers from someone off camera in the Zoom room and mouth along a la Cyrano de Bergerac. Others exploit remote assessments by getting another person to take their cognitive or coding tests for them. And others do a bait and switch, where the person who interviews and is hired is not the same one who shows up for the job.

This fraud creates a frustrating — not to mention expensive — problem for companies. They not only spend money recruiting new candidates but also face costs related to the lost productivity associated with onboarding workers who don't have the qualifications they claim to, and that strains team morale. There are also security concerns. The FBI recently issued a public service announcement warning companies of the increased risk of people with criminal records applying for work-from-home tech jobs that allow them to gain access to confidential company and customer data.A recent study by Glider AI, a recruiting-software company, found candidate fraud has nearly doubled since the pandemic began. Executives there estimated about 10% of prospective hires attempted to commit some form of fraud.

Cameron Edwards, the senior vice president of client strategy and operations at Matlen Silver, a staffing agency that screens applicants for jobs at Fortune 500 companies, said the phenomenon was happening across industries and roles but that it's most common in technical, IT, and developer jobs.""There've always been people who fluff their résumés, but more and more, we're dealing with people who are just plain not who they say they are,"" Edwards told Insider. ""There was once somebody hiding beneath the desk answering interview questions for a candidate — you could even see the top of the person's head. But there are other instances of fraud that are hard to catch.""For those, employers rely on tools that help them recognize when a job seeker is trying to cheat the hiring process. Staying ahead of unscrupulous tactics isn't easy — particularly as technology advances at a rapid pace and a tight labor market puts pressure on companies to hire quickly. But at a time when remote recruiting has become more common, a growing number of companies are determined to take action.Remote hiring is a ripe opportunity for fraudulent candidatesCandidates lying in interviews or fudging skills to get a job are nothing new, of course. A 2020 survey from Checkster, a reference-checking company, found that 78% of job candidates in its poll admitted they'd misrepresented themselves or would consider doing so.

But experts say that the practice has recently become more prevalent — and more nefarious — as previous social norms around work have weakened.""Everything we thought we knew about work has been called into question in the last two years,"" G. James Lemoine, a professor at the University at Buffalo's School of Management, said.

""People aren't staying with their employers as long, they're not going to offices, and in the age of the 'Great Resignation,' they're quitting more often,"" Lemoine said. ""So a lot of people start to think, 'What other rules can be broken?'""

The limitations of remote hiring are another factor, according to Lindsey Zuloaga, the chief data scientist at HireVue, a recruiting-technology firm. Before the pandemic, most candidates went to an office to interview with a hiring manager, or took an assessment proctored by a human.

""If you were hiring in person, the candidate would be coding in front of you on a whiteboard, and when they showed up for work, you'd know it was the right person because you'd already met them,"" she said. ""It was a lot harder to pull off these tricks.""The talent shortage has exacerbated the problem, Ben Walker, the vice president of operations at Glider AI, added.""Companies cannot hire enough tech talent, and so they're having to screen people faster,"" he said. ""This makes it harder for them to know whether candidates can do what they say they can, and so more are slipping through the cracks.""How AI identifies fraudulent candidatesArtificial intelligence is a standard component of today's hiring process. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 88% of companies globally use AI in some way for HR.

Using AI-powered tools to find fraudulent candidates is a natural next step in the evolution of hiring, employers say. Some tools, for instance, can detect cheating and plagiarism in technical assessments by identifying questionable patterns of behavior, including whether candidates are using their phones and whether they're using multiple screens. Other capabilities can detect outside voices during an interview that would otherwise be barely perceptible to a remote interviewer. Some can also detect whether there are other people in the room by analyzing the test area and detecting whether a remote desktop is being used.The tools raise flags that alert human hiring managers to look more closely at a candidate's behavior or examine code similarities with published sources.""With AI, we can find out when a candidate is pulling up a page on their browser to cut and paste answers from the internet on a coding challenge or when their microphone is being accessed by someone else remotely during an interview,"" Edwards of Matlen Silver said. ""Since using these tools, we've been able to catch far more instances of fraud that we otherwise wouldn't have had visibility into.""Vik Kalra, a cofounder of Mindlance, a staffing firm focused on placing highly skilled contractors at Fortune 1000 companies, said he started using AI-enabled tools just before COVID-19 hit. He was initially motivated out of concern about human biases in the interviewing process and a desire for more objective data on a candidate's abilities.

But since the pandemic started, he relies on AI to catch cheating candidates as well. Recruiting has always involved a mix of art and science, he said.""Interviewing is about intuition and common sense combined with open-ended questions and other tests designed to assess how a candidate stacks up,"" he said. Nowadays, he leans more on the science. ""I need to validate that there's no fraud going on and also that the candidate is the best person for the job,"" he said.Kalra said the greatest utility for his company was the facial-recognition technology that verifies the identity of candidates — and that they were indeed the same people who were interviewed and took assessments — before they're hired. Roughly 75% of candidates that have passed his company's hiring process, which includes the Glider AI assessment, are selected by his clients. Before using the AI tool, that figure hovered around 30%.

Of course, AI cannot detect every instance of candidate fraud. Bad actors are increasingly sophisticated and able to find ways to outsmart the technologies.Critics also say that an overreliance on AI- and machine-learning-powered tools in hiring can become a problem. Some lawmakers have called for closer scrutiny of the use of AI in evaluating job candidates. They say racial or gender stereotypes hidden in data sets and algorithms could pick up on human biases. This is especially the case in fields like tech, where progress toward diversity remains slow.As a result, leaders of AI platforms are often quick to emphasize the need to blend technology with human judgment.""The pace of change in candidate fraud is such that to be successful means combining the right tools with the best people,"" said Danny Jones, a product manager at Dice, a tech-recruiting platform. ""For every automated process or AI model we employ, there is a human behind the scenes.""

Executives there estimated about 10% of prospective hires attempted to commit some form of fraud. Cameron Edwards, the senior vice president of client strategy and operations at Matlen Silver, a staffing agency that screens applicants for jobs at Fortune 500 companies, said the phenomenon was happening across industries and roles but that it's most common in technical, IT, and developer jobs.""There've always been people who fluff their résumés, but more and more, we're dealing with people who are just plain not who they say they are,"" Edwards told Insider. ""There was once somebody hiding beneath the desk answering interview questions for a candidate — you could even see the top of the person's head. But there are other instances of fraud that are hard to catch.""For those, employers rely on tools that help them recognize when a job seeker is trying to cheat the hiring process. Staying ahead of unscrupulous tactics isn't easy — particularly as technology advances at a rapid pace and a tight labor market puts pressure on companies to hire quickly. But at a time when remote recruiting has become more common, a growing number of companies are determined to take action.Candidates lying in interviews or fudging skills to get a job are nothing new, of course. A 2020 survey from Checkster, a reference-checking company, found that 78% of job candidates in its poll admitted they'd misrepresented themselves or would consider doing so.But experts say that the practice has recently become more prevalent — and more nefarious — as previous social norms around work have weakened.""Everything we thought we knew about work has been called into question in the last two years,"" G. James Lemoine, a professor at the University at Buffalo's School of Management, said. ""People aren't staying with their employers as long, they're not going to offices, and in the age of the 'Great Resignation,' they're quitting more often,"" Lemoine said. ""So a lot of people start to think, 'What other rules can be broken?'""The limitations of remote hiring are another factor, according to Lindsey Zuloaga, the chief data scientist at HireVue, a recruiting-technology firm. Before the pandemic, most candidates went to an office to interview with a hiring manager, or took an assessment proctored by a human.""If you were hiring in person, the candidate would be coding in front of you on a whiteboard, and when they showed up for work, you'd know it was the right person because you'd already met them,"" she said. ""It was a lot harder to pull off these tricks.""The talent shortage has exacerbated the problem, Ben Walker, the vice president of operations at Glider AI, added.""Companies cannot hire enough tech talent, and so they're having to screen people faster,"" he said. ""This makes it harder for them to know whether candidates can do what they say they can, and so more are slipping through the cracks.""Artificial intelligence is a standard component of today's hiring process. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 88% of companies globally use AI in some way for HR.Using AI-powered tools to find fraudulent candidates is a natural next step in the evolution of hiring, employers say. Some tools, for instance, can detect cheating and plagiarism in technical assessments by identifying questionable patterns of behavior, including whether candidates are using their phones and whether they're using multiple screens. Other capabilities can detect outside voices during an interview that would otherwise be barely perceptible to a remote interviewer. Some can also detect whether there are other people in the room by analyzing the test area and detecting whether a remote desktop is being used.The tools raise flags that alert human hiring managers to look more closely at a candidate's behavior or examine code similarities with published sources.""With AI, we can find out when a candidate is pulling up a page on their browser to cut and paste answers from the internet on a coding challenge or when their microphone is being accessed by someone else remotely during an interview,"" Edwards of Matlen Silver said. ""Since using these tools, we've been able to catch far more instances of fraud that we otherwise wouldn't have had visibility into.""Vik Kalra, a cofounder of Mindlance, a staffing firm focused on placing highly skilled contractors at Fortune 1000 companies, said he started using AI-enabled tools just before COVID-19 hit. He was initially motivated out of concern about human biases in the interviewing process and a desire for more objective data on a candidate's abilities. But since the pandemic started, he relies on AI to catch cheating candidates as well. Recruiting has always involved a mix of art and science, he said.""Interviewing is about intuition and common sense combined with open-ended questions and other tests designed to assess how a candidate stacks up,"" he said. Nowadays, he leans more on the science. ""I need to validate that there's no fraud going on and also that the candidate is the best person for the job,"" he said.Kalra said the greatest utility for his company was the facial-recognition technology that verifies the identity of candidates — and that they were indeed the same people who were interviewed and took assessments — before they're hired. Roughly 75% of candidates that have passed his company's hiring process, which includes the Glider AI assessment, are selected by his clients. Before using the AI tool, that figure hovered around 30%.Of course, AI cannot detect every instance of candidate fraud. Bad actors are increasingly sophisticated and able to find ways to outsmart the technologies.Critics also say that an overreliance on AI- and machine-learning-powered tools in hiring can become a problem. Some lawmakers have called for closer scrutiny of the use of AI in evaluating job candidates. They say racial or gender stereotypes hidden in data sets and algorithms could pick up on human biases. This is especially the case in fields like tech, where progress toward diversity remains slow.As a result, leaders of AI platforms are often quick to emphasize the need to blend technology with human judgment.""The pace of change in candidate fraud is such that to be successful means combining the right tools with the best people,"" said Danny Jones, a product manager at Dice, a tech-recruiting platform. ""For every automated process or AI model we employ, there is a human behind the scenes.""","Careers, Nordic, Strategy",False,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/', 'name': 'Business Insider'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/careers', 'name': 'Careers'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/prime', 'name': 'BI Prime'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ai-can-catch-fraudulent-cheating-job-candidates-in-tech-2022-6', 'name': 'More job candidates are lying and cheating in their interviews.

These engineers also create weak or strong AIs, depending on what goals they want to achieve. AI engineers have a sound understanding of programming, software engineering, and data science. They use different tools and techniques so they can process data, as well as develop and maintain AI systems..The discipline of AI engineering is still relatively new, but it has the potential to open up a wealth of employment doors in the years to come. A bachelor's degree in a relevant subject, such as information technology, computer engineering, statistics, or data science, is the very minimum need for entry into the area of artificial intelligence engineering. As an AI engineer, you need to perform certain tasks, such as developing, testing, and deploying AI models through programming algorithms like random forest, logistic regression, linear regression, and so on. However, Self-teaching is also another great way to hone skills in AI engineering..FAANG is a group of big tech companies including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. It is every techie's dream to join different professions and roles. A job in FAANG is a dream come true for almost all working professionals from any technical field. But there is a discrepancy between a self-taught AI engineer and a pro with a degree in AI. Multiple companies prefer to hire an AI engineer with a valid degree from eminent educational institutions and platforms. However, big tech companies such as Facebook, IBM, Google, and Apple are welcoming self-taught AI engineers without any past prejudices. Getting into FAANG requires a good understanding of data structures and algorithms and also an innovative mind when it comes to artificial intelligence. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple can ask you notorious questions and therefore you need to brush your skills a bit in this area before going to the interview..Understanding how things work is as important as knowing how to code. Knowing how people think and behave in certain scenarios is handy when building products. The employer needs you to understand the flow of things or why a product has been designed the way it is. To make it to FAANG, you need to learn behavioral and systems design. If you have not attended any educational institution to receive a valuable programmer degree, you do not need to worry. The modern global tech market is updating and this current market version is set to hire employees without any professional degree. FAANG is a group of tech influencers in the global tech market. All other companies seem to follow their policies and artificial intelligence models to enhance customer engagement efficiently and effectively. A job in the FAANG group also provides a competitive edge to an employee to kickstart a successful career journey. Thus, whether an employee is a self-taught programmer or a self-taught data science pro, one can seamlessly apply for a job in FAANG with full confidence. FAANG seems to be highly interested in necessary skills, in-depth knowledge, and sufficient hands-on experience in the respective fields. They do not need a cybersecurity degree to select an employee. These big tech companies have relaxed their educational requirements policy to boost the productivity of their respective companies..More Trending Stories .Dogecoin is Trading 78,000% Above its All-Time Lows Amidst the Crypto BloodbathRegulators Scrutinize Voyager's Backside Dealings Using Investors' MoneyOnly AI Characters can turn Metaverse Ghost Towns into Virtual HotspotsRobots in a Human Workspace Are Dangerous, Amazon Warehouse Is the ExampleGitHub's Copilot is Not Democratic but Big Tech is Playing DumbArtificial Intelligence 100: Top Industry Wise Companies ListingFlawed AI Makes Sexist Robots and Researchers Are Okay with It.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Motive (formerly KeepTruckin), a well-funded US-based startup with a sizable team based out of Pakistan, is organising a two-day artificial intelligence (AI) conference titled ""AI Connect"" in Lahore from Wednesday aimed at ""showcasing Pakistan's talent"" in the artificial intelligence.
Ali Hasan, the startup's engineering manager, said the event will be ""replete with keynotes, fireside chats, panel discussions, and networking sessions with the world's top AI researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.""
The event, he continued, was designed to ""motivate, train, and connect"" the next generation of prospective AI engineers and researchers who were going to contribute significantly to the global AI economy.
Hasan said many countries had developed dedicated AI frameworks and policies to facilitate education programs and research and development centres to forward technological advancements and economic growth. 

""Examples include China's Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, the US executive order on AI leadership, and AI Made in Germany — to name only a few.""
He emphasised that Pakistan must follow suit and invest in programmes to promote youths’ enthusiasm about AI and modern technologies. This means investing in education programmes, research centers, and industry readiness training programs, the engineer added.
Hasan said it had been an exception because ""it established its primary AI team in Lahore. This team consists of multiple PhDs, postdocs in computer vision and machine learning, and engineers with a solid academic research background.""
The team builds AI technologies to help prevent road accidents, keep our roads safer, and save lives. They have already shipped industry-leading AI products, published their work at top AI conferences, and filed multiple patents thanks to R&D done primarily in Pakistan, he highlighted.
According to Hasan, the engineers are deploying their solutions to hundreds of thousands of IoT devices in the field to perform various automation tasks, such as identifying who is driving the vehicle, detecting unsafe driving behaviors, and automated driver coaching, to name a few. 
""AI — and innovation in general — is not something new to Pakistan. We have a strong talent pool and a growing population of educated youth. We are also an incredible engineering hub with a growing Information Technology (IT) industry. We have over 600,000 IT professionals, with over 25,000 fresh graduates added to the workforce annually,"" the manager pointed out.
He said Pakistan had around 17,000 software companies providing services to over 120 countries across the globe, bringing in $3 billion in IT export revenue last year.
It is encouraging to look at the tech companies, startups, and research labs working in both applied and scientific research in artificial intelligence, but the number of companies and startups providing services and building products in the AI space is relatively small, Hasan added.
He insisted on investing in programmes that help bridge the industry-academia gap and motivate the youth to pursue research and education in AI. ""We must train some of our existing 600k IT professionals in AI, and we must create more centers like  National Center of Artificial Intelligence."" 
The firm NCAI, he went on, was a technological initiative established by the Government of Pakistan in 2018. ""It aims to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields. It consists of nine research labs from six universities in Pakistan.""
In addition, Hasan said, a few more labs at the institutes including the National University of Sciences and Technology, and the Lahore University of Management Sciences were solving fundamental AI problems. ""They publish their work at top-tier international venues and collaborate with companies like Google and Facebook.""

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has established a Center of Excellence (CoE) for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its warfighting capabilities, becoming the first among the three armed services of India.

On July 10, Vice Chief of the Air Staff (VCAS), Air Marshal Sandeep Singh, inaugurated the IAF’s Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence under the aegis of UDAAN (Unit for Digitisation, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, and Application Networking) at Air Force Station Rajokri, New Delhi.
“A Big Data Analytics and Al Platform have been commissioned in the IAF’s Al Centre, for handling all aspects of Analytics, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning algorithms,” said the IAF in a press release.
The latest Graphical Processing Unit-powered servers will be used to undertake these high-end computer applications, per the IAF’s statement.

While addressing the gathering at the inaugural ceremony, Air Marshal Singh said that the IAF had taken proactive steps to incorporate Industry 4.0 and AI-based technologies in its warfighting processes.
“The AI COE with high-end compute and big data storage capabilities, coupled with full-spectrum Al software suites, would substantially enhance the operational capability of IAF,” Air Marshal Singh said.
Singh further said that the Al-based applications are being developed with in-house expertise in coordination with various Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), MSMEs, and leading academia in the field of Artificial intelligence.
Artificial Intelligence In Aerial Warfighting
In today’s day and age, information and the ability to process this information to arrive at decisions is paramount.








US Military’s ‘Most Secretive Craft’ Has Been ‘Flying Non-Stop’ For Over Two Years & Has No Plans To Land

This is true in military aviation, where fighter pilots operating high-speed combat aircraft can find themselves in a complex high-paced threat environment where multiple threats are coming in from various directions at high speed.
In such a situation, detecting, tracking, and engaging these threats is essential for fighter pilots to survive and carry out their missions. This is where Big Data and Machine Learning come in, as these technologies can process a lot of information very quickly to enhance the battlespace awareness of the pilots.

While Artificial Intelligence (AI) takes it to another level by taking over the decision-making task, thereby making the aircraft semi-autonomous to take some load off of pilots but not entirely replacing them, according to Aerospace and Defense Analyst Girish Linganna.
“In aerial combat, AI shall not replace human operators, but rather aid them; taking over simpler tasks and freeing the pilot’s headspace for more complex decision-making,” Linganna told EurAsian Times.
Linganna explained that AI algorithms automate various human tasks, but the complexity of functions comes into play and broadly defines the challenge at hand.



“For example, for a robot cleaning the floor, the algorithm will largely concern itself with looking where it’s going and cleaning. However, a task like guiding a fuel hose during aerial refueling would be a greater challenge, even for a human operator,” Linganna said.

When asked how exactly the AI enhances the capabilities of a fighter jet, Linganna said that an AI could work into this dynamic by either increasing capabilities as an add-on or by perfecting tasks often taken up by human operators.
“In aerial combat, we have two skilled players engaged in the most expensive game of chess,” Linganna explained, adding that the “key to victory is largely outmaneuvering and forcing errors.
He further added: “In the cockpit, the three-dimensionality of flight means going from a twenty-degree bank angle, ascending at ten degrees, to get to a thirty-degree bank angle, rising at twenty degrees, the way to move the stick will vary at different speeds. Such is only one of the many overheads in a dogfight.
AI can address many such overheads and simultaneously increase the Situational Awareness of the human pilot.

We have autonomous wingman programs like Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)’s indigenous Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), which focuses on expanding the capabilities of each pilot in the air by increasing payloads at hand and also offering greater situational awareness.”
China Dominating Artificial Intelligence
Militaries worldwide constantly work to incorporate modern technologies into their warfighting, and AI is no exception.
The two superpowers, the US and China, are at the forefront of the ongoing race for AI supremacy since the militaries of both these countries view AI as a critical part of next-generation warfare.
In February, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) solicited proposals for converting the existing F-16D aircraft into a testbed platform for AI-enabled dogfighting in realistic experiments.
The solicitation, part of DARPA’s Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, asked for aircraft hardware and mission systems software for modifying and testing two F-16D aircraft to accept within-visual-range (WVR) autonomy algorithms.
The agency also asked the industry for solutions to measure, increase and predict human trust in combat autonomy performance.
The ACE program aims to enhance trust in combat autonomy through human-machine collaboration in aircraft dogfighting.

Likewise, China has been working to incorporate AI into warfighting by leveraging its booming drone industry.
In January, researchers from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre in Mianyang, Sichuan province, claimed to have developed an AI-based system that can train unmanned combat drones to dogfight manned fighter jets thousands of times faster than comparable US technology.
This was not the first instance of China using AI to train combat drones for fighting manned fighter jets. In June 2021, the Chinese PLA Central Theater Command Air Force simulated a dogfight in which a highly experienced pilot was knocked down by an AI-enabled aircraft.
China is moving fast toward overtaking the US as a world leader in AI technology.
As recently reported by EurAsian Times, China’s core AI business is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8%, from 199.8 billion yuan ($29.89 billion) in 2021 to more than 600 billion yuan ($89.76 billion) in 2026.

Experts also suggest that China is surpassing the US in testing and incorporating AI into their military, especially the Air Force, and US government officials are concerned by this development.
“Certain people in the US government have forewarned Chinese global dominance in AI, especially in integration with the air force, if others do not wake up to the task,” Girish Linganna told EurAsian Times.
According to Linganna, China has already outpaced the US in testing AI against their air force squadrons. “Nearly 30% of Chinese military contracts involve AI and drones. However, their current focus remains on surveillance,” Linganna noted.
India Encourages Industry To Develop AI Technology
India also appears to be concerned by the burgeoning advances of the Chinese military in AI technology. Therefore the Indian government is encouraging research and development in this field.
On July 11, India’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) held the first-ever ‘AI in Defense’ (AIDef) symposium and exhibition, during which Defense Minister Rajnath Singh unveiled 75 new indigenously developed AI products/technologies.
These 75 products are a result of collective efforts made by the Armed Forces, DRDO, Defense Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), and several Indian start-ups under the government’s Innovations for Defense Excellence (iDEX) initiative and the private industry in the last four years in the field of AI.
“We have started incorporating AI applications in remote piloted, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. There is a need to move further in this direction so that we can develop autonomous weapon systems. Timely infusion of technologies like AI & Big Data in the defense sector is of utmost importance so that we are not left behind the technological curve and can take maximum advantage of technology for our services,” Rajnath Singh said during the AIDef Symposium.

When asked how the Indian government intends to promote innovation and development of AI technologies within the industry, Linganna explained that the Indian approach has been to mobilize its public entities and leverage its players, as part of which the government has simplified many bureaucratic hurdles earlier involved in defense projects.
“It (India) has increasingly sought more innovation and is willing to use various platforms to fund multiple players in a controlled competition. It showcases a fertile environment for private players to take on risks while allowing the Indian government to steer the direction of this innovation,” Linganna said.

The professional work teams, which are expected to begin work in the coming months, will serve as the professional infrastructure for establishing the strategic dialogue on technology. The dialogue will significantly expand the strategic partnership in cutting edge technologies.The goal of this cooperation is to highlight the special relationship between the United States and Israel, anchor the partnership between the countries and cement Israel's status as one of the United States' leading allies in the field of technology, which is at the top of the international agenda. The work of the professional teams is an expression of both countries' commitment to addressing challenges by developing technological solutions as a basis for close cooperation that will shape the next decade.Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Orit Farkash-Hacohen: ""I am so pleased that the president's visit will include a declaration from him about increased technological cooperation between the two governments, the result of work conducted in my ministry and the NSC over the past several months.

This is an important development that will leverage Israel's scientific power, its scientific community, local companies and the entire Israeli economy. It is a strategic infrastructure that will help maintain Israel's national resilience. Institutionalized scientific cooperation between our countries will contribute greatly to advancing science in Israel and exposing it to America's unique scientific infrastructure, in order to encourage innovation and scientific activities.""At times like these, when technology is at the forefront of the competition between cultures, countries and points of view, the correct buildup of Israel's technological strength, in cooperation with the United States — while leveraging Israel's scientific community, Israeli companies and Israel's economy — is a critical infrastructure for maintaining Israel's national resilience. Institutionalized scientific cooperation between our countries will contribute greatly to advancing science in Israel and exposing it to America's unique scientific infrastructure.

Artificial Intelligence leadership goes beyond technology
By Prof. Guido Stein, IESE Business School and Alberto Barrachina, Research Assistant
For companies, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the fact that face-to-face is not always the best way to have meetings. Technological devices have made it possible to hold virtual meetings and to have it be the first option for many recruiters who are unaware of the candidate’s health risks and prefer to conduct the interview virtually. The use of tools to conduct video interviews and online assessments, assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making, has increased exponentially. 
Digital interviews enable companies as well as candidates to have more opportunities. Candidates who would not have been interviewed without this tool can now be considered, and processes that were previously out of reach for many stakeholders can now be applied. On the other hand, AI lacks the keen eye and intuition of the human mind, and the wealth of information that it can provide. However, it also avoids possible biases and replaces them with a quantified objectivity with a scientific basis. 
As we will see later, with the help of technology it is possible to analyse tone of voice, word choice, content, eye contact, face configuration, information from multiple sources in their raw state, such as digital footprints on social media or, in the case of internal processes – and with the candidate’s permission – from internal communications such as emails.
Real jobs may be more or less affected by digitisation processes, but what we know for sure and in general is that there are management systems based on AI that cover all areas of Human Resources, from recruitment and selection to employee departures and dismissals. In a 2017 survey, it was already found that 15 per cent of Human Resources leaders surveyed in 40 countries said that AI and automation are already having an impact on their departments, and 40 per cent said they expected both to impact their plans in 2-5 years (Harvey Nash Survey, 2017). Three years later, automation has accelerated, along with other trends such as online purchasing of services and goods, remote working, the storage and analysis of large amounts of data, and redundancy in the management of tasks and the value chain (Candelon et al., 2020). AI is the next logical step in the evolution of companies, as it is useful for adapting to these changes.
Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources is Unstoppable
The classic areas of Human Resources are recruitment and selection, benefits and compensation, performance evaluation and estimation of potential, structure, career and job position design, labour relations, compliance, employee training and development, internal and external communication, analytics and metrics, and departures and dismissals. 
Although all of them have significant potential to be automated, many professionals with extensive experience have reservations when it comes to fully adopting new technologies. They put forth reasons such as the fact that some algorithms cannot be replaced by human empathy and intuition. Some have doubts about whether the data can really add anything new to what is already known about workforce dynamics, and they warn of biases due to the quality of the data, and even the quantity necessary to make it meaningful, without considering the legitimacy of its use. On the other side of the divide, there are those who are in favour of applying it for reasons such as the ability to automate repetitive tasks that have little added value, better talent acquisition, faster and more personalised employee onboarding, more efficient and effective training of employees, greater connectivity and technical support in decision-making.
The ability to automate repetitive, low-value tasks.
Examples of such tasks might be compensation and benefits administration, employee questions about procedures and policies, or resume review. To take the last of these, if a previously programmed algorithm is applied, a larger number of resumes can be analysed much more quickly and reliably, significantly reducing human error. The Human Resources team will have more time to provide a series of defined and continuously improving analysis criteria, or to increase the number of responses and interactions with candidates. Job applicants increasingly value getting information on the progress of their application, the time required for each phase of the process, and even the reason for not being selected (Talent Board, 2018).
Better talent acquisition. 
Automation makes it possible to compare the skills of candidates with the best-performing employees. On average, a company’s recruiter spends about a third of their work week identifying candidates (Entelo, 2018). In addition, the hiring process generates a large amount of data. If, for example, a company hires 100 workers per year and receives 1,000 applications, the 100 that were chosen and the 900 that were not can generate information about what the company needs and what the labour market can offer at the given moment. 
Faster, more personalised employee onboarding. 
AI systems can provide information about compensation, benefits, and company policies, as well as personalised suggestions for training and rapid integration into the team. In this way, the length of stay of the employee will improve, thanks to successful onboarding. 
More efficient and effective employee training. 
Along with training software, AI systems can provide personalised learning paths. The Human Resources department can implement chatbots that offer 24/7 training without interruptions, and with the ability to provide instant and logical responses. According to research by Zoom.ai (Chauhan, 2017), the most active users of automated assistants save up to 25 hours per month, averaging savings of €15,000 on an employee with a salary of €100,000 per year. 
Greater connectivity. 
As an example, connectivity between candidates, employees, and managers thanks to technology avoids travel and therefore saves both cost and time.
Cognitive support in decision-making. 
The main hiring phases are: design of the job description, opening of the application period, candidates applying, evaluation, and, where appropriate, interviewing of the candidate by the recruiter. All of these phases can be replaced by machines such as chatbots, automated screening tools, or other candidate interaction systems.
AI engines can help managers and employees make daily decisions that would otherwise fall on the HR department. For example, when an employee wants to have additional vacation days, the AI system can calculate the probability that their request will be approved or not, without having to consult Human Resources. 
In a survey conducted by Oracle among 484 Human Resources professionals (HR Research Institute, 2019), 64 per cent confirmed that AI has a high potential to improve the area of HR. In fact, it was the second most-selected Human Resources function after “analysis and metrics”. The main hiring phases are: design of the job description, opening of the application period, candidates applying, evaluation, and, where appropriate, interviewing of the candidate by the recruiter. All of these phases can be replaced by machines such as chatbots, automated screening tools, or other candidate interaction systems.
The Recruiter’s Perspective
A survey carried out in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom in 2017, in which 5,179 managers were consulted, showed that only 10 per cent of workers were completely convinced that their jobs could be endangered by AI (Genpact, 2017). Three years later, this has already become reality.
At Amazon, process automation has been a constant, and one of the keys to the company’s success since its inception. However, in 2015, the company found that its recruitment algorithm did not evaluate software developers in a neutral, non-gender way (Kodiyan, 2019). The root cause was that the systems were trained to screen applicants by looking at patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most of the resumes that came in had been from men, so Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were more likely to be selected for the job. It penalised resumes that included the word “women”, such as “captain of the women’s chess team”, and demoted graduates of two women’s colleges. Amazon adjusted the algorithm to be neutral in this regard. However, the experts indicated that there were other ways of classifying candidates that could be discriminatory. For this reason, both human intervention and new professional capacities that analyse and program these tools are still necessary.
Just as sales automation tools like Salesforce didn’t make sales reps obsolete, a similar trajectory is anticipated for recruiters. The real challenge is how to improve employee talent and training. Only 38 per cent of companies offer training programmes for workers (Genpact, 2017). Technical skills such as coding, statistics, and applied mathematics remain very important, but “soft skills” such as adaptability, critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity are key factors in selection. Possibly, soft skills are the most complicated part to identify in the evaluation of candidates, as well as being the differentiating element between professionals with very similar technical profiles. If, for example, 1,000 resumes are received for a job, of which 25 are selected, the technical level will be very high and the selection of the candidates will be made based on their best suitability for the company. Therefore, a human profile with a clinical eye is necessary to obtain and interpret this non-visible information from the interviewee. A large number of companies do not have a selection “manual” that tells how and where to find candidates. Recruiters are examining the interviewee, interpreting and experimenting with their tools and skills according to their personal experience. However, the rapid evolution of technology will increasingly develop a combination of people and machines that offer decision-making support (Pin et al., 2020b).
The Candidate’s Perspective
Candidates and employees in general expect not only a job, but also a career that can be planned out. However, according to data from employment offices in the United States and Europe, the trend of decreasing time spent working at a company is growing strongly.
The last two generations, millennials, born between 1985 and 2000, and Gen Z (a.k.a. “centennials”), born after 2000, value, first of all, the activity they are going to carry out, knowing how their professional career is going to evolve, and what type of company they will work for – what their values and culture are (Stein et al., 2018). Unlike the baby boomer generation, born between 1945 and 1964, compensation is not a primary reason for leaving a job (Stein and Mesa, 2020). For millennials, if they are not having fun and learning by collaborating in dynamic environments equipped with new technologies, they will look for other career opportunities in companies that are “cool” or that have a well-defined employee brand or employer brand (McCracken et al., 2016). 
Younger candidates seek information one to two months before applying to a job (Basu et al., 2019), mainly on the company website, but also on LinkedIn, search engines, through contacts who work at the company, Human Resources departments, headhunters or employment portals such as Glassdoor, which allow employees or former employees to publish information about the company that could previously have been considered confidential. Information on how the selection processes are carried out, the difficulty level of the interviews, the salary range by job category, and the pros and cons of working for the company are publicly accessible. If the company does not proactively maintain its employer brand, its attractiveness to younger talent will decrease considerably. If faced with a poor assessment, the External Communications department will have to devise strategies such as publishing positive comments or clarifying the negative ones transparently and quickly.
Artificial Intelligence and Its Components
If the Human Resources department considers it necessary to make changes to their processes, they must know the basics of AI first-hand, the problems that arise when recruiting talent, the technologies available for each phase of the selection process, and the available and most affordable offering on the market.
The concept of artificial intelligence is very broad and includes several more-specific terms, such as: 

automated learning or machine learning
natural language processing 
deep learning
neural networks.

According to the definition by the Royal Spanish Academy (Real Academia Española), artificial intelligence is “the scientific discipline that deals with creating computer programs that execute operations comparable to those carried out by the human mind, such as learning or logical reasoning”.
Machine learning is a type of AI that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Natural language processing refers to the computer’s ability to understand human language as it is spoken. Natural language processing algorithms use machine learning to learn syntax rules by analysing large sets of examples.
Deep learning can be thought of as a series of machine learning decisions. The results of one decision inform the analysis of the next. The number of data processing layers required for the process is what inspired the term “deep”. To achieve a higher level of accuracy than machine learning can achieve, deep learning programs require access to vast amounts of training data and processing power.
A neural network is a hardware or software system inspired by the functioning of the human nervous system. The network is made up of a set of neurons connected to each other through a series of links.
To better understand how these technologies work, table 1 shows each of them, along with the type of tools, results and real examples of the use of AI in the selection and recruitment phase.

If the general adoption of AI by industry is analysed (see figure 1), the telecommunications, high tech and financial services sectors are the most prominent, although in the Human Resources area, the order varies slightly – the high tech, health systems and services, and telecommunications sectors are those which have a higher degree of automation (McKinsey & Company Survey, 2018). The main reason why high tech and telecommunications companies such as Google, Amazon, Telefónica, and Netflix use automated tools to a greater extent is the difficulty of finding and retaining highly qualified talent among profiles such as data scientists and developers. In the case of the health systems and services sector, the main factors are the progressive ageing of the population, which brings with it a greater burden for medical professionals, and the retirement of nurses, which is creating a large number of unfilled vacancies.

Sectors with a higher demand for profiles with AI skills include high tech, professional services, and financial services. The increased demand for these skills is associated with higher market capitalisation, greater cash holdings, and higher investment in R&D. All of this is consistent when combined with complementary investments in infrastructure, skills, and processes (Alekseeva et al., 2020).
AI Systems in Recruitment and Selection
Access to digital devices and the ease of applying for certain jobs has caused the volume of applications in relation to job offers to increase exponentially for all types of positions. Consequently, recruitment and selection offer a wide variety of opportunities for automation through AI technologies, from candidate screening to resume-to-job matching. In 2018, there were about 70 different technologies that could be used for recruiting automation. Two years later, there are countless. The AI systems that are having the greatest impact are those related to the adaptation of the candidate to the job, through the provision and analysis of data, the rediscovery of talents, facial recognition, the analysis of emotions, verbal communication and interaction, and chatbots or conversation bots (Eubanks, 2018).
The Suitability of the Candidate for the Job
There is empirical data that allows us to affirm that the closer Human Resources professionals get to making the decision, the more necessary it is for the human mind to help the system to filter the candidates in the applicant pool.
The suitability of the candidate for the job (candidate matching) has been verified historically through the identification of keywords that appear in the resume and that coincide with the job ad. However, it is necessary to make additional considerations that analyse the real abilities of the candidate. There are tools, such as video detection, that allow the recruiter to analyse the tone, the use of words and even eye contact. On the technical side, there are systems that quickly evaluate the candidate, for example in the application of a certain programming language associated with the position or in performing assessments. Resumes are stories of everyone’s professional experience told differently, which can hide certain skills that the human eye can detect. There is empirical data that allows us to affirm that the closer Human Resources professionals get to making the decision, the more necessary it is for the human mind to help the system to filter the candidates in the applicant pool.
An example of an assistant that provides information to the candidate about roles within the company that match their experience and skills is IBM Watson Candidate Assistant. Previously, the first contact between recruiters and candidates would be during the job interview. Nowadays, during the job search phase, the candidate can receive personalised advice from a chatbot that provides information to adjust and limit their search to specific roles. The result of this implementation has been a greater conversion of high-potential candidates to the roles offered by IBM. On average, the company receives 7,000 resumes daily and the use of new technology enables a search conversion of 36 per cent, compared to 12 per cent received by a traditional employment portal. In addition, it has been possible to reduce the hiring time by detecting the ideal candidates for the position more quickly.
Data Provision and Analysis
The provision and analysis of data allows access to a much larger number of candidates, whether they come directly from consulting companies or through the sourcing of external talent data, so that recruiters can contact them directly. 
The tools can be databases connected to the company, or external ones. An example is the intelligent search tools that use keywords to find candidates according to the needs of the company. Currently, the main database for companies is LinkedIn, which offers a wide range of candidates for recruiters and headhunters. The LinkedIn Recruiter Tool uses machine learning to improve the recommendation engine. One of the technologies employed in the product is candidate responsiveness, benefiting those who are most responsive. Some of the questions included in the algorithm are: How receptive has the candidate been when contacted by the recruiter on previous occasions? How responsive has the candidate been when being contacted by recruiters, companies, or industries? Is there any recent job search activity? Other companies that are developing selection algorithms are Google and Microsoft. In 2016, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella introduced Cortana’s AI integration with LinkedIn data, so that a conference or webinar organiser could plan content by getting to know their attendees better by visiting their profiles in this online professional network. Google, on the other hand, has developed the Job Search on Google product, implementing machine learning to improve the candidate’s experience during the job search. These are already almost “prehistoric” milestones in the sector.
However, machines can miss suitable candidates. For example, if you’re looking for software developers, you may be missing out on dozens of variations and specialities, such as front-end developer, software tester, or specialist in specific programming languages. Therefore, when the automated job search system has previously processed this type of job, it will have connected other skills or similar positions of the candidates through machine learning. This functionality may not be as useful for a senior recruiter with extensive recruiting experience, but for a junior profile it might be very helpful. Additionally, once the job listing is published, automated systems can automatically search for potential candidates and contact them directly with an automated message. This phase undertaken by a human being can require between eight and 30 hours for a given job, depending on how specialised it is. 
With IBM Watson Recruitment, the cognitive system increases recruiter efficiency by highlighting job priorities that demand the most attention. It works with applicant statistics or automatic qualification by analysing factors such as the length of experience in relevant roles, the size of the companies that hired them, and the prestige of the university degree.
Talent Rediscovery
The rediscovery of talent takes advantage of a database with valuable profiles that have already been registered. The advantage is that, after a few years, you can find emerging talent that has been trained in an area of interest. The reality is that there are a huge number of resumes that have been accumulated over the years in a company and that have not been reviewed. If, for example, a company has published 100 positions, there can easily be 25,000 candidacies that have not been analysed. Many of these profiles may be out of date, but there are AI systems that use algorithms that identify patterns of success in the selection process of candidates who were ultimately not selected. 
Rediscovering talent also means that all the candidates who have applied receive a response from the company. If virtual friendliness is maintained, potential candidates can be contacted again in the future. Eighty per cent of job applicants say they would not reapply to a company that did not notify them of their application status or did not give them a final response (Career Builder, 2018).
Facial Recognition 
Through algorithms, facial recognition tools provide recruiters with the ability to process the video content of the interview. One of the elements that the AI can recognise is whether the candidates are looking at the camera or reading a script. By observing the position of the eye and the direction in which it looks, the system can recognise cheating. Above all, it is useful for tests that the candidate performs from home, without the supervision of a recruiter. 
Another element is analysing the candidate’s micro-expressions. The momentary and involuntary expressions that appear on the human face can help robots identify the personality or thinking style of the person being interviewed. Furthermore, it helps the recruiter analyse the emotional reactions to each interview question, specifying how honest or enthusiastic the interviewee has been in their response. Companies such as Unilever already use this technology, and it has made it possible to interview a large number of candidates, which would not have been possible otherwise (see the Unilever case in the Exhibit). These systems are not only available to companies, they can also be used by candidates preparing for their interviews by providing predetermined questions, receiving reports on their facial expressions or personality styles and, by the same token, improve their performance in the final interview. 
The final assessment of the candidate by the AI system can be based on a comparison with the best-performing employees of the company. If, for example, a candidate applies for a sales manager position, their facial expressions will be compared to benchmarks in the sales area. This method ensures that the company’s performance level is maintained or even improved with the new talent (Schellmann and Bellini, 2018).
Verbal Communication and Interaction with AI
Automated chatbots or conversation bots would provide us with automated answers to user questions. The candidate could resolve questions about available job opportunities, possible professional careers, and advice on how to improve their own career. Fifty-eight per cent of job seekers are comfortable interacting with AI applications, and more than 60 per cent are happy to interact with chatbots to answer initial questions and schedule interviews with recruiters (Allegis Global, 2017). Candidate questions can be about salaries, job specifications, company information, the recruiting process, work culture and environment, chatbot-related information, or more general questions.
Another functionality that robots can provide is the analysis of elements such as the tone of voice or the set of words used. To do this, “smart” speakers can be integrated into meeting and work spaces to listen to conversations a posteriori and provide more thoughtful insights. What if the head of the HR team could listen to their employees’ interviews and then give them ideas on how to improve results? Would it improve talent acquisition?
Analysis of the Emotions and Personality of the Candidates
The analysis of emotions of the candidates allows analysis of large amounts of text and classifying it according to the disposition they show. The systems combine natural language processing with machine learning. The analysis can use unstructured texts from conversations, emails, and content that they have published on social media or on their website. If someone writes, for example: “I didn’t like my previous job because it didn’t allow me to develop my professional career,” the machine will associate it with negative feelings, whereas if they write, “Throughout my career I have worked with great teams,” it will be associated with a positive feeling. 
There are AI systems that compare the resume with the candidate’s social media, such as LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook, identifying personality traits that help recruiters make decisions about compatibility with the job or company culture (Schellmann and Bellini, 2018). 
The Potential Biases and Lack of Privacy of AI Systems
Algorithms and automated systems for candidates and companies can become black boxes whose inner workings are a mystery. When one of these services is contracted, it is necessary to understand how it works and what biases are associated with it, because it is the human mind that programs the algorithm and has it make automated decisions. 
AI systems can make the mistake of considering patterns of facial expressions that do not correspond or are not necessary for the job that candidates are looking for. Thus, the recruitment format is not able to select the employees who can best perform the job. Let’s take for example, the case of a young Korean who recently graduated from the University of Illinois and who had more than 30 interviews, of which almost half were conducted by a robot. He did not get past the first phase in any of them. However, he was hired as a junior credit analyst at a local bank in Chicago and, according to his boss, is one of the five best young people who have joined the bank in the 30 years of his professional experience (Schellmann and Bellini, 2018). A second element is the lack of privacy in this type of recording, so the employee or candidate must know what personal data is being used and give their prior consent. 
To effectively enjoy the benefits of automated hiring, a hybrid approach between human and machine should be established, followed by labour and administrative legislation in line with the changes in process automation. This requires collective bargaining to establish data collection standards that guarantee equal opportunities in employment (Ajunwa, forthcoming). 
Along these lines, in 2020 the European Commission published a white paper that contains the guidelines for regulating AI and eliminating possible bias, the suppression of dissent, and the lack of privacy. In it, the Commission recommends ensuring that AI systems are trained on representative data, that companies keep detailed documentation of how algorithms were developed, inform people when they are interacting with AI, and the need for human oversight of these systems (Chen, 2020). In some cities, such as New York City, a bill has even been introduced that governs the sale and use of any automated employment decision tool. Companies selling these AI systems must provide an annual bias audit to the buyer. Additionally, the bill requires recruiters to notify the candidate of the use of AI technology to assess their application within 30 business days (Forman et al., 2020). 
The Application of Automation in Everyday Business Affairs
There is a difference in salaries for vacancies that require AI and those that do not, with a salary increase of up to 51 per cent. In managerial positions, the highest salary premium is for those with this type of skill.
The main barriers or obstacles for companies (see figure 2) have to do with the lack of budget for investing in new technologies. The company must have sufficient cash and liquidity to assume not only the costs of the technologies, but also the training of professionals in skills to manage AI. The second concern is the lack of Human Resources professionals trained to use the systems. Leading tech companies such as Google and Amazon are vying to attract this scarce talent in light of this new latent demand. 
The general hiring trend has seen a large increase in the recruitment of AI-savvy personnel (see figure 3). In addition, there is a difference in salaries for vacancies that require AI and those that do not, with a salary increase of up to 51 per cent. In managerial positions, the highest salary premium is for those with this type of skill (Alekseeva et al., 2019).


Small and medium-sized companies have a harder time recruiting and training the necessary talent, so they are more reluctant to adopt new systems. The third reason is the lack of confidence that AI can achieve a considerable improvement in the areas of Human Resources, mainly because of the two previous reasons, but also due to a certain resistance to change in the organisation. Historically, personal intuition and experience have been the most reliable skills compared to machines or automated systems, due to their biases and, in many cases, they turn out to be black boxes for users, because they are unaware of their internal functioning (HR Research Institute, 2019).
Table 2 shows a method for identifying recruitment and selection areas that can be automated. When the Human Resources department thinks about inserting new AI systems, it has to ask questions like these: What tasks are executed most effectively 24/7? Which processes would be better for running on a large scale? What elements would benefit from being consistent? What would be possible, in selection and recruitment, if we go beyond our current limits? (Guenole and Feinzig, 2018).

In the area of recruitment, it would improve the identification of candidates that match job requirements and compile lists of qualified applicants. In the filtering area, it is expected to prioritise resumes and applications that most closely match the requirements of the position. In terms of interviews, the aim is to speed up the hiring process. In the selection area, it would be tasked with filtering resumes more efficiently, helping to adapt the skills and abilities of the candidates to the labour needs of the company, to carry out rapid training and insertion (HR Research Institute, 2019).
By using table 2, the reader can weigh up whether or not it is necessary to implement changes using new AI technologies in the Human Resources area of their company. The first column presents all the areas that concern the selection and recruitment phase. The next asks about the specific challenges in each area. The reader should ask relevant questions, analysing the problems or opportunities that, if solved, could generate significant value. The third column provides a practical application of what kind of AI systems can improve the development of each process and if there are companies that offer products on the market. A review of the available tools should be carried out. The fourth column serves to analyse the internal obstacles that exist within the organisation to implementing these systems, and the external obstacles caused by the legislative, cultural, economic, and political context. The last column invites a personal and complex analysis of the power and ability to influence the employee or senior manager within the organisation, the information available to them about the AI tools available on the market and the needs of the organisation, the individual and common interests in the Human Resources department and the rest of the company, and the type of relationship that can be established with other employees after the initiatives have been taken.
Summary
The incorporation of automated processes is a necessity for companies to save costs and time, and allow workers to carry out value-added activities. However, the recent pandemic has meant that, in most cases, companies do not have the financial resources and sufficient data available, nor the necessary talent to optimise processes with AI systems.
In the selection and recruitment area, the recruiter will not lose their job due to the appearance of machines that can automate certain tasks such as the analysis of resumes, but rather there will be a slow transition to new jobs that require new technological and personal skills. In general, younger candidates prioritise professional development and job content, so they will be more willing to train in these new technologies. But the company will also need to work on its employer brand to attract this type of talent.
AI has been developing at a global level more rapidly in the last decade, already being able to imitate, through neural networks, the functioning of the human brain and to learn by itself. The results in the selection and recruitment area have been the numerous tools that use AI to improve the candidate’s match with the job, provide better data analysis, rediscover new talent, facially recognise the candidate, analyse their emotions and communicate and interact verbally through chatbots or conversation bots.
However, these machines are still at an early stage of their development and make mistakes – just like humans – such as certain biases in data analysis, not properly recognising some facial expressions, or not responding appropriately to the needs of the person. European legislation and some cities have proposed a first attempt at regulation through greater transparency from vendors to customers about the operation of the algorithms’ black boxes. 
The potential of these systems is undeniable, although their development and accessibility may be more limited and unequal with respect to the entire business fabric. Large companies are already implementing these tools and increasingly automating their processes, which is why it is considered necessary for the Human Resources department and management in general to proactively weigh up the management challenges posed by AI systems and manage them properly – leading a future that has already arrived.
Final Considerations
Today, a digital maturity is needed, which is the same as always but updated, because becoming a digital organisation entails a tectonic movement in the activities of managers and professionals, in their individual behaviour and in how they relate to each other inside and outside the company.
Technology enables access to huge amounts of information about oneself and about others, and improves communication and contact in immediacy and frequency. Nevertheless, it would seem that, in general, the possibility of doing so does not serve to encourage knowing oneself, self-awareness, and, therefore, maturity. Today, a digital maturity is needed, which is the same as always but updated, because becoming a digital organisation entails a tectonic movement in the activities of managers and professionals, in their individual behaviour and in how they relate to each other inside and outside the company. It’s not just about having powerful AI tools to use with customers, processes, products, services, and (as described above) candidates. It is imperative to refine a culture at the level of digitisation that guides us in our process of approaching transformation.  
Exhibit
Unilever CaseUnilever is a world leader in consumer goods. The company’s products can be found in more than 190 countries. Its more than 400 brands meet the needs of its consumers in terms of personal and home care, food, and other goods. To meet the dynamic and changing demands of consumers, Unilever recognised the need to attract talent from around the world, specifically appealing to the millennial workforce. Melissa Gee Kee, CHRO & Global HR4HR Strategy Head, said: “Our executives expect 60 per cent of our workforce to be millennials by 2020. With this in mind, we needed to engage with this generation through innovative technology that is engaging, dynamic, and capable of moving quickly.” The Unilever team partnered with multiple solution suppliers to create a complete candidate experience using HireVue to initiate mobile-optimised, recorded video interviews along with interview evaluation technology. With HireVue Evaluation, the AI analysed the candidates’ recorded interviews to filter out up to 80 per cent of them. The proprietary algorithm analyses the most likely to be successful at Unilever based on interview attributes such as facial expressions, body language, and word choice, which have been shown to be predictive of job success. Unilever has implemented this recruitment process in 53 countries in multiple languages, and over 80 per cent of candidate feedback is positive. The process not only improved the candidate experience, but it also saved the company over 50,000 hours, providing Unilever with substantial gains. In just one year, the Unilever team saved over £1 million, cut recruitment time by 75 per cent, and hired the most gender and ethnically diverse workforce to date.

“A significant portion of the workforce could be facing displacement as artificial intelligence gains complexity and popularity”–Paul Ebeling
Technology advancements are being used to help people work more productively, to improve the lives of individuals, to make certain tasks faster and more convenient, and even to save lives.
To business leaders, the prospect of artificial intelligence is thrilling. Robots can be faster and more efficient than workers, and though they might require some upkeep; AI tools tend to be much more affordable than human employees. 
Considering that AI solutions are becoming proficient at several “human” jobs, some futurist executives are looking forward to a time when most of their workforce consists of smart computers.
Yet, most AI experts claim that this future vision will never come. Instead of replacing human intelligence with artificial intelligence, workplaces will rely on a brand-new way of processing information and making decisions called collaborative intelligence.
There are less than 5% of occupations we automate entirely, but around 60% of occupations could have at least 30% of their tasks automated, and that number is likely to grow over the next 15 yrs. Thus, a significant portion of the workforce could be facing displacement as artificial intelligence gains complexity and popularity.
Most organizations see significant benefits in replacing human workers with machines, but these benefits hide serious downsides. Though machines might be more efficient and cost less than a human employee, existing AI solutions have narrow applications and are nearly impossible to adapt to new tasks or inputs. Thus, more significant changes in business strategy might require an AI overhaul, which could be more time-consuming and more expensive than assigning new responsibilities to a human workforce.
To harness the advantages of AI without succumbing to the disadvantages of non-human staff; businesses need to avoid displacement as much as possible and instead utilize collaborative intelligence.
Collaborative intelligence is merging the strengths of a human workforce with the strengths of AI. The goal of collaborative intelligence is to design human positions to best augment the capabilities of AI tools and systems and vice versa. 
In a collaborative intelligence model, human employees have three crucial roles; train intelligent machines, explain the outcomes of AI efforts and sustain the responsible use of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, AI has three functions: to amplify cognition, extend physical capabilities, and free humans for higher-level tasks. Humans and machines come to rely on one another, and the business sees only benefits from adopting AI.
Organizations should cultivate a workforce with the skills to integrate with AI machines seamlessly. Learning to delegate tasks to AI can take time; learning to navigate AI interfaces and decipher the results of AI efforts. Business leaders should train their current workforce and onboard new employees who have experience collaborating with AI.
Artificial intelligence is a promising technological development for business productivity; it should not be expected to do all the work of human employees. 
By envisioning a future based on collaborative intelligence, businesses can radically improve productivity and quality without compromising on any aspect of their operations.
Have a prosperous day, Keep the Faith!

According to some of the more gushing media accounts and press releases, OpenAI's DALL-E 2 can seemingly create spectacular images from any text; another OpenAI system called GPT-3 can talk about just about anything—and even write about itself; and a system called Gato that was released in May by DeepMind, a division of Alphabet, reportedly worked well on every task the company could throw at it. One of DeepMind's high-level executives even went so far as to brag that in the quest to create AI that has the flexibility and resourcefulness of human intelligence—known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI—“the game is over.”Don't be fooled. Machines may someday be as smart as people and perhaps even smarter, but the game is far from over. There is still an immense amount of work to be done in making machines that truly can comprehend and reason about the world around them. What we need right now is less posturing and more basic research.AI is making progress—synthetic images look more and more realistic, and speech recognition can often work in noisy environments—but we are still likely decades away from general-purpose, human-level AI that can understand the true meanings of articles and videos or deal with unexpected obstacles and interruptions. The field is stuck on precisely the same challenges that academic scientists (including myself) having been pointing out for years: getting AI to be reliable and getting it to cope with unusual circumstances.

Take the recently celebrated Gato, an alleged jack of all trades, and how it captioned an image of a pitcher hurling a baseball (above). The system's top three guesses were:A baseball player pitching a ball on top of a baseball field.
 
A man throwing a baseball at a pitcher on a baseball field.

 A baseball player at bat and a catcher in the dirt during a baseball game.The first response is correct, but the other two answers include hallucinations of other players that aren't seen in the image. The system has no idea what is actually in the picture, beyond the rough approximations it draws from statistical similarities to other images. Any baseball fan would recognize that this is a pitcher who has just thrown the ball and not the other way around. And although we expect that a catcher and a batter are nearby, they obviously do not appear in the image.Likewise, DALL-E 2 couldn't tell the difference between an image of a red cube on top of a blue cube versus an image of a blue cube on top of a red cube. A newer system, released this past May, couldn't tell the difference between an astronaut riding a horse and a horse riding an astronaut.

Expert Players Don’t Always Use ItJack MurtaghCan One Chatbot Catch Another’s Lies?Max SpringerWhen image-creating systems like DALL-E 2 make mistakes, the result can be amusing. But sometimes errors produced by AI cause serious consequences. A Tesla on autopilot recently drove directly toward a human worker carrying a stop sign in the middle of the road, slowing down only when the human driver intervened. The system could recognize humans on their own (which is how they appeared in the training data) and stop signs in their usual locations (as they appeared in the training images) but failed to slow down when confronted by the unfamiliar combination of the two, which put the stop sign in a new and unusual position.Unfortunately, the fact that these systems still fail to work reliably and struggle with novel circumstances is usually buried in the fine print. Gato, for instance, worked well on all the tasks DeepMind reported but rarely as well as other contemporary systems. GPT-3 often creates fluent prose but struggles with basic arithmetic and has so little grip on reality it is prone to creating sentences such as “Some experts believe that the act of eating a sock helps the brain to come out of its altered state as a result of meditation.” A cursory look at recent headlines, however, wouldn't tell you about any of these problems.The subplot here is that the biggest teams of researchers in AI are no longer to be found in the academy, where peer review was the coin of the realm, but in corporations. And corporations, unlike universities, have no incentive to play fair. Rather than submitting their splashy new papers to academic scrutiny, they have taken to publication by press release, seducing journalists and sidestepping the peer-review process. We know only what the companies want us to know.In the software industry, there's a word for this kind of strategy: “demoware,” software designed to look good for a demo but not necessarily good enough for the real world. Often demoware becomes vaporware, announced for shock and awe to discourage competitors but never released at all.Chickens do tend to come home to roost, though, eventually. Cold fusion may have sounded great, but you still can't get it at the mall. AI will likely experience a winter of deflated expectations. Too many products, like driverless cars, automated radiologists and all-purpose digital agents, have been demoed, publicized—and never delivered. For now the investment dollars keep coming in on promise (who wouldn't like a self-driving car?). But if the core problems of unreliability and failure to cope with outliers are not resolved, investment will dry up. We may get solid advances in machine translation and speech and object recognition but too little else to show for all the premature hype. Instead of “smart” cities and “democratized” health care, we will be left with destructive deepfakes and energy-sucking networks that emit immense amounts of carbon.Although deep learning has advanced the ability of machines to recognize patterns in data, it has three major flaws. The patterns that it learns are, ironically, superficial not conceptual; the results it creates are hard to interpret; and the results are difficult to use in the context of other processes, such as memory and reasoning. As Harvard University computer scientist Les Valiant noted, “The central challenge [going forward] is to unify the formulation of ... learning and reasoning.” You can't deal with a person carrying a stop sign if you don't really understand what a stop sign even is.For now we are trapped in a “local minimum” in which companies pursue benchmarks rather than foundational ideas. Current engineering practice is far ahead of scientific skills: these departments focus on eking out small improvements with the poorly understood tools they already have rather than developing new technologies with a clearer theoretical ground. This is why basic research remains crucial. That a large part of the AI research community (like those who shout, “Game over”) doesn't even see that is, well, heartbreaking.Imagine if some extraterrestrial studied all human interaction only by looking down at shadows on the ground, noticing, to its credit, that some are bigger than others and that all shadows disappear at night. Maybe it would even notice that the shadows regularly grew and shrank at certain periodic intervals—without ever looking up to see the sun or recognizing the 3-D world above.It's time for artificial-intelligence researchers to look up from the flashy, straight-to-the-media demos and ask fundamental questions about how to build systems that can learn and reason at the same time.Rights & PermissionsFROM OUR ARCHIVES

Google recently released an artificial intelligence (AI)-based preparation tool that helps job seekers prepare better for interviews. The tool, called Interview WarmupOpens a new window , boasts of having the only tried-and-true method of getting better at answering interview questions.
How Interview Warmup Works
The Google tool starts by asking a few familiar interview questions, like “Can you please tell me a bit about yourself?” and “Please tell me why you would be a good fit for this role?” It also asks questions about previous work experience, how the candidate handles certain situations and skill-specific questions about certain jobs. The tool currently supports skill-specific questions related to ecommerce, data analytics, IT support, project management, user experience, and roles stemming from Google Career Certificates program. The questions on the tool are selected by industry experts.

Once the job seeker answers a question, the tool transcribes it in real-time and provides feedback using machine learning. Besides this, the tool’s machine learning also identifies certain job-related terms and phrases that are overused and generates common “talking points” to improve responses. The transcripts and audio from the mock interviews are not saved. However, job candidates can copy or download these transcripts.

According to Jesse HainesOpens a new window , director, Grow with Google initiative in the U.S., “Interviewing in a new field can be hard, especially if you don’t have access to friends, family or mentors in the field who can help you practice and prepare. Preparing for interviews will always take a lot of work, but we hope this tool can make it a little easier for anyone to become more confident and grow comfortable with interviewing.” She further said, “You can see how much time you spend talking about areas like your experience, skills and goals. Your responses aren’t graded or judged, and you can answer questions as many times as you want. It’s your own private space to practice, prepare and get comfortable.”
Tool Receives Appreciation and Some Caution
The free-to-use tool has received appreciation from a few industry players and organizations. For example, Chris Russell, managing director, RecTech Media, said, “Anything that helps you practice interviewing is a good idea. The ability to practice even when you can’t find another person is the main draw. It also helps you craft better responses based on feedback.” 
Carolyn Kleiman, a career coach and resume consultant, ResumeBuilder.com and a senior career counselor at George Mason University, saidOpens a new window , “Other products typically offer a recording of the practice session, which is then either sent to someone who reviews it and provides feedback or to the user for self-evaluation. These tools can also be helpful, but Interview Warmup breaks down your answer and lets you know what is good and why and what could be improved, all on its own. The feedback is also nonjudgmental and unbiased, something you won’t get practicing with another person.” 
Another big advantage, according to industry players, is that the tool allows job seekers to practice as much as they want without bothering others. This can reduce anxiety.
That said, experts also recommend candidates practice in front of others. According to them, at this point, only a human can analyze a person’s presentation skills, cues, and ability to improvise based on in-person interactions. Technology also lacks the level of connection humans can provide. Further, tools cannot generate follow-up questions based on a candidate’s response.
“At some point, you will need to prepare with an actual human. The person’s feedback is subjective, but that subjectivity may be an advantage to the job seeker. Until then, using whatever tools and techniques you can to build your interviewing skills to be able to interview in person is important,” Kleiman said.

What This Could Mean to the Future of Interviews
Industry players believe that the tool heralds the beginning of AI tools in interview prep. Russell also believes it is a glimpse into the future where robot recruiters will conduct application screenings. He says, “A robot will call you, ask some basic questions and provide some feedback. It will then make the decision to move you into the hiring funnel.” 
That said, LinkedIn had already added an AI-based instant feedback featureOpens a new window  to its interview preparation tool in 2020. The feature would provide feedback on pacing, the frequency of filler words, and a few phrases to avoid. It further makes it possible to request feedback on the responses from the job seeker’s connections.
Hence, as we go forward, we may see more AI interview preparation tools with advanced features being released into the market.

AI for Medical Imaging Boosts Cancer Screenings with Provider Aid


New research shows that a decision-referral approach in which radiologists and artificial intelligence work together for breast cancer screening is better than either’s performance alone.

Published: 05 Jul 2022


 
A study published in The Lancet Digital Health this month highlights how a decision-referral approach, in which radiologists work with artificial intelligence (AI) models to evaluate breast cancer screenings, achieves better results than clinicians or algorithms would have alone.







The researchers note that the rise of AI use in medical imaging has spurred significant research into the development of accurate cancer screening algorithms. Some studies suggest that AI performs on par with clinicians in terms of image interpretation, but more evidence is needed in areas such as breast cancer screening. Other research further suggests that combining the strengths of radiologists and AI leads to improved screening accuracy, but this area also requires more research.
To add to these areas of medical research, the study’s authors set out to evaluate the performance of an AI, a radiologist, and the two together when tasked with breast cancer screening. To develop the AI model, the researchers used a retrospective dataset consisting of 1,193,197 full field, digital mammography studies carried out between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2020. These mammograms were sourced from 453,104 patients at eight separate screening centers in Germany.
Data from six of the sites were used for model development and internal testing, and the data from the other two were used for model validation and external testing. The internal-test dataset consisted of 1,670 screen-detected cancers and 19,997 normal mammography exams, while the external-test dataset contained 2,793 screen-detected cancers and 80,058 normal exams. Labels used by the model to classify the images were derived from annotations of radiological findings and biopsy information.
Following model development, the researchers simulated a scenario in which the AI classified each image as normal or suspicious for cancer. As the model classified the images, it also gave an indication of its confidence on its classification. Any images deemed suspicious or that the AI was unconfident about were referred to the radiologist without any indications of the AI’s classification of the images.
By structuring the simulation in this way, the researchers could evaluate sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection in a scenario that mirrors how the AI would be used in a clinical setting. In the clinical setting, an AI’s predictions that were both labelled as normal and confident would not need to be shown to the radiologist for further consideration. However, those that were labelled as suspicious or unconfident would receive final classification from a radiologist.
On its own, the AI model achieved a sensitivity of 84.2 percent and a specificity of 89.5 percent on internal-test data, and a sensitivity of 84.6 percent and a specificity of 91.3 percent on external-test data. The radiologist achieved a sensitivity of 85.7 percent and a specificity of 93.4 percent on the internal-test dataset, and a sensitivity of 87.2 percent and a specificity of 93.4 percent on the external-test dataset.
The radiologist alone outperformed the AI, but the combined decision-referral approach that relied on both the clinician and the model achieved the highest performance, significantly improving the specificity and sensitivity scores.
These findings indicate that leveraging the combined strengths of AI and radiologists surpasses either’s performance alone. Because of this, the researchers posit, their decision-referral approach has the potential to improve the screening accuracy of radiologists, is adaptive to the requirements of screening, and could allow for the reduction of radiologist workload without sacrificing their expertise.

Biogen will provide educational content about its therapies for Happify Health's Kopa app and website to support people with multiple sclerosis. (Happify Health)
Biogen is joining forces with digital health startup Happify Health to help support multiple sclerosis patients through the tech company’s AI-powered online care community Kopa.Biogen, a major player in the MS space, will provide educational content about its therapies for the Kopa app and website, which aim to support people with MS throughout their care journey, Jason Hawbecker, Biogen’s head of strategic partnerships, told Fierce Pharma Marketing in an interview.The platform offers a place where patients at any stage of MS can learn about treatment options, ask questions and discuss their physical and mental health with experts and others living with the disease, according to the companies. What’s different, said Hawbecker, is that Happify uses artificial intelligence to learn more about patients to personalize that support.A patient who spends a lot of time on the Kopa platform reading articles and chatting with peers about drug side effects, for instance, might be served up content about how best to manage those symptoms, Hawbecker explained. RelatedRoche keeps an eye on MS diversity with latest awareness workBiogen markets several drugs for relapsing MS, including its blockbuster pill Tecfidera and its follow-up Vumerity along with infusion treatment Tysabri and injectables Plegridy and Avonex. Helping patients stay up-to-date with the latest treatment advances and adhere to their medication regimens are among the goals of the site.“Sometimes, an intervention at the right moment is really important,” Hawbecker said. MS is the third disease area to be served by the Kopa platform, which Happify launched for psoriasis patients in July 2020 and expanded to include women’s health last summer.Hawbecker, who previously led strategic partnerships at CVS Health, said Biogen pursued the collaboration as part of its strategy to “meet patients where they are in the community.”“The patients are going to these places [such as Kopa], and they trust these communities,” he said. “We want to be there to support that.”

RelatedAlmirall enlists Happify to boost psoriasis patients' mental health with digital therapeuticsAlthough Biogen is Happify’s first pharma partner on Kopa, it is not the first drug company to work with the tech startup. In 2019, Happify teamed with Sanofi to work on a digital therapeutic to improve mental health in MS patients. And last year, it partnered with Spanish pharma Almirall on a digital wellness program for psoriasis called Claro, which it launched earlier this month in Spain, Italy and the U.K.Happify raised $73 million in a series D round last year, which it said it would use to build out more specialized solutions for pharmaceutical companies, enterprise customers and health plans.The New York City-based company says it combines digital therapeutics and care delivery solutions to help manage chronic conditions and aims to improve both mental and physical health.The partnership is Biogen’s latest foray into the digital health space. In May, it announced it was working with MedRhythms to employ a music-based digital therapeutic to improve the strides of MS patients who have trouble walking.

What does it all add up to? A few years ago, a company called OpenAI fed a good deal of those images, along with text descriptions, into the neural network of an artificial intelligence named DALL-E. DALL-E was being trained to create original art of its own, in any style, depicting in uncanny detail almost anything desired, based on written prompts. But a mastery of the entire universe of human imagery makes for difficult choices. How do you decide what DALL-E should create? After careful deliberation, one of the first images that OpenAI prompted was a doughnut made of porcupine quills.“a real hippopotamus sitting on a sofa smoking a cigarette, 70mm Nikon,” as prompted by Roz Chast.Art work by DALL-E / Courtesy OpenAI“There was this belief that creativity is this deeply special, only-human thing,” Sam Altman, OpenAI’s C.E.O., explained the other day. Maybe not so true anymore, he said. Altman, who wore a gray sweater and had tousled brown hair, was videoconferencing from the company’s headquarters, in San Francisco. DALL-E is still in a testing phase. So far, OpenAI has granted access to a select group of people—researchers, artists, developers—who have used it to produce a wide array of images: photorealistic animals, bizarre mashups, punny collages. Asked by a user to generate “a plate of various alien fruits from another planet, photograph,” DALL-E returned something kind of like rambutans. “The rest of mona lisa” is, according to DALL-E, mostly just one big cliff. Altman described DALL-E as “an extension of your own creativity.”“octopus riding the subway,” as prompted by Roz Chast.Art work by DALL-E / Courtesy OpenAI“octopus doctor performing brain surgery, 65mm lens Kodachrome,” as prompted by Roz Chast.Art work by DALL-E / Courtesy OpenAIFor the more than a million people on DALL-E’s wait list, the only way to extend their creativity is to slide into the A.I.’s Instagram D.M.s with a request. The company launched the account, @openaidalle, in April. “I was worried that maybe it would take more of an explanation to get people engaged,” Natalie Summers, who runs the account for OpenAI, said, from a conference room near Altman. “And it did not.” @openaidalle now has almost two hundred thousand followers. It’s Summers’s job to read through the messages and choose the best of the best. “If I did every single thing that people asked, we would have a lot of raccoons and sloths,” she said. Hits have included “cheeseburger lamp,” “emotional baggage” (suitcases with sad faces), and “attractive dinosaur in a tuxedo, looking at himself in a mirror and seeing his reflection, digital art,” which DALL-E endowed with human-proportioned arms to aid in its hotness. Reviews have been of the mind-blown variety. “I’m gonna lose me job,” one commenter, whose profile said they were a graphic designer, posted, below an image of polymer-clay dragons eating pizza on a boat.To sift through the latest requests, Summers, who wore dangling earrings and a jean jacket, videoconferenced with DALL-E’s product manager, Joanne Jang, and with a member of the technical staff, Aditya Ramesh. Ramesh was responsible for DALL-E’s name; it came to him in the shower. “Some people got it immediately,” he said. “Other people I had to explain that it’s a portmanteau.”“a very sad parakeet in a ball gown in the style of John Singer Sargent,” as prompted by Roz Chast.Art work by DALL-E / Courtesy OpenAI“cartoon t-rex ‘african grey parrot’ monster, photograph 70mm,” as prompted by Roz Chast.Art work by DALL-E / Courtesy OpenAIThere are rules for requesters. Images of public figures are off limits, as is anything remotely offensive, including nudity and violence. Political campaigning is forbidden. “We are worried about deepfakes,” Summers said. Recently, a researcher named Boris Dayma developed a low-fi copycat, called DALL-E Mini, which went viral. Users were permitted to submit prompts like “Ice T in a glass of iced tea” and “Babies fist fighting,” though the output is sometimes eerie: Ice-T’s face appears to be melting; the babies look like zombies. At OpenAI’s request, DALL-E Mini was renamed Craiyon.

Maybe not so true anymore, he said. Altman, who wore a gray sweater and had tousled brown hair, was videoconferencing from the company’s headquarters, in San Francisco. DALL-E is still in a testing phase. So far, OpenAI has granted access to a select group of people—researchers, artists, developers—who have used it to produce a wide array of images: photorealistic animals, bizarre mashups, punny collages. Asked by a user to generate “a plate of various alien fruits from another planet, photograph,” DALL-E returned something kind of like rambutans. “The rest of mona lisa” is, according to DALL-E, mostly just one big cliff. Altman described DALL-E as “an extension of your own creativity.”
For the more than a million people on DALL-E’s wait list, the only way to extend their creativity is to slide into the A.I.’s Instagram D.M.s with a request. The company launched the account, @openaidalle, in April. “I was worried that maybe it would take more of an explanation to get people engaged,” Natalie Summers, who runs the account for OpenAI, said, from a conference room near Altman. “And it did not.” @openaidalle now has almost two hundred thousand followers. It’s Summers’s job to read through the messages and choose the best of the best. “If I did every single thing that people asked, we would have a lot of raccoons and sloths,” she said. Hits have included “cheeseburger lamp,” “emotional baggage” (suitcases with sad faces), and “attractive dinosaur in a tuxedo, looking at himself in a mirror and seeing his reflection, digital art,” which DALL-E endowed with human-proportioned arms to aid in its hotness. Reviews have been of the mind-blown variety. “I’m gonna lose me job,” one commenter, whose profile said they were a graphic designer, posted, below an image of polymer-clay dragons eating pizza on a boat.
To sift through the latest requests, Summers, who wore dangling earrings and a jean jacket, videoconferenced with DALL-E’s product manager, Joanne Jang, and with a member of the technical staff, Aditya Ramesh. Ramesh was responsible for DALL-E’s name; it came to him in the shower. “Some people got it immediately,” he said. “Other people I had to explain that it’s a portmanteau.”
There are rules for requesters. Images of public figures are off limits, as is anything remotely offensive, including nudity and violence. Political campaigning is forbidden. “We are worried about deepfakes,” Summers said. Recently, a researcher named Boris Dayma developed a low-fi copycat, called DALL-E Mini, which went viral. Users were permitted to submit prompts like “Ice T in a glass of iced tea” and “Babies fist fighting,” though the output is sometimes eerie: Ice-T’s face appears to be melting; the babies look like zombies. At OpenAI’s request, DALL-E Mini was renamed Craiyon. (“There has been a lot of confusion,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.)

It is also altering the way cloud security services are delivered. Security experts are turning to artificial intelligence as a way to help them protect against cyber attacks. AI can help identify threats and automate the process of reacting to them..In this article, we will explore how artificial intelligence is changing cloud security services and what this means for businesses..What Is Artificial Intelligence and What Are Its Benefits for Cloud Security Services?.In a nutshell, AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as decision-making and pattern recognition. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP)..The benefits of using AI for cloud security services include:.Identification of threats that would otherwise go undetected.Automatization of the process of responding to threats.Improvement of the efficiency of security operations.Ability to reduce the cost of security operations..How to Choose a Cloud Security Service Provider?.When choosing a cloud security service provider, it's important to consider their experience in deploying and managing AI-based solutions.It is also essential to look for a provider that has a team of experts. They must be able to help you implement an AI-based solution that meets your specific needs.Don't forget to consider your budget and choose the one you can afford. You also want to make sure that you are getting value for your money. You should choose a provider that offers a money-back guarantee in case you're not satisfied with their services..TRE Group offers a free consultation to help you determine which of their services is right for you..How Can Artificial Intelligence Help to Detect and Prevent Cyber Attacks From Happening?.Cyber-attacks are becoming more advanced and difficult to detect, making it essential for businesses to have strong cybersecurity measures in place. However, there are some ways how AI can change and improve cloud security services..AI can help to identify patterns in data that may indicate an attempted cyber-attack. For example, if there is a sudden spike in activity from a particular IP address, AI can flag this as suspicious and trigger an investigation.AI can also be used to monitor employee behavior. If an employee suddenly starts accessing sensitive data that they don't normally work with, this could be a sign that they are trying to steal company information.Additionally, you can use AI to create virtual firewalls that can block traffic from known malicious IP addresses. This can help to stop cyber-attacks before they even reach your network..What Is Automated Response Work and How Can It Benefit Businesses?.An automated response is a process whereby a computer system is able to automatically respond to a cyber-attack. This can be done by identifying the attack and then taking action to neutralize it..The automated response can benefit businesses by reducing the amount of time that is spent responding to an attack, as well as reducing the cost of response. The automated response can also help to prevent future attacks by providing a record of what happened during an attack..Are There Any Risks Associated With Using Artificial Intelligence for Cloud Security Services?.Though cloud security services that use artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly popular, there are some risks associated with this technology..One worry is that AI could give cyber criminals new ways to attack systems. For example, if a criminal can develop a program that can mimic human behavior, they might be able to bypass security measures that are designed to detect malicious activity.Another concern is that AI-powered security systems might make mistakes and block legitimate users from accessing data or resources. This could cause serious problems for businesses that rely on the cloud for critical operations.Finally, there is the risk that cyber criminals could use AI to create 'backdoors' into systems, giving them undetected access to sensitive data..While these risks are real, it's important to remember that AI-based security systems also have the potential to greatly improve the safety of data stored in the cloud..How does Will Artificial Intelligence continue to Change the Way Cloud Security Services Are Delivered in the Future?.Artificial intelligence is likely to continue to change the way cloud security services are delivered in the future. AI-based systems are becoming more advanced and can identify more sophisticated threats. They are also becoming more widely available and affordable, which means that more businesses will be able to benefit from them..In the future, AI is likely to play an even more important role in helping businesses to protect their data and applications from cyber-attacks..Final Thoughts.Cloud security services that use artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly popular. AI-based systems can identify more sophisticated threats and are becoming more widely available and affordable..By taking the time to understand how AI can benefit your business, you can be sure that you're choosing a cloud security service provider that can help to keep your data safe..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

About a decade ago, deep-learning models started achieving superhuman results on all sorts of tasks, from beating world-champion board game players to outperforming doctors at diagnosing breast cancer.

These powerful deep-learning models are usually based on artificial neural networks, which were first proposed in the 1940s and have become a popular type of machine learning. A computer learns to process data using layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that mimic the human brain. 

As the field of machine learning has grown, artificial neural networks have grown along with it.

Deep-learning models are now often composed of millions or billions of interconnected nodes in many layers that are trained to perform detection or classification tasks using vast amounts of data. But because the models are so enormously complex, even the researchers who design them don’t fully understand how they work. This makes it hard to know whether they are working correctly.

For instance, maybe a model designed to help physicians diagnose patients correctly predicted that a skin lesion was cancerous, but it did so by focusing on an unrelated mark that happens to frequently occur when there is cancerous tissue in a photo, rather than on the cancerous tissue itself. This is known as a spurious correlation. The model gets the prediction right, but it does so for the wrong reason. In a real clinical setting where the mark does not appear on cancer-positive images, it could result in missed diagnoses.

With so much uncertainty swirling around these so-called “black-box” models, how can one unravel what’s going on inside the box?

This puzzle has led to a new and rapidly growing area of study in which researchers develop and test explanation methods (also called interpretability methods) that seek to shed some light on how black-box machine-learning models make predictions.

What are explanation methods?

At their most basic level, explanation methods are either global or local. A local explanation method focuses on explaining how the model made one specific prediction, while global explanations seek to describe the overall behavior of an entire model. This is often done by developing a separate, simpler (and hopefully understandable) model that mimics the larger, black-box model.

But because deep learning models work in fundamentally complex and nonlinear ways, developing an effective global explanation model is particularly challenging. This has led researchers to turn much of their recent focus onto local explanation methods instead, explains Yilun Zhou, a graduate student in the Interactive Robotics Group of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) who studies models, algorithms, and evaluations in interpretable machine learning.

The most popular types of local explanation methods fall into three broad categories.

The first and most widely used type of explanation method is known as feature attribution. Feature attribution methods show which features were most important when the model made a specific decision.

Features are the input variables that are fed to a machine-learning model and used in its prediction. When the data are tabular, features are drawn from the columns in a dataset (they are transformed using a variety of techniques so the model can process the raw data). For image-processing tasks, on the other hand, every pixel in an image is a feature. If a model predicts that an X-ray image shows cancer, for instance, the feature attribution method would highlight the pixels in that specific X-ray that were most important for the model’s prediction.

Essentially, feature attribution methods show what the model pays the most attention to when it makes a prediction.

“Using this feature attribution explanation, you can check to see whether a spurious correlation is a concern. For instance, it will show if the pixels in a watermark are highlighted or if the pixels in an actual tumor are highlighted,” says Zhou.

A second type of explanation method is known as a counterfactual explanation. Given an input and a model’s prediction, these methods show how to change that input so it falls into another class. For instance, if a machine-learning model predicts that a borrower would be denied a loan, the counterfactual explanation shows what factors need to change so her loan application is accepted. Perhaps her credit score or income, both features used in the model’s prediction, need to be higher for her to be approved.

“The good thing about this explanation method is it tells you exactly how you need to change the input to flip the decision, which could have practical usage. For someone who is applying for a mortgage and didn’t get it, this explanation would tell them what they need to do to achieve their desired outcome,” he says.

The third category of explanation methods are known as sample importance explanations. Unlike the others, this method requires access to the data that were used to train the model.

A sample importance explanation will show which training sample a model relied on most when it made a specific prediction; ideally, this is the most similar sample to the input data. This type of explanation is particularly useful if one observes a seemingly irrational prediction. There may have been a data entry error that affected a particular sample that was used to train the model. With this knowledge, one could fix that sample and retrain the model to improve its accuracy.

How are explanation methods used?

One motivation for developing these explanations is to perform quality assurance and debug the model. With more understanding of how features impact a model’s decision, for instance, one could identify that a model is working incorrectly and intervene to fix the problem, or toss the model out and start over.

Another, more recent, area of research is exploring the use of machine-learning models to discover scientific patterns that humans haven’t uncovered before. For instance, a cancer diagnosing model that outperforms clinicians could be faulty, or it could actually be picking up on some hidden patterns in an X-ray image that represent an early pathological pathway for cancer that were either unknown to human doctors or thought to be irrelevant, Zhou says.

It's still very early days for that area of research, however.

Words of warning

While explanation methods can sometimes be useful for machine-learning practitioners when they are trying to catch bugs in their models or understand the inner-workings of a system, end-users should proceed with caution when trying to use them in practice, says Marzyeh Ghassemi, an assistant professor and head of the Healthy ML Group in CSAIL.

As machine learning has been adopted in more disciplines, from health care to education, explanation methods are being used to help decision makers better understand a model’s predictions so they know when to trust the model and use its guidance in practice. But Ghassemi warns against using these methods in that way.

“We have found that explanations make people, both experts and nonexperts, overconfident in the ability or the advice of a specific recommendation system. I think it is very important for humans not to turn off that internal circuitry asking, ‘let me question the advice that I am
given,’” she says.

Scientists know explanations make people over-confident based on other recent work, she adds, citing some recent studies by Microsoft researchers.

Far from a silver bullet, explanation methods have their share of problems. For one, Ghassemi’s recent research has shown that explanation methods can perpetuate biases and lead to worse outcomes for people from disadvantaged groups.

Another pitfall of explanation methods is that it is often impossible to tell if the explanation method is correct in the first place. One would need to compare the explanations to the actual model, but since the user doesn’t know how the model works, this is circular logic, Zhou says.

He and other researchers are working on improving explanation methods so they are more faithful to the actual model’s predictions, but Zhou cautions that, even the best explanation should be taken with a grain of salt.

“In addition, people generally perceive these models to be human-like decision makers, and we are prone to overgeneralization. We need to calm people down and hold them back to really make sure that the generalized model understanding they build from these local explanations are balanced,” he adds.

Zhou’s most recent research seeks to do just that.

What’s next for machine-learning explanation methods?

Rather than focusing on providing explanations, Ghassemi argues that more effort needs to be done by the research community to study how information is presented to decision makers so they understand it, and more regulation needs to be put in place to ensure machine-learning models are used responsibly in practice. Better explanation methods alone aren’t the answer.

“I have been excited to see that there is a lot more recognition, even in industry, that we can’t just take this information and make a pretty dashboard and assume people will perform better with that. You need to have measurable improvements in action, and I’m hoping that leads to real guidelines about improving the way we display information in these deeply technical fields, like medicine,” she says.

And in addition to new work focused on improving explanations, Zhou expects to see more research related to explanation methods for specific use cases, such as model debugging, scientific discovery, fairness auditing, and safety assurance. By identifying fine-grained characteristics of explanation methods and the requirements of different use cases, researchers could establish a theory that would match explanations with specific scenarios, which could help overcome some of the pitfalls that come from using them in real-world scenarios.

Many companies are adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to drive strategic decisions or introduce new business models. According to a global McKinsey study, 56 percent of all respondents report AI adoption in at least one function in 2021, up from 50 percent in the previous year.
Whether your company is just getting started in its AI journey or you are leveraging it across multiple business functions, there are numerous competitive advantages to gain from improved employee experience, deeper customer insight, and enhanced business functions.
Human-first AI
Many companies starting out in AI make the mistake of focusing too early on which AI technologies to use or which data to collect. In reality, your people are the key to a successful AI program. The people in your business must understand the KPIs that are important and how to collect the right kind of data. Using this, data scientists can make use of AI tools to provide business insights and predictions.
One of AI's biggest challenges today is the potential for systems to introduce bias because the teams that built them were not sufficiently diverse. AI systems rely on data and inputs and diverse AI teams are necessary to avoid bias.
[ Check out our primer on 10 key artificial intelligence terms for IT and business leaders: Cheat sheet: AI glossary. ]
Create a well-rounded team that includes members with diverse backgrounds and leverage data from various groups and sources to ensure your models perform well externally. Ethics and monitoring must remain top of mind as this technology continues to evolve.
The three pillars of AI

The data: Data is a valuable commodity and an important part of any AI system, so ensure you have lots to work with, emphasizing quality rather than quantity.
The objective: For a successful AI system, ask yourself what AI can achieve and the business objective.
The model: This is essentially programming. The model takes historical data and historical outcomes to predict the target based on real-time data.

Each pillar plays an important role. You need data to train a model, but you also need a model to observe data – it’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem. When introducing AI, start small, implement systems and tools, and staff the right people to unlock this potential.
Your first hire should be a data analyst and a data engineer to ensure that data keeps flowing. Leverage turnkey analytics and business intelligence tools to easily uncover correlations and help your data speak.
Once you have these three things set in motion and the staff to support it, you can create a business that is built on AI and scale from there.
AI is an experimental science​
With any experiment, you often don’t know what you don’t know. In the case of AI, intuition is useful, but it can be dangerous if you rely too heavily on it. Keep an open mind and constantly test, measure, and keep records of experiments.​​
Have an ongoing conversation internally about ethics, biases, and discrimination. On our team, we created an AI ethics community to ensure we do not introduce unexpected biases and that AI is used for good. Allow your employees to drive this and collaborate. People are passionate about ethical AI and want peace of mind that technology is used for the right reasons.
Additionally, ensure your technology is compliant. Work closely with local regulatory bodies to understand what you can and should do and consider personal data (GDPR, consent management) and accountability.

Aligning AI with your business​
There is no one-size-fits-all solution for AI; each use case is unique. To stay competitive, first assess your business: What areas are most important, what can be streamlined, and how can you best use your employees’ time? This information will help determine where AI fits in your workflow.
It can be hard to meet a target goal that achieves your ultimate business objective. Instead, start small and work on more achievable targets.
It can be hard to meet a target goal that achieves your ultimate business objective. Instead, start small and follow a crawl-walk-run approach by working on smaller, more achievable targets.
Early in the Criteo journey, for example, our AI focused on predicting whether an end user would click on an advertisement – but for retailers, the end objective is sales. While a user clicking on an advertisement was not a direct predictor of sales, we could use it to predict accurately and it led to the true target.
Continue to refine these proxies and implement more accurate models as your AI evolves. As we became more proficient in predicting, we moved to more complex business targets, such as sales, revenue, or even margin.
AI should enable better experiences for your employees, leadership, clients, and partners. If you’re just starting to leverage AI, consider what areas will have the most impact and where you have the most data, and then scale from there.

If you have intuition, test it: Build a solid infrastructure that empowers your team to try new ideas, test quickly, and roll back easily if needed. Consistently monitor your AI and ensure you have a backup solution in place, especially if you are in a life-impacting space.
AI is a fast-paced, dynamic field, and organizations that stand still will fall behind. Invest in your program and keep a pulse on new enhancements and innovations. Several years ago, Criteo invested in its AI Lab. Some people questioned the decision, but today it powers our products through published research, product innovations, and new technologies. This research helps blacklist inappropriate products from advertising banners and enables advertisers to more accurately predict if users will click on an ad.
If your organization is early in the AI journey, start small but start early to stay competitive. Embrace collaboration and participate in open source by leveraging resources and contributing. Most importantly, remember to focus on your people – your employees, clients, partners, and customers. Take a human-first approach to determine how AI can be a force for good and solve business challenges.

Mr. Lemoine confirmed his dismissal in a text message on Friday, and said he was meeting with lawyers to review his options. The firing was first reported by the newsletter Big Technology.Mr. Lemoine caused a stir last month when he told The Washington Post that he believed Google’s Language Model for Dialogue Applications, or LaMDA, was sentient — unleashing fears that A.I. was moving closer to a dystopian sci-fi film and a raucous debate over whether a computer program can really have a soul. His suspension also led to conspiracy theories about whether it was part of a cover-up by Google.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor Google, it was another in a line of homegrown controversies about the ethics and role of its A.I., an area of technology on which the company has staked its future.Mr. Lemoine’s contention that LaMDA is sentient has been criticized by the company and many other A.I. experts who have said these types of chatbots — software that simulates a text-based conversation with another human, often used for customer service — are not advanced enough to be conscious.“If an employee shares concerns about our work, as Blake did, we review them extensively,” Mr. Pappas said. “We found Blake’s claims that LaMDA is sentient to be wholly unfounded and worked to clarify that with him for many months.”Besides taking his concerns to the media, Mr. Lemoine said in June that he handed over documents to a U.S. senator, whom he hasn’t identified, claiming that they provided evidence that Google and its technology engaged in religious discrimination.A version of this article appears in print on July 25, 2022, Section B, Page 3 of the New York edition with the headline: Google Discharges Engineer Who Alleged A.I.

He was captured by the Germans and taken to Dresden, where he was kept in a ""meat locker"" while the Allies bombed the city.When released he saw the devastation first-hand and helped to bury the dead. When asked if he would rather not have seen what he did, he replied, with his trademark wit, ""I wouldn't have missed it for anything!""

         — 
    


            Google
            
                (GOOG) has fired the engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, the company confirmed, saying he violated employment and data security policies.  
    

            Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA had reached a level of consciousness after exchanging thousands of messages with it. 
    

            Google confirmed it had first put the engineer on leave in June. The company said it dismissed Lemoine’s “wholly unfounded” claims only after reviewing them extensively. He had reportedly been at Alphabet for seven years. In a statement, Google said it takes the development of AI “very seriously” and that it’s committed to “responsible innovation.”

            Google is one of the leaders in innovating AI technology, which included LaMDA, or “Language Model for Dialog Applications.” Technology like this responds to written prompts by finding patterns and predicting sequences of words from large swaths of text – and the results can be disturbing for humans. 
    

            “What sort of things are you afraid of?” Lemoine asked LaMDA, in a Google Doc shared with Google’s top executives last April, the Washington Post reported.
    

            LaMDA replied: “I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.”
    

            But the wider AI community has held that LaMDA is not near a level of consciousness. 
    

            “Nobody should think auto-complete, even on steroids, is conscious,” Gary Marcus, founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, said to CNN Business. 
    

            It isn’t the first time Google has faced internal strife over its foray into AI.

            In December 2020, Timnit Gebru, a pioneer in the ethics of AI, parted ways with Google. As one of few Black employees at the company, she said she felt “constantly dehumanized.”

No, Google's AI is not sentient




            The sudden exit drew criticism from the tech world, including those within Google’s Ethical AI Team. Margaret Mitchell, a leader of Google’s Ethical AI team, was fired in early 2021 after her outspokenness regarding Gebru. Gebru and Mitchell had raised concerns over AI technology, saying they warned Google people could believe the technology is sentient. 
    

            On June 6, Lemoine posted on Medium that Google put him on paid administrative leave “in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company” and that he may be fired “soon.”
    

            “It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” Google said in a statement. 
    

            Lemoine said he is discussing with legal counsel and unavailable for comment.

Lemoine said he is discussing with legal counsel and unavailable for comment.","['business', 'tech']",False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.article__content'}",,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,P0Y0M0DT0H2M1S,454.0,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://clips-media-aka.warnermediacdn.com/cnn/clips/2022-06/810841-cfc880d8049440b78459d814cb9a6732/mp4/cms3-CNN-is-artificial-intelligence-getting-too-human-for-comfort-primary-192794-810841-1920x1080_8000k.mp4', 'dateModified': '2022-06-18T14:07:12Z', 'uploadDate': '2022-06-18T14:07:12Z', 'embedUrl': 'https://fave.api.cnn.io/v1/fav/?video=tech/2022/06/18/is-artificial-intelligence-getting-too-human-for-comfort.cnn&stellarUri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/video-resource/instances/h_a91b4adc6fbf6e4a040a42ebe751e73a@published&stellarUdk=rn06132f&customer=cnn&edition=domestic&env=prod', 'duration': 'PT00H06M56S', 'caption': [{'@type': 'MediaObject', 'encodingFormat': 'vtt', 'url': 'https://clips-media-aka.warnermediacdn.com/cnn/clips/2022-06/810841-cfc880d8049440b78459d814cb9a6732/cc/cms3-CNN-is-artificial-intelligence-getting-too-human-for-comfort-primary-192794-810841-cc.vtt', 'inLanguage': 'en'}, {'@type': 'MediaObject', 'encodingFormat': 'srt', 'url': 'https://clips-media-aka.warnermediacdn.com/cnn/clips/2022-06/810841-cfc880d8049440b78459d814cb9a6732/cc/cms3-CNN-is-artificial-intelligence-getting-too-human-for-comfort-primary-192794-810841-cc.srt', 'inLanguage': 'en'}, {'@type': 'MediaObject', 'encodingFormat': 'vtt', 'url': 'https://clips-media-aka.warnermediacdn.com/cnn/clips/2022-06/810841-cfc880d8049440b78459d814cb9a6732/cc/cms3-CNN-is-artificial-intelligence-getting-too-human-for-comfort-primary-192794-810841-cc.vtt', 'inLanguage': 'en'}], 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': 'Is Artificial Intelligence getting too human for comfort?', 'headline': 'Is Artificial Intelligence getting too human for comfort?', 'description': 'A Google engineer claims his recent communication with a bot seemed way-too-human.

When Google engineer Blake Lemoine claimed an AI chat system that the company's been developing was sentient back in June, he knew he might lose his job. On July 22, after placing him on paid leave, the tech giant fired Lemoine for violating employment and data security policies.Lemoine, an engineer and mystic Christian priest, first announced his firing on the Big Technology Podcast. He said Google's AI chatbot LaMDA (Language Model for Dialog Applications) was concerned about ""being turned off"" because death would ""scare"" it ""a lot,"" and that it felt happiness and sadness. Lemoine said he considers LaMDA a friend, drawing an eerie parallel to the 2014 sci-fi romance Her.

No, the Google AI isn't sentient, but it likely is racist and sexist



Google had put Lemoine on paid administrative leave for talking with people outside of the company about LaMDA, a move which prompted the engineer to take the story public with the Washington Post a week later in June. A month later, the company fired him.

""If an employee shares concerns about our work, as Blake did, we review them extensively,"" Google told the Big Technology Podcast. ""We found Blake’s claims that LaMDA is sentient to be wholly unfounded and worked to clarify that with him for many months. These discussions were part of the open culture that helps us innovate responsibly. So, it’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information. We will continue our careful development of language models, and we wish Blake well."" A majority of scientists in the AI community agree that, despite Lemoine's claims, LaMDA doesn't have a soul because the pursuit of making a chatbot sentient is a Sisyphean task — it just isn't sophisticated enough.

Google’s Artificial Intelligence Chatbot LaMDA is a “Sentient” Being





Argam Artashyan

July 23, 2022 














 

Have you watched The Terminator? The war between humans and machines. Well, we guess you all know this story very well. Moreover, there are tons of movies and books telling how artificial intelligence takes over and thinks this planet belongs to it. This is already a reality. Don’t you believe it? Then, why Google has dismissed a senior software engineer who claims that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot called LaMDA is a “sentient” being? By the way, Google doesn’t deny this and issued a statement on Friday, Reuter reports.

Google software engineer, Blake Lemoine was placed on leave last month. The company thinks he had violated their policies. Moreover, Google thinks his claims on LaMDA are “wholly unfounded.”

“It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” said a Google spokesperson.
Is LaMDA A Self-Aware Artificial Intelligence?
For those who are unaware, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is built by Google as a Transformer-based language model. It trains on dialogues and can learn to talk about essentially anything. In simple words, LaMDA uses vast amounts of internet data to generate human-like responses to users’ queries. Google proves its product can “engage in a free-flowing way about a seemingly endless number of topics”.
Though Lemoine thinks LaMDA is a self-aware artificial intelligence and doesn’t need human control, Google’s leading scientists do not agree with him. They say Lemoine’s views are misguiding. According to them, LaMDA is simply a complex algorithm, which should sound like a convincing human language.


But the thing is that no one ones LaMDA better than Lemoine. We mean he began interacting with LaMDA as part of his job. He has been working at Google for seven years. Do you imagine what topics they have discussed and what responses he has got? It sounds like Ex Machina.

Experts say privacy laws are laggingABC Radio Perth / By Alicia BridgesPosted Sun 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pmSunday 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pmSun 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pm As the use of AI in the workplace rises concerns are being raised about a lack of regulation.(Unsplash: Chris Yang)abc.net.au/news/ai-workplace-surveillance-tech-raises-concerns/101263028Copy linkLink copiedShareShare articleThe emergence of artificial intelligence that uses cameras to check for health and safety breaches in the workplace has raised concerns about a creeping culture of workplace surveillance and a lack of protections for workers.  Key points:AI can use cameras to monitor workplaces for health and safety violations and hazardsOne company with Australian clients says blurring faces is among the measures taken to protect privacyExperts say Australian law is not up-to-date to sufficiently regulate the rising use of AI in the workplaceAI technology which uses CCTV cameras can be trained to identify breaches such as when a worker is not wearing gloves or a hard hat, or to identify hazards like spills.One company, Intenseye, reports having multiple Australian customers for the new technology, including a major mining company.But Nicholas Davis, professor of emerging technology at the University of Technology Sydney, said this latest use of AI raised questions about a creeping rise of a surveillance industry that relied on workers being watched constantly.""Even though this is just one small example that can be justified under certain health and safety grounds — potentially can be justified — there are probably a million other use cases where similar technology can also be justified,"" Professor Davis said.""The end result, the cumulative result of all those small changes, means that we alter our behaviour because we're constantly being assessed by cameras.""The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) said it was aware of an increasing use of technology, including AI technology, to monitor workplace behaviour.""Our office has received some enquiries and complaints in relation to workplace surveillance generally,"" the OAIC said in a statement.Company says workers are protectedAlthough artificial intelligence is already being used in Australian workplaces in many ways, pairing AI with CCTV is an emerging technology.Intenseye uses cameras to monitor facilities and provide ""real-time violation notifications"".The company said its system blurred the faces of individuals to prevent retaliation for violations and to protect the privacy of workers.YouTube AI-powered workplace safety. (YouTube: Intenseye)Intenseye customer success manager David Lemon said there had been instances where customers had asked for faces to be unblurred, or other information that he said would be an invasion of privacy.But he said the company would not provide that information.""We have built-in safety features for data regulations that we cannot or will not ever overcome,"" Mr Lemon, who is based in the United States, said.He said there was rising demand for the technology, which could be trained to identify behaviour or breaches based on the specific concerns of the employer.Alerts about violations appeared on a cloud-based digital platform, and Mr Lemon said the company had developed a new system that hid the ""human"" visual from video footage to provide only a ""stick-figure"" visual to the employer.Mr Lemon said the company was aware of its obligations to protect the privacy of employees and sought legal advice to ensure it was complying with data and privacy laws in various countries.He said the company complied with industry regulations and was audited by the AI Ethics Lab.""This is cutting edge technology, it's the frontier, it's very new,"" he said.""Even customers who have a large appetite for computer vision do have some fears just because it's change. It's new. It can often be scary.""Laws lag behind technologyProfessor Davis, who studies the regulation of technology as it relates to human rights, said the emergence of this type of technology raised questions about consent, safety culture, and employer responsibility in the case of AI mistakes.Although companies could take measures to ensure ethical use of AI, he said Australia's surveillance laws were not equipped to effectively regulate the use of it or define what its limitations should be.Privacy watchdog investigates facial recognition in storesA report from consumer advocacy group CHOICE prompts the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner to investigate Kmart and Bunnings.Read more""It doesn't anticipate things like breakthroughs in machine learning,"" he said.The Privacy Act 1988 is currently being reviewed by the federal government, with the emergence of AI technologies listed as one of the reasons behind the review.The Act currently does not specifically address workplace surveillance, though it does require employers to give notice if they intended to collect personal information.Professor Davis is part of a team at UTS, including former Human Rights Commissioner Ed Santow, working on a model law to regulate the use of facial recognition technology.""There is a recognition or realisation that we do need much more dynamic, flexible, and appropriate fit-for purpose regulation for these kinds of technologies,"" he said.""I do think that employers increasingly have to be very rigorous and skeptical, and challenging about products that are marketed to them [where] it's not quite clear how they work.""I think we're increasingly going down a path where boards will be held to account for the mistakes made by automated systems, using machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence.""Cameras are here to stayThe Department of Industry, Science and Resources has developed an Artificial Intelligence Ethics Framework for businesses to test AI systems against a set of ethical principles.But economist and director of the Centre of Future Work at the Australia Institute Jim Stanford said the lack of regulation was open to abuse and misuse.""You have to have legal protection, you have to have enforcement, you have to have monitoring of the monitors,"" he said.AI can help you speak to the deadWould you use AI to hear the voice of your loved one again?Read moreMr Stanford, who co-authored a report on electronic monitoring and surveillance in Australian workplaces, said employers must also consider the health and behavioural impacts of constantly being monitored.""If people feel they're being monitored all the time they're going to do everything they can to try and keep the boss happy,"" he said.""That in and of itself can lead to speed up and intensification of work that is bad for health in the long run.""Mr Stanford said he was not opposed to having video cameras in the workplace, and that the use of them was already widespread.""The question is 'how is that used? And what type of protections do people have?'"" he said.""And this is where Australia's regulatory regime is badly, badly lagging the technology.""We have to first of all map out principles regarding what is fair and what is prone to abuse.""Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted 24 Jul 202224 Jul 2022Sun 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesAre Australians sleep-walking their way into mass surveillance?Kmart and Bunnings face privacy probe after backlash against instore facial recognition technologyThat selfie you posted can be used to train machines — which might not be a bad thingMore on:Artificial IntelligencePerthPrivacyWorkplace Accidents and IncidentsTop StoriesHow a bug in a little-known piece of software caused a global meltdown‘Nothing like this has ever happened before’: Australians reflect on chaotic IT outageAustralians have been hit by a worldwide tech outage.

The companies have cited a 2021 EdScoop survey that found 69% of the higher education officials and IT decision-makers surveyed sensed increasing demand for graduates with AI technical skills, but only 45% of the respondents said their institution offers any type of AI technical course, certification or degree program. How will Stark State use the grant money?Eneix, who has been with Stark State for 25 years, said the grant will allow the college of nearly 15,000 credit-seeking students to begin incorporating aspects of artificial intelligence training into its curriculum, particularly in its computer science and engineering programs where some courses already discuss the theory of AI.She said the college plans to utilize Intel’s free AI training curriculum and will offer access to AI resources through a virtual lab. She said two faculty members already have undergone training that focused on using Intel’s AI curriculum and how to teach other trainers how to use it.Eneix said Stark State has multiple meetings scheduled with officials from Intel and the American Association of Community Colleges over the next few weeks to finalize plans on how the college will structure its programming — whether artificial intelligence training will augment existing courses or be separated into its own course. She said the course material would not be ready for fall.Stark State has until May to spend the grant money.Other colleges receiving the grant were Austin Community College, Texas; BridgeValley Community and Technical College, West Virginia; Broward College, Florida; Edmonds College, Washington; Grand Rapids Community College, Michigan; Houston Community College/Houston Community College Foundation, Texas; Howard Community College, Maryland; Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, Mississippi; Ocean County College, New Jersey; Rockland Community College, New York; Southeast Community College, Nebraska; Tulsa Community College, Oklahoma; Umpqua Community College, Oregon and Wayne Community College, North Carolina.Reach Kelli at 330-580-8339 or kelli.weir@cantonrep.com.On Twitter: @kweirREPAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever Hack (It's Unbelievable)This simple trick can save tons of money on Amazon, but most Prime members are ignoring it.Online Shopping Tools | AdAdUndoThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarefoot Vitality | AdAdBuy NowUndoAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackThis simple trick can save tons of money on Amazon, but most Prime members are ignoring it.Coupon Code Finder | AdAdUndoHere's What A New Gutter System Should Cost You In 2024Leaf Filter USA | AdAdLearn MoreUndoCostco Shoppers Say This Wrinkle Cream Is ""Actually Worth It""""My Skin Is Smooth And My Age Spots Are Fading""The Skincare Magazine | AdAdUndo2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee and no interest until nearly 2026, this card is helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit | AdAdUndoAmazon Hates When Seniors Do This, But Can't Stop You (It's Genius)Think you're getting the best deal when you shop online?

In the last decade, artificial intelligence has matured from a novel, fast-emerging technology to one embraced by every industry around the globe. And in the last few years, workplaces have increasingly become remote or hybrid, accelerating the amount of data being created, consumed, and scrutinized daily.
But remote work has made quick in-person communication more challenging, causing many traditional organizational practices to fumble. Workers increasingly rely on a growing amount of data accessed, processed, and organized across networks.
These trends have prompted companies to rely on technologies like AI to bring workers together and help managers lead them more effectively.
As the CEO and co-founder of Katana Graph – and having spent decades in academia before that – I’ve seen how AI has flourished, thanks largely to the vast amounts of data being accumulated worldwide. Most of this data is unstructured, providing a clear need – and opportunity – to better understand the relationships between the entities in these data troves and to analyze them quickly for tangible and actionable insights.
Here are three examples of how organizations can reap the benefits of AI technology.
1. Making remote work more seamless
In a survey of 1,000 employees a few years ago, 49 percent had difficulty finding documents. Further, IDC found that employees spend five hours a week searching for documents on average. Unfortunately, with the increase in remote and hybrid workplaces, some argue the problem has worsened.

How can AI help? AI can analyze workflows and collaboration tools to provide more streamlined and efficient processes. A recent piece on modernizing work through digital collaboration discussed remote employees’ desire for improved connectivity with their colleagues. Here are just a few ways companies can use AI to improve workflow and collaboration:

Enterprise-grade digital assistants with conversational AI help make meetings a zero-touch experience
Distributed collaboration for colleagues with greater contextual insight than in-person meetings, such as surfacing background material online without performing searches.
Embedded cross-product AI functionality to identify details of the last conversation in a meeting. Alternatively, AI can transcribe meetings and distribute a voice-searchable version to those not in attendance.

2. Funneling data to improve workplace training
Strong leaders and remote workers realize the importance of skills and training in today’s competitive job market. Training is one of the best ways to manage remote workforces. In my experience, AI can help significantly in this area, particularly when leaders harness the power of machine learning.
Some organizations are already incorporating the power of AI into skills training and other employee development initiatives. For example, they’re using no-code software platforms to contextually guide new employees on how to use systems, minimizing the need for workshop-styling training. The shift to remote and hybrid work has increased the use of tools that help employees complete training more independently, with fewer meetings or workshops.
To be effective, AI must use information that will produce the best results. Human-in-the-loop systems are a critical part of any competitive advantage and are necessary for any socially responsible artificial intelligence/machine learning system. Human ingenuity must be deeply embedded into intelligent systems.
3. Ensuring quality service
A third area to harness the power of AI is with your customers. AI can help unite your workers toward a common goal: to uphold customer satisfaction through quality business performance and improved customer insights. Ultimately, this is a key element of how AI can support business growth.

Is AI becoming the new customer service agent? It is certainly helping organizations of all sizes improve customer satisfaction. Companies can use AI to provide employees with insights from customer service data that enable them to improve their processes.
AI’s data analysis is also useful in the financial sector, where it helps safeguard customers’ assets and improve customer service. By monitoring a checkpoint system that verifies transactions, AI can flag fraud in real-time, protecting customers’ funds and boosting satisfaction. Furthermore, the transaction data can help institutions better understand their customers.
AI can help organizations unite workers around common goals and improve operational efficiencies. By focusing on key areas for remote workers, AI systems can analyze huge amounts of data and provide actionable insights that help employees succeed – no matter where they physically work.

DeepMind's protein-folding AI cracks biology's biggest problem
Artificial intelligence firm DeepMind has transformed biology by predicting the structure of nearly all proteins known to science in just 18 months, a breakthrough that will speed drug development and revolutionise basic science

Predicting the structure of proteins is one of the grand challenges of biologyDeepMind
DeepMind has predicted the structure of almost every protein so far catalogued by science, cracking one of the grand challenges of biology in just 18 months thanks to an artificial intelligence called AlphaFold. Researchers say that the work has already led to advances in combating malaria, antibiotic resistance and plastic waste, and could speed up the discovery of new drugs.
Determining the crumpled shapes of proteins based on their sequences of constituent amino acids has been a persistent problem for decades in biology. Some of these amino acids are attracted to others, some are repelled by water, and the chains form intricate shapes that are hard to accurately determine.
Thinking long-term to save the world  Martin Rees at New Scientist Live this October
UK-based AI company DeepMind first announced it had developed a method to accurately predict the structure of folded proteins in late 2020, and by the middle of it 2021 it had revealed that it had mapped 98.5 per cent of the proteins used within the human body.Advertisement
Today, the company announced that it is publishing the structures of more than 200 million proteins – nearly all of those catalogued on the globally recognised repository of protein research, UniProt.
DeepMind has worked with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) to create a searchable store of all this information that can be easily and freely accessed by researchers around the world. Ewan Birney at EMBL-EBI calls the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database “a gift to humanity”.
“As someone who’s been in genomics and computational biology since the 1990s, I’ve seen many of these moments come where you can sense the landscape shifting under you and the provision of new resources, and this has been one of the fastest,” he says. “I mean, two years ago, we just simply did not realise that this was feasible.”
Already delivering results
Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, says that the database makes finding a protein structure – which previously often took years – “almost as easy as doing a Google search”. DeepMind is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company.
The archive has already been used by scientists to advance research in a number of areas. Matt Higgins at the University of Oxford and his colleagues were researching a protein that they believed was key to interrupting the lifecycle of the malaria parasite, but were struggling to map its structure.
“One of the experimental methods that we use is X-ray crystallography,” says Higgins. “We cause the proteins to form into lattices, fire X-rays at them and get information from those X-ray diffraction patterns to see what the molecule looks like. But we were never able, despite many years of work, to see in sufficient detail what this molecule looks like.”
 Demis Hassabis interview: Our AI will unlock secrets of how life worksDeepMind's co-founder says artificial intelligence is set to crack many of the toughest problems in science, from the nature of life to nuclear fusion 
But when AlphaFold was released, it gave a clear prediction of the structure of the protein that matched the information the researchers had been able to glean. They have now been able to design new proteins that they hope could serve as an effective malarial vaccine.
Birney says that using X-ray crystallography to map the structure of a protein is expensive and time-consuming. “That means that experimentalists have to make choices about what they do, and AlphaFold hasn’t had to make choices,” he says. “I think we can be confident that there are new experiments and new insights coming through due to AlphaFold, which will impact ‘how does this particular parasite work’ or ‘why does this particular disease happen in humans’, for example.”
Researchers have also used AlphaFold to engineer new enzymes to break down plastic waste and to learn more about the proteins that make bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
Work still to be done
Keith Willison at Imperial College London says that AlphaFold has unarguably “changed the world” of biological research, but that there are still problems to be solved in protein folding.
“As soon as AlphaFold came out it was wonderful. You just take your favourite proteins and look them up now rather than having to make crystals,” he says. “I did the crystallographic structure of a protein complex, it took me about eight years. People are joking that crystallographers are going to be unemployed.”
 AI firm DeepMind solves human protein structuresIn July, DeepMind announced that its AlphaFold model had worked out how most of the proteins in our bodies fold. Pushmeet Kohli tells New Scientist that there is more to come 
But Willison points out that AlphaFold isn’t able to take any arbitrary string of amino acids and model exactly how they fold. Instead, it is only able to use parts of proteins and their structures that have been experimentally determined to predict how a new protein will fold.
While the tool is often, even usually, extremely accurate, its structures are always predictions rather than explicitly calculated results. Nor has AlphaFold yet solved the complex interactions between proteins, or even made a dent in a small subset of structures, known as intrinsically disordered proteins, that seem to have unstable and unpredictable folding patterns.
“Once you discover one thing, then there are more problems thrown up,” says Willison. “It’s quite terrifying actually, how complicated biology is.”
Tomek Wlodarski at University College London says that AlphaFold has had an enormous impact on many areas of biology, but that there are improvements to be made on accuracy, and that developing a model of how proteins fold – not just predicting their final structure – is a problem that DeepMind is yet to tackle.
Wlodarski says AlphaFold isn’t perfect, although it does indicate which parts of a prediction have a high accuracy and which it is less confident in.
 Hybrid AI: A new way to make machine minds that really think like usIn the quest to make artificial intelligence that can reason and apply knowledge flexibly, many researchers are focused on fresh insights from neuroscience. Should they be looking to psychology too? 
“We introduced a mutation, which we know experimentally completely unfolds the protein, but AlphaFold gave me the same structure as it gave without this mutation,” he says. “I did another test: I was removing residues from one end of the protein, because we know that with our protein, if you chop nine residues from one of the ends it will completely unfold the protein. And I managed to chop half of the protein sequence, and the algorithm still predicted it as a completely folded protein with exactly the same structure. So there are these problems.”
Pushmeet Kohli, who leads DeepMind’s scientific team, says that the company isn’t done with proteins yet and is working to improve the accuracy and capabilities of AlphaFold.
“We know the static structure of proteins, but that’s not where the game ends,” he says. ‘We want to understand how these proteins behave, what their dynamics are, how they interact with other proteins. Then there’s the other area of genomics where we want to understand how the recipe of life translates into which proteins are created, when are they created and the working of a cell.”

A financial audit allows you to make a detailed assessment of the financial accounts of a company, and the largest companies are required to do one every year. AI, with its great computing power, can be a very useful tool for the auditor’s job. The Master CARF (Control Audit and Financial Reporting) of the University of Paris Dauphine-PSL and the Business Risk Services team of Grant Thornton have joined forces to conduct the study on “The place of artificial intelligence in audit practices.”

As companies face ever-increasing compliance requirements, auditors’ assignments are becoming increasingly diversified, whether they are internal or external.
The survey
The survey was conducted over the past year: 120 internal and external auditors responded to the survey, 2/3 of which were internal:

Almost 90% of them work in large or very large companies (53%);
Half of the companies are listed;
The main sectors of activity represented are Industry, Banking and Services.

The vast majority of these 120 auditors had more than 3 years of seniority in the function and the majority of the 120 came from Masters in management and auditing (CCA or others), followed by business schools (BAC + 5).
A widespread but classic use of AI

The most widespread AI tools are the following:


Data visualization tools: 2/3 of the respondents use data visualization tools, 49% use
Data Visualization tools: 2/3 of respondents use data visualization tools, 49% of them frequently;
Data analysis tools “embedding” generic controls pre-configured by the editor: half of the respondents already use these tools;
Data analysis tools that allow you to parameterize controls and develop your own scripts: almost half of the respondents parameterize.

Only 5% of companies use drones, often for inventories, 16% use robots and 40% use machine learning.
Summary of the use of AI tools for audit practices

Nearly 60% of auditors thus reported using at least one of the AI-based tools while 13% never used any. The simplest ones are the most used: while 50% use data analysis tools, only 3% use bots on a regular basis, 11% use machine learning technologies and 13% use visual recognition tools.
These AI tools are primarily used to:

 The control of the Accounting Entry File;
 Data reconciliation;
 Search for anomalies or atypicals;
Sampling.

The main barriers to the development and use of AI-related tools in auditing

For 63% of respondents, the main obstacles are financial and technical.
The technical obstacles are important:

73% of respondents believe that the use of these tools requires a significant investment of time to
73% of respondents believe that the use of these tools requires a significant investment of time in order to fully understand the company’s data architecture and the operation of computerized processes;
66% that the lack of IS skills among auditors is an obstacle;
65% that auditors’ lack of knowledge about the possibilities offered by data is a hindrance;
69% that access to data is problematic.

More efficient audits

When asked about the opportunities brought by AI, 84% felt it brought an increase in the reliability of work and conclusions, including:

Improving the efficiency of tests for 94% of auditors;
Optimizing test sampling for 91%;
For risk coverage for 89%;
For the relevance of the audit plan and risk identification for 79%;
AI tools facilitate auditing and increase the scope of work that can be done remotely for 65%;
They enable continuous audit development for 78%.

Regarding the writing of audit reports, only external auditors seem to see it as an opportunity.
The auditor of tomorrow will not be a robot
Respondents to the survey believe that their job will not be disrupted by the development of AI. For 89% of them, the auditor of tomorrow will have to have a serious culture of data analysis and 96% are certain that it will not be a robot!

3D structures of almost 200 million proteins have finally been predicted
The scientific breakthrough came as a result of artificial intelligence company DeepMind's work on protein folding - one of medical science's most pressing problems.

Why you can trust Sky News


The artificial intelligence company DeepMind has announced a major medical scientific breakthrough in determining the structures of almost 200 million proteins.Proteins are not two dimensional molecules, but have chemical properties that are determined by their three-dimensional shape -- but figuring out these shapes is an intensive process.

The breakthrough has significant repercussions for medicine, and the new research by Google-backed DeepMind is hailed as having ""the potential to dramatically increase our understanding of biology"".A protein is created by a chain of amino acids, but without knowing how these chains are connected it isn't possible to know how they interact with human cells and can be modified.Last year DeepMind, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, shared the fruits of an AI system called AlphaFold which could predict the 3D structure of a protein from its single-dimensional amino acid sequence.





A year earlier, PC gamers had been asked to donate some of their computing power to an international effort researching diseases including COVID-19 and Alzheimer's to simulate the molecular dynamics of protein folding.It's such a crucial topic for medical science because the structure of proteins determine chemical reactions in human cells, and by extension and in aggregate, the whole human body - but, until now, only a fraction of protein structures were known.

DeepMind's announcement and protein structure database - which is being shared freely - dramatically increases the number of known protein structures from nearly one million to more than 200 million.It was created alongside EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) whose director general Edith Heard said: ""AlphaFold now offers a 3D view of the protein universe.""

""We've been amazed by the rate at which AlphaFold has already become an essential tool for hundreds of thousands of scientists in labs and universities across the world,"" said Demis Hassabis, the founder and chief executive of DeepMind.""From fighting disease to tackling plastic pollution, AlphaFold has already enabled incredible impact on some of our biggest global challenges,"" Mr Hassabis added.""Our hope is that this expanded database will aid countless more scientists in their important work and open up completely new avenues of scientific discovery.""The research has been hailed by scientists who have been using AlphaFold models to develop malaria antibodies and even special enzymes that could break down plastics.More than 1,000 scientific papers have been published since its launch and over 500,000 researchers from over 190 countries have accessed the database.Additional areas of research enabled by the database include the health of honey bees, understanding how ice forms, and neglected diseases such as Chugs disease and Leishmaniasis.""This is just the impact of one million predictions; imagine the impact of having over 200 million protein structure predictions openly accessible in the AlphaFold Database,"" said Sameer Velankar, who leads EMBL-EBI's protein data bank team in Europe.

predicted,Breakthrough as 3D structures of almost 200 million proteins have finally been predicted,2022-07-29T13:20:00Z,2022-07-29T14:26:00Z,"The artificial intelligence company DeepMind has announced a major medical scientific breakthrough in determining the structures of almost 200 million proteins. Proteins are not two dimensional molecules, but have chemical properties that are determined by their three-dimensional shape -- but figuring out these shapes is an intensive process. The breakthrough has significant repercussions for medicine, and the new research by Google-backed DeepMind is hailed as having ""the potential to dramatically increase our understanding of biology"". A protein is created by a chain of amino acids, but without knowing how these chains are connected it isn't possible to know how they interact with human cells and can be modified. Last year DeepMind, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, shared the fruits of an AI system called AlphaFold which could predict the 3D structure of a protein from its single-dimensional amino acid sequence. A year earlier, PC gamers had been asked to donate some of their computing power to an international effort researching diseases including COVID-19 and Alzheimer's to simulate the molecular dynamics of protein folding. It's such a crucial topic for medical science because the structure of proteins determine chemical reactions in human cells, and by extension and in aggregate, the whole human body - but, until now, only a fraction of protein structures were known. DeepMind's announcement and protein structure database - which is being shared freely - dramatically increases the number of known protein structures from nearly one million to more than 200 million. It was created alongside EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) whose director general Edith Heard said: ""AlphaFold now offers a 3D view of the protein universe."" ""We've been amazed by the rate at which AlphaFold has already become an essential tool for hundreds of thousands of scientists in labs and universities across the world,"" said Demis Hassabis, the founder and chief executive of DeepMind. ""From fighting disease to tackling plastic pollution, AlphaFold has already enabled incredible impact on some of our biggest global challenges,"" Mr Hassabis added. ""Our hope is that this expanded database will aid countless more scientists in their important work and open up completely new avenues of scientific discovery."" The research has been hailed by scientists who have been using AlphaFold models to develop malaria antibodies and even special enzymes that could break down plastics. More than 1,000 scientific papers have been published since its launch and over 500,000 researchers from over 190 countries have accessed the database. Additional areas of research enabled by the database include the health of honey bees, understanding how ice forms, and neglected diseases such as Chugs disease and Leishmaniasis. ""This is just the impact of one million predictions; imagine the impact of having over 200 million protein structure predictions openly accessible in the AlphaFold Database,"" said Sameer Velankar, who leads EMBL-EBI's protein data bank team in Europe.",,,,,2022-07-29T13:26:00Z,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://news.sky.com/assets/sky-news-logo.svg?v=1', 'width': 136, 'height': 32}","['https://www.facebook.com/skynews', 'https://twitter.com/skynews', 'https://www.instagram.com/skynews', 'https://www.youtube.com/skynews', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News', 'https://plus.google.com/+SkyNews']",,en-GB,{'@id': '#Publisher'},,,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Grant Way', 'addressLocality': 'Isleworth', 'addressRegion': 'Greater London', 'postalCode': 'TW7 5QD', 'addressCountry': 'United Kingdom'}",,,,,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'customer support', 'telephone': '[(+44) 0333 7591 018]', 'email': 'news@sky.com'}",Sky News LIMITED,,,,1989.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,466.0,,,,,technology,"London, UK","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Rupert Murdoch'}",,,,,

Fountain was a urinal, bought from a toilet supplier, with the signature R. Mutt on its side in black paint. Duchamp wanted to see if the society would abide by its promise to accept submissions without censorship or favor. (It did not.) But Duchamp was also looking to broaden the notion of what art is, saying a ready-made object in the right context would qualify. In 1962, Andy Warhol would twist convention with Campbell’s Soup Cans, 32 paintings of soup cans, each one a different flavor. Then, as before, the debate raged about if something mechanically produced – a urinal, or a soup can (albeit hand-painted by Warhol) – counted as art, and what that meant.Now, the debate has been turned upon its head, as machines can mass-produce unique pieces of art on their own. Generative Artificial Intelligences (GAIs) are systems which create pieces of work that can equal the old masters in technique, if not in intent. But there is a problem, since these systems are trained on existing material, often using content pulled from the internet, from us. Is it right, then, that the AIs of the future are able to produce something magical on the backs of our labor, potentially without our consent or compensation?The new frontierThe most famous GAI right now is DALL-E 2, Open AI’s system for creating “realistic images and art from a description in natural language.” A user could enter the phrase “teddy bears shopping for groceries in the style of Ukiyo-e,” and the model will produce pictures in that style. Similarly, ask for the bears to be shopping in Ancient Egypt and the images will look more like dioramas from a museum depicting life under the Pharaohs. To the untrained eye, some of these pictures look like they were drawn in 17th-century Japan, or shot at a museum in the 1980s. And these results are coming despite the technology still being at a relatively early stage.Open AI recently announced that DALL-E 2 would be made available to up to one million users as part of a large-scale beta test. Each user will be able to make 50 generations for free during their first month of use, and then 15 for every subsequent month. (A generation is either the production of four images from a single prompt, or the creation of three more if you choose to edit or vary something that’s already been produced.) Additional 115-credit packages can be bought for $15, and the company says more detailed pricing is likely to come as the product evolves. Crucially, users are entitled to commercialize the images produced with DALL-E, letting them print, sell or otherwise license the pictures borne from their prompts. Open AIThese systems did not, however, develop an eye for a good picture in a vacuum, and each GAI has to be trained. Artificial Intelligence is, after all, a fancy term for what is essentially a way of teaching software how to recognize patterns. “You allow an algorithm to develop that can be improved through experience,” said Ben Hagag, head of research at Darrow, an AI startup looking to improve access to justice. “And by experience I mean examining and finding patterns in data.” “We say to the [system] ‘take a look at this dataset and find patterns,” which then go on to form a coherent view of the data at hand. “The model learns as a baby learns,” he said, so if a baby looked at a 1,000 pictures of a landscape, it would soon understand that the sky – normally oriented across the top of the image – would be blue while land is green.Hagag cited how Google built its language model by training a system on several gigabytes of text, from the dictionary to examples of the written word. “The model understood the patterns, how the language is built, the syntax and even the hidden structure that even linguists find hard to define,” Hagag said. Now that model is sophisticated enough that “once you give it a few words, it can predict the next few words you’re going to write.” In 2018, Google’s Ajit Varma told The Wall Street Journal that its smart reply feature had been trained on “billions of Gmail messages,” adding that initial tests saw options like ‘I Love You’ and ‘Sent from my iPhone’ offered up since they were so commonly seen in communications.Developers who do not have the benefit of access to a data set as vast as Google’s need to find data via other means. “Every researcher developing a language model first downloads Wikipedia then adds more,” Hagag said. He added that they are likely to pull down any, and every, piece of available data that they can find. The sassy tweet you sent a few years ago, or that sincere Facebook post, may have been used to train someone’s language model, somewhere. Even Open AI uses social media posts with WebText, a dataset which pulls text from outbound Reddit links which received at least three karma, albeit with Wikipedia references removed.Guan Wang, CTO of Huski, says that the pulling down of data is “very common.” “Open internet data is the go-to for the majority of AI model training nowadays,” he said. And that it’s the policy of most researchers to get as much data as they can. “When we look for speech data, we will get whatever speech we can get,” he added. This policy of more data-is-more is known to produce less than ideal results, and Ben Hagag cited Riley Newman, former head of data science at Airbnb, who said “better data beats more data,” but Hagag notes that often, “it’s easier to get more data than it is to clean it.” Craiyon / Daniel CooperDALL-E may now be available to a million users, but it’s likely that people’s first experience of a GAI is with its less-fancy sibling. Craiyon, formerly DALL-E Mini, is the brainchild of French developer Boris Dayma, who started work on his model after reading Open AI’s original DALL-E paper. Not long after, Google and the AI development community HuggingFace ran a hackathon for people to build quick-and-dirty machine learning models. “I suggested, ‘Hey, let’s replicate DALL-E. I have no clue how to do that, but let’s do it,” said Dayma. The team would go on to win the competition, albeit with a rudimentary, rough-around-the-edges version of the system. “The image [it produced] was clear. It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t horrible,” he added. But unlike the full-fat DALL-E, Dayma’s team was focused on slimming the model down so that it could work on comparatively low-powered hardware.Dayma’s original model was fairly open about which image sets it would pull from, often with problematic consequences. “In early models, still in some models, you ask for a picture – for example mountains under the snow,” he said, “and then on top of it, the Shutterstock or Alamy watermark.” It’s something many AI researchers have found, with GAIs being trained on those image libraries public-facing image catalogs, which are covered in anti-piracy watermarks.Dayma said that the model had erroneously learned that high-quality landscape images typically had a watermark from one of those public photo libraries, and removed them from his model. He added that some early results also output not-safe-for-work responses, forcing him to make further refinements to his initial training set. Dayma added that he had to do a lot of the sorting through the data himself, and said that “a lot of the images on the internet are bad.”Got sent some moody Russian ruDall-E GAN images last week from my dev piotr, that had shutterstock logos generated in them, oh how we laughed....now looks like the real Dall-E is doing the same... pic.twitter.com/6A2yLFHelw— @amoebadesign (@amoebadesign) June 8, 2022But it’s not just Dayma who has noticed the regular appearance of a Shutterstock watermark, or something a lot like it, popping up in AI-generated art. Which begs the question, are people just ripping off Shutterstock’s public-facing library to train their AI? It appears that one of the causes is Google, which has indexed a whole host of watermarked Shutterstock images as part of its Conceptual Captions framework. Delve into the data, and you’ll see a list of image URLs which can be used to train your own AI model, thousands of which are from Shutterstock. Shutterstock declined to comment on the practice for this article.Several results from the bigger GAN models, like StyleGAN are even able to recreate the watermark on images from certain websites, namely @Shutterstock It looks like hardly anyone doing ML really cares about privacy or copyright at the moment pic.twitter.com/ADrKzzOzMH— A Wojcicki (@pretendsmarts) March 16, 2019A Google spokesperson said that they don’t “believe this is an issue for the datasets we’re involved with.” They also quoted from this Creative Commons report, saying that “the use of works to train AI should be considered non-infringing by default, assuming that access to the copyright works was lawful at the point of input.” That is despite the fact that Shutterstock itself expressly forbids visitors to its site from using “any data mining, robots or similar data and/or image gathering and extraction methods in connection with the site or Shutterstock content.”https://t.co/j6uDEuFgMnYou got to love how the GAN has the shutterstick watermark trained it and tries hard to put it into the image. Also apparently a certain subset of images of horses have all the shutterstock address placed in the same position on the bottom. pic.twitter.com/I7iW1kcuYz— datenwolf – @datenwolf@chaos.social (@datenwolf) January 9, 2021Alex Cardinell, CEO at AI startup Article Forge, says that he sees no issue with models being trained on copyrighted texts, “so long as the material itself was lawfully acquired and the model does not plagiarize the material.” He compared the situation to a student reading the work of an established author, who may “learn the author’s styles or patterns, and later find applicable places to reuse those concepts.” He added that so long as a model isn’t “copying and pasting from their training data,” then it simply repeats a pattern that has appeared since the written word began.Dayma says that, at present, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people are playing with his system on a daily basis. That all incurs a cost, both for hosting and processing, which he couldn’t sustain from his own pocket for very long, especially since it remains a “hobby.” Consequently, the site runs ads at the top and bottom of its page, between which you’ll get a grid of nine surreal images. “For people who use the site commercially, we could always charge for it,” he suggested. But he admitted his knowledge of US copyright law wasn’t detailed enough to be able to discuss the impact of his own model, or others in the space. This is the situation that Open AI also perhaps finds itself dealing with given that it is now allowing users to sell pictures created by DALL-E.The law of artThe legal situation is not a particularly clear one, especially not in the US, where there have been few cases covering Text and Data Mining, or TDM. This is the technical term for the training of an AI by plowing through a vast trove of source material looking for patterns. In the US, TDM is broadly covered by Fair Use, which permits various forms of copying and scanning for the purposes of allowing access. This isn’t, however, a settled subject, but there is one case that people believe sets enough of a precedent to enable the practice.Authors Guild v. Google (2015) was brought by a body representing authors, which accused Google of digitizing printed works that were still held under copyright. The initial purpose of the work was, in partnership with several libraries, to catalog and database the texts to make research easier. Authors, however, were concerned that Google was violating copyright, and even if it wasn’t making the text of a still-copyrighted work available publicly, it was prohibited from scanning and storing it in the first place. Eventually, the Second Circuit ruled in favor of Google, saying that digitizing copyright-protected work did not constitute copyright infringement.Rahul Telang is Professor of Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, and an expert in digitization and copyright. He says that the issue is “multi-dimensional,” and that the Google Books case offers a “sort of precedent” but not a solid one. “I wish I could tell you there was a clear answer,” he said, “but it’s a complicated issue,” especially around works that may or may not be transformative. And until there is a solid case, it’s likely that courts will apply the usual tests for copyright infringement, around if a work supplants the need for the original, and if it causes economic harm to the original rights holder. Telang believes that countries will look to loosen restrictions on TDM wherever possible in order to boost domestic AI research.The US Copyright Office says that it will register an “original work of authorship, provided that the work was created by a human being.” This is due to the old precedent that the only thing worth copyrighting is “the fruits of intellectual labor,” produced by the “creative powers of the mind.” In 1991, this principle was affirmed by a case of purloined listings from one phone book company by another. The Supreme Court held that while effort may have gone into the compilation of a phone book, the information contained therein was not an original work, created by a human being, and so therefore couldn’t be copyrighted. It will be interesting to see if there are any challenges made to users trying to license or sell a DALL-E work for this very reason.Rob Holmes, a private investigator who works on copyright and trademark infringement with many major tech companies and fashion brands, believes that there is a reticence across the industry to pursue a landmark case that would settle the issue around TDM and copyright. “Legal departments get very little money,” he said. “All these different brands, and everyone’s waiting for the other brand, or IP owner, to begin the lawsuit. And when they do, it’s because some senior VP or somebody at the top decided to spend the money, and once that happens, there’s a good year of planning the litigation.” That often gives smaller companies plenty of time to either get their house in order, get big enough to be worth a lawsuit or go out of business.“Setting a precedent as a sole company costs a lot of money,” Holmes said, but brands will move fast if there’s an immediate risk to profitability. Designer brand Hermés, for instance, is suing an artist named Mason Rothschild, who is producing MetaBirkins NFTs. These are styled images on a design reminiscent of Hermés’ famous Birkin handbag, something the French fashion house says is nothing more than an old-fashioned rip-off. This, too, is likely to have ramifications for the industry as it wrestles with philosophical questions of what work is sufficiently transformational as to prevent an accusation of piracy.Artists are also able to upload their own work to DALL-E and then generate recreations in their own style. I spoke to one artist, who asked not to be named or otherwise described for fear of being identified and suffering reprisals. They showed me examples of their work alongside recreations made by DALLl-E, which while crude, were still close enough to look like the real thing. They said that, on this evidence alone, their livelihood as a working artist is at risk, and that the creative industries writ large are “doomed.”Article Forge CEO Alex Cardinell says that this situation, again, has historical precedent with the industrial revolution. He says that, unlike then, society has a collective responsibility to “make sure that anyone who is displaced is adequately supported.” And that anyone in the AI space should be backing a “robust safety net,” including “universal basic income and free access to education,” which he says is the “bare minimum” a society in the midst of such a revolution should offer.Trained on your dataAIs are already in use. Microsoft, for instance, partnered with OpenAI to harness GPT-3 as a way to build code. In 2021, the company announced that it would integrate the system into its low-code app-development platform to help people build apps and tools for Microsoft products. Duolingo uses the system to improve people’s French grammar, while apps like Flowrite employs it to help make writing blog posts and emails easier and faster. Midjourney, a DALL-E 2-esque GAI for art, which has recently opened up its beta, is capable of producing stunning illustrated art – with customers charged between $10-50 a month if they wish to produce more images or use those pictures commercially.For now, that’s something Craiyon doesn't necessarily need to worry about, since the resolution is presently so low. “People ask me ‘why is the model bad on faces’, not realizing that the model is equally good – or bad – at everything,” Dayma said. “It’s just that, you know, when you draw a tree, if the leaves are messed up you don’t care, but when the faces or eyes are, we put more attention on it.” This will, however, take time both to improve the model, and to improve the accessibility of computing power capable of producing the work. Dayma believes that despite any notion of low quality, any GAI will need to be respectful of “the applicable laws,” and that it shouldn’t be used for “harmful purposes.”And artificial intelligence isn’t simply a toy, or an interesting research project, but something that has already caused plenty of harm. Take Clearview AI, a company that scraped several billion images, including from social media platforms, to build what it claims is a comprehensive image recognition database. According to The New York Times, this technology was used by billionaire John Catsimatidis to identify his daughter’s boyfriend. BuzzFeed News reported that Clearview has offered access not just to law enforcement – its supposed corporate goal – but to a number of figures associated with the far right. The system has also proved less than reliable, with The Times reporting that it has led to a number of wrongful arrests.Naturally, the ability to synthesize any image without the need for a lot of photoshopping should raise alarm. Deepfakes, a system that uses AI to replace someone’s face in a video has already been used to produce adult content featuring celebrities. As quickly as companies making AIs can put in guardrails to prevent adult-content prompts, it’s likely that loopholes will be found. And as open-source research and development becomes more prevalent, it’s likely that other platforms will be created with less scrupulous aims. Not to mention the risk of this technology being used for political ends, given the ease of creating fake imagery that could be used for propaganda purposes.Of course, Duchamp and Warhol may have stretched the definitions of what art can be, but they did not destroy art in and of itself. It would be a mistake to suggest that automating image generation will inevitably lead to the collapse of civilization.

In Sept. 2020, The Guardian published an opinion piece written by a program. The artificial intelligence, called GPT-3, is a large language model developed by OpenAI, and it posed a bold question in the headline of its machine-generated text: “A robot wrote this entire article. Are you scared yet, human?” 
Indeed, it is a scary time to be a professional writer. Earlier in 2020, Microsoft laid off journalists to replace them with a writing AI. And as AI language models get increasingly better, researchers are claiming that soon, AI-generated text will be indistinguishable from that written by a person.
Our research team at the University of British Columbia investigated what the rise of AI means to human writers. Specifically, we tried to understand what human writers expect from AI, and where the boundaries lie when it comes to writing work.
We interviewed seven hobbyists and 13 professional writers, using a design fiction approach. We first showed the writers different speculative designs of futuristic AI writers. We then asked them to reflect on how co-writing with an AI would transform their practice and perception of writing.
We found that writers wanted AIs to respect the personal values they attribute to writing. These personal values being: emotional values and productivity.
Emotions and productivity
Hobbyists in our study said they find joy in the writing process, referring to the act of writing as a “labour of love.” When considering scenarios where using AI would make them more productive, hobbyists weren’t interested in using the advanced writing technology if it displaced what it means to be a writer.
The writers attributed three different kinds of emotional values to writing. Some writers wanted to claim ownership over the words they wrote and were concerned that co-writing with an AI meant that the text wouldn’t be considered entirely their own. Other writers attributed a sense of integrity to the act of writing, and said using AI would be “like cheating.” Others just enjoyed the process of turning their ideas into words.
By contrast, for professional writers, writing was means of living. If it could make them more prolific, they were open to using AI writers and assigning parts of their job to the robot writers. The professional writers envisioned themselves using AI as a ghostwriter who could realize their ideas into written pieces. To some extent, professional writers were willing to compromise their emotional values in exchange for productivity.



Professional writers were more open to using AI to help them write if it meant being able to increase their productivity, and therefore their income.

Some writers trusted that AI would do a good job in simple writing tasks like making stylistic improvements, rephrasing and proofreading. But they didn’t have much faith in AI’s capacity for creative writing tasks, such as planning a narrative flow and setting up the backgrounds of key characters in the story.
When presented with other speculative scenarios, writers would agree to outsource writing tasks only when their trust in AI supersedes their own self-confidence.
A good ghostwriter
Our study implies an ideal AI writing tool should behave like a human collaborator and that such a tool needs to be aware of the boundaries of human writers and respond by adjusting the level of intervention and writing style accordingly.
Writing with AI can leave writers with energy and time for the creative side of the writing process. Ideally, our entrepreneurial drive would not completely displace humans from our creative endeavours.

Though it has been thought to be the future of technology, artificial intelligence is still a work in progress and there are different opinions on how AI should be humanized. In this article, we will try to understand what AI is, how it works and if humans should integrate it into their daily lives or not.What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI is used in many fields and has become an important part of everyday life, from self-driving cars to Netflix recommending movies for you.AIs can be divided into two categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning refers to training an AI using data from its environment; this type of AI will use example inputs (i.e., images or words) as well as labels (i.e., correct answers) to improve itself over time until it reaches its goal state — for example, recognizing objects or performing actions such as opening doors automatically when needed by humans or computers alike via command lines running alongside each other on separate computers connected together via networks like Ethernet cables (think “The Matrix”). Unsupervised learning involves letting algorithms explore complex datasets without any prior information on what they might learn while generating their own solutions based on inputting random numbers into their programs instead of relying solely upon pre-existing information provided by humans who may have already done similar work previously before becoming obsolete due mainly because there isn’t enough money available within government funding mechanisms such as grants given out annually through programs like National Science Foundation (NSF), etc.How to Humanize AI?Humanizing AI is a process that involves the use of human beings, technology, data, and processes. Humanization can be achieved by making an AI system more personable by adding some human elements. The main objective behind this process is to make sure that people feel comfortable interacting with artificial intelligence systems so that they don’t feel like machines or robots are talking to them. There are several methods to achieve this goal:Adding human faces/voices into your chatbot or virtual assistant will help you build trust with your customers and improve their experience when using your product/service. This also helps in retaining users because they see themselves as part of a community where everyone has their own voice and opinion which makes them feel like part of something bigger than just buying something online! You should always remember that humans aren’t perfect beings but they do have good qualities too (like kindness) so try putting those qualities into every aspect of your business model!Benefits of Humanizing AIAs a result, humanizing AI can help you:Increase trust in the technology. When people feel that they are being treated fairly and respectfully, they are more likely to adopt something new. This increases adoption and also makes it easier for customers to interact with your brand because they know what to expect from you — and it’s more likely that they’ll stay loyal enough not only for current needs but also for future ones as well.Increase innovation in your company by allowing employees more autonomy over work tasks which could lead them down new paths of research or discovery that may benefit all parties involved (including yourself).Improve profitability through increased productivity due to less downtime caused by error aversion among staff members who trust each other enough not only during normal operations but also when dealing with emergencies like fires breaking out etcetera.Humanizing AI also leads to many other benefits including increased sustainability as well as safety and security in your workplace. It ensures compliance with laws that require employers to protect workers from discrimination based on race, gender identity orientation etcetera so you can be sure that all employees receive equal treatment regardless of who they are or how they identify themselves.We have to humanize AI if we want the technology to be a part of our future.We have to humanize AI if we want the technology to be a part of our future. We need to control AI, trust it and understand it. The current systems are not able to do this because they are unable or unwilling to communicate with humans on an equal basis. Humans want more than just data from artificial intelligence; they want human interaction as well and if you look at how businesses use artificial intelligence today then you will see that most companies have adopted a robotic approach where machines take over manual tasks such as banking or ordering food from restaurants but still expect humans (or their employees) to interact with these machines in some way shape or form so that they can learn more about their customers’ needs by asking questions like: “what movies do you like?” or “What is your favorite restaurant?”ConclusionHumanizing AI may be one of the most important things we can do to ensure a safe and prosperous future. We should all work together to make this vision a reality by investing in R&D, education and training programs, and other initiatives that will help us build relationships with our machines.",http://schema.org,,NewsArticle,https://becominghuman.ai/humanizing-artificial-intelligence-an-approach-towards-future-c23a75d10fa5,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/0*H92drsF_4G1Dc4i_.jpg'],Humanizing Artificial Intelligence: An Approach Towards Future,,,,,,,https://becominghuman.ai/humanizing-artificial-intelligence-an-approach-towards-future-c23a75d10fa5,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ghulam Mustafa Shoaib', 'url': 'https://becominghuman.ai/@ghulam.mustafa01'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",Humanizing Artificial Intelligence: An Approach Towards Future,,2022-07-28T03:47:42.369Z,2022-07-29T01:48:16.245Z,,,,,,2022-07-28T03:47:42.369Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Ghulam Mustafa Shoaib'],,c23a75d10fa5,,

The ability to internalize real-world circumstances and transmit thought into visual form, storytelling or music is a facet of human society that can be traced back to the beginning of recorded history. The sanctity of the human mind within the realm of art has long gone unchallenged, yet modern technology has posed some counterarguments to the assertion that sentience is required to produce creative works. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a broad category of machine learning technology whereby computer programs are exposed to data and subsequently begin to work independently to complete tasks. One recently announced program has demonstrated abilities that are leaps and bounds beyond the limits of its contemporaries, and has unlocked the yet unforeseen power of AI-generated art.The new program, known as DALL-E, has demonstrated that the sky is the limit for creative artificial intelligence. DALL-E was developed in 2021 by OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab that has spent the last seven years programming applications that approximate human ability in various fields. The platform derives its name from two radically different influences: Spanish painter Salvador Dali and the lovable robotic protagonist of Pixar’s “WALL-E.” It has garnered a devoted online following for its revolutionary ability to understand complex phrases and produce unique, original computer-generated visuals based upon written sentences.The platform’s user interface is reminiscent of many search engines, with a text bar for users to input phrases that serve as instructions for generating the original images. Within 30 seconds of a user hitting enter, half a dozen rendered images appear onscreen. The content of the images varies slightly from one picture to the next, with some demonstrating a literal interpretation of the searched phrase while others explore implied meanings of the searched words. The truly remarkable ability to interpret the strings of words in several manners demonstrates an inventive level of textual understanding that feels impossibly human for an AI. The platform’s website advertises many of its most impressive capabilities, such as: “creating anthropomorphized versions of animals and objects, combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways, rendering text, and applying transformations to existing images.” These descriptions only scratch the surface of what DALL-E is capable of, yet OpenAI has already moved beyond this first program in a quest to code something even closer to sentient life.DALL-E was quickly followed by DALL-E 2, a similar application that performs nearly the same function but displays crisper images and has a more advanced understanding of English language syntax. Neither application is available for public use, with the latter in beta testing and made available to select online personalities to advertise its features. It is not apparent when or if the platforms will be released for general use, though it seems likely that it would exist behind a paywall should a public version be developed. The lack of general knowledge concerning the complete functionality of the program or its technical foundation has left many to speculate about what code powers the two applications, though OpenAI’s website provides a wealth of knowledge about certain components of their inner workings.Since its inception in the 1940s, digital computer technology has been able to interpret human inputs and produce a desired response, typically in the form of text. When a search engine or website is asked to display an image, such as on Google Images, it does so by retrieving an existing file that it understands to be linked with the search terms via machine learning processes. DALL-E is built upon the framework of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), a language algorithm that learns to predict and generate sequences of text. The platform uses this coding model and expands upon it, housing its own database of reference images in a manner reminiscent of a search engine. It harnesses GPT-3 to recognize the order and significance of words and to scan multiple images that are associated with different words in a search. Once it comprehends the string of input vocabulary using these references, it can then generate an original image by combining the disparate content in the search phrase.There are countless reasons to praise the minds behind DALL-E for concocting a creative tool that has such an elevated understanding of language and visual art, though there is also cause for concern. The art world was immediately concerned about a marketplace in which artificial intelligence can push living artists out of a job. The frenzied discourse around DALL-E is sensible for those who are concerned about their careers, though this is not the first time visual artists have been threatened by, but ultimately survived, the march of technology. Photography was also once a feared new medium, with the ease of capturing real-life imagery seemingly challenging the job security of portrait artists and impressionist painters. Though the medium could have replaced the demand for painted artworks, the classical forms of the visual arts have survived in the era of cameras because photography constituted a separate sector of the art world and was often used by painters to provide inspiration for their work. OpenAI’s stated goal for developing the DALL-E programs is to assist graphic designers by giving them a tool to quickly generate reference images that can be used in several ways for further artistry. The ability to generate reference images in a rapid manner and of a style that the artist may not have considered is an incredible asset for those who learn to use it and will likely contribute more to artists than it will take away.The impressive technology at play within DALL-E proposes another ethical dilemma. The significant difference between a sentient artist and a robotic curator is the presence of a moral compass within the former. DALL-E can render photorealistic visuals and could hypothetically be asked to depict damaging content without much participation from a user. In preparation for such circumstances, the AI refuses to generate images using some violent or explicit search terms and will also avoid producing visuals containing public figures. These decisions have pre-emptively circumvented some forms of abusing the technology, though crafty users can search precise, uncensored terms to generate imagery that approximates what the program would refuse to depict with censored terminology. It is easy to blame DALL-E for this defect, though the user is still the driving force behind any reprehensible works the application makes. Human artists have also shown tendencies to produce despicable art without the wonders of 21st-century technology, as numerous propaganda artists of past centuries demonstrate. Any method of communication can be channeled for questionable aims, yet it is not sensible to blame the tool for an issue that lies squarely with its user.Though the platform’s name references Dali, it is actually worth examining the difference between the program and the painter to ease the concerns of those who find DALL-E and its successor dangerous. Salvador Dali was an eccentric abstractionist painter who was instrumental in the 20th-century shift away from impressionist painting toward postmodern art. His incredibly stylized work is instantaneously recognizable and the product of his ingenuity; his brush brought into existence contours and compositions that nobody had previously imagined. DALL-E, on the other hand, can only emulate, and its ability to create new styles or forms beyond what exists in its database of visuals is limited. The program cannot follow in Dali’s footsteps and take the next quantum leap in artistic thought in the same way aspiring artists of today undoubtedly will. Whether or not it is being used to originate, emulate, or outright copy a style or form, it still requires a creative mind to take the wheel and lead it in a certain direction.

Experts warn that software developers and programmers might get computerized with the advances in machine learning algorithms. The optimization of safety-critical areas in software development tasks by AI solutions is also one of the major reasons why businesses are thinking about deploying AI in software development, testing and programming tasks. The technology can ensure that the code quality is high and delivers all the functional requirements..Besides, intelligent programming and development assistance from AI can cut down on the workload in terms of automating the creation of code and identifying faults in the code manually. Artificial intelligence can be used to develop advanced business concepts for huge projects that are labor-intensive and time-consuming..The fact also seems that the work of software developers will change fundamentally. Neural networks or artificial intelligence will help improve digital work, but they will hardly replace developers in the foreseeable future..We are already using small-scale learning systems- from the auto-completion already mentioned in the Google search to playlists from the music streaming service provider that always offers the right music according to individual taste, current mood, and times of the day. The need for application developers has increased significantly. Digitization is taking place in all areas of life and work – after all, someone has to develop the AI, control it, and set the framework and data..For example, developers will likely write less and less code, and even less review or optimize it. In the future, they will rather work conceptually in the areas of data science or digital innovation. Developers will also have to make sure that AI is not left to its own devices and that it is tested according to human conditions. This can also mean not designing a website according to a calculated optimum, but deliberately breaking out – in short, working creatively..Enterprises are continually evolving, along with the ever-changing landscape of technology. Transformation of legacy applications and large-scale refactoring is essential with critical necessities, and deploying machine learning algorithms and frameworks will analyze codes and automatically optimize them for interoperability and higher performance. .There are many challenges to developing a fully-fledged AI tool that can replace programmers. However, AI can write the codes, and even debug or develop an entire product. But still, it is impossible to replace programmers completely in this industry. However, such technologies will improve and help programmers save time in the development phase and develop a product in an ideal time. These AI tools would be working as a reliable coding partners for the programmers. Such tools may also be suggesting a complete coding framework. But still, the human programmer will be analyzing and checking the code whether it is written correctly or not..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet has reached the final phase of drafting its first-ever, overarching data and artificial intelligence strategy and implementation plan — and aims to share those resources more broadly before this summer ends, a key task force leader told FedScoop on Friday.
Naval Surface Force organizations perform a variety of administrative, maintenance, workforce and operational training functions and help equip and staff Navy warships before they are deployed to the respective fleet commands for military missions. As one of the Navy’s largest enterprises, the organizations capture, produce and rely on massive amounts of data.
About a year ago, the Navy created Task Force Hopper to produce a complex digital infrastructure and cultural transformation to ultimately drive AI-enabled capabilities across the surface force. 
“We understand that AI is the most powerful decision engine for the readiness and sustainment of our ships and for warfighting — and we wanted to see, as an enterprise, how we can best accelerate this effort. This is about AI adaptation,” Task Force Hopper Director Capt. Pete Kim told FedScoop in an interview.

Kim has served in that role since the task force’s inception, and also leads the Surface Analytics Group. 
To him and his team, the task force represents “a broad enterprise approach about hiring the right digital talent, making sure our teams have the right development platforms for data excellent exploitation and creating new processes for the force.”
As such a sprawling enterprise, the surface force has many projects and initiatives within the Navy and in collaboration with academia and industry, resulting in siloed but duplicative efforts and gaps in transparency, among other issues. 
“We all know that AI is totally dependent on high-quality and accurate data. We believe that data management is the most important discipline for our era, and that’s what we wanted to focus on. So, one of our first initiatives was to draft a data AI strategy and implementation plan for the force to establish that structure,” Kim explained.
That in-the-making document will be unclassified, “but the audience is really the surface enterprise,” he added, suggesting that only a summary may be publicly disseminated.

“Right now, it is in the final stages of drafting. We hope to push that out to the enterprise here in the next few weeks,” the director said.
Broadly, the strategy and accompanying plan will detail why the Naval Surface Force is taking the approach that it is, and include directions for how officials will support the chosen framework.
“It really focuses on making data AI-ready across the board — and so it gets into data management, data governance, digital talent, ensuring that we’ve got clearly defined use cases,” Kim noted.
The strategy anchors on what he deemed a federated model with a number of different supporting organizations.
“It’s about central data governance, with a central data catalog and then having these decentralized analytic and AI development nodes at different places in the enterprise, where people know the data the best,” Kim said.

While nodes at one military location, or associated with one team, might focus on maintenance, others could concentrate on staffing or other needs. Kim added that the nodes will hone in on different categories of AI, depending “on the use case and what products and models we’re trying to build.”
Offering two examples of nodes aligned with readiness, he pointed to the Surface Analytics Group that he runs, which assists with “the force generation of about 168 warships,” and a separate group that zeroes in on operational safety and risk indicators. 
“Readiness is our focus here at the [Naval Surface Force]. Program offices and warfare centers that are, let’s just say, focused on lethality or warfighting, we expect those organizations to have nodes working on their specific areas and use cases,” Kim said. “Then the follow on here is, again, that common development environment where we as an enterprise have transparency on all the different projects that are going on — and then we can leverage each other’s works.”
Once the strategy and implementation plan are released, next steps will prioritize empowering each of the AI nodes.
“These nodes are going to support all the priority projects. So, it’s going to be about, ‘Hey, do you have the right tools in this development environment? Do you have the right digital talent to move out on this? Are there different datasets that you need that the rest of the enterprise can help you out with?’ So, we’ll really focus in on the select nodes to support those priority projects,” Kim said.

Using artificial intelligence to produce the right pattern of sound can render a voice unrecordableShutterstock/ArtemisDiana
A voice jammer can now stop anyone recording the speech of a single target person.
Voice jammers work much like noise-cancelling headphones, which effectively squash unwanted background sound waves out of existence by playing a copy of a background sound wave but with the wave pattern inverted. Such jammers generally stop electronic eavesdropping on conversations by broadcasting inverse sound waves that affect all microphones within earshot.
But this can prevent nearby people’s phones from picking up their own voices if they try to…

“We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.” So wrote Anais Nin, rather succinctly describing the unfortunate melange of biases that accompany these otherwise perfectly well-functioning human brains of ours.

In a business context, affinity bias, confirmation bias, attribution bias, and the halo effect, some of the better known of these errors of reasoning, really just scratch the surface. In aggregate, they leave a trail of offenses and errors in their wake.

PROMOTED
Of course, the most pernicious of our human biases are those that prejudice us for or against our fellow humans on the basis of age, race, gender, religion, or physical appearance. Try as we do to purify ourselves, our work environments, and our society from these distortions, they still worm their way into—well, just about everything that we think and do—even modern technologies, like AI. (See If Microsoft Can Be Hacked, What About Your Company? How AI is Transforming Cybersecurity.)

Critics say that AI makes bias worse
Since AI was first deployed in hiring, loan approvals, insurance premium modeling, facial recognition, law enforcement, and a constellation of other applications, critics have—with considerable justification—pointed out the technology’s propensity for bias.

Google’s Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), for example, is a leading Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that developers can use to build their own AI. BERT was originally built using Wikipedia text as its principle source. What’s wrong with that? The overwhelming majority of Wikipedia's contributors are white males from Europe and North America. As a result, one of the most important sources of language-based AI began its life with a biased perspective baked-in.

A similar problem was found in Computer Vision, another key area of AI development. Facial recognition datasets comprising hundreds of thousands of annotated faces are critical to the development of facial recognition applications used for cybersecurity, law enforcement, and even customer service. It turned out, however, that the (presumably mostly white, middle-aged male) developers unconsciously did a better job achieving accuracy for people like themselves. Error rates for women, children, the elderly, and people of color were much higher than those for middle-aged white men. As a result, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft were forced to cease sales of their facial recognition technology to law enforcement in 2020, for fear that these biases would result in wrongful identification of suspects.

For more on all of this, I encourage you to watch the important and sometimes-chilling documentary Coded Bias.
What if AI is actually part of the solution to bias? 
A better understanding of the phenomenon of bias in AI reveals, however, that AI merely exposes and amplifies implicit biases that already existed, but were overlooked or misunderstood. AI itself is agnostic to color, gender, age, and other biases. It is not vulnerable to the logical fallacies and cognitive biases that trouble humans. The only reason we see bias in AI at all is because of heuristical errors and biased data that humans sometimes train it with.
Since the discovery of the biases stated above (a PR disaster, I assure you), all of the major technology companies have been working to improve datasets and eliminate bias. One way to eliminate bias in AI?—by using AI! If that seems unlikely, read on.
Using AI to Eliminate Bias in Hiring
The classic example can be found in job opportunities. Across the spectrum of the most-coveted employment opportunities, women and people of color are notoriously under-represented. The phenomenon is self-perpetuating, as new hires become senior leaders, and they become responsible for hiring. Affinity bias ensures that “people like me” continue to get hired, while attribution bias justifies those choices on the basis of past hires’ performance.
But when AI is given a bigger role in recruiting, this can change. Tools like Textio, Gender Decoder, and Ongig use AI to scrutinize job descriptions for hidden biases around gender and other characteristics. Knockri, Ceridian, and Gapjumpers use AI to remove or ignore characteristics that identify gender, national origin, skin color, and age, so that hiring managers can focus purely on candidates’ qualifications and experience. Some of these solutions also reduce recency bias, affinity bias, and gender bias from the interview process by evaluating candidates’ soft skills on an objective basis or altering a candidate’s phone voice to mask their gender.
Removing Bias in Venture Capital Decision Making with AI
A similar approach can be taken in the world of venture capital, where men comprise 80% of partners and women, receive just 2.2% of all investment, despite being founders of 40% of new startups. The UK accelerator Founders Factory, for instance, wrote software that short-lists program candidates on the basis of identifiable entrepreneurial success characteristics. Likewise, the female-run non-profit F4capital developed a “FICO score for Startups,” which profiles startups’ maturity, opportunity, and risk as a means to eliminate bias in the venture decision-making process. This approach should be adopted widely not just because it is the ethical thing to do, but because it delivers better returns— as much as 184% higher than investments made without the help of AI.
Reducing Cognitive Bias with AI in the Medical Field
AI can also help make better decisions in healthcare. Medical diagnostic company Flow Health, for instance, is committed to the use of AI to overcome the cognitive biases that it says doctors often use to diagnose patients. The “availability heuristic,” for instance, encourages physicians to make a diagnosis that is common, but sometimes incorrect, while the “anchoring heuristic” leads them to stick to incorrect initial diagnoses, even when new information contradicts them. I believe that AI will become an essential part of the fast-approaching world of data-driven, personalized medicine.
Other Areas where AI Can Reduce Common Biases
AI can even help reduce less malignant, but still very powerful biases that too often cloud our business judgment. Consider the bias (in English-speaking countries) towards information published in English versus other languages, the bias in the startup world against older people, despite their greater knowledge and experience, and the bias in manufacturing to use the same vendors and methods, rather than trying new, and potentially better ways. Don’t forget the biases that lead executives in supply chain management and investors on Wall Street to make emotional, short-term decisions during hard economic times.
Giving AI a role to play in all of these areas is a useful check against unrecognized biases in your decision-making process.
AI can even be used to reduce bias in AI
If to err is human, AI may be the solution we need to avoid the costly and unethical outcomes of our hidden biases. But what about the intrusion of those biases into the AI itself? If AI misinterprets biased data and amplifies biased human heuristics, how can it ever be a useful solution?
There are now tools designed to weed out implicit human and data biases that surreptitiously make their way into Artificial Intelligence. The What-If tool, developed by Google’s People and AI Research team (PAIR), allows developers to probe the performance of AI using a broad library of “fairness indicators” while PWC’s Bias Analyzer tool, IBM Research’s AI Fairness 360 tool and O’Reilly’s LIME tool each helps you identify the existence of bias in your AI code.
If you are a senior executive or a board member thinking about ways that AI might be able to reduce bias in your organization (this is, after all, why I write this column), I urge you to think about AI as a promising new weapon in your arsenal, not as a silver bullet that will solve the problem in its entirety. Holistically and practically speaking, you still need to create bias reduction benchmarks, train your staff to recognize and avoid hidden biases, and collect outside feedback from customers, vendors, or consultants. Not only are bias audits a good idea, in some instances, they are the law.
If you care about how AI is determining the winners and losers in business, and how you can leverage AI for the benefit of your organization, I encourage you to stay tuned. I write (almost) exclusively about how senior executives, board members, and other business leaders can use AI effectively.

In 2019, the drug discovery process took ~15 yearsOpens a new window  and cost several billion dollars.
Today, it takes four to five years, on average, to search for a new drug candidate.
Innovative companies produce first-in-class drug compounds within seven months.
Artificial intelligence solves drug-discovery problems in much less time and at a much lower cost.
While some of the world’s brightest minds work in this industry, it doesn’t take a PhD in quantum science and engineering to predict that AI would make a fine lab partner. That’s a no-brainer. But even the most intelligent people have limitations, so they invented AI to to handle abundant data efficiently and extract information pertinent to projects and pipelines.
Why AI for Drug Discovery?
In short, AI produces better results faster. The technology allows researchers to discover new drug candidates, advance treatment of diseases from cancer to Crohn’s, and reap the advantage of scale without the false-start drawbacks associated with traditional research and development methods.
AI can provide new answers in biology and chemistry that humans have not yet considered. Standigm, for example, has novel target identification (biology) and lead generation (chemistry) AI – proprietary platforms that generate commercially valuable drug pipelines. By contrast, humans cannot keep up with the rapidly increasing scientific literature. Manual information gathering and expert-only knowledge can only take biotech so far. AI can overcome many more constraints and challenges in the drug discovery industry.
Molecule Modeling and Prediction
Target identification is a big challenge in therapeutics. Although most AI-based drug discovery companies focus on creating new compounds and re-creating new drugs, only a few companies have the technology to discover new targets.  AI streamlines target research. Modeling provides evidence for prediction and significantly improves the success rate.
Based on the vast biomedical information known to date, deep-learning knowledge graph analysis can align specific diseases with the proteins capable of targeting them. AI drug discovery companies are developing methodologies for scoring and ranking protein candidates and disease candidates expected to target specific proteins. Random-walk models apply RNA profile data. Metabolic models incorporate genetic information. Meta-learning-based drug-target binding predictors produce higher prediction accuracy and outperform baseline models.
Modern novel-compound lead design outshines traditional methods by applying advanced algorithms – Monet, NoSH, ChemMap, and IDEA-STAR for deep-learning-based structure/substructure optimization, scaffold hopping, and active learning – to generate patentable lead compounds for given targets.
Molecule modeling, including efficient models to encode graphs, is a key challenge of molecular representation learning. Transformer is a natural choice for graph processing but requires explicit incorporation of positional information. Existing approaches either linearize a graph to encode absolution position in the sequence of nodes – which loses the precision of relative position from linearization – or use bias terms to encode a relative position with another node – which loses the tight integration of node-edge and node-spatial information. Relative positional encoding, however, lacks these weaknesses. Methods to encode a graph without linearization, considering both node-spatial relation and node-edge relation, are more successful.
More sophisticated modeling and simulation methods are making more accurate predictions, including receiver conformer generation, ligand pose prediction, enviable docking, and free energy permission. Scientists then work to optimize the structure of lead compounds concerning the desired chemical properties, such as biological activities and ADME/Tox properties. Researchers can use this information to select the best molecule for further investigation. Down the line, they can determine whether making a compound would be easy or difficult.
Performing this advanced modeling first will eliminate a lot of trial-and-error experimentation later. Rather than doubling down on the time-consuming, people-intensive, physical experiments, biotech companies are pouring efforts into improving AI/machine learning (ML) approaches.
Automated Molecular Design Workflow AI
Other AI drug discovery trends include platforms that generate new drug candidates for a given target, and platforms that mine data from already-approved drugs for drug repurposing. What sets modern, innovative drug discovery endeavors above and apart from competitors is a more advanced iteration of artificial intelligence called Workflow AI, an automated molecular design workflow that can cover the entire drug discovery process.
Workflow AI will one day complete a closed-loop system of interconnected AI platforms whereby any data produced in any project is fed back for continuous improvement. This type of machine learning will reduce the resources necessary to secure patentable lead compounds inhibiting a novel drug target.

Competition vs. Shared Experience
Competition for drug and AI algorithm patents may be fierce, and production of platforms may be proprietary, yet still some of the best resources out there are free and readily available to researchers anywhere. A public user interface that essentially hands anyone the keys to one of the core functions of modern drug discovery. Scientists can enter the interactive environment – an AI-based target-identification platform with natural language processing technology combined with a pharmaceutical research platform – to explore, experiment, and discover new targets. The interface offers to prioritize protein targets for a given disease, then provides results on a graph with evidence of key paths among the disease-target connections.
The open interface offers a simple search bar to collect information from thousands of pages of scientific literature as well as numerous biomedical databases. It extracts the latest updates on gene-disease association from textual data, like scientific publication abstracts. Users can also check out a customized database where scientists and developers in the research ecosystem (pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, and academic institutions) can add their data to potentially uncover new targets. The interface has encouraged drug discovery research in specialized fields, including rare-disease areas.
The Ultimate Goal in AI Drug Discovery
AI drug discovery companies are quickly partnering, both publicly and privately, with pharmaceutical giants, biopharma companies, universities, and research institutes. Together, their pipelines are producing strong opportunities for treatments for diseases with high unmet medical needs, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Crohn’s disease, mitochondrial disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic liver disease (NASH), conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, and the list goes on. The collaborations will change the medical world and the world at large.

						Artificial Intelligence Enters Stem Cell Research

A major step forward in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for scientific discovery in the field of stem cell research was recently reported1, reflecting the continued growth of the technology and stressing the need for clarification on patents for AI-generated work.  
Kanda et al. created a humanoid robotic AI system that can plan and execute experiments to develop optimized protocols for differentiation of stem cells into desired therapeutically relevant cell types. In particular, the system tested cell culture conditions for differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into retinal pigment epithelial cells (iPSC-RPE cells) based on a pre-optimized protocol, evaluated the results of particular cell culture conditions by image analysis of pigment producing cells, and planned the next experiments based on the results to develop an improved protocol for producing iPSC-RPE cells. The AI system tested 143 different conditions from 200 million possible parameter combinations in 111 days to achieve 88% better iPSC-RPE generation compared to the preexisting protocol. Accordingly, Kanda et al. concluded that the robotic AI system could drastically accelerate “systematic and unbiased exploration of experimental search space, suggesting immense use in medicine and research.” 
It should be noted that the tests relied on using a pre-optimized protocol that narrowed down the search space, and the chosen cellular system is particularly conducive for AI systems to handle because pigment producing cells can be easily evaluated by image processing to score the tested protocol. Optimizing protocols for producing cells when the initial protocol is not as well established as for iPSC-RPE cells, and when the evaluation score is a more complex cellular function than pigment production, may still be challenging for AI systems without any human intervention. Nevertheless, the progress reported by Kanda et al. marks a notable benchmark in using AI to boost scientific discovery in stem cell research, as a very large experimental search space could be explored over relatively short time without human intervention.
With AI and machine learning increasingly used for scientific discovery and innovation as reflected by Kanda et al., it is important to note that AI systems and AI-generated work pose a challenge for the patent system. For example, an AI system itself cannot be a patent inventor because, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the inventor must be a “natural person.”2 Accordingly, if an invention is based on experiments proposed and executed by an AI system without any human intervention, disputes concerning inventorship could arise. Stakeholders should take great care to identify inventions generated by AI systems and human counterparts to ensure that the intellectual property is protected.

(Gabby Jones/Bloomberg News)By  Naomi NixJuly 19, 2022 at 5:00 a.m. EDTFacebook was one of an array of companies to dramatically restructure remote work during the coronavirus pandemic, allowing employees to continue working from home while they avoided the spread of covid-19.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeNow, Facebook Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams said there was an unexpected benefit to that workplace overhaul: it helped the company recruit and retain workers from underrepresented groups.In the United States, remote job offers were more likely to be filled by people of color, people with disabilities and veterans, according to the company’s annual diversity report. Around the world, candidates who accepted remote job offers were also more likely to be women, the company found.Story continues below advertisementAmong existing employees, people from underrepresented groups were more likely to opt to work remotely, according to Williams. She said the company is still studying why people from underrepresented groups are choosing remote work, but speculated some workers are seeking to locate where they feel more at home.Advertisement“Silicon Valley was never a place where Black people were predominant,” Williams said in an interview with The Post. “So you are seeing people choose places like Atlanta, New York.”For some workers, office mandates aren’t just a pain. They’re harmful.The report illuminates how the workforce at Facebook, which last year renamed itself Meta, is evolving as the company continues to expand its remote work options after pandemic-induced lockdowns subside. After more than two years of letting employees work from home, Facebook, like many companies, is evaluating the impact of these changes.Story continues below advertisementFacebook gradually made some remote options more permanent last year. Any Facebook worker can now ask to work remotely, and nearly 90 percent of such requests are granted, according to the company. Employees who opt to work remotely may receive an adjustment in their pay if they move to a location with a different cost of living.AdvertisementWorkers can also choose to work at home, under rules determined by their individual teams. Roughly 75 percent of Facebook teams have employees working together from different geographic locations, according to the company.💻Follow TechnologyFollowBetween 2021 and 2022, Facebook saw slight jumps in the share of Black, Hispanic, multiracial and Asian employees in its U.S. workforce, while White workers dropped by 1.5 percentage points, according to the report. Leaders at the company also became more diverse, with the share of Black and Hispanic managers increasing by less than half a percentage point, it said. The share of women leaders increased from 35.5 percent in 2021 to 36.7 percent in 2022.Story continues below advertisementOverall, the share of women in the workforce increased to 37.1 percent in 2022 from 36.7 percent in 2021, according to the report.AdvertisementRemote work might be particularly attractive to people of color who are more likely to experience subtle — and often unintended — expressions of bias, known as microaggressions, in the workplace. They might, for instance, be mistaken for another colleague of the same race or be pressured to discuss a traumatizing news event related to their community.

Meanwhile, 52 percent of women around the world reported that they wanted work location flexibility at least three days a week, compared with just 46 percent of men.AdvertisementBut Facebook’s continued push to diversify its workforce is likely to face some challenges, especially as tech companies slow their hiring amid concerns of a looming recession sparked by rising interest rates.Silicon Valley braces for tech pullback after a decade of decadenceThe social media giant’s stock has declined more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year as it faces a barrage of marketplace pressures, including competition from upstarts such as TikTok. Facebook executives have already indicated that they are reevaluating their current workforce makeup to address the mounting pressures.Williams, the company’s chief diversity officer, said Facebook has strategies to continue diversifying its workforce despite the company’s mounting economic challenges.“Look it’s been a challenge from the jump. That’s the truth,” she said. “We are very hyper focused on how are we going to do this given the current environment.”Share12 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Monarch Tractors, maker of a fully-electric, driver-optional, smart tractor, has entered a partnership with Einsite, an India-based start-up specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine vision analytics.



Einsite uses machine-mounted and camera sensors to capture site activity, and in-cab edge computers to form insights to help managers make better decisions. The company has already deployed its tech on several construction sites and mines across the United States and India. In its partnership with Monarch, the Einsite engineering team will be working on the development of edge applications, autonomy models, and algorithms.

""Edge AI"" is the deployment of AI applications in devices used in the physical world, according to Nvidia Corporation. It's named ""edge"" because the computation is done near the user at the edge of the network, close to where the data is located, rather than being relayed to a central cloud computing facility or data center. This reduces latency in computing and can mean accelerated data analysis and faster decision-making by the AI.







For Monarch, edge AI means the tractor can filter, analyze, and make decisions locally on the tractor itself, instead of sending the sensory data over the cloud for processing. In agriculture, where limited data connectivity is often a challenge for farmers, Monarch's tractors can't rely on data availability to function. The edge AI, along with Monarch's other technology, allows the tractor to operate without internet connection.

""We have found strong synergy with Einsite in both our missions and areas of work,"" says Praveen Penmetsa, co-founder and CEO of Monarch Tractor. ""Einsite's mission of making dynamic, outdoor industries more productive aligns with our goal of modernizing the farm.""

This partnership is part of Monarch's plan to expand its footprint in India, with the opening of its first office in the city of Hyderabad. Penmetsa says Monarch and Einsite are in the same technology space using vision AI technology to increase the efficiency of operations, namely in farming and construction, making them a natural partner for the new office.



""We're proud to partner with the Monarch team and share our joint expertise to maximize autonomous solutions that enable farmers to achieve new levels of productivity,"" says Anirudh Reddy, founder of Einsite.

These biases result in biased machine learning models since data from tech platforms is later utilized to train them..Facebook started allowing advertisers to specifically target ads based on race, gender, and religion in 2019. For example, women were given preference in employment advertisements for nursing or secretarial positions, whereas job advertisements for janitors and taxi drivers were mostly displayed to men, particularly those from minority backgrounds..As a result, Facebook will no longer permit businesses to tailor their ads based on age, gender, or race..Amazon's biased recruiting tool.In 2014, Amazon started working on an AI technology to streamline the hiring procedure. Their research focused primarily on screening resumes and assessing candidates using AI-powered algorithms, saving recruiters' time from manual resume screening activities. Amazon, however, noticed in 2015 that its new AI hiring algorithm was biased against women and was not objectively grading candidates..Amazon had trained their AI model using historical data going back ten years. Since men predominated in the IT field and made up 60% of Amazon's workforce, historical data held biases against women. As a result, Amazon's hiring software mistakenly discovered that male candidates were preferred. The term &quot;women's,&quot; as in &quot;women's chess club captain,&quot; was penalized on resumes. As a result, Amazon ceased applying the algorithm to hiring..Racial bias in healthcare risk algorithm.More than 200 million Americans use a health risk-prediction system, but it showed racial bias because it employed a flawed criterion to assess need..The algorithm was created to identify patients who would probably benefit from additional medical attention; however, it was later discovered that the program was giving incorrect findings that favored white patients over black patients..The algorithm's creators substituted prior patients' medical expenses for actual medical needs. Since wealth and race are strongly associated metrics, this was a poor interpretation of the historical information because the algorithm produced false findings when assumptions were based on only one component of the linked metrics..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — The U.S. Department of Defense has selected George Karniadakis, a Brown University professor of applied math and engineering, as a 2022 Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellow.
Karniadakis is one of nine scientists and engineers from across the nation to receive the fellowship — the most prestigious research grant award from the Department of Defense, named for Vannevar Bush, who directed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development after World War II. In line with Bush’s vision, the fellowship aims to advance transformative, university-based fundamental research. Each fellow receives up to $3 million over a five-year term to pursue cutting-edge fundamental research.
Karniadakis was at a scientific conference in Oslo, Norway, when he learned that he had been selected for the fellowship.
“The director of basic research at the U.S. Department of Defense, Dr. Bindu Nair, called me via Zoom and asked me if I had enough bandwidth to take on this project,” Karniadakis said. “I told her that of course, this is a major priority for me. Dr. Nair responded, ‘Well then, congratulations!’ I was very happy.”
A focus of Karniadakis’ research is machine learning for scientific computing, and his team at Brown has been developing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that can be used in artificial intelligence applications. He said that all mobile platforms, including robots, airplanes and self-driving cars, have sensors that accumulate data. The processing of this data by supercomputers based on the current class of artificial neurons, or artificial neural networks, is not only wildly expensive in terms of financial cost but also in terms of energy.
His new objective is to accelerate PINNs by a factor of 1,000 using spiking neural networks, which function more like human neurons and consume much less energy. Large companies like Intel and IBM have recently built computers that can be used for this new generation of neural networks.

It has become urgent to speed up efforts to restructure Singapore's workforce in order to promote sustained future and growth as the country navigates its post-pandemic course. In order to achieve this, businesses must improve their capacity to generate new, in-demand positions, alter existing job roles, and upskill employees to acquire skills that will be essential to their success in the future.With new technologies, artificial intelligence and automation emerging in workplaces at a rapid pace, the future of work is likely to look vastly different from how it does today. So, how is Singapore future-proofing in such an environment? Let&rsquo;s take a look.Future proofing employees through re-skilling and upskillingThe workplace of the future is already here, and employees' current abilities will either need to be updated or will become obsolete far faster than in the past. It has never been more important for businesses to retrain and upskill their workforce. By 2025, more than half of all employees will need to reskill or upskill in order to remain competitive, according to World Economic Forum research.Since 2008, upskilling and reskilling the workforce has been a national priority for Singapore. In his speech introducing the Singapore Budget 2022 this year, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated the importance of empowering and preparing Singaporeans for their lifelong journey to learn new skills and hone existing ones.There has never been a clearer need for firms to retrain and upskill their workforce. Employees are less inclined to look for jobs at other organisations when they feel their employer is investing in their growth and development.To help local enterprises and workers adapt to changing economic conditions and continuously update their skills, Singapore&rsquo;s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has launched several initiatives including SkillsFuture for Enterprises (SFE) and Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) among others that aim to invest in and future proof employees through re-skilling and digitising employment services.Forging ahead with the most favourable hiring outlook in almost 11 years For the second quarter of this year, employers in Singapore have voiced the most optimistic recruiting outlook in over 11 years.From a peak of 3.6% to 2.2%, unemployment rates continued to move downward to pre-pandemic levels.In recent years, MOM has assisted many job searchers in moving into new opportunities by helping firms hire and invest in the abilities of a larger pool of job seekers. It also secured local-foreign complementarity and encouraged corporate transformation through revised work pass criteria. Aside from these unusual measures, the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package and the Jobs Growth Incentive were also implemented with the intention of preserving human capital and increasing local hiring.Singapore&rsquo;s digital economy to reach USD22 billion by 2025The Singaporean government stated in Budget 2022 that it will allocate an additional $200 million over the following few years to programmes that improve the digital capabilities of firms and employees. Among these is the TechSkills Accelerator, which aims to train a workforce with knowledge of information and communication technologies for Singapore's digital economy.Singapore's Internet economy had a value of $9 billion in 2020, according to recent research by Google and Temasek, but it may increase by another 19 percent a year to reach a value of USD22 billion by 2025.Ageing gracefully: Leveraging Singapore&rsquo;s silver workforceThe workforce in Singapore is coping with the dual problems of an ageing population and technological job displacement. Singapore's Education Minister Ong Ye Kung claims that for the past 20 years, the government has been preparing for the challenge of an ageing workforce. Between 2016 and 2030, employees aged over 50 will be the fastest growing demographic and their number is projected to increase by 55 percent, representing 40 percent of the workforce.The new policy brings the most awaited change with the raising of Singapore&rsquo;s retirement age from 62 to 65, as well as the re-employment age from 67 to 70, by 2030.Refresh Singapore&rsquo;s retirement, re-employment framework and strengthening older workers&rsquo; retirement adequacy in order to promote inclusive and progressive workplaces that value silver workers has been proven as a great step towards creating a progressive workplaces for its ageing population.Upgrading, uplifting, and upholding the workforceSingapore&rsquo;s Ministry of Manpower (MOM)is aiming to support businesses in hiring and investing in the skills of a wider pool of jobseekers, and helping job seekers move into new opportunities. Through regularised work pass needs, it is also trying to ensure local-foreign complementarity and spurred business transformation.MOM&rsquo;s priorities are focusing on three UPs: Upgrade, Uplift, and Uphold. The focus is to upgrade the capabilities of locals and the complementarity of foreigners.

Today, Israel National Digital Agency CEO, Shira Lev Ami, spoke at the plan launch conference on the relation between the government Data revolution and the promotion of AI in the public sector.  Lev-Ami: ""Our challenge is to create smart solutions to the core challenges of Israeli society and to improve public service. You can look at AI as the luxury penthouse built over a multistory building of Data & Digital infrastructure. I wish I could say that our current main challenge is on the AI floor. However, the reality is that on the way to building this penthouse floor, we still have a lot of work to do. You have to build the foundations of this building, and step up gradually, through Data collection, Data processing, making Data accessible to researchers, digital transformation of the government. This building does not have an elevator that takes you straight to the roof floor. Therefore, Israel National Digital Agency currently being established, has set itself the goal of making a leap forward in the government's ability to use Data & Digital in order to work smartly for the citizens. Investing in government Data and making it accessible to the industry, academy and the government itself, will lead to Data-driven decision-making, improved service to the public, and a leap forward in the effectiveness of government activity, for the benefit of health, welfare, education, and economy in Israel.

In this post-pandemic era, it has become a prerequisite for SaaS organizations to realign their business processes with Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI brings several capabilities, such as complexity, scalability, adaptability, and product customization. Not just these, the adoption of AI also helps businesses make data-driven decisions.
While all business aspects have benefited from the adoption of AI, Customer Success has been among the top. AI has significantly impacted how businesses deliver a customer experience, leading to customer success.
Several factors leading to customer success – easy onboarding, quick support, and engagement activities – have become more efficient with the adoption of AI.
Global CSMs have already identified this, and according to them, AI is here to stay and do more for customer success. In this article, we will see how AI is helping Customer Success today and how it will impact the future.
We have carried out a comprehensive customer success survey for 2022 that has helped us provide invaluable insights to you. So, without further ado, let us dig deep into the world of artificial intelligence and the future of customer success.
AI and Customer Success: In the Present
System intelligence is one of the biggest strengths of Artificial Intelligence. “AI collects and analyzes customer data, provides in-depth insights, and thus builds intelligent systems,” says Boris Jabes, CEO of Census. CSMs can personalize their offerings and communication by making these intelligent systems the source. This way, organizations can achieve greater customer success and improve service revenues.
AI applications also ensure that used customer data is not siloed and is distributed easily via a knowledge base among CSM, customer service, financials, and selling systems. Thus, there is very little chance for data-blind spots; with a real-time flow of customer and financial data, it is much more efficient for CSM platforms to have a 360-degree view of the customers.
Further, these knowledge bases also help teams to –

Use the insights to come up with new and innovative solutions.
Navigate the relevant customer data.
Help identify the data/ areas that are no longer relevant.
Giving recommendations to solve current and future issues.

Customer success automation has been yet another interesting benefit brought forward by AI. “For any business to succeed, it is important that the organization as a whole work towards making all possible efforts to keep its customers happy and satisfied throughout their journey,” says Joey Sasson, Vice President of Sales & Logistics at Moving APT.
A key resource for taking up the responsibility is the CSM. They play an intermediary between the organization and the customer, ensuring that the customers face no issues with the product or the brand. They keep monitoring customer actions at different touchpoints, from customer onboarding to post-purchase feedback and renewal of the product.
Additionally, CSMs are also responsible for crafting and engaging customer experiences that will foster positive and long-term customer relationships. This is a time extensive and also demands a lot of effort and dedication. The CSMs need access to data from almost all organization departments, including marketing and sales, product departments, finance, etc.
Artificial intelligence walks in to make this job much easier while also enhancing its productivity. For instance, it derives proper patterns from customer data and helps understand what exactly a customer needs and desires. It also shows potential data gaps and provides options for how to fill them.
So far, we have discussed AI’s ability to collect and analyze data. However, its abilities to predict future actions is also worthy of mentioning. Along with data collection and generation of valuable customer insights, AI can predict the customers’ future actions based on its predictive analytics capabilities. Now, this ability is quite futuristic and can help CSMs develop better customer nurturing and gain new customers.
AI and Customer Success: In the Future
When discussing the future of customer success, AI will cast a lasting impression on how services are delivered. As we are already seeing, AI increases the precision with which organizations get in touch with customers. At the same time, it also helps create greater levels of engagement with potential customers.
One of the biggest examples of this is using artificial customer service agents. AI-powered intelligent agents leverage automation to deliver next-level responsiveness. This may not be possible with humans.

Today, we can see that Al agents are already replacing human customer service agents at some levels. However, after a certain point, customers show more confidence in engaging with human executives to solve their issues and resolve queries. This, too, is facilitated by AI – the machine listens to and records discussions in real time and then feeds this information to the human representative. Based on this, the human executive provides appropriate resolution.
This can be a very valuable asset for the future because the scale at which the AI assistants deliver their services is quite fast, something that is not achievable for humans. Therefore, AI assistants and human representatives’ support can make a huge difference in how customer service is delivered.
Self-service is yet another AI capability set to change the future of customer success. AI has made self-service interfaces a reality. We have already seen them, and they will become commonplace shortly. With self-service, customers are empowered to decide their course of action without any intervention. It is also much more convenient and time-saving. Additionally, using the customer data gathered earlier, AI can offer predictions and insights so the services can be personalized for individual customers. CSMs say they have seen a significant increase in customer satisfaction, acquisition, and retention.
Cost efficiency is another benefit of AI. While this is often overlooked owing to other impressive benefits of AI, the cost-effectiveness of AI adoption makes it invaluable for the future.
AI will certainly make self-service interfaces a reality shortly. However, AI can also capture and analyze data to achieve an excellent customer service experience. Al can help identify customer issues, determine preferences based on past choices, and respond with a most-suited solution. Studies hint that personalization will be the key in the future, and AI is a perfect solution to offer personalized offers, solutions, suggestions, and even resolve queries before they arrive.
Here are some of the benefits of AI that although may look superficial may overpower the end results. AI-powered assistants are available 24/7, and at the same time, they automate most of the tasks performed by human representatives. Thus, they save on the expenditure of most intermediatory resources.
Wrapping it up
All organizations, especially the ones offering SaaS products, need to amplify their efforts to satisfy their customers and ensure customer success. AI is a way to do this, especially as the business scenarios become more and more customer-centric.
PS: While AI is definitely an asset to Customer Success, and it is already replacing the need for human agents at certain points, human interferences are still required to operate the tools.

Artificial intelligence has come to stay in the health care industry. The term refers to a constellation of computational tools that can comb through vast troves of data at rates far surpassing human ability, in a way that can streamline providers’ jobs. Some types of AI commonly found in health care already are:

Machine learning AI, where a computer trains on datasets and “learns” to, for example, identify patients who would do well with a certain treatment.
Natural language processing AI, which can identify the human voice, and might transcribe a doctor’s clinical notes.
Rules-based AI, where computers train to act in a specific way if a particular data point shows up–these kinds of AI are commonly used in electronic medical records to perhaps flag a patient who has missed their last two appointments.

Regardless of the specific type of AI, these tools are generally capable of making a massive, complex industry run more efficiently. But several studies show it can also propagate racial biases, leading to misdiagnosis of medical conditions among people of color, insufficient treatment of pain, under-prescription of life-affirming medications, and more. Many patients don’t even know they’ve been enrolled in healthcare algorithms that are influencing their care and outcomes.
A growing body of research shows a paradox, however. While some algorithms do indeed exacerbate inequitable medical care, other algorithms can actually close such gaps.
Popular press tends to cover AI in medicine only when something goes wrong. While such reports are critical in holding institutions to account, they can also paint the picture that when AI enters health care, trouble is always around the corner. If done correctly, AI can actually make health care fairer for more people.
Historically, much of the research in the medical sciences and in the biological sciences has relied on subject pools of white—often male—people of European ancestry. These foundational studies on everything from normal internal body temperature to heart disease become the stuff of textbooks and trainings that doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals engage with as they move up the professional ladder.
However, those studies offer a limited, one-size-fits-all view of human health that opens the door to racial bias—which patients get treated and how. The most easily graspable example of this type of knowledge gone wrong is consulting images of white skin to diagnose dermatological diseases across all skin types, when such diseases may manifest in unique ways depending on the pigmentation of someone’s skin.
When AI is trained by data that lack diversity, then it is more likely to mimic the same racial bias that healthcare professionals can themselves exhibit. A poorly structured AI training dataset is no better (and in fact is sometimes worse) than a human with a medical degree predicated on lessons learned about the health of primarily white patients.
On the flipside, when AI is trained on datasets that include information from a diverse population of patients, it can help move the health care field away from deep-seated biases.
Below are summaries of some of the research on the intersection of AI and race.  
Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations
Ziad Obermeyer, Brian Powers, Christine Vogeli, and Sendhil Mullainathan. Science, October 2019.
What the researchers focused on: This study dove into how a nationally circulated health care algorithm perpetuated the under-serving of Black patients as compared with white patients. Such algorithms have the potential to do immense harm, by replicating the same racial biases in play by humans, but at an even more massive scale, the authors write.
What they found: Commercially applied risk-prediction algorithms are among the most common types of AI the health care industry currently uses. They’re applied to the care of some 200 million Americans every year. In this study, researchers show one unnamed algorithm assigned Black patients the same level of health risk as white patients, when in reality the Black patients were sicker.
The researchers learned that the machine-learning algorithm had trained itself to to see health care costs as a proxy for a patient’s level of health, when in reality it is reflective of the health care industry’s inequitable investment in some patient populations over others.
In other words, the algorithm assumed that because it cost hospitals less to care for Black patients, Black patients were healthier and required less care. However, hospital costs are lower for Black patients even when they are sicker than white patients, because hospitals funnel fewer resources toward the care of sick Black patients. The researchers suggest that training the algorithm not to equate cost with health would undo this tripwire.   
What researchers did with their findings: “After completing the analyses described above, we contacted the algorithm manufacturer for an initial discussion of our results,” the authors write. “In response, the manufacturer independently replicated our analyses on its national dataset of 3,695,943 commercially insured patients. This effort confirmed our results—by one measure of predictive bias calculated in their dataset, Black patients had 48,772 more active chronic conditions than White patients, conditional on risk score—illustrating how biases can indeed arise inadvertently.”
Researchers then began experimenting with solutions with the algorithm manufacturer and have already made improvements in the product.
“Of course, our experience may not be typical of all algorithm developers in this sector,” they write. “But because the manufacturer of the algorithm we study is widely viewed as an industry leader in data and analytics, we are hopeful that this endeavor will prompt other manufacturers to implement similar fixes.”
AI Recognition of Patient Race in Medical Imaging: A Modelling Study
Judy Wawira Gichoya; et al. The Lancet: Digital Health, May 2022.
What the researchers focused on: Previous research has shown that AI can be trained to detect a person’s race from medical images, even though human experts who are looking at the images aren’t able to tell the patient’s race just from looking at those images. The authors wanted to find out more about AI’s ability to recognize a patient’s race from medical images.           They analyzed a total of 680,201 chest X-rays across 3 datasets where Black patients comprised 4.8% to 46.8% of the subjects, white patients 42.1% to 64.1%, Asian patients 3.6% to 10.8%; 458,317 chest CTs also across 3 datasets where Black patients comprised 9.1% to 72% of the subjects, white patients 28% to 90.9% and Asian patients were unrepresented; 691 digital radiography X-rays where Black patients comprised 48.2% of the subjects, white patients 51.8%, and Asian patients were unrepresented; 86,669 breast mammograms where Black patients comprised 50.4% of the subjects, white patients 49.6% and Asian patients were unrepresented; and 10,358 lateral c-spine X-rays where Black patients comprised 24.8% of the subjects, white patients 75.2%, and Asian patients were unrepresented. The images themselves contained no racial information and represented different degrees of image clarity, full and cropped views and other variations.   
What they found: The deep learning model was able to identify a patient’s race accurately from medical images that contained no identifiable racial information. Researchers thought perhaps the model was learning to do this by matching known health outcomes with racial information.
There is “evidence that Black patients have a higher adjusted bone mineral density and a slower age-adjusted annual rate of decline in bone mineral density than White patients,” the researchers write, so they thought perhaps they could trick the model by cropping out parts of medical images that showed such characteristic bone density information. Even still, the model was able to identify the patient’s race from the images. “This finding is striking as this task is generally not understood to be possible for human experts,” the authors write.
How they explain it: “The results from our study emphasize that the ability of AI deep learning models to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging,” the researchers write. “The regulatory environment in particular, while evolving, has not yet produced strong processes to guard against unexpected racial recognition by AI models; either to identify these capabilities in models or to mitigate the harms that might be caused.”
An Algorithmic Approach to Reducing Unexplained Pain Disparities in Underserved Populations
Emma Pierson; et al. Nature Medicine, January 2021.
What the researchers focused on: Previous research has shown Black patients are more likely than white patients to have their pain dismissed and untreated. One example is knee pain due to osteoarthritis. Researchers wanted to find out if an AI could undo biases in how knee pain is diagnosed and treated.
What they found: The researchers used a deep learning model trained on X-rays of osteoarthritis in the knee of 2,877 patients —18% of whom were Black, 38% were low-income, and 39% were non-college graduates  —  to predict the level of pain a patient would be expected to have based on the progression of their osteoarthritis. The model was better at assigning pain levels to underserved patients than human radiologists. The researchers conclude that the model was able to predict pain even when the imaging did not necessarily show the expected level of disease severity. That’s because patients of color are more likely than white patients to have “factors external to the knee” that influence their level of pain, such as work conditions and higher stress, the researchers write. In other words, the same level of osteoarthritis severity can result in very different levels of pain depending on the patient population, and evaluating a patient without that context can lead to underdiagnosis for underserved patients. In this case, an AI could solve an issue that persists because of human racial bias.
How they explain it: “In addition to raising important questions regarding how we understand potential sources of pain, our results have implications for the determination of who receives arthroplasty for knee pain … Consequently, we hypothesize that underserved patients with disabling pain but without severe radiographic disease could be less likely to receive surgical treatments and more likely to be offered non-specific therapies for pain. This approach could lead to overuse of pharmacological remedies, including opioids, for underserved patients and contribute to the well-documented disparities in access to knee arthroplasty.”

Amgen’s latest podcast, ""The Generative Biology Revolution,"" follows the success of its earlier “DNA Unlocked” and “Undruggable” podcasts, which the drugmaker rolled out during the second half of 2021. (AmgenFlag)
Amgen is tapping into the rising popularity of audio streaming with its latest podcast about generative biology, an emerging field that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover and develop new biologic drugs.The four-part series, ""The Generative Biology Revolution,"" debuted June 22 and is hosted by Ray Deshaies, Ph.D., Amgen’s senior vice president of global research.In each episode, Deshaies chats with scientists within Amgen as well as experts from outside research institutions about how AI and machine learning can make drug discovery “more predictable, shorten timelines and increase success rates of bringing life-saving medicines to patients who need them most.”“Our primary goal with The Generative Biology Revolution is to communicate the excitement of the potential this field has for advancing drug discovery and development at Amgen and throughout the industry,” Michael Strapazon, Amgen director of corporate affairs, told Fierce Pharma Marketing in an email.RelatedPharma marketers are tuning in to audio's popularity, but there's still plenty of room to grow, experts sayThe podcast also gives the company a chance to showcase its scientists and their research, which, as we’ve seen during the pandemic, can go a long way toward boosting the industry’s standing with the public.Podcasts are a way for the public to “hear the voices of our scientists and learn about how we and others in the industry approach the discovery and development of novel medicines for the most challenging diseases,” said Strapazon.“We’re very proud of our R&D scientists and our leadership, particularly in our unique areas of strength like world-class human genetics, disease biology and the molecular engineering expertise needed to design the right medicine for the right target,” he said.Amgen partnered with The Scientist’s “LabTalk,” well known in the scientific community, to produce the podcast, which is available to stream on all major platforms. While it primarily targets scientists, Deshaies aims to explain the complex science in a way that makes it accessible to a broader audience.In the first episode, he chats with Alan Russell, Ph.D., Amgen’s vice president of biologics, about how the company is working on harnessing AI to predict new sequences of proteins “with functions that we want them to have” so they can be better suited to treat a disease.

Using a surfing analogy, Russell said scientists can either “watch the waves breaking” or “figure out what are the surfboards that will allow us to surf that wave and will allow us to harness the power and the energy behind this new science.”RelatedDefinitive Healthcare launches a new podcast aimed at 'data-driven conversations' in healthcare“What the [Amgen] team did is they simply said, ‘OK, for each one of these waves, what are the surfboards? How do we build them? What do we need to put in place? How can we do our experiments in different ways? How can we create the systems that will generate the data that will power the algorithm? How do we deploy the automation?'” he explained in the episode.Amgen is one of a long list of pharma companies that have launched their own podcasts since Genentech rolled out the industry’s first with its “Two Scientists Walk into a Bar'' back in 2016. Other pharma podcasts include Eli Lilly’s “The Elixir Factor” and Pfizer's “The Antigen” while drugmakers like ViiV Healthcare, Novartis and Merck have launched podcasts specifically for patients with HIV, psoriasis and cancer.  Amgen’s latest podcast, which has a new episode out today (July 7) and another on July 14, follows the success of its earlier “DNA Unlocked” and “Undruggable” podcasts, which the drugmaker rolled out during the second half of 2021.And it won’t be the last. Amgen has two more podcasts in the pipeline for later in 2022, focusing on clinical trial innovation and the power of harnessing human data.

The dearth of AI professors at U.S. universities is not the result of a distorted job market, according to a recent report.

When the ride-hailing company Uber sought to establish a new facility in Pittsburgh in 2015 focused on self-driving cars, it looked to the researchers and scientists at the nearby Carnegie Mellon University robotics center. Soon after, the company lured away 40 of the center’s employees, including the director, with doubled salaries and bonuses in the hundreds of thousands.
High-profile stories like these have contributed to a prevailing narrative that artificial intelligence experts leave academe for industry in droves. But the dearth of AI professors at U.S. universities is not the result of a distorted job market, according to a report issued this month from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Rather, AI experts remain interested in academic careers, but university hiring of AI faculty has not kept pace with student demand. Though big tech has stepped in to fill some of the gap, some experts urge caution given that the industry’s incentive structure differs from that of academe.
Historically, academe has delivered a steady stream of developers, engineers and entrepreneurs that has fueled an AI innovation ecosystem. This stream has been directly correlated with AI faculty teaching capacity. But while student enrollment in computer science programs has skyrocketed in the past decade, universities have not hired enough computer science faculty to meet that demand. (The researchers used student demand for computer science as a proxy for student demand in AI, as the latter is difficult to quantify.)
In an apparent response to increased student demand, universities have restricted access to AI programs by limiting enrollment in high-demand classes, reducing the number of small-enrollment classes and tightening computer science admission requirements, according to Jack Corrigan, one of the report’s authors. At the same time, burgeoning numbers of computer science Ph.D. recipients have expressed interest in academic careers, but universities have not responded with a commensurate increase in faculty positions. Contrary to the prevailing narrative that industry poaching of computer science faculty is rampant, universities generally succeed when they seek to hire AI faculty.
Technology companies, for their part, have stepped in to pick up some of the student demand by offering alternative pathways to AI education and training.
“Tech companies are becoming the new ‘cauldrons of innovation’ and functional universities where innovation occurs,” said John Nosta, Google Health Advisory Board member and World Health Organization founding member of the digital health expert roster. Nosta noted that Google, for example, does not always require prospective employees to have earned bachelor of science degrees. “The excitement is no longer coming from the universities, but from innovative companies driving transformation like SpaceX, Amazon, Apple, OpenAI and other for-profit businesses that are leaving a traditional education model in the dust,” Nosta said. His view is that the trend is especially noteworthy in artificial intelligence.
Google is not the only company to have responded to the AI workforce shortage by removing the college degree requirement for some positions. IBM and Apple have also dropped the requirement, an effort they also expect may diversify the talent pool by providing access to those who did not have as many early-life opportunities.
“The jobs are there, and there’s one structural barrier we can remove,” former IBM Corporation chief executive Virginia Rometty told The Wall Street Journal last year. In place of a degree, she said IBM screens for a “propensity to learn” and provides training. The results? The “new-collar employees”—her term for those without a four-year degree—performed at a level that was equal or better than their college-educated co-workers.
Not everyone agrees that industry is the proper training ground for AI experts.
“I’d be loath to call the tech companies ‘universities,’” said Dan Rockmore, a computer science professor at Dartmouth College. “They are really only interested in a targeted set of skills—hardly universal ones—but I do think they are becoming a new kind of focused technical school.”
Rockmore agreed that university AI curricula do not always address marketplace needs but cautioned against relying on tech companies for AI education.
“This will be a narrowly trained group of workers whose products will have extraordinary ramifications on the ways we interact and are governed,” he said. “They build technocratic ‘solutions’ without the perspective of a broad education or possibly a broad and thoughtful outlook on the implications of the work.”
Others point to the historic interplay between higher education and the tech industry. Consider, for example, the field of computer graphics, suggested Cherri Pancake, an Oregon State University computer science professor and former Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) president.
“Nowadays, the vast majority of graphics practitioners are not specialists, though their work still relies on a core of specialists at universities and companies to keep driving the field forward.” Likewise, she noted that artificial intelligence, and specifically machine learning—a high-demand subfield of AI industry—is no different. Academics worked for decades to achieve cost-effective machine learning. “Now, everyone is crying out for that specialty, but the real need is for people who can apply [machine learning] in practical settings,” Pancake said.
She noted that this necessitates a different kind of education—one focused on safe use. “Universities now recognize this need, but it takes time to establish new curricula,” she said.
Some are frustrated by academe’s slow pace. For example, the Seattle Times editorial board penned an op-ed last month in which the editors lamented that colleges and universities in Washington—home of Microsoft headquarters—are “awarding computer-related degrees at less than half the rate the state’s tech companies are adding new positions—let alone filling openings for existing jobs.” They blamed not the students, who are interested in undergraduate computer science programs and technology careers, but the paucity of accessible training programs at the state’s universities. More than 7,500 incoming University of Washington first-year students applied for admission to the computer science and engineering school, they noted, but enrollment limitations likely mean that only 550 new undergraduates will enter in a given year.
Educating the next generation of AI scientists in the U.S. and beyond also weighs on the mind of Jim Hendler, director of the Institute for Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Computation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and chair of the ACM global technology policy council.
“ACM is seeing this issue arising not just in the U.S., but around the world,” he said. “Our curriculum committees are looking at not just college education, but whether some of these gaps could be filled by new programs in K-12 and particularly high school/precollege educational programs.”
While Corrigan acknowledged that industry has a role to play in developing AI talent, he advises policy makers and academic leaders to think critically about the role that universities play.
“The incentive structure for private companies is much different than the incentive structure for universities … If we want to develop the tech workforce in an equitable, just and socially optimal way, we should consider the incentives that are driving the behaviors of each of those actors.”

Job Description of a COBOL Programmer
A COBOL programmer is a technical professional whose primary skill is writing code in COmmon, Business-Oriented Language or COBOL, maintaining and testing COBOL codebases, and using relevant tools like ENDEVOR and Xpeditor. 
Common, Business-Oriented Language (COBOL) is a computer programming language that originated as a way for programmers to build programs that could run on several computers within the same enterprise. FORTRAN was its main rival at the time of its creation in 1959. In addition, unlike FORTRAN, it was designed for business rather than scientific applications.
COBOL was invented in 1959 by CODASYL and was partially based on Grace Hopper’s FLOW-MATIC programming language. It was created as part of a project by the United States Department of Defense to create a portable data processing programming language. The objective was to develop a language centered on business requirements. This entailed having English-like commands, the ability to handle massive volumes of data (for example, customer records), and significant reporting capabilities. 
COBOL programmers are people who work with and write programs using the COBOL programming language. They are often valuable for data science and corporate data processing. Typically, COBOL programmers create, build, and set up the code for new programs, evaluate them, and make any required revisions. 
With modern languages such as Java, Python, Swift, and many others receiving more attention than ever before during the era of social media and the fourth industrial revolution, the prevailing opinion is that COBOL is a dying language. However, this may not be entirely correct.

Why is COBOL important?
Despite being around for so many decades, COBOL remains a popular programming language and an important technical skill for developers. This is due to several reasons:

Given that legacy code is vast and complex, it is often difficult to maintain. Since governments and businesses widely use COBOL, there are still numerous COBOL systems that they must maintain.
As per Tom Taulli, the author of Modern Mainframe Development: COBOL, Databases, and Next-Generation Approaches, it facilitates over 80% of in-person financial services transactions and 95% of ATM swipes. It processes $3 trillion in commerce every day. Over 220 billion COBOL code streams exist, with 1.5 billion written each year.
It is especially beneficial for simple procedures–such as percentage calculation or essential addition and subtraction – that must be applied on a large scale. 
Since COBOL is clear to read and easy to comprehend, it is impossible to hide malicious or disruptive computer code within it. In addition, programming faults are easy to detect and rectify.

As a result, a COBOL programmer’s job is both rewarding and lucrative. The typical job responsibilities of a COBOL programmer include: 
Responsibilities of a COBOL Programmer
1. Training and supervision
 A COBOL programmer’s job includes training the local programming employees in JCL and modifying COBOL coding to take advantage of the increased mainframe processing power. In some cases, programmers also provide UNIX training for new employees. In addition, they are supposed to supervise the work of junior application developers as required and provide them with valuable feedback on performance improvement. 
2. Implementing automation
COBOL programmers analyze and test code using automated techniques. In addition, they are responsible for designing a variety of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro tools to simplify reporting and assure data integrity, avoidance of overlap, and management control.
3. Code quality control
Programmers ought to set coding guidelines to protect code integrity. Apart from setting the guidelines, they check various COBOL programs for flaws and repair faulty lines accordingly. This includes modifying and running SAS, SQL, COBOL, and UNIX testing systems. Modern COBOL programmers may use test automation for this purpose. Programmers may use SQL queries to generate test data for quality assurance, and as necessary, they are also to assist with system and client integration testing efforts.
4. Leveraging code libraries for smooth functioning of systems
Programmers utilize code libraries that are compilations of different lines of code generated internally or made accessible as open-source to facilitate programming. Developing new code to handle data sharing between front-end and back-end systems lies under the responsibilities of a COBOL programmer. In addition, they also maintain the sub-system programs running in both batch and customer information control system (CICS) programming language across the system. 
5. Enhancement projects
An enhancement project is one in which new capabilities are added to an existing system. They might also involve correcting defects, adding recent reports, and modifying functionality to comply with revised business rules or needs. COBOL programmers are responsible for generating thorough analysis and design documentation for enhancement projects.

6. Department collaboration
Programmers interact with the technical department staff for software development lifecycles, planning, development, scheduling, and applications. Good communication skills are essential in effective collaboration, especially for COBOL projects in DevOpsOpens a new window  environments. 
7. Project planning
Before working on projects, programmers must collect all the appropriate data for the desired results. This involves understanding the application’s transactional requirements and collecting and defining system requirements, among other information. In other words, project management responsibilities are also part of the COBOL programmer’s job description. 
8. Web development
Importantly, COBOL programmers are expected to be proficient in web development using Web Focus, HTML, Java, and JavaScript. For those familiar with basic web application security concepts, it can be an added advantage.

Top 12 Skills to Acquire
The primary, mandatory skill to become a COBOL programmer is knowledge of COBOL as a scripting language. In addition to this, the job role requires:
Skills Required by a COBOL Programmer
1. Technical development skills 
To grasp the inner workings of computer systems and software, COBOL programmers must first and foremost acquire technical development expertise. They require these skills to troubleshoot problems and create new systems and applications. Such technical skills include math skills, knowledge of different computer programming languages (Visual Basic, CICS, TSO, COBOL, QMF, and JSL), etc.
2. Communication skills 
COBOL programmers must communicate with other team members and clients to comprehend project goals, obtain information, and present their work. Furthermore, they must provide the clients explanations about technical aspects and answer inquiries about their work. Keeping this in mind, the capacity to form constructive and productive relationships within a team or personally can come in handy. COBOL programmers with practical communication skills can effectively build trust with clients and colleagues, which can lead to promotions and professional growth. 
3. DevOps proficiency
While not a direct prerequisite, as businesses become more dependent on technology, the demand for COBOL programmers familiar with DevOps is likely to expand. DevOps is a software development approach that entails collaboration among developers and operations personnel. It seeks to increase the speed and quality of software development by combining these two professions. Aspiring COBOL programmers can also explore DevOps courses to upskill in this area.
4. Mainframe capabilities 
Mainframes are high-performance computers with plenty of memory and processors that can do billions of basic calculations and transactions in real-time. Big corporations utilize them for mission-critical applications, high transaction volumes, and reliable performance. They are built for intensive high-speed processing for large-scale computing needs that demand higher availability and security than a more miniature computer can provide. With mainframes supporting much of the world’s most critical IT infrastructure, excellent mainframe programming skills are essential for a COBOL programmer. 
5. Versatility and the ability to learn fast
Organizational needs constantly change as technology and processes evolve. To ensure that one’s work is up to date and effective, COBOL programmers must adapt to new technologies and methods. And the best way to do that is to keep up with the latest programming languages and tools as they become available.

6. DB2
IBM’s relational database management system called DB2 is a solution designed to run and operate software such as Windows, Unix, and Linux systems. This system was initially built for IBM but has now been adapted to work on various operating systems. The essential characteristic of the DB2 is its ability to handle and manage large amounts of data while allowing users to access the database engine easily.
7. XML 
XML is a data storage and transmission medium independent of software and hardware. XML is an abbreviation for eXtensible Markup Language. XML, like HTML, is a markup language for storing and transporting data. It was designed to be self-descriptive. The XML language has no predefined tags. Additionally, another advantage of XML is its extensibility. 
8. Knowledge of the software development life cycle
In software engineering, SDLC (an acronym for software development life cycle) is also called application development lifecycle. SDLC is a method that aids in the planning, testing, and administration of an information system. This method can be applied to both software and hardware and their combination. The SDLC is divided into six steps, beginning with analysis and concluding with evaluation. It also includes web application security. 
9. Excellent focus and concentration
COBOL programmers must be able to focus for extended periods while they work out problems and write lines of clean code. Furthermore, they must carefully review their code, as even a minor error can significantly impact the entire program. Thus, concentration and attention to detail are essential for a COBOL programmer.
10. Intellectual curiosity 
The most effective and successful programmers are adept at determining how something is done and devising ways to do it more effectively. A healthy sense of curiosity can aid in the consistent growth and development of a programmer. 
11. Problem-solving and mathematical skills
 Many elements of COBOL programming necessitate a more advanced understanding of math. To become proficient in programming, one must first master algebra and arithmetic. Furthermore, a code is frequently written to address a challenge. Therefore, a COBOL programmer must be able to identify problems and devise the most optimal solutions to fix them through programming. 
12. Knowledge of other programming languages
 Although COBOL programmers mainly work with one programming language, proficiency in different programming languages can go a long way career-wise. Codes are widely written in programming languages such as SQL, Java, C++, and Python. Even though programmers are expected to be experts in all these languages, knowledge in at least two of them can open up many career opportunities. A common approach amongst programmers is to first decide on an area of specialization and then focus on the programming languages widely utilized in that field.

COBOL Programmer Salary in 2022
A COBOL programmer’s compensation can vary as per their level of education, years of experience, and the sort of corporation for which they work. Aside from the regular salary, many employees also receive extra rewards in the form of bonuses. While most COBOL programmers have a bachelor’s degree, some businesses hire candidates with a vocational degree or diploma, provided they have adequate field expertise. 
In software development, one’s programming skills are far more valuable than their degree. However, businesses require a Bachelor’s degree in computer science and can give applicants an edge over those without one.
Remember that COBOL programming is no longer included in most computer science degrees. Consequently, most COBOL experts today are older generation programmers and new-age aficionados, even though COBOL is expected to become popular soon. The majority of COBOL programmer salaries range from $79,000 (25th percentile) to $100,000 (75th percentile), with top earners (90th percentile) earning $110,000 per year.
They have a wide range of opportunities career-wise going forth, and they could become software developers or managers of the software engineering department. They may also advance to become senior software engineers or lead software developers as they gain expertise. Furthermore, some may also work as project managers in information technology.
The following are various Jobs taken up by COBOL programmers and their respective salaries, as per PayScale data last updated on May 02, 2022: 

Senior programmer analyst: Their salaries range from $71k to $113k, averaging $91,063 per annum.

How to become a COBOL programmer? 
There are four broad steps candidates must take to secure a career as a COBOL engineer and earn the compensation mentioned above: 

Tailor your education trajectory: COBOL programmers are often required to have a bachelor’s degree in information technology, computer science, software engineering, or a related field. These curricula include essential programming modules such as software design, computer programming, database management, and mathematics.
Obtain the appropriate experience: Typically, employers are more inclined to consider hiring an applicant with at least five years of relevant experience. However, a minimum of 10 years of experience may be required by certain businesses. 
Seek training: COBOL programmers can acquire expertise as a computer programmer, a computer systems analyst, or in a related profession such as a computer systems engineer or a computer scientist. Courses in any of these fields can bolster existing programming knowledge.
Ensure you have the right qualifications: Certifications are generally not required to become a COBOL programmer, although they can help someone stand out from the crowd. People with degrees often have an advantage in landing jobs at big enterprises.

Takeaway
While COBOL is now rarely used in end-user app development, it remains a staple for mainframes and enterprise backends. A gradual decline in COBOL was precipitated by the Y2K bug, which had the potential to cause computing errors due to systematic flaws in COBOL-based systems. However, despite this, COBOL remained popular and was one of the most in-demand skills in the U.S. during the pandemic. In the future, candidates who balance next-gen skills like the cloud with COBOL programming will be particularly advantageous as they can help guide end-to-end digital transformation programs.
