It works as follows: after candidates arrive at the company’s careers webpage, they are greeted by a chatbot which shows them positions opening in their area and then takes them through the pre-selection process. This includes questions such as, “Are you able to lift 50 pounds?” “Do you prefer working a day shift or are you flexible?”

It can then schedule an interview and send an email invitation. Brigitte Van Den Houte, vice-president, global talent management at Pitney Bowes, describes the chatbot’s tone as “welcoming”.

She says: “For areas where we have a high-volume recruitment challenge, AI has helped us to scale efficiently without having to temporarily deploy additional recruiters.” The use of such tech, the company says, has helped reduce the time to fill some positions by 10 per cent — or nine days.

A growing number of human resources departments are deploying these technological tools to find recruits. A host of recruitment tech start-ups have sprung up to meet this need. Barry Flack, an HR tech consultant, says that these have been attractive to investors as they promise to solve a problem they “have all experienced”.

New ventures include some that search online and in databases for matching candidates, sifting through vast quantities of applications and using machine learning. “Finding matched profiles has become easier,” says Mr Flack.

Then there are chatbots that can answer candidates’ rudimentary questions and help screen applications at the first stages (for example, basic technical and experience requirements and legalities such as the right to work). Further down the recruitment funnel, there are online assessments using game theory and psychological profiling.

Some employers are deploying video interviews and others use basic AI to help discern if candidates are “confident” or “passionate”.

Candidate relationship management tools have also grown in recent years. These help employers market their brand to prospects who might be interested in applying and nurture potential candidates with campaigns and communications, hoping to convert them into applicants.

Such tools have shaken up recruitment. A working article entitled “Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources Management” argues that the “speed with which the business rhetoric in management moved from big data to machine learning to artificial intelligence is staggering. The match between the rhetoric and reality is a different matter, however.”

One of the biggest HR tech claims is that technology can sift through applicants to find the best fit, free of human prejudices. Alistair Cox, chief executive of Hays, the recruiter, wrote in a blog post: “as well as increasing efficiency, automating sections of the screening phase can also lead to a decrease in subconscious hiring bias”.

Peter Cappelli, director of the centre for human resources at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and one of the authors of the article, is sceptical. “Any kind of structure eliminates bias. If you told employers to standardise the questions they ask that [would] eliminate the bias. A lot of [tech] imposes structure on the hiring process.”

As the oft-cited example of Amazon shows, technology can be as biased as humans if it replicates past hiring decisions. The tech group had to abandon its AI recruitment tool when it realised it discriminated against women because it tried to find candidates much like its current workforce: in other words, men. Decisions made by algorithm may also make a company more vulnerable to legal action, argues Prof Capelli, because the assumptions driving hiring decisions are clearly set out.

Technology can also require considerable finessing. Deloitte’s Human Capital report described one tech vendor as having “taken over a year to train its chatbot to intelligently screen hourly job candidates”.

Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, the jobs review site, says that automating trawls through the internet, looking for recruits on LinkedIn and other online platforms, has drawbacks. “Not all candidates show their best side [online]. They get left out of searches.”

Some candidates, by contrast, are brilliant at it, says David D’Souza, membership director at CIPD, the human resources professional body, citing LinkedIn profiles: “Everyone is ‘strategic’, everyone is ‘good with people’ and everyone is ‘proactive’. At the point that everyone becomes all those things you lose the ability to differentiate.”

Other products are focused on building a pipeline of interested candidates — including those that have failed previous applications and ones who register interest on an employer’s website. It will then market the company to candidates, and build a relationship. One such tool is Beamery, which calls itself a talent engagement platform. It gauges a candidate’s interest in the company or job (for example, if they open an email from the company) to determine whether they are ready to pursue a role.

Products that allow a recruiter to keep in touch with failed — or potential — candidates can be useful. However, Prof Cappelli says: “Don’t kid yourself that this is a relationship, that the company really cares about you.” Moreover, the risk is that they bombard people with marketing material. “If you are the first mover it’s a smart thing to do but not the 20th.”

“One of the things that people have always valued is human connection, whether with a boss, or clear feedback at the end of a process,” says Mr D’Souza. “Part of the challenge with tech is that it’s more efficient but it reduces human contact. People want speed and convenience, ideally from a person.”

The candidate’s experience is critical, agrees Bill Boorman, who advises recruitment tech start-ups. They want to understand the process and receive feedback. “They don’t want it to be painful.”

Ultimately, as with automation of other white-collar jobs, the hope is that technology reduces repetitive tasks. Matt Weston, UK managing director of Robert Half, the recruiter, says: “It’s really important to get the balance with the human technology. At the end of the day HR is a personal department that can’t be too automated.”

Prof Cappelli says that in an age of techno-hype, there is an expectation that machines will solve the recruitment problem. “In a typical company you can persuade the CFO to buy software. Does it work? Probably not.”

The technology might even be making things worse. When companies use a new tool, says Mr Chamberlain, they tend to overuse it. New technology makes it easy to add extra tests.

“The time for the interview process has got much longer . . . They are making people jump through more hoops,” he says.

“It’s not clear that it’s improving the match of candidates. It will take trial and error to see what tech really delivers on these promises.”

Recruitment tech to help weed out bad hires
Some recruitment tech is working with psychologists to devise psychological quizzes to discover the motivations or personality types of a candidate or employee. 
Attuned is one such company that offers its product for both recruitment and retention. It asks the person taking a test to answer a series of questions, to find out if they are motivated by things such as money or a desire for autonomy, to see if they are a good fit with their team or company.
Casey Wahl, the founder, says that one recruitment company that used it for hiring found that they reduced the number of bad hires — so that instead of 30 per cent of recruits leaving within six months, it was only 10 per cent.

There’s a lot of marketing buzz and technical spin on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Most of what’s out there is either too fluffy or too mathy, either too general or too focused on specific applications, too disconnected from business outcomes and metrics, and too undirected.
This article provides an overview of these related technologies by:

Defining AI, machine learning, and deep learning, explaining the differences from traditional approaches, describing when to use them, and noting their advantages and disadvantages.
Explaining how they complement business frameworks and enable business outcomes and metrics.
Describing common types of machine learning and deep learning model training, algorithms, architectures, performance assessments, and obstacles to good performance.
Providing examples of machine learning models and algorithms at work.
Presenting a potential framework for AI implementation for business outcomes.

Why AI: AI in the business context
All organizations work to specific outcomes, and they juggle several business metrics and processes to achieve this, such as revenue, costs, time to market, process accuracy, and efficiency. Yet they have limited resources (money, time, people, and other assets). So, the problem boils down to making good decisions about resource allocation (what kind of resources, how many/much of them, what should they do, what capabilities do they need, etc.), and making those good decisions faster than competitors and faster than the market is changing.











 
 
 
Making these decisions is hard, but clearly, they become much, much easier when data, information, and knowledge are available. Assuming these inputs are available, they need to be aggregated and mined for nuggets. Analysts need time to pull tribal knowledge out of subject matter experts’ heads, to adjust to fluctuating business rules, to calibrate for personal biases where possible, and to spot patterns and to generate insights. Ideally, analysts and managers should (time permitting) assess multiple scenarios and run several experiments to increase confidence in their recommendations and decisions. Finally, the decisions need to be operationalized.

Enter AI, machine learning, and deep learning, which:

Model the organization based on observations.
Generate insights by simultaneously reviewing lots of factors and variables (far more than a person can achieve in a reasonable time period and cost constraint).
Learn continuously as new observations are provided.
Quantify the likelihood of outcomes (that is, predict what is likely to happen).
Prescribe specific actions to optimize the business goals and metrics.
Adjust rapidly to new business rules through faster retraining versus traditional slower reprogramming.

What makes AI, machine learning, and deep learning possible now is the proliferation of data volume and data types coupled with the lower costs of compute and storage hardware and tools. Web-scale companies (such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Netflix) have proven it works, and they are being followed by organizations in all industries. Combined with business intelligence, the trio of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning overcomes obstacles to decisioning, thereby facilitating organizations to achieve their business goals, as Figure 1 shows.

How to tell if AI or machine learning is real


AI, machine learning, and deep learning apply to everyone in metrics-driven organizations and businesses.
In its May 2011 publication “Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity,” McKinsey Global Institute stated that the gap for managers and analysts who know how to use the results of analytics stood at 1.5 million, an order of magnitude more than for those who produce the analytics (such as data analysts and data scientists).
Put another way, the chokepoint in the data value chain is not the data or the analytics; it’s the ability to consume the data/analytics in context and in an intelligent way for surgical action. This is an opportunity for business and process professionals to marry AI, machine learning, and deep learning to the business frameworks and concepts already understood so well. It’s a chance to define problems and hypotheses within those frameworks and concepts, and then to use AI, machine learning, and deep learning to find patterns (insights) and to test hypotheses that take too long to test, would otherwise be too expensive to identify and test, or are too difficult for people to carry out, as Figure 2 shows.











 
 
 
 Trace3

Figure 2: AI complements business frameworks and issues.


Organizations and businesses are increasingly turning to AI, machine learning, and deep learning because, quite simply, business is becoming more complex. There are too many things occurring at one time for us people to process; that is, there are too many data points (both relevant and not-so-relevant) for us to synthesize. Looked at it this way, too much data can be a liability (analysis paralysis, anyone?).
But AI, machine learning, and deep learning can turn that pile of data into an asset by systematically determining its importance, predicting outcomes, prescribing specific actions, and automating decision making. In short, AI, machine learning, and deep learning enable organizations and businesses to take on the factors driving business complexity, among them:

Value chains and supply chains that are more global, intertwined, and focused on microsegments.
Business rules that rapidly change to keep pace with competitors and customer needs and preferences.
Correct forecasting and deployment of scarce resources to optimize competing projects/investments and business metrics.
Need to simultaneously drive towards both increased quality and customer experience while reducing costs.

In many ways, AI, machine learning, and deep learning are superior to explicit programming and traditional statistical analysis:











 
 
 

The business rules don’t really need to be known to achieve the targeted outcome—the machine just needs to be trained on example inputs and outputs.
If the business rules change such that the same inputs no longer result in the same outputs, the machine just needs to be retrained—not reprogrammed—allecelerating response times and alleviating people of the need to learn new business rules.
Compared to traditional statistical analysis, AI, machine learning, and deep learning models are relatively quick to build, so it’s possible to rapidly iterate through several models in a try-learn-retry approach.


However, AI, machine learning, and deep learning do have disadvantageous, as Figure 3 shows. Among them, they are still based on statistics, so there is an element of uncertainty in the output. This makes the integration of AI, machine learning, and deep learning into the workflow tricky because high ambiguity in the machine’s decisions should likely be handled by a person. And to improve the machine’s accuracy, mistakes (and right answers) should be fed back to the machine to be used for additional training (learning).
Additionally, AI, machine learning, and deep learning models can be less interpretable; that is, it may not be clear how they arrive at their decisions. This is particularly true of complex deep learning models with many “layers” and “neurons”; such lack of clarity may be of particular concern in highly regulated industries. It should be noted that there is a lot of research focused in this area, so perhaps it won’t be a disadvantage in the future.

Figure 3: AI, machine learning, and deep learning advantages, disadvantages, and drivers.


Given the advantages and disadvantages, when might it be appropriate to use AI, machine learning, and deep learning? Here are some ideas:











 
 
 

The juice is worth the squeeze: There’s a high-potential business outcome but traditional approaches are too cumbersome, time-consuming, or just not appropriate.
Relevant data is available and accessible.
Subject matter experts believe the data contain meaningful signal (that is, insight can be gleaned from the data).
The problem definition ties to a machine learning or deep learning problem, such as classification, clustering, or anomaly detection.
The success of use cases can be mapped to machine learning and deep learning model performance metrics, such as precision-recall and accuracy.

AI defined: The natural progression from BI to AI
AI, machine learning, and deep learning are a natural progression of business intelligence. Where BI describes and diagnoses past events, AI, machine learning, and deep learning try to predict the likelihood of future events and prescribe how to increase the likelihood of those events actually occurring. A simple example illustrating this is the GPS guiding you from point A to point B:

Description: What route did the vehicle take, and how long did it take?
Diagnosis: Why did the vehicle take a long time at a particular traffic light (assuming the GPS platform/tool tracks things like accidents and vehicle volume)?
Prediction: If a vehicle is going from point A to point B, what is the expected ETA?
Prescription: If a vehicle is going from point A to point B, what route should the vehicle take to achieve the expected ETA?

Prediction in AI
One example of prediction is sentiment analysis (the probability of someone liking something). Let’s assume you can track and store the textual content of any user posting (such as tweets, updates, blog articles, and forum messages). You can then build a model that predicts the user’s sentiment from his or her postings.
Another example is increasing customer conversion: people are more likely to sign up for subscriptions if they’re offered a chance to win a prize they want—so you can predict which prizes will lead to the highest number of conversions.











 
 
 
Prescription in AI
Prescription is about optimizing business metrics in various processes, such as marketing, sales, and customer service, and it’s accomplished by telling the prescriptive analytics system what metrics should be optimized. This is like telling the GPS what you want to optimize, such as least fuel consumption, fastest time, lowest mileage, or passing by the largest number of fast-food joints in case you get a craving for something. In a business setting, you might target increased conversion by 10 percent, sales by 20 percent, or net promoter score (NPS) by five points.
From there, the prescriptive analytics system would prescribe a sequence of actions that leads to the corresponding business outcomes you want.
Say you want to achieve a 10-percent conversion lift. The system may prescribe:











 
 
 

Reducing the frequency of your direct mail marketing by 15 percent, while
simultaneously increasing your Twitter and Facebook engagements by 10 and 15 percent, respectively, then
when your aggregate social media engagement reaches 12 percent, start directing the public to your customer community portal for customer-to-customer engagement.

These prescriptive actions are like the turns that your GPS system advises you to take during the journey to optimize the goal you set.

The relationship among BI, statistics, and AI
Here’s one way to define the difference among BI, statistics, and AI:

BI is traditionally query-oriented and relies on the analyst to identify the patterns (such as who are the most profitable customers, why are they the most profitable, and what attributes that set them apart, such as age or job type).
Statistics also relies on the analyst to understand the properties (or structure) of the data to find information about the population in the data, but it adds mathematical rigor in extrapolating to generalization (such as if there is a difference between these customer segments in real life versus what is found in the sample data).
AI, machine learning, and deep learning rely on algorithms (not analysts) to autonomously find patterns in the data and enable prediction and prescription.

Please note that BI, statics, and AI, machine learning, and deep learning can do more than what is described in Figure 5; this example simply demonstrates how these methods can answer a series of progressive business questions.

While statistical modeling on one side and machine learning and deep learning on the other are both used to build models of the business situation, there are some key differences between the two, as Figure 6 shows. In particular:

Statistical modeling requires a formal mathematical equation between the inputs and outputs. In contrast, machine learning and deep learning don’t try to find that mathematical equation; instead they simply try to re-create the output given the inputs.
Statistical modeling requires an understanding between the variables and makes assumptions about the statistical properties of the data population. Machine learning and deep learning do not.

Typically, because statistical modeling requires a mathematical equation and an understanding of the relationships among the data, statistical models take a relatively long time to build as the statistician studies and works with the data. But if completed successfully—that is, the equation is found and the statistical relationships among the data are very well understood—the model can be killer.
Machine learning and deep learning models, on the other hand, are very fast to build but may not achieve high performance to start. But because they are so easy to construct in the early stages, many algorithms can be tried simultaneously with the most promising of them continuously iterated until model performance becomes extremely good.











 
 
 
Machine learning and deep learning models also have the added advantage of continuously learning from new data “on their own,” and thus improving their performance.
Should the nature of the data change, the machine learning and deep learning models simply need to be retrained on the new data; whereas the statistical models typically need to be rebuilt in whole or in part.
Machine learning and deep learning models also excel in solving highly nonlinear problems (it’s just harder for people to do this—those equations get very long!). This attribute of machine learning and deep learning really comes in handy as microsegments become the norm (think customer segments of one, mass customization, personalized customer experience, and personal and precision medicine), and processes and root-cause analysis becomes increasingly multifactored and interdependent.











 
 
 
How AI, machine learning, and deep learning differ
So far, I have lumped together AI, machine learning, and deep learning together. But they are not exactly the same, as Figure 7 shows.

Why an AI-driven strategy is a must to defend against today’s cyberthreats

AI is where machines perform tasks that are characteristic of human intelligence. It includes things like planning, understanding language, recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem solving. This can be in the form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial narrow intelligence (ANI).











 
 
 

AGI has all the characteristics of human intelligence, with all our senses (maybe even more) and all our reasoning, and so can think just like we do. Some describe this as “cognitive”—think C3PO and the like.
ANI has some facets of human intelligence but not all; it’s used to perform specific tasks. Examples include image classification in a service like Pinterest and face recognition on Facebook. ANI is the current focus of most business applications.

Machine learning is where machines use algorithms to learn and execute tasks without being explicitly programmed (that is, they do not have to be provided specific business rules to learn from the data; put another way, they don’t need instructions such as “if you see X, do Y”).
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, generally using artificial neural networks. The benefit of deep learning is that in theory it does not need to be told what data elements (or “features” in machine learnig speak) are important, but most of the time, it needs large amounts of data.
Figure 8 shows the timeline of AI’s evolution.











 
 
 
 Trace3

Figure 8: AI’s historical timeline.


The differences among explicit programming, machine learning, and deep learning can be better understood through the example of handwritten number recognition. To a person older than five years old, recognizing handwritten numbers isn’t hard. We’ve learned (been trained) over the years by parents, teachers, siblings, and classmates.
Now imagine getting a machine to do the same through explicit programming. In explicit programming, you have to tell the machine what to look for. For example, a round object is a zero, a line that goes up and down is a one, and so on. But what happens if the object isn’t perfectly round, or the ends don’t touch so it’s not fully round? What happens when the line doesn’t go up and down but instead tips sideways, or if the top part of the line has a hook (like “1”)—is it now closer to 7? The many variations of handwritten letters make it difficult to write an explicit program; you would be consistently adding new “business rules” to account for the variations.
As Figure 9 shows, in the machine learning approach, you would show the machine examples of 1s, 2s, etc., and tell it what “features” (important characteristics) to look for. This feature engineering is important because not all characteristics are important. Examples of important characteristics might be number of closed loops, number of lines, direction of lines, number of line intersections, and positions of intersections. Examples of unimportant characteristics might be color, length, width, and depth. Assuming you feed the machine the right features and provide it with examples and answers, the machine would eventually learn on its own how important the features are for the different numbers, and then hopefully be able to distinguish (or classify) the numbers correctly.
Notice that with machine learning you have to tell the machine the important features (that is, what to look for), so the machine is only as good as the person identifying the appropriate features.











 
 
 
The promise of deep learning is that no one has to tell the machine what features to use (that is, which ones are most important)—it will automatically figure this out. All you need to do is to feed it all the features from which it will select the important features on its own. While this an obvious advantage, it comes at a price in the form of high-data-volume requirement and long training time that requires significant computational processing capabilities.

AI model concepts: an overview
The idea behind machine learning and deep learning models is they learn from data they are given (things they have seen before), and then can generalize to make good decisions on new data (things they have not seen before).
But what constitutes a model? One definition of models is that they consist of three components:

Data: Historical data is used to train the model. For example, when learning to play the piano, the data you are fed is different notes, different types of music, different composer styles, etc.
Algorithms: General rules that models use for the learning process. In the piano example, your internal algorithm might tell you to look for the musical notes, how to move your hands on the keys, how and when to press the pedals, etc. Figure 10 shows the relationship between models and algorithms.
Hyperparameters: These are “knobs” that data scientists adjust to improve the model performance, and they are not learned from the data. Again using the piano example, hyperparameters include how often you practice the musical piece, where you practice, time of day you practice, piano you use for practice, etc. The thinking is that adjusting these “knobs” improves your ability to learn how to play the piano.

When you put all of this together, you become a piano-playing model. In theory, depending on how well you’re trained, new musical pieces you’ve never seen before could be placed in front of you and you’d be able to play them.
 Trace3

Figure 10: Relationship between models and algorithms.


Types of machine learning
Machines, just like people, can learn in different ways, as Figure 11 shows. I’ll again use the piano-training analogy to explain:

Supervised: Your instructor shows or tells you both the right way and the wrong way to play. In an ideal situation, you are given equal numbers of examples of how to play the right and wrong ways. Essentially, the training data consists of a target/outcome variable (or dependent variable) that is to be predicted from a set of predictors (independent variables). Using these sets of variables, you generate a function that maps inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of performance on the training data. A business example of supervised training is showing the system examples of loan applications (consisting of predictors like credit history, work history, asset ownership, income, and education) that were approved or rejected (the target outcomes and decisions).
Unsupervised: You’re on your own—nobody tells how you to play, so you make up your own ideas of right and wrong, with the goal of optimizing a parameter that’s important to you, such as speed of finishing the piece, the ratio of loud notes to soft notes, or number of unique keys you touch. Essentially, data points have no labels associated with them to inform you right or wrong. Instead, the goal is to organize the data in some way or to describe its structure. This can mean grouping it into clusters or finding different ways of looking at complex data so that it appears simpler or more organized. Unsupervised learning is usually less effective at training the model than supervised learning, but it may be necessary when no labels exist (in other words, the “right” answers are not known). A common business example is market segmentation: It’s frequently unclear what the “right” maret segments are, but every marketer is looking for segments of natural affinities so they can approach those segments with just the right message, prootions, and products.
Semisupervised: A combination of supervised and unsupervised. This is used where there is not enough supervised data. In the piano example, you would receive some instruction but not a lot (maybe because lessons are expensive or there aren’t enough teachers).
Reinforcement: You’re not told what the right and wrong way to play is, and you don’t know what parameter you’re trying to optimize, but you are told when you do something right or wrong. In the case of piano training, your teacher might hit your knuckles with a ruler when you play the wrong note or play with the wrong tempo, and she gives you a backrub when you play things well. Reinforcement learning is very popular right now because, in several situations, there isn’t enough supervised data available for every scenario, but the “right” answer is known. For example, in the game of chess, there are too many permutations of moves to document (label). But reinforcement learning still lets tells the machine when it makes right and wrong decisions that advance to ward winning (such as capturing pieces and strengthening positions in chess).
Transfer learning: You use your knowledge of playing the piano to learn another instrument because you’ve built certain transferable skills (such as the ability to read notes and maybe even developing nimbleness in your hands) that you can build on to learn how to play the trumpet. Transfer learning is used because it reduces learning time, which can be significant (several hours or even several days) for models that use deep learning architectures.

 Trace3

Figure 11: Modeling: common types of learning/training.


Common machine learning algorithms
As Figure 12 shows, common algorithm types include:

Regression is simply drawing a curve or line through data points.
Classification is determining to what group something belongs. Binary classification (two groups) is determining if something belongs to a class or not, such as whether the animal in the picture is a dog or not. Sticking with the animal example, multiclass classification (more than two groups) is whether the animal is a dog, cat, bird, etc.
Clustering is similar to classification, but you don’t know the classifications ahead of time. Again using the examples of animal pictures, you may determine that there are three types of animals, but you don’t know what those animals are, so you just divide them into groups. Generally speaking, clustering is used when there is insufficient supervised data or when you want to find natural groupings in the data without being constrained to specific groups, such as dogs, cats, or birds.
Time series assumes that the sequence of data is important (that the data points taken over time have an internal structure that should be accounted for). For example, sales data could be considered time-series because you may want to trend revenue over time to detect seasonality and to correlate it with promotion events. On the other hand, the order of your animal pictures doesn’t matter for classification purposes.
Optimization is a method of achieving the best value for multiple variables when they do not move in the same direction.
NLP (natural language processing) is the general category of algorithms that try to mimic human use and understanding of languages, such as chatbots, scrubbing unstructured writing like doctor’s notes for key data fields, and autonomous writing of news articles.
Anomaly detection is used to find outliers in the data. It is similar to control charts but uses lots more variables as inputs. Anomaly detection is especially useful when “normal” operating parameters are difficult to define and change over time, and you want your detection of abnormalities to adjust automatically.

 Trace3

Figure 12: Modeling: types of algorithms.


Deep learning models
Deep learning is based on the concept of artificial neural networks (ANNs). In that way, they work like human brains where synapses become stronger or weaker based on feedback of some sort, and neurons fire based on specified conditions. Hard problems are being solved through deep learning models, including self-driving cars, image detection, video analysis, and language processing. Figure 13 shows their key characteristics.
Lest you think that deep learning models are the only things that should be used, there are some caveats:

First, they require large amounts of data—generally much more than machine learning models. Without large amounts of data, deep learning usually does not perform as well.
Second, because deep learning models require large amounts of data, the training process takes a long time and requires a lot of computational processing power. This is being addressed by ever more powerful and faster CPUs and memory as well as newer GPUs and FPGAs (field-programmable logic arrays).
Third, deep learning models are usually less interpretable than machine learning models. Interpretability is a major area of deep learning research, so perhaps this will improve.

 Trace3

Figure 13: Modeling: deep learning.


How to measure machine learning model performance
Models, just like people, have their performance assessed. Here are a few ways to measure the performance of a relatively simple regression model. The MAE, RMSE, and R2 performance metrics are fairly straightforward, as Figure 14 shows.
All these can be considered a type of cost function, which helps the model know if it’s getting closer or farther away from the “right” answer, and if it’s gotten “close enough” to that answer. The cost function tells the model how far it has to go before it can take new data it hasn’t seen before and output the right prediction with a high enough probability. When training the model, the goal is to minimize the cost function.
 Trace3

Figure 14: Modeling: performance assessment: example of error calculation for regression.


Precision versus recall in classification models
Once the cost function has done its job of helping the model head in the direction of the “right answer” based on training data (data it is being shown), you need to evaluate how well the model performs on data it hasn’t yet seen. Let me explain this in the context of classification models (models that determine whether something is in one group or another, such as if the picture is a dog, cat, rat, etc.).
To assess the performance of classification models (see Figure 15), you use the equation for accuracy (as detailed below). However, it’s generally accepted that when the training data exhibits class imbalance, the accuracy metric might be misleading, so you use metrics called precision and recall instead. Here’s what these terms mean:

Class imbalance: The data is skewed in one direction versus other directions. Consider the example of predicting whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. The vast majority of transactions are not fraudulent, and the data set will be skewed in that direction. So, if you predicted that a given transaction is not fraud, you’d probably be right—even if you know nothing about transaction itself. Applying the accuracy metric in this example would mislead you to think you’re doing a great job of predicting transactions that are not fraudulent.
Precision is a measure of relevance. Pretend you use your search engine to find the origin of the tennis score “love.” Precision measures how many of the items returned are really about this versus links to how much people love tennis, how people fell in love playing tennis, etc.
Recall is a measure of completeness. Using the same example of the tennis score “love,” recall measures how well the search engine captured all the references that are available to it. Missing zero references is amazing, missing one or two isn’t too bad, missing thousands would be terrible.

Unfortunately, in the real world, precision and recall are traded off; that is, when one metric improves, the other metric deteriorates. So, you’ve got to determine which metric is more important to you.
 Trace3

Figure 15: Modeling: performance assessment: confusion matrix for classification.


Consider the example of a dating app that matches you with compatible people. If you’re great-looking, rich, and have a sparkling personality, you might lean towards higher precision because you know there will be a lot of potential matches, but you only want the ones that are a real fit, and the cost for you to screen potential matches is high (hey, you’re busy building an empire—you’ve got millions of things to do). On the other hand, if you’ve been looking for someone for a long time and your mother’s been on your back, you might lean toward recall to get as many potential matches as possible. The cost of sorting through potential suiters is relatively low compared to the constant nagging from your mother! To assess how well the model balances precision and recall, the F1 score is used.
These metrics can be plotted on a graph, as Figure 16 shows; one is called the ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) and the other is the PR curve (precision-recall curve). A perfect curve (which you will never get unless you cheat!) is a curve that goes up the Y axis to 1 and then goes across the top. In the case of the ROC curve, a straight line across the diagonal is bad—this means that model predicts true positives and true negatives equally at 50 percent rates (no better than random guesses). These metrics are frequently converted to an area under the curve (AUC), so you’ll see terms like AUC ROC and AUC PR.
 Trace3

Figure 16: Modeling: performance assessment: ROC and PR curves.


Why building machine learning models can be hard
Now that you understand what a model is and how to judge a model’s performance, let’s explore why building a well-performing model can be hard. There are several reasons, as Figure 17 shows. Among them: problem formulation, data issues, selecting the appropriate model algorithm and architectures, selecting the right features, adjusting hyperparameters, training models, cost (error) functions, and underfitting (bias) and overfitting (variance).
Be aware that data science, just like any other science, is both an art and science. Of course, there are always brute-force ways to do things, but those approaches can be time-consuming, may miss insights, and may just plain get things wrong. The current approach of data science is to pool the knowledge of subject matter experts (such as lines of business, operations, and transformation and improvement specialists) and data scientists to create models that fulfil the business needs.
 Trace3

Figure 17: Modeling: common obstacles leading to poor performance.


Overfitting versus underfitting
Overfitting and underfitting are particularly popular problem outcomes, so let’s delve into them a bit. As Figure 18 shows, they involve bias and variance.
Overfitting (high variance) means that the model responds too much to variations in the data, such that it hasn’t really learned the true meaning and instead “memorized” the data. It would be the same as you reading a math book in school and, when given a test on it, know the answers only to the three examples given in the book. When the teacher asks you these math problems (say, 2+1=3, 7+2=9, and 4+2=6), you get them right. But when she asks you something different—say, 1+1=?—you don’t know the answer. That’s because you haven’t learned what addition is, even though you know the answers to the examples. (By the way, don’t tell my professors, but this method saved my bacon in college back in the day!)
Underfitting (high bias) is the opposite problem in that you refuse to learn something new. Maybe you know how to do addition in base 10. But now circumstances have changed, and you’re asked to do addition in base 16. If you exhibit high bias, you’ll continue to do base-10 addition and not learn base-16 addition, and so you get the wrong answers.
Both are problems, and data science has mechanisms to help mitigate them.
 Trace3

Figure 18: Modeling: obstacles: bias and variance.


Machine learning model examples
Let’s go through a couple of machine learning examples of using two types of algorithms: eager algorithms and lazy algorithms. Figure 19 shows examples of both.
Eager algorithms don’t use explicit training (the first path in the diagram), whereas lazy algorithms are explicitly trained (the second path in the diagram). Because eager algorithms aren’t explicitly trained, their training phase is fast (nonexistent, actually), but their execution (or inference phase) is slower than the trained lazy algorithms. Eager algorithms also use more memory because the entire data set needs to be stored, while the data used to train the lazy algorithm can be discarded once training is completed, using less overall memory.
 Trace3

Figure 19: Machine learning examples with and without training.


Example: Document search using TF-IDF
In this first example of an eager algorithm applied to text analytics, I’m using an algorithm called TF-IDF. I’ll explain what TF and IDF mean shortly, but let’s first be clear on the goal of this example. There are five simple, short documents (Documents 1 to 5), as Figure 20 shows. There’s also a dictionary of keywords for these documents; the dictionary is used for keyword searches. And there is also a user who has a query. The goal is to retrieve documents that best fit the user’s query. In this example, you want to return the five documents in order of prioritized relevance.
 Trace3

Figure 20: Text analytics example: TF-IDF problem.


First, let me explain clarify the TF and IDF acronyms. TF stands for term frequency, or how often a term appears (that is, the density of that term in the document). The reason you care is because you assume that when an “important” terms appear more frequently, the document it’s in is more relevant; TF helps you map terms in the user’s query to the most relevant documents.
IDF stands for inverse document frequency. This is almost the opposite thinking—terms that appear very frequently across all documents have less importance, so you want to reduce the importance weight of those terms. Obvious words are “a,” “an,” and “the,” but there will be many others for specific subjects or domains. You can think of these common terms as noise that confuses the search process.
Once TF and IDF values are calculated for the documents and the query, you just calculate the similarity between the user’s query and each document. The higher the similarity score, the more relevant the document. Then you present those documents to the user in order of relevance. Easy right?
Now that you understand how it’s done, you just have to do the calculations. Figure 21 shows the solution.
 Trace3

Figure 21: Document search (text analytics): solution.


Let’s walk through the calculations. By the way, you’ll see there are several matrices. Machine learning and deep learning models do a lot of their calculations using matrix math. You’ll want to be aware of that as you work with data scientists; you’ll want to help them get the data into these types of formats in a way that makes sense for the business problem. It’s not hard, but it’s part of the art of the data science preprocessing stage.
In the first TF matrix, you calculate the normalized (“relative”) frequency of each keyword (as specified in the dictionary) for each document. The numerator represents the word count frequency in that document, and the denominator represents the maximum number of times that word appeared in any give document; in other words, it’s the maximum value across all the numerators.
In the second matrix, you add an IDF vector in the last row for each term in the dictionary. You just apply the equation you’ve been given: IDF(t) = log(N/n(t)), where

N = number of recommendable documents
n (t) = number of documents in which keyword t appears

The next step is to create the TF-IDF matrix for the documents by multiplying each row of the documents by the last IDF row. Now you’re done with the document matrix. Repeat the same process to create the user-query matrix.
Finally, combine the two matrices and calculate the similarity between each document and the user query. In this case, you use an equation to calculate similarity called cosine similarity (there are other similarity calculations you can use as well). The equation is represented in the figure, and the values are in the last column. Notice that the similarity value between the user query and itself is 1—as it should be because it’s being compared to itself.
From here, you can sort the similarity values (in the last column of the matrix) from highest to lowest, thus presenting the user with documents from most to least relevant. Now you’re done! Notice there was no “training” of the model; you just applied a few equations.
Example: Pet recommendations using collaborative and content-based approaches
Let’s go through another example of an eager machine learning algorithm used in a recommender engine, similar to what you might see from many websites. In this case, you have data on four pet lovers, and you know their preference in terms of the type of pets they like and how much they like specific pets. Let’s assume there is a fifth pet lover (Amy) about whose preference you know less.
Your goals are two-fold: Predict the rating that Amy would give to a specific pet, and predict the preference of pets that Amy may like if you know her preferences of pet attributes. You should see that this closely resembles a similarity problem, using similarity of attributes between people you know more about to someone you know less about.
There are two ways to determine similarity in recommendation systems: collaborative and content-based, and collaborative can be further defined as user-based or item-based.
In the collaborative method, you need the ratings of users in the community. Applying this through the user-based approach, you predict what users like based on the likes of similar users in the community. By contrast, using the item-based approach, you predict what users like based on similarity among items that the community likes.
The content-based method does not use ratings of users in the community. Instead, it’s based on the characteristics of the items themselves, and the value (or label) assigned to these characteristics are provided by a domain expert.
Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, as Figure 22 shows.
 Trace3

Figure 22: Recommender example: similarity intuition.


Consider this example: In the collaborative method, you use the pet ratings of other users to predict an individual’s unknown rating of a pet.
First, try the user-based approach. Because you are comparing aggregate individual’s ratings that can be skewed by human bias (that is, their baselines can be varied), you use a similarity function called the Pearson similarity (see the equation in the figure) that tries to correct for user bias by normalizing the ratings (that is, by subtracting the average of the ratings from each user rating). Working through the example, you see that Alice’s ratings are most similar to Bill’s ratings, so you can assume Amy’s missing rating would be the same as Bill’s.
Now try the item-based approach. In this approach, you don’t focus on individuals’ ratings but instead on the items’ ratings. And because the items’ ratings are a composite of ratings provided by several individuals, you don’t have to be as concerned about bias, so you can use the cosine similarity function (see the equation in the figure). Here, you see that Cat is most similar to Hedgehog, so you can infer that Amy’s rating for Cat would be the same as her rating for Hedgehog.
Finally, try the content-based approach. This approach doesn’t require the ratings of community members. Instead, an expert has labeled the data—in this case, the attributes (cute, clean, cuddly, loyal) of each pet type. If you know an individual’s preference for each attribute, you can use the cosine similarity function to predict the pets that the individual is most likely to enjoy. In this example, Amy is most likely to enjoy, in order of descending preference, Hedgehog, Rabbit, Dog, Pig, then Cat.
Let’s get into the math a bit. As an example, to determine Amy’s score for Hedgehog, you find the similarity between Hedgehog’s pet attributes and Amy’s ratings of importance of pet attribute:

The Hedgehog’s vector is (4,3,1,1)
Amy’s vector is (3,3,2,1)
You need to find similarity between these two vectors
Cosine similarity = [4(3) + (3)(3) + (1)(2) + (1)(1)] / [SQRT(4^2 + 3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) * SQRT(3^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2)] = .96

For the collaborative method, you use Pearson equation because it normalizes ratings across users (who can be inconsistent in their ratings). If you have objective ratings (such as ratings not based on people with different scales), you can use cosine similarity. Figure 23 shows the solution.
Here are the variables in the equations:

u: user
i: item to be rated
N: # nearest neighbors
j: neighbor
rj,I: j’s rating on i
rj bar: average of j’s ratings
ru bar: average of user’s rating
alpha: scaling factor for ratings; 1 means use as is (there is no right value for alpha; it’s one of those hyperparameters) described earlier that an experienced data scientist can adjust to derive better results given the problem objective and context)

 Trace3

Figure 23: Recommender example: similarity solution.


Example: Lazy algorithm using support vector machine (SVM)
Finally, here’s an example of a lazy machine learning algorithm called the support vector machine (SVM). In this approach, you want to determine which group an item belongs, such as whether a new customer ends up being a highly or lowly profitable customer. To accomplish this using SVM, you need to calculate two parameters:

Weights (importance) of each attribute (examples of attributes might be the customer’s income, number of family members, profession, and educational achievement)
Support vectors, which are the data sets that are nearest to the curve (called a hyperplane) that separates the groups.

You then take these two parameters and plug them into an equation, as Figure 24 shows.
The way you calculate these parameters is to use the available data sets, and this is what is referred to as training the data.
 Trace3

Figure 24: Classification example: SVM problem and intuition.


Figure 25 shows the equation used to make the prediction under the Prediction label. Values that are calculated during the training phase are:

The weights (the alphas and thetas) used to minimize the cost function.
The support vectors xi, which are a subset of the training data.

Once the model is trained, you can then plug in new values of x (such as the attributes of new customers), and then predict the class, h(x), in which these new values of x belong (such as whether they are expected to be highly profitable customers or not).
 Trace3

Figure 25: Classification example: SVM solution.


Why AI projects fail
There are common ways that AI projects fail in the business environment, as Figure 26 shows. Any AI framework should address those pitfalls.
 Trace3

Figure 26: Why AI projects fail.


The first driver of failure is either selecting the wrong use case or taking on too many uses cases without sufficient capabilities and infrastructure. You can use the criteria described earlier to identify problems that better lend themselves to AI solutions. In addition, it is smart to set up a series of use cases that let capabilities and knowledge be built incrementally and with increasing technical sophistication.
Selecting the right use cases is best done collaboratively with:

Line-of-business staff who know the business problems, contexts, and constraints, as well as the hypotheses they want tested.
Business analysts who can ask questions that clarify the business intent and requirements, and who can identify the data sources and transformations.
Data scientists who can formulate the machine learning and deep learning problem so that models can provide answers to the business’s hypotheses.
Data engineers and IT resources who can provide access to the data.

Organizing and orchestrating these types of activities correctly upfront requires experienced cross-functional leaders who understand and can balance business impacts, operational drivers, workflow barriers and opportunities, data needs and constraints, and technology enablers.
The second driver is incorrectly building the AI models themselves. This consist of two elements:

Even though data science, like other sciences, is experimental in nature (you don’t really know what the data will tell you until you work with it), the approach to data science should be well-defined, should be disciplined, and should speed time-to-value.
Good data scientists can quickly experiment and iterate, learn from their experiments, distinguish between promising and ineffective approaches, and research and adapt cutting-edge methods if necessary. Good data scientists build MVPs (minimal viable products) in rapid, parallel fashion.

The third driver is lack of scale to quickly build and improve multiple AI models simultaneously. Frequently, this comes down to data scientists being able to work collaboratively, to reuse data pipelines, workflows, and models/algorithms, and to reproduce model results. Additionally, they need to be able to capture and quickly incorporate operational feedback (in the test, staging, or production environments) to further build scale. Accomplishing this requires both the correct infrastructure environment as well as a right-touch model governance approach.
The fourth driver of failure is an inability to operationalize and monetize AI models. Generally speaking, AI models are developed for one of two purposes:

To find previously unidentified insights
To automate decision making (for both cost reduction and efficiency/productivity).

Clearly, models that never make it out of the laboratory can’t accomplish these tasks.
Furthermore, not only do the models need to be deployed (that is, made accessible to people or systems), but they must be incorporated into workflows in such a way that they are “used” in operations, and exceptions (such as when models cannot make decisions with high probability of correctness) must be managed gracefully (such as through human intervention, model retraining, and model rollback). AI operationalization and monetization requires gradual but full model workflow integration, monitoring of data inputs and model performance parameters, and management of frequent model deployments.
How do I AI? An end-to-end AI solution framework
Finally, let’s tie all this together with an example AI solution framework shown in Figure 27.
 Trace3

Figure 27: AI reference architecture.


There are four components:

Data management.
Model development.
Model operationalization.
Ensuring that the models are used, affect the business, and improve business metrics.

The first component, data management, is a normal part of current BI environments, so I don’t describe it here.
The second component, model development, consists to two broad areas:

Defining and prioritizing use cases that are appropriate for machine learning models.
Building the machine learning models at scale.

The third component, model operationalization, not only entails model deployment but also the process of continuous retraining and redeployment, model integration with operational workflows, and integration of operational feedback for model improvement. 
The purpose of all of this is to monetize the models’ capabilities.
Finally, the fourth component, organization and business impact, is simple (and obvious) but vital to the future maturation of an organization’s AI capabilities. The function of this component is to ensure that the AI models are actually used by the lines of businesses (that is, they trust them and derive value from them) and that they are affecting business outcomes. Without line-of-business buy-in, the AI movement will rarely take flight.
Above these four components in Figure 27 are collaboration groups: IT, data engineers, data scientists, and lines of business. AI is a team sport.
You can take these components and put a reference architecture around them (see Figure 28), adding a component called model governance to ensure that model reproducibility, data science reusability, and data scientists’ collaboration are achieved and to ensure that model retraining/rollback is possible when required.

Designing and implementing a solution like this reference architecture will support the AI solution framework with robustness, speed to market, and business outcomes.

The world is fast evolving, with Artificial intelligence (AI) at the forefront in changing the world and the way we live. This article is Part 1 of a 2 part series.
An important question: What is AI? For many people, it remains unclear what this technology is all about, so this is a good place to start the conversation. AI is a branch in computer science that deals with the intelligent behavior of machines. It is an ingeniously simulated ability of a machine to imitate human behavior and our conventional response patterns. This is made possible with specific algorithms that make the AI function in a specified scope of activities (according to what the algorithm codes for). This means that with AI, many of our everyday activities can now be carried out effectively by programmed machine technology.

Over the years, a number of technocrats in the field have carried out extensive work in broadening the prospects of fundamental AI innovations. However, one of the prevailing concerns is in the need for a structure where both male and female genders participate as innovators and active movers. This concern comes as a result of overwhelming male-driven dispositions being incorporated into finished Al functioning products. The reason for this is that few women are present and involved in the development of artificial intelligence.
The importance of AI technology: How can AI change the world?  
Speaking on the relevance and implications of AI adoption in the world’s general operational systems, Microsoft’s chief envisioner David Coplin had this to say:
PROMOTED


It will change how we relate to each other. I would argue that it will even change how we perceive what it means to be human. -- David Coplin 
 



The use of AI in organizations, governments, security frameworks, energy and natural resource management, etc., is drastically on the rise. Although AI advancement levels and use may differ substantially from one geographical region to the other, there are clear indicators pointing to the fact that more people are acknowledging the solutions that the technology brings.
This leads us to acknowledging the center of focus for AI developers. Most AI developers are now ultimately directed towards achieving a basic goal. They are charged with the responsibility of building AI models that would aptly substitute direct human efforts. This need comes in recognition to the inadequacies of human labor efforts, which are characterized by inaccuracy, inefficiency and other failures. For example, artificial intelligence has been pointed at to possess the potential for more accurate medical practices. Thus, you can be sure of a more accurate surgical procedure using this framework than is currently available by most humans. Hence, we can say that the opposites of the inadequacies of human efforts are precisely the benefits of artificial intelligence to our world.

However, even though work is ongoing in significantly constructing the usefulness of this technology, truly significant achievements are yet to come. AI is all around us, but often times we don’t notice it. For instance, Facebook uses AI technology for its image recognition. AI has also played roles in managing calendars, political campaigns, and is fast approaching basically everything!
According to John McCarthy - one of the founding fathers of the technology:


The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.  -- John McCarthy 
 


This conveys that AI can imitate any aspect of our life, and hence presents a different and more advanced world to help us!
Let's consider some obvious reasons why AI will become pervasive in the near future:

AI virtual assistants

Using AI, more people would be able to step down on having to carry out so many tasks by themselves. With a personal assistant AI, we’ll be able to remove the more mundane tasks from our lives. For instance, there may be no need to go to the grocery store, meet with an appointment, or make that deadline yourself as your AI assistant knows just what to do, and when to do it. Consider the value of such help in managing your messages, helping to sort out your wardrobe, doing your laundry. However, the AI would only function according to its developed programming. Hence, one AI may be programmed to work on multiple assignments, while another may be far more narrow in scope of application.

Increasing effective labor input with guaranteed corresponding output

Businesses today are realizing the prospects of AI; they know how valuable the technology is for achieving increased productivity. Unlike human labor that can be very limited, artificial intelligence provides more input with a corresponding positive output - on average. The technology is able to achieve this through the use of innovative diffusion, apt and proactive decision implementations, and other roadmaps that ultimately jerks up positive output.
Accenture has estimated a minimum of 40% increase in realizable productivity for companies that would be adopting AI by the year 2023.
Most artificial intelligence modules are connected to other frameworks such as cloud database and storage, big data, cryptography and blockchain, internet of things (IoT), etc. As such, they are able to facilitate the speed and effectiveness of information transmission and reproducibility, from end to end.

Improving operational costs

Utilization of physical manpower requires sustained salaries and allowance costs for the company. This directly effects the company's net profits and increases operational costs. An AI operated company, where costs on human labor are largely removed, has huge gains in the long and short run due to impactful salary reduction. Although analysts consider the high costs of AI development, the utilizing firm will likely benefit significantly in the long run, and it may just keep the firm alive.
The prospects for AI future use are enormous. This is already indicated in current use of AI in the medical, banking, gaming, transport, manufacturing, and defense sectors.
Artificial intelligence guru and industry influencer Andrew Ng has likened the expected impact of AI, to that of the impact electricity has had on the world. He had this to say in his comparison:


Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don’t think AI will transform in the next several years.  -- Andrew Ng 
 


Elon Musk speaks of the great potentials of AI in bettering the world systems. However, his latest concerns are on the possibilities of an inability of humans to ultimately control its accompanying negative effects. According to Musk, human designed AI may end up becoming a kind of nuisance to man - if it finally becomes pervasive.
But irrespective of how analysts, stakeholders and enthusiasts perceive things, the basic importance of artificial intelligence is undeniable and is adequately acknowledged by all.

And taxing innovation is a sure way to make a country poorer. Europe has also rejected the idea. In 2017 the European Parliament soundly defeated a draft motion, proposed by its committee on legal affairs, that recommended considering a tax on the owners of robots to fund retraining programs for workers displaced by the machines and shore up the finances of their social security system. And yet properly constructed, a tax on automation may not be as destructive as it sounds. South Korea, the most robotized country in the world, instituted a robot tax of sorts in 2018 when it reduced the tax deduction on business investments in automation. There are two sound arguments for taxing robots.  The easiest is this: Governments need the money. In the United States, income taxes account for half of the $3 trillion collected every year by the Internal Revenue Service; payroll taxes account for another third.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Eduardo Porter joined The Times in 2004 from The Wall Street Journal.

What alchemy and astrology can teach artificial intelligence researchers

Artificial intelligence researchers and engineers have spent a lot of effort trying to build machines that look like humans and operate largely independently. Those tempting dreams have distracted many of them from where the real progress is already happening: in systems that enhance – rather than replace – human capabilities. To accelerate the shift to new ways of thinking, AI designers and developers could take some lessons from the missteps of past researchers.





For example, alchemists, like Isaac Newton, pursued ambitious goals such as converting lead to gold, creating a panacea to cure all diseases, and finding potions for immortality. While these goals are alluring, the charlatans pursuing them may have secured princely financial backing that would have been better used developing modern chemistry.
Equally optimistically, astrologers believed they could understand human personality based on birthdates and predict future events by studying the positions of the stars and planets. These promises over the past thousand years often received kingly endorsement, possibly slowing the work of those who were adopting scientific methods that eventually led to astronomy.
As alchemy and astrology evolved, the participants became more deliberate and organized – what might now be called more scientific – about their studies. That shift eventually led to important findings in chemistry, such as those by Lavoisier and Priestley in the 18th century. In astronomy, Kepler and Newton himself made significant findings in the 17th and 18th centuries. A similar turning point is coming for artificial intelligence. Bold innovators are putting aside tempting but impractical dreams of anthropomorphic designs and excessive autonomy. They focus on systems that restore, rely on, and expand human control and responsibility.






Updating early AI dreams
Back in the 1950s, artificial intelligence researchers pursued big goals, such as human-level computational intelligence and machine consciousness. Even during the past 20 years some researchers worked toward the ""singularity"" fantasy of machines that are superior to humans in every way. These dreams succeeded in attracting attention from sympathetic journalists and financial backing from government and industry. But to me, those aspirations still seem like counterproductive wishful thinking and B-level science fiction.
Even the dream of creating a human-shaped robot that acted like a person has lasted for more than 50 years. Honda's near-life-size Asimo and the web-based news reader Ananova got a lot of media attention. Hanson Robotics' Sophia even received Saudi Arabian citizenship. But they have little commercial future.
By contrast, down-to-earth user-centered designs for information search, e-commerce sites, social media and smartphone apps have been wild successes. There is good reason that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are some of the world's biggest companies – they all use more functional, if less glamorous, types of AI.
Today's cellphones feature speech recognition, face recognition and automated translation, which all use artificial intelligence technologies. These functions increase human control and give users more options, without the deception and theatrics of a humanoid robot.










The robot Sophia spoke at the United Nations.
Yielding control
Efforts that pursue advanced forms of computer autonomy are also dangerous. When developers assume their machines will function correctly, they often shortchange interfaces that would allow human users to quickly take control when something goes wrong.
These problems can be deadly. In the October 2018 crash of Lion Air's Boeing 737 Max, a sensor failure caused the newly designed automatic pilot to steer the plane downwards. The pilots couldn't figure out how to override those automatic controls to keep the plane in the air. Similar problems have been factors in stock market ""flash crashes,"" like the 2010 event in which US$1 trillion disappeared in 36 minutes. And poorly designed medical devices have delivered deadly doses of medications.
The National Transportation Safety Board report on the deadly May 2016 Tesla crash called for automated systems to keep detailed records that would allow investigators to analyze failures. Those insights would lead to safer and more effective designs.






Getting to human-centered solutions
Successful automation is all around: Navigation applications give drivers control by showing times for alternative routes. E-commerce websites show shoppers options, customer reviews and clear pricing so they can find and order the goods they need. Elevators, clothes-washing machines and airline check-in kiosks, too, have meaningful controls that enable users to get what they need done quickly and reliably. When modern cameras assist photographers in taking properly focused and exposed photos, users have a sense of mastery and accomplishment for composing the image, even as they get assistance with optimizing technical details.
Without being human-like or fully independent, these and thousands of other applications enable users to accomplish their tasks with self-confidence and sometimes even pride.
A new report from a leading engineering industry professional group urges technologists to ignore tempting fantasies. Rather, the report suggests, developers should focus on technologies that support human performance and are more immediately useful.
In a flourishing automation-enhanced world, clear, convenient interfaces could let humans control automation to make the most of people's initiative, creativity and responsibility. The most successful machines could be powerful tools that let users carry out ever-richer tasks with confidence, such as helping architects find innovative ways to design energy-efficient buildings, and giving journalists tools to dig deeper into data to detect fraud and corruption. Other machines could detect – not contribute to – problems like unsafe medical conditions and bias in mortgage loan approvals. Perhaps they could even advise the people responsible on ways to fix things.
Humans are accomplished at building tools that expand their creativity – and then at using those tools in even more innovative ways than their designers intended. In my view, it's time to let more people be more creative more of the time, by shifting away from the alchemy and astrology phase of AI research.
Technology designers who appreciate and amplify the key aspects of humanity are most likely to invent the next generation of powerful tools. These designers will shift from trying to replace or simulate human behavior in machines to building wildly successful applications that people love to use.

SAN DIEGO, Calif. – Artificial intelligence could be used not only for faster decision-making on the battlefield but also for faster training as the Navy inserts more weapons and tools onto ships and aircraft, the Navy’s top weapons buyer said last week.
James Geurts, the assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition, told reporters that the Navy has many needs for AI tools, especially given the service’s reliance on large data sets such as surveillance video and radar and sonar pictures.
“We tend to focus a lot on decision aids and how to use it to aid in decision-making speed. We look at it a lot of times on how to make sense of lots of data, whether it’s video processing or sonar processing or something along those lines,” Geurts said while speaking to reporters after giving a speech at the WEST 2019 conference, co-hosted by the U.S. Naval Institute and AFCEA.
“I think an area we don’t talk enough about where I think there’s also very interesting opportunities is in training, and how do we speed up our training cycles. So if we get our acquisition cycle going very quickly, whether it’s … building ships faster or putting new capabilities on ships, eventually we will be limited in its effectiveness by how fast we can train the crew and make them proficient. And so some of the use of AI is almost a training aid … I think that’s a whole other area of very interesting possibilities for us to deal with this kind of ever-changing world.”
One early effort to create this kind of AI learning environment is through the use of the Aegis Virtual Twin effort, which allows computers and consoles with the Aegis Combat System to be brought onboard a ship at sea and tap into actual radar and information feeds on the ship without interfering with the crew’s ability to navigate and fight the ship. The consoles running Aegis with real-time data from the ship could be used to test out new software capabilities that the Navy hopes to field and wants to solicit user feedback first, or it could be used for realistic training aboard the ship. The Navy has said that adding artificial intelligence to this existing Aegis Virtual Twin setup would allow the system to understand each user and track his or her past performance, creating future scenarios based on proven weaknesses or areas that haven’t been tested previously rather than providing cookie-cutter training to all sailors.

Leaders at the Department of Defense level are also eager to incorporate AI technologies. Speaking at WEST, Alan Shaffer, deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, said that the Navy needs to buy ships and planes, but if it can’t also field enablers then it won’t win a high-end fight.
“One of the biggest enablers is digital supremacy. Who can turn knowledge into decisions most quickly. So I say frequently … 100 years ago, wars were won by the folks with the biggest biceps. That’s not the future. The future is, who can get to the right decision most quickly. And what enables decisions? Turning a lot of data over to algorithms to crunch it to help give a decision – what most people call artificial intelligence. It’s not a panacea, it’s not perfect, it’s not everything, but the concept of turning data into the right decision more quickly – or more importantly, pointing out when something is going south – is incredibly important. So artificial intelligence … will help speed decisions,” Shaffer said in his keynote speech.
Rear Adm. Christian Becker, the commander of Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command that leads the Navy’s efforts to embrace AI, information warfare and other high-end capabilities, talked about information as warfare and said advances in this realm would improve “the ability to command and control a fight, I’m talking about the ability to sense an environment, I’m talking about the ability to direct fires, integrate fires. That’s information as warfare, and that’s what we’re working on.”
But the Navy can’t just incorporate new technology for the sake of modernizing; it needs to fully rethink how it conducts missions and how it buys new technologies, in the wake of this new digital warfare world.
“I’ll leave you with one quote that I find really appropriate when we talk about being able to go faster, being able to think about things differently, how we approach things, how we buy things, how we require things and how we get after the fight,” Becker said in a panel presentation.
“We can keep improving the way we’re doing business today, but if we need to do business completely differently in order to move at speed and scale, then we’ve got to figure out what that different is. … The quote I’ll leave you with comes from someone named (retired Vice Adm. David) Decoy Dunaway: ‘Don’t do stupid better.’”

4 emerging tech tools for EHS and sustainability professionals


Early adopters are turning to wearable sensors, drones and artificial intelligence to reduce risks and drive measurable results. 


By Jen Boynton
February 21, 2019














What does it take to prevent environmental pollution? How do you make sure employees perform their work in a way that keeps them safe from injury? Which sustainability metrics are best for helping your company change how it operates?  A new report from the National Association for Environment, Health and Safety and Sustainability management (NAEM) reveals that emerging technologies are rapidly changing how companies answer those questions. In its latest research into the trends shaping the profession, the association found that companies are experimenting with some truly high-tech solutions to improve data collection, reduce risks and monitor their environmental impacts in live time.Here is a look at a few technology tools that are starting to take hold:1. Smart sensorsThirty-one percent of NAEM respondents are using or evaluating using smart sensors in the workplace. It’s no surprise — smart sensors have a variety of possible applications at work. These devices take input from the physical environment and use built-in computational resources to respond, performing predefined functions upon detection of specific input. Smart sensors can be used for everything from tracking worker safety — to see if a line operator is at risk of an ergonomic injury — to monitoring a storage tank’s walls for stability and the liquid contents within to ensure they are in the correct balance. All of these applications increase the rate that key data reaches the people who can act on it and reduce the likelihood of bad things happening.2. DronesDrones and other unmanned aerial vehicles can monitor broad swaths of land and those that are difficult to access by road or foot. In forested areas, they can track illegal deforestation and monitor for wildfires.  In agricultural applications, they can monitor fields for crop growth, infestations and irrigation leaks. Ranchers can use drones equipped with high definition cameras and thermal imaging to monitor livestock location and health.
New data is only as good and as useful as the algorithms that make sense of it.

The key with all of these applications is that they allow for more robust monitoring at a reduced cost than ""boots on the ground"" can provide. Quickly identifying problems means the cost of containment will be much lower. It’s no surprise 14 percent of respondents are using or evaluating drones for use in EHS monitoring, inspections and data collection.3. Artificial intelligence and machine learningTwenty percent of respondents are using machine learning — a form of artificial intelligence — on the job. The most crucial applications combine raw data with a computer powerful enough to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. One machine learning platform NAEM documented automates decision-making for retailers on unsaleable items such as leaking detergent or expired hair dye. It provides retail employees with a barcode scanner connected to a database which advises employees about the hazardous materials contained in the products and the best way to dispose of them: donation; recycling; or landfill.Artificial intelligence brings automation to many other routine EHS&S tasks as well, from air quality sampling to greenhouse gas emissions management.4. Virtual realityWhen it comes to workplace safety, training is key. Virtual reality is making EHS&S training faster, easier and more effective. Rather than simply describing a safety risk companies can use a simulated work environment to teach employees how to safely lift and load, practice new skills and work in confined spaces. EHS&S professionals are also using it to conduct virtual ""walkthroughs"" of facilities before they are built to flag compliance issues and to advise on modifications that could be made while the project is still in the design stage. Sixteen percent of those surveyed are using or evaluating virtual reality tools to help get the job done.Don't forget the important role of data managementAs these new technologies come on line, effective data management becomes a new opportunity and challenge. New data is only as good and as useful as the algorithms that make sense of it. Privacy concerns also come into play. Data security protocols must be strong and algorithms must be carefully crafted to avoid inserting bias. These concerns are top of mind for any EHS&S professional integrating new data systems into their work. The most effective integrations of new technology will be mindful of these challenges and work proactively to resolve them.Ultimately, it’s not the data you have but what you do with it that makes new technology most impactful.

 The story of Artificial Intelligence hype has a considerable business history in 2019. AI is increasingly being absorbed into just about every business sector. Once an investment in the future, it is now an optimization of machine learning in the present. What was once a buzzword for an unspecified time carries with it now the hype of the future that is quickly becoming very much the here and now.
 Many people don’t know the extent to which Artificial Intelligence is changing the workforce and how it has been an integral part of the history of R&D at companies such as Microsoft. In fact, quite incredibly in 2019 it’s Microsoft that leads the AI patent race. 









PROMOTED

There have been over 154,000 AI patents filed worldwide since 2010 
The survey from IFI Claims Patent Services shows a strong uptick in the patent category covering AI, machine learning and neural networks.
Between 2013 and 2018, the category grew by 34% annually.

 Yet tech companies such as Microsoft and Google are also sounding the alarm on the potential dangers of AI in an era of deep fakes, facial recognition software with biases and many other applications with potential dangers. As of November last year, Microsoft though had filed 697 AI patents identified as important due to their ‘significant competitive advantage’. Out of the top 30 companies listed in the research, Microsoft filed 20% of all patents and is ranked number 1.  Microsoft’s approach to AI is rigorous and has a long history.

 Microsoft shows the AI Hype is Real  To seek the origins of Microsoft’s interest in artificial intelligence, we have to go back to when Bill Gates founded Microsoft’s research arm in 1991. It’s clear that AI was an area of investigation from the start that’s fast tracked the world we know today. Think about that for a moment, that’s nearly three decades ago. Indeed from the start, Microsoft Research (MSR for short) hired more than its fair share of computing’s most visionary, accomplished experts and academic talent in the domain. Yet in the last few years up to the present of 2019, AI-based marketing patents are the fastest growing global category, reaching a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29.3% between 2010 and 2018. Machine learning dominates the AI patent landscape today, leading all categories of AI patents including deep learning and neural networks and Microsoft is among the leaders in the Cloud, cybersecurity and AI-based digital security patents. We are just five years into Satya Nadella’s tenure as Microsoft CEO and he has decidedly pivoted the company towards AI and the Cloud. Incredibly, today more than 1,000 computer scientists are in MSR’s employ, as well as at its Redmond headquarters in addition to such global locations such as Boston, Montreal, Beijing, Bangalore and beyond. You might say that the decade ahead, the 2020s, is the era when artificial intelligence will grow up and while to be sure Hollywood renditions of AI are extreme exaggerations of technology far beyond what we are capable of today, there’s a looming promise of AI’s impact on the global economy for years to come. Essentially AI is attributed to add 1.2% to annual GDP growth over the next decade. That’s an astounding figure, and one that proves that the hype might be justified.

Led by renowned roboticist Dieter Fox, senior director of robotics research at Nvidia and a professor at the University of Washington, the lab is aiming to develop the next generation of robots that can safely work alongside humans, possibly transforming industries like manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare in the process. It’s one of the many grand challenges for artificial intelligence – a sci-fi vision of robots that aren’t just good at very specific tasks, but capable of behaving as if almost human.
But the robot is also a somewhat elaborate muscle flexing exercise. It’s an eye-catching demonstration of what Nvidia’s hardware and software can do today and could do in the future – and a bid by the company to stay one step ahead of an increasingly speedy competition.
Optimising graphics processing unit, or GPUs, for AI back in 2005 must go down as one of the smartest business decisions in technology hardware history. But now it’s on top, and faced with increasing competition, consolidating that position will be one of the toughest tests in Nvidia’s 25-year history.
Nvidia’s latest lab has been kitted out with equipment and real life environments that robots are expected to encounter in the real world. The first of these scenarios is a humble kitchen. The robot assistant integrates AI and deep learning techniques to detect and track objects, understand the relative positions of doors and drawers, and open and close them to access specific items. “In the past, robotics research has focused on small, independent projects rather than fully integrated systems,” Fox says. “We’re bringing together a collaborative, interdisciplinary team of experts in robot control and perception, computer vision, human-robot interaction, and deep learning.”
The team in Seattle is being assisted by around 60 researchers spread across Nvidia’s other research hubs in Santa Clara, Eastern Massachusetts, Toronto and Tel Aviv. The multidisciplinary approach has a fiendishly difficult goal: Nvidia is trying to show that its artificial intelligence hardware and software can transform robots from what they are today – very accurate positioning machines that dumbly follow regimented instructions – into dynamic and flexible machines that can safely work alongside humans.
Samim Wagner, an AI researcher for Google in Berlin, believes one of the main reasons Nvidia is carrying out its own research is to help it build better AI hardware that it can then sell on to others. “In order to build feasible and competitive hardware for machine learning, Nvidia is strategically forced to do high quality machine learning research,” he says. “The company’s traditional connections with the games and entertainment industries provide it with a focus-point for its machine learning research, which is key for success.” Which helps explain the robot – and a host of other oddball experiments taking place in Nvidia’s research laboratories.
“Now that we have deep learning it’s possible to make robots interact with their environment,” says Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist and senior vice president of research, in reference to the robot kitchen helper. “Now that we can build perceptual systems, we can build robots that don’t count on the car being in the exact same spot each time.”
As with Nvidia’s experiments with robotics, deep learning has enabled AI systems to tackle problems that were previously impossible. Through its trial-and-error technique, breakthroughs have been made in virtual assistants, computer vision, language translation, chatbots and facial recognition. And, as with so much in artificial intelligence, such breakthroughs rely heavily on clever little GPUs.
Nvidia’s AI journey started at Joanie’s Cafe in Palo Alto, California, in 2010. “We got into AI after a breakfast meeting I had with Andrew Ng,” says Dally. At that breakfast, Ng, a well known AI researcher who was working with Google Brain at the time, explained how Google was training AI systems to recognise photos of cats with the help of 16,000 central processing units, or CPUs. After pointing out next to no one has 16,000 CPUs at their disposal, Dally laid down a challenge. “I bet we could do this with way fewer GPUs,” he said to Ng.
Shortly after the encounter, Dally asked Nvidia researcher Bryan Catanzaro to team up with Ng and do just that. “We achieved roughly the same performance with 48 GPUs that they had done with 16,000 CPUs,” says Dally. “At the time it was really clear to me that this was going to transform everything.”
From a bet about recognising cats, Nvidia’s AI business has exploded. The company doesn’t disclose exactly how much it is currently investing into the field, but filings reveal it spent a total of $1.8 billion (£1.4b) on all research in the last financial year. Key areas of investment were gaming, AI and automotive. The effectiveness of its GPUs for artificial intelligence projects has created a  scramble amongst Nvidia’s competitors, with Intel, Google and even Facebook investing huge sums of money to try and catch up.
In July 2018, Google announced it was developing its own AI chips for on-device machine learning. Google’s bet is on a new kind of chip: a tensor processing unit designed specifically for neural network machine learning. And a separate, equally important tussle is also unfolding. As well as hardware, Nvidia’s code library is also going up against rival frameworks such as Google Tensorflow or Facebook PyTorch. Think of it as deep learning as a service. And, against all the odds, Nvidia is still holding its own.
The reason? As the cat challenge showed, GPUs are brilliant at handling AI tasks. That’s because GPUs are better than CPUs at running the parallel computing problems associated with AI, where many calculations are carried out simultaneously. Parallel computing is particularly prevalent in neural networks because they are designed to work in a similar way to animal brains, which can do many tasks at the same time, or in parallel. Eventually, Nvidia wants to be the one building the artificial brains inside every phone, computer, robot and autonomous car.
Led by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, the company effectively preempted the AI boom back in 2005 when it created software that allowed its GPUs to process the millions of minuscule computations that would eventually be required by modern AI. Its GPUs are now in data centres around the world, powering AI tasks for thousands of businesses. Between 2014 and 2018, the company was boosted by a 524 per cent increase in revenue for its data centre-optimised chips.
“We’re the supplier to the whole world,” says Dally. “Everyone’s training their deep neural networks on Nvidia GPUs,” he continues, adding that the company’s T4 chip is widely used for inference tasks. Facebook and Google use Nvidia’s platform to power the AI features on their platforms. Almost all the driverless car companies are using Nvidia technology. The company has also signed deals with Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu.
As with the robot in the kitchen, Nvidia’s other AI experiments appear similarly eclectic and oddball. It’s built a creative neural network, known as a generative adversarial network, or GAN, that’s scarily good at creating hyper-realistic images of human faces. In a paper released in December 2018, the company showed just how clear its GAN faces are compared to GAN faces from four years ago.
Faces aren’t the only thing that Nvidia’s GANs can create, or fake. Nvidia has also developed a translation network that can turn photos taken in winter into beautiful summery scenes. Got a rainy photo of your wedding you want brightening up? Nvidia’s AI can make it look just like the sun was shining all along. And it doesn’t stop there. Nvidia showed off the world’s first video game demo to use AI-generated graphics at the end of last year. The demo was a driving simulator that was built by combining AI-generated visuals with a standard video game engine.

But there have been bumps in the road. And they hint at a rougher ride to come. At the start of the year, Nvidia was forced to cut its fourth quarter revenue forecast by $500 million in a move that saw its stock tumble nearly 18 per cent. The cryptocurrency crash that rumbled through much of 2018 was extremely painful for Nvidia’s bottom line, costing it an estimated $23 billion in market value. But it was also a blessing – albeit an expensive one.
For the time being, the adaptability of Nvidia’s GPUs give it an edge over its rivals: they’re integral to data centres, self-driving cars, research labs, cryptocurrency mining rigs – you name it, there’s a GPU in it. But that could soon change. And that’s where Nvidia’s research labs come into play.
“There’s a slew of new AI hardware startups,” says Stephen Merity, an AI research consultant and the founder of a startup in stealth mode. “They may well be a threat but it’s a huge open question. I can’t imagine any of those startups hitting mass scale early on.”
One such startup is UK-based Graphcore, which is now valued at over $1 billion (£760,000) thanks to funding from the likes of BMW, Sequoia, and the founder of Google-owned DeepMind. Graphcore claims its intelligence processing units, which are yet to go into mass production, are 100 times faster than any existing systems. For Nvidia, that could create a financial headache bigger than the cryptocrash.
“I don’t know what the end state of the AI hardware ecosystem looks like,” says deep learning researcher Stephen Merity. “If the end state is the same hardware on both sides, Nvidia has an advantage. If it fragments into ‘hardware you use for training’ and ‘hardware you use in the real world’ then Graphcore and other similar startups may do very well.”

But, according to the economist Richard Baldwin, in “The Globotics Upheaval: Globalization, Robotics, and the Future of Work” (Oxford), the new ones are “white-collar robots,” knowledge workers and quinoa-and-oat-milk globalists, the machines that will bankrupt Brooklyn. Mainly, they’re algorithms. Except when they’re immigrants. Baldwin calls that kind “remote intelligence,” or R.I.: they’re not exactly robots but, somehow, they fall into the same category. They’re people from other countries who can steal your job without ever really crossing the border: they just hop over, by way of the Internet and apps like Upwork, undocumented, invisible, ethereal. Between artificial intelligence and remote intelligence, Baldwin warns, “this international talent tidal wave is coming straight for the good, stable jobs that have been the foundation of middle-class prosperity in the US and Europe, and other high-wage economies.” Change your Wi-Fi password.

How can you know if you’re about to get replaced by an invading algorithm or an augmented immigrant? “If your job can be easily explained, it can be automated,” Anders Sandberg, of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, tells Oppenheimer. “If it can’t, it won’t.” (Rotten luck for people whose job description is “Predict the future.”) Baldwin offers three-part advice: (1) avoid competing with A.I. and R.I.; (2) build skills in things that only humans can do, in person; and (3) “realize that humanity is an edge not a handicap.” What all this means is hard to say, especially if you’ve never before considered being human to be a handicap. As for the future of humanity, Oppenheimer offers another cockamamie rule of three: “Society will be divided into three general groups. The first will be members of the elites, who will be able to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape and who will earn the most money, followed by a second group made up primarily of those who provide personalized services to the elite, including personal trainers, Zumba class instructors, meditation gurus, piano teachers, and personal chefs, and finally a third group of those who will be mostly unemployed and may be receiving a universal basic income as compensation for being the victims of technological unemployment.”
Readers of Douglas Adams will recognize this sort of hooey from “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” Long ago, in a galaxy not at all far away, the people of the planet Golgafrincham were divided into three groups: A, “all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers”; B, “hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants” (the group that everyone else considers to be “a bunch of useless idiots”); and, C, “all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things.” The B people, told they must lead an expedition to colonize another planet, rocket away in a starship, having been led to believe that their planet is doomed. “Apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something,” the B ship’s captain tells Arthur Dent, vaguely wondering why the other ships never followed. “Or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was.” Dent inquires, “And they made sure they sent you lot off first, did they?”
This time, notwithstanding Elon Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, no one’s trying to persuade the B people to board a spaceship, because the B people—the hairdressers and the Zumba-class instructors, the meditation gurus and the personal trainers—are supposed to stick around to cater to the A people. No, this time it’s the C people, the people who make and do things—things that can now be made and done faster and cheaper by robots—who are being flushed down the cosmic toilet. The historian and sometime futurist Yuval Noah Harari has a name for the C people: he calls them the “useless class.” Some futurists suggest that, in our Asimov-y future, these sort of people might wind up spending their empty days playing video games. Otherwise, they’ll wage a revolution, an eventuality that the self-proclaimed “cognitive elite”—the A people, who believe themselves to be cleverer than the cleverest robots—intend to wait out in fortified lairs. (Peter Thiel owns nearly five hundred acres of land in New Zealand, complete with its own water supply.) More popular is the proposal to pay the C people for doing nothing, in order to avert the revolution. “It’s going to be necessary,” Musk said during a summit in Dubai two years ago, joining a small herd of other billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, of Facebook, and Stewart Butterfield, of Slack, who endorse universal basic income. It’s either that or build a wall.
This thesis has been rolling around like a marble in the bowl of a lot of people’s brains for a while now, and many of those marbles were handed out by Martin Ford, in his 2015 book, “Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future.” In the book, and in an essay in “Confronting Dystopia: The New Technological Revolution and the Future of Work” (Cornell), Ford acknowledges that all other earlier robot-invasion panics were unfounded. In the nineteenth century, people who worked on farms lost their jobs when agricultural processes were mechanized, but they eventually earned more money working in factories. In the twentieth century, automation of industrial production led to warnings about “unprecedented economic and social disorder.” Instead, displaced factory workers moved into service jobs. Machines eliminate jobs; rising productivity creates new jobs.
“Given this long record of false alarms, contemporary economists are generally dismissive of arguments that technological progress might lead to unemployment as well as falling wages and soaring income inequality,” Ford admits. After all, “history shows that the economy has consistently adjusted to advancing technology by creating new employment opportunities and that these new jobs often require more skills and pay higher wages.”
That was then. The reason that things will be different this time, Ford argues, has to do with the changing pace of change. The transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy was linear; the current acceleration is exponential. The first followed Newton’s law; the second follows Moore’s. The employment apocalypse, when it comes, will happen so fast that workers won’t have time to adjust by shifting to new employment sectors, and, even if they did have time to adjust, there would be no new employment sectors to go to, because robots will be able to do just about everything.
It is quite possible that this thesis is correct; it is not possible to know that it is correct. Ford, an advocate of universal basic income, is neither a historian nor an economist. He is a futurist, a modern-day shaman, with an M.B.A. Everybody thinks about the future; futurists do it for a living. Policymakers make plans; futurists read omens. The robots-are-coming omen-reading borrows as much from the conventions of science fiction as from those of historical analysis. It uses “robot” as a shorthand for everything from steam-powered looms to electricity-driven industrial assemblers and artificial intelligence, and thus has the twin effects of compressing time and conflating one thing with another. It indulges in the supposition that work is something the wealthy hand out to the poor, from feudalism to capitalism, instead of something people do, for reasons that include a search for order, meaning, and purpose. It leaves out of its accounting the largest source of labor in the United States before the Civil War, people held in bondage, and fails to consider how the rise of wage labor left women’s work uncompensated. And it ignores the brutal truth that, in American history, panic about technological change is almost always tangled up with panic about immigration. Nineteenth-century populists, those farmers left behind by the industrial revolution, wanted railroad companies to be taxed, but they also wanted to bar African-Americans and Asian immigrants from full citizenship. They raged against the machine; they fought for the color line.
In “Temp: How American Work, American Business, and the American Dream Became Temporary” (Viking), the historian Louis Hyman argues that in the course of the past century management consultants, taking the wheel, reinvented work by making employers more like machines, turning work into the kind of thing that robots could do long before there were any robots able to do it. His story begins in the nineteen-twenties, with the rise of management consulting, and takes a turn in the fifties, with the first major wave of automation, a word coined in 1948. “Machines should be used instead of people whenever possible,” a staffer for the National Office Managers Association advised in 1952. To compete, workers had to become as flexible as machines: able to work on a task basis; ineligible for unions; free at night; willing to work any shift; requiring no health care or other benefits, not so much as a day off at Christmas; easy to hire; and easier to fire.
“The rise of computers and the rise of temps went hand in hand,” Hyman writes. By 1958, Elmer Winter had founded Manpower, Inc., and companies all over the country had come to rely on the services of management consultants to trim their employment costs. Hyman argues, “Beginning in the midst of the postwar boom in the 1950s, American jobs were slowly remade from top to bottom: consultants supplanted executives at the top, temps replaced office workers in the middle, and day laborers pushed out union workers at the bottom. On every step of the ladder, work would become more insecure as it became more flexible.”
Gradually, Hyman says, “the key features of the postwar corporation—stable workforce, retained earnings, and minimized risk—became liabilities rather than assets.” Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, Harvard Business School’s Michael Porter introduced the logic underlying outsourcing. By the nineteen-eighties, corporations had to get “lean.” (I worked for Porter in those days, as a Manpower temp.) By the nineteen-nineties, they needed to “downsize.” If businesses exist not to make things and employ people but instead to maximize profits for investors, labor can be done by temps, by poorly paid workers in other countries, or by robots, whichever is cheapest.
The robots, though, were mainly for show. In the nineteen-eighties, Apple called its headquarters the Robot Factory. “To understand the electronics industry is simple: every time someone says ‘robot,’ simply picture a woman of color,” Hyman advises. One in five electronics companies used no automation at all, and the rest used very little. Seagate’s disk drives were assembled by women in Singapore. Hewlett-Packard hired so many temporary workers that it started its own temp agency. The most important technology in the electronics industry, as Hyman points out, was the fingernail.
In the nineteen-eighties, the sociologist Patricia Fernandez-Kelly conducted a study of the electronics and garment industries in Southern California. More than seventy per cent of the labor force was women of color, and more than seventy per cent of those women were Hispanic. In San Diego, Fernandez-Kelly interviewed a woman she called Fermina Calero (a pseudonym, to protect her from deportation). Calero was born in Mexico. In 1980, when she was twenty-one, she began working in Tijuana, soldering filaments of metal for sixty-five cents an hour. In 1983, Calero crossed into the United States, illegally, to work at Kaypro, the maker of the Kaypro II, a personal computer that briefly rivalled the Apple II. In the nineteen-sixties and seventies, Andrew Kay, the company’s founder, had hired management consultants to help him reimagine his labor force. In the eighties, when people speaking English responded to the company’s newspaper Help Wanted ads, they were told that there were no openings; when people speaking Spanish called, they were invited to apply. By the time Calero started working for Kaypro, its workforce consisted of seven hundred people, nearly all undocumented Mexican immigrants. The company’s general manager said, “They are reliable; they work hard; they don’t make trouble.” At Kaypro, Calero earned nearly five dollars an hour. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service raided the factory, she hid in a supply closet. She was not a robot.
Skeptics of the current robots-are-coming argument predict the arrival of another A.I. winter. “We have not moved a byte forward in understanding human intelligence,” Zia Chishti wrote in the Financial Times last fall. “We have much faster computers, thanks to Moore’s law, but the underlying algorithms are mostly identical to those that powered machines 40 years ago.” That goes back to the time of the Kaypro.
A lot has changed in those forty years, not least in the availability of enormous sets of data that artificial intelligences can use to study and learn. Still, the economist Robert J. Gordon is unconvinced that the robots are coming. In his 2016 book, “The Rise and Fall of American Growth,” he argued that a century of economic expansion that began in 1870—driven by human-condition changing developments like electricity, a public water supply, and the interstate-highway system—ended in 1970, and that, since then, inventions have been merely incremental. The telephone was patented in 1876. It changed people’s lives, and contributed to a huge rise in productivity. The cell phone, Gordon argues, just isn’t that different from a telephone. In a 2016 essay, “Why Robots Will Not Decimate Human Jobs,” Gordon points out that the uses to which smartphones get put are “not a part of the market economy that creates jobs and pays wages.” Robots have altered manufacturing, he concedes, but he doesn’t think that they’ve altered the economy, or that they’re about to. “I play a game called ‘find the robot,’ ” he writes. “In my daily strolls in and out of supermarkets, restaurants, doctor and dentist offices, my nearby hospital, offices in my own university, and the vast amount of employment involving elementary and secondary teachers, personal trainers, and old age caretakers, I have yet to find a robot.”
Economic inequality produces political instability and partisan death matches. Everyone worries about jobs, but people who worry about robots and people who worry about immigrants propose very different solutions. Either way, much writing in this field is, essentially, fantasy. In “The Globotics Upheaval,” Baldwin predicts that the march of the robots will have four stages: transformation, upheaval, backlash, and resolution. The resolution will involve what he calls “shelterism.” Once white-collar workers realize that their jobs are on the line, too, they’ll find ways to protect themselves by “sheltering” certain activities, things that only humans can do. He explains, “This will mean that our work lives will be filled with far more caring, sharing, understanding, creating, empathizing, innovating, and managing people who are actually in the same room. This is a logical inevitability—everything else will be done by globots.” The catch is that, historically, caring, sharing, understanding, and empathizing with people who are in the same room as you has been the work of women, and is therefore either unpaid, and not recognized as work, or paid very badly. Childcare, elementary-school teaching, nursing, geriatric care, and social work will not suddenly become high-paying, high-prestige professions simply because everything else is done by robots. If that were going to happen, it would already be happening, because we already know that these jobs require beings who are human. Instead, something darker is going on, mirrored in the feminizing of robots, from the male robots of the nineteen-sixties and seventies—Hal, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Mr. Robinson’s robot on “Lost in Space”—to the fembots and sexbots of “Her” and “Ex Machina,” and, not least, the sexy and slavish Alexa. Female workers aren’t being paid more for being human; instead, robots are selling better when they’re female.
The economist Oren Cass, the author of “The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America” (Encounter), much of which originally appeared in National Review, is fed up with the robot hysteria. “Technological innovation and automation have always been integral to our economic progress, and in a well-functioning labor market, they should produce gains for all types of workers,” he insists. He has no patience with advocates of universal basic income, either. “We have reached a point where the rich think paying everyone else to go away represents compassionate thinking,” he writes.
Like Hyman, Cass blames mid-twentieth-century economic thinkers for the current malaise, though he blames different thinkers. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, he argues, economic policymakers abandoned workers and the health of the labor market in favor of a commitment to over-all economic growth, with redistribution as an adjustment and consumerism as its objective. That required quantifying prosperity, hence the G.D.P., a measure that Cass, along with other writers, finds to be disastrous, not least because it values consumers above producers. Cass sees universal basic income as the end-stage scenario of every other redistribution program, whose justification is that the poor will be fine without work as long as they can buy things. Here he mocks the advocates of the current economic arrangement, who are prone to note that the poor are not actually starving, “and so many people have iPhones!”
Reporters are suckers for the hype, Cass maintains, pointing out that after a 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that, in the next hundred years, robots might eliminate as many manufacturing jobs as were lost in 2001 (presumably, a tolerable loss), the Times ran a story with the headline “Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs,” while the Washington Post titled its story “We’re So Unprepared for the Robot Apocalypse.” Cass offers a careful criticism of the robots-are-stealing-our-jobs theory. He cites four of its errors. It overestimates twenty-first-century innovations and underestimates the innovations of earlier centuries. It miscalculates the pace of change. It assumes that automation will not create new sectors. (3-D printing might replace a lot of manufacturing workers, but it could also create a lot of new small businesses.) And it fails to appreciate the complexity of many of the jobs it thinks robots can do. The 2013 Oxford study that kept Andrés Oppenheimer up at night Cass finds to be mostly silly. Its authors, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, rated seven hundred and two occupations from least “computerizable” to most. Highly vulnerable are school-bus drivers, and, while a self-driving school bus does not seem technically too far off, Cass points out, few parents can imagine putting their kids on a bus without a grownup to make sure they don’t bash one another the whole way to school.
Cass’s own policy proposals center, very reasonably, on the importance of work and family, but he fails to demonstrate how his proposals—lowering environmental regulations and establishing academic tracking in high schools—will achieve his objectives. And though “The Once and Future Worker” offers a rousing call for an honest reckoning with American economic policy, it also indulges in its own sleight of hand. “The story goes that ‘automation’ or the ‘knowledge economy,’ not bad public policy, is to blame,” Cass writes. “Historically, economists and policy makers have led the effort to explain that technological innovation is good for workers throughout the economy, even as its ‘creative destruction’ causes dislocation for some. So why, suddenly, are they so eager to throw robots and programmers under the bus?” One answer might be that, given the current state of American political polarization, it’s either throw the robots under the bus or throw the immigrants. Cass, not surprisingly, advocates restricting immigration.
Trump is a closer. Closers tend to talk about immigrants. Trump has tweeted the word “jobs” nearly six hundred times, but not once has he tweeted the words “robot,” “robots,” or “automation.” “We’re going to fight for every last American job,” he promised from the floor of a Boeing plant in South Carolina, weeks after taking office. “I don’t want companies leaving our country,” the new President said. “There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the products, and think that they are going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.” That June, Boeing laid off nearly two hundred employees from the South Carolina plant, as part of a forty-per-cent reduction in its production of 777s. In 2017, the company laid off nearly six thousand workers.
Trump’s Administration mocks fears of a robot invasion. Closers usually do. “I’m not worried at all,” Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said two years ago. Nevertheless, some think tankers suggested that Trump’s election was “secretly about automation.” And a study published last summer in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy—whose lead author, Carl Frey, is the same guy who made the list of the seven hundred and two most computerizable jobs—argues that the robot caravan got Trump elected. Measuring the density of robots and comparing them with election returns, Frey and his colleagues found that “electoral districts that became more exposed to automation during the years running up to the election were more likely to vote for Trump.” Indulging in a counterfactual, they suggest that a less steeply rising increase in exposure to robots would have tipped both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin toward voting for Hillary Clinton. According to this line of thinking, Twitter bots and fake Facebook news didn’t elect Donald Trump, but robots really might have. Or maybe it was all the talk about the wall.
Heads, the robots are coming! Accept the inevitability of near-universal unemployment! Tails, the Mexicans are coming! Close the borders! So far, the only other choice, aside from helplessly watching the rise of extremism, is to mint a new coin. Heat a forge. Smelt a blank. Engrave two dies. Put your blank in between them. Strike the whole thing with a hammer.

No one is safe.

There’s just the one coin. Both fears have to do with jobs, whose loss produces suffering, want, and despair, and whose future scarcity represents a terrifying prospect. Misery likes a scapegoat: heads, blame machines; tails, foreigners. But is the present alarm warranted? Panic is not evidence of danger; it’s evidence of panic. Stoking fear of invading robots and of invading immigrants has been going on for a long time, and the predictions of disaster have, generally, been bananas. Oh, but this time it’s different, the robotomizers insist.This thesis has been rolling around like a marble in the bowl of a lot of people’s brains for a while now, and many of those marbles were handed out by Martin Ford, in his 2015 book, “Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future.” In the book, and in an essay in “Confronting Dystopia: The New Technological Revolution and the Future of Work” (Cornell), Ford acknowledges that all other earlier robot-invasion panics were unfounded.

They raged against the machine; they fought for the color line.Futurists foretell inevitable outcomes by conjuring up inevitable pasts. People who are in the business of selling predictions need to present the past as predictable—the ground truth, the test case. Machines are more predictable than people, and in histories written by futurists the machines just keep coming; depicting their march as unstoppable certifies the futurists’ predictions. But machines don’t just keep coming. They are funded, invented, built, sold, bought, and used by people who could just as easily not fund, invent, build, sell, buy, and use them. Machines don’t drive history; people do. History is not a smart car.Video From The New YorkerHow the Coronavirus Is Widening Economic InequalityIn “Temp: How American Work, American Business, and the American Dream Became Temporary” (Viking), the historian Louis Hyman argues that in the course of the past century management consultants, taking the wheel, reinvented work by making employers more like machines, turning work into the kind of thing that robots could do long before there were any robots able to do it. His story begins in the nineteen-twenties, with the rise of management consulting, and takes a turn in the fifties, with the first major wave of automation, a word coined in 1948. “Machines should be used instead of people whenever possible,” a staffer for the National Office Managers Association advised in 1952. To compete, workers had to become as flexible as machines: able to work on a task basis; ineligible for unions; free at night; willing to work any shift; requiring no health care or other benefits, not so much as a day off at Christmas; easy to hire; and easier to fire.“The rise of computers and the rise of temps went hand in hand,” Hyman writes. By 1958, Elmer Winter had founded Manpower, Inc., and companies all over the country had come to rely on the services of management consultants to trim their employment costs. Hyman argues, “Beginning in the midst of the postwar boom in the 1950s, American jobs were slowly remade from top to bottom: consultants supplanted executives at the top, temps replaced office workers in the middle, and day laborers pushed out union workers at the bottom. On every step of the ladder, work would become more insecure as it became more flexible.”Gradually, Hyman says, “the key features of the postwar corporation—stable workforce, retained earnings, and minimized risk—became liabilities rather than assets.” Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, Harvard Business School’s Michael Porter introduced the logic underlying outsourcing. By the nineteen-eighties, corporations had to get “lean.” (I worked for Porter in those days, as a Manpower temp.) By the nineteen-nineties, they needed to “downsize.” If businesses exist not to make things and employ people but instead to maximize profits for investors, labor can be done by temps, by poorly paid workers in other countries, or by robots, whichever is cheapest.The robots, though, were mainly for show. In the nineteen-eighties, Apple called its headquarters the Robot Factory. “To understand the electronics industry is simple: every time someone says ‘robot,’ simply picture a woman of color,” Hyman advises. One in five electronics companies used no automation at all, and the rest used very little. Seagate’s disk drives were assembled by women in Singapore. Hewlett-Packard hired so many temporary workers that it started its own temp agency. The most important technology in the electronics industry, as Hyman points out, was the fingernail.“Normally, I’d say we can do this the easy way or the hard way, but, honestly, we have time for both. Our 2 P.M. cancelled.”Copy link to cartoonCopyLinkLink copiedShopShopOpen cartoon galleryOpen GalleryIn the nineteen-eighties, the sociologist Patricia Fernandez-Kelly conducted a study of the electronics and garment industries in Southern California. More than seventy per cent of the labor force was women of color, and more than seventy per cent of those women were Hispanic. In San Diego, Fernandez-Kelly interviewed a woman she called Fermina Calero (a pseudonym, to protect her from deportation). Calero was born in Mexico. In 1980, when she was twenty-one, she began working in Tijuana, soldering filaments of metal for sixty-five cents an hour. In 1983, Calero crossed into the United States, illegally, to work at Kaypro, the maker of the Kaypro II, a personal computer that briefly rivalled the Apple II. In the nineteen-sixties and seventies, Andrew Kay, the company’s founder, had hired management consultants to help him reimagine his labor force. In the eighties, when people speaking English responded to the company’s newspaper Help Wanted ads, they were told that there were no openings; when people speaking Spanish called, they were invited to apply. By the time Calero started working for Kaypro, its workforce consisted of seven hundred people, nearly all undocumented Mexican immigrants. The company’s general manager said, “They are reliable; they work hard; they don’t make trouble.” At Kaypro, Calero earned nearly five dollars an hour. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service raided the factory, she hid in a supply closet. She was not a robot.In 1984, the year that Calero hid in a closet at Kaypro, computer scientists at the annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence began warning about the coming of an “A.I. winter”: artificial intelligence had been overhyped by a credulous press and overfunded by incautious investors, and, given these wild and wide-eyed expectations, it had underdelivered. The hype was about to die down, and the funding to dry up. The A.I. winter lasted for years.Skeptics of the current robots-are-coming argument predict the arrival of another A.I. winter. “We have not moved a byte forward in understanding human intelligence,” Zia Chishti wrote in the Financial Times last fall. “We have much faster computers, thanks to Moore’s law, but the underlying algorithms are mostly identical to those that powered machines 40 years ago.” That goes back to the time of the Kaypro.A lot has changed in those forty years, not least in the availability of enormous sets of data that artificial intelligences can use to study and learn. Still, the economist Robert J. Gordon is unconvinced that the robots are coming. In his 2016 book, “The Rise and Fall of American Growth,” he argued that a century of economic expansion that began in 1870—driven by human-condition changing developments like electricity, a public water supply, and the interstate-highway system—ended in 1970, and that, since then, inventions have been merely incremental. The telephone was patented in 1876. It changed people’s lives, and contributed to a huge rise in productivity. The cell phone, Gordon argues, just isn’t that different from a telephone. In a 2016 essay, “Why Robots Will Not Decimate Human Jobs,” Gordon points out that the uses to which smartphones get put are “not a part of the market economy that creates jobs and pays wages.” Robots have altered manufacturing, he concedes, but he doesn’t think that they’ve altered the economy, or that they’re about to. “I play a game called ‘find the robot,’ ” he writes. “In my daily strolls in and out of supermarkets, restaurants, doctor and dentist offices, my nearby hospital, offices in my own university, and the vast amount of employment involving elementary and secondary teachers, personal trainers, and old age caretakers, I have yet to find a robot.”Still, even if the hype about robots is mostly unwarranted, the worry about jobs is real. If the latest jobs numbers look good, the longer-term trends look bad, especially for Americans without a high-school diploma, or less, a population whose real wages have been falling for decades. In a downward compression of the labor market, these jobs have been taken not so much by robots as by college graduates: as much as forty per cent of college graduates are currently working at jobs that do not require a college degree, Ellen Ruppel Shell reports, in “The Job: Work and Its Future in a Time of Radical Change” (Currency). Four out of every five children born in the United States in 1950 went on to earn more than their parents. For children born in 1980, that ratio had fallen to one in two. Lately, it’s down to one in three. Estimates range from the cautious to the entirely hysterical, but one reasonable study predicts that, by 2050, one in four working-age American men will be unemployed, having been replaced by some form of automation. Most imminently threatened are the millions of people who work as drivers of cars and trucks, scheduled to be replaced by fleets of self-driving vehicles beginning as early as next year.Economic inequality produces political instability and partisan death matches. Everyone worries about jobs, but people who worry about robots and people who worry about immigrants propose very different solutions. Either way, much writing in this field is, essentially, fantasy. In “The Globotics Upheaval,” Baldwin predicts that the march of the robots will have four stages: transformation, upheaval, backlash, and resolution. The resolution will involve what he calls “shelterism.” Once white-collar workers realize that their jobs are on the line, too, they’ll find ways to protect themselves by “sheltering” certain activities, things that only humans can do. He explains, “This will mean that our work lives will be filled with far more caring, sharing, understanding, creating, empathizing, innovating, and managing people who are actually in the same room. This is a logical inevitability—everything else will be done by globots.” The catch is that, historically, caring, sharing, understanding, and empathizing with people who are in the same room as you has been the work of women, and is therefore either unpaid, and not recognized as work, or paid very badly. Childcare, elementary-school teaching, nursing, geriatric care, and social work will not suddenly become high-paying, high-prestige professions simply because everything else is done by robots. If that were going to happen, it would already be happening, because we already know that these jobs require beings who are human. Instead, something darker is going on, mirrored in the feminizing of robots, from the male robots of the nineteen-sixties and seventies—Hal, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Mr. Robinson’s robot on “Lost in Space”—to the fembots and sexbots of “Her” and “Ex Machina,” and, not least, the sexy and slavish Alexa. Female workers aren’t being paid more for being human; instead, robots are selling better when they’re female.The economist Oren Cass, the author of “The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America” (Encounter), much of which originally appeared in National Review, is fed up with the robot hysteria. “Technological innovation and automation have always been integral to our economic progress, and in a well-functioning labor market, they should produce gains for all types of workers,” he insists. He has no patience with advocates of universal basic income, either. “We have reached a point where the rich think paying everyone else to go away represents compassionate thinking,” he writes.Like Hyman, Cass blames mid-twentieth-century economic thinkers for the current malaise, though he blames different thinkers. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, he argues, economic policymakers abandoned workers and the health of the labor market in favor of a commitment to over-all economic growth, with redistribution as an adjustment and consumerism as its objective. That required quantifying prosperity, hence the G.D.P., a measure that Cass, along with other writers, finds to be disastrous, not least because it values consumers above producers. Cass sees universal basic income as the end-stage scenario of every other redistribution program, whose justification is that the poor will be fine without work as long as they can buy things. Here he mocks the advocates of the current economic arrangement, who are prone to note that the poor are not actually starving, “and so many people have iPhones!”Reporters are suckers for the hype, Cass maintains, pointing out that after a 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that, in the next hundred years, robots might eliminate as many manufacturing jobs as were lost in 2001 (presumably, a tolerable loss), the Times ran a story with the headline “Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs,” while the Washington Post titled its story “We’re So Unprepared for the Robot Apocalypse.” Cass offers a careful criticism of the robots-are-stealing-our-jobs theory. He cites four of its errors. It overestimates twenty-first-century innovations and underestimates the innovations of earlier centuries. It miscalculates the pace of change. It assumes that automation will not create new sectors. (3-D printing might replace a lot of manufacturing workers, but it could also create a lot of new small businesses.) And it fails to appreciate the complexity of many of the jobs it thinks robots can do. The 2013 Oxford study that kept Andrés Oppenheimer up at night Cass finds to be mostly silly. Its authors, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, rated seven hundred and two occupations from least “computerizable” to most. Highly vulnerable are school-bus drivers, and, while a self-driving school bus does not seem technically too far off, Cass points out, few parents can imagine putting their kids on a bus without a grownup to make sure they don’t bash one another the whole way to school.Cass’s own policy proposals center, very reasonably, on the importance of work and family, but he fails to demonstrate how his proposals—lowering environmental regulations and establishing academic tracking in high schools—will achieve his objectives. And though “The Once and Future Worker” offers a rousing call for an honest reckoning with American economic policy, it also indulges in its own sleight of hand. “The story goes that ‘automation’ or the ‘knowledge economy,’ not bad public policy, is to blame,” Cass writes. “Historically, economists and policy makers have led the effort to explain that technological innovation is good for workers throughout the economy, even as its ‘creative destruction’ causes dislocation for some. So why, suddenly, are they so eager to throw robots and programmers under the bus?” One answer might be that, given the current state of American political polarization, it’s either throw the robots under the bus or throw the immigrants. Cass, not surprisingly, advocates restricting immigration.Donald Trump ran for President on a promise to create twenty-five million new jobs during the next decade. “My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before,” he said in September, 2016. Many economists mocked his plan, which included protecting American jobs by imposing tariffs on imports. The Economist announced a new political fault line, not between left and right but between open and closed: “Welcome immigrants or keep them out? Open up to foreign trade or protect domestic industries? Embrace cultural change, or resist it?” Barack Obama was an opener. Openers tend to talk about robots. “The next wave of economic dislocation won’t come from overseas,” Obama said in his farewell address, in January, 2017, days before Trump’s Inauguration. “It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good, middle-class jobs obsolete.”Trump is a closer. Closers tend to talk about immigrants. Trump has tweeted the word “jobs” nearly six hundred times, but not once has he tweeted the words “robot,” “robots,” or “automation.” “We’re going to fight for every last American job,” he promised from the floor of a Boeing plant in South Carolina, weeks after taking office. “I don’t want companies leaving our country,” the new President said. “There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the products, and think that they are going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.” That June, Boeing laid off nearly two hundred employees from the South Carolina plant, as part of a forty-per-cent reduction in its production of 777s. In 2017, the company laid off nearly six thousand workers.Trump’s Administration mocks fears of a robot invasion. Closers usually do. “I’m not worried at all,” Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said two years ago. Nevertheless, some think tankers suggested that Trump’s election was “secretly about automation.” And a study published last summer in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy—whose lead author, Carl Frey, is the same guy who made the list of the seven hundred and two most computerizable jobs—argues that the robot caravan got Trump elected. Measuring the density of robots and comparing them with election returns, Frey and his colleagues found that “electoral districts that became more exposed to automation during the years running up to the election were more likely to vote for Trump.” Indulging in a counterfactual, they suggest that a less steeply rising increase in exposure to robots would have tipped both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin toward voting for Hillary Clinton. According to this line of thinking, Twitter bots and fake Facebook news didn’t elect Donald Trump, but robots really might have. Or maybe it was all the talk about the wall.Heads, the robots are coming! Accept the inevitability of near-universal unemployment! Tails, the Mexicans are coming! Close the borders! So far, the only other choice, aside from helplessly watching the rise of extremism, is to mint a new coin. Heat a forge. Smelt a blank. Engrave two dies. Put your blank in between them. Strike the whole thing with a hammer. Anyone can do it. ♦",annals of technology,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/04/are-robots-competing-for-your-job'}","Probably, but don’t count yourself out, Jill Lepore writes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c6f02d13a3ac62cebaaf5fd/1:1/w_2114,h_2114,c_limit/190304_r33801.jpg",https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/04/are-robots-competing-for-your-job,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Balancing AI’s potential



We can already see the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) in international development: the seemingly endless possibilities to enhance productivity and innovation across healthcare, agriculture, education, transportation, and governance.
Yet it is also becoming abundantly clear that AI could have negative repercussions as well, particularly in countries with weaker institutional capacity and legal protections. AI has the potential to threaten democratic processes, employment, human rights and — because of the weaponization of AI tools — privacy, policing, and defense.
Apart from these potential benefits and threats, the transformative potential of AI for both good and harm will be magnified in the Global South, where existing gender and socio-economic inequalities could either be tempered or exacerbated.



Artificial Intelligence in the Global South



Given the opportunities and potential consequences of new automation and mechanization techniques and advanced analysis through machine learning and neural networks, IDRC is investing in applied research across a number of domains to advance the public good with the use of artificial intelligence for development (AI4D).
These activities aim to:

Improve policy and regulation to promote inclusive and human rights-based AI
	Responsive institutions and good governance have a crucial role to play in mitigating the potential harms of AI, such as job losses, while ensuring that AI systems deliver innovation and impact.
Spur AI applications for public interest
	Research and innovation networks will foster collaborative and cross-disciplinary spaces for experts to design context-specific AI solutions across a broad range of sectors.
Foster AI infrastructure and skills in the Global South
	It is crucial to support building blocks for the successful dissemination of AI, such as releasing public and private sector data, capacity building, and supporting ethical and fair systems that support the public good.




What does AI4D look like in practice?



IDRC-supported research is ensuring that the benefits of AI are used to advance development, reduce social inequality, and foster greater gender parity.
These activities aim to:



Provide a comprehensive overview of AI’s potential and benefits for the developing world

A recent mapping of AI talents, actors, and knowledge hot spots in the Global South illustrates the extent to which universities, start-ups, and other stakeholders already engage with AI across Africa.
Through a series of consultations and workshops, IDRC is working with partners to build networks of AI researchers and innovators in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. A critical focus of these consultations is how AI can contribute to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. In turn, these consultations will form the basis of networks of excellence to advance and implement the AI4D program.

But for the many content moderators working for Google and YouTube, the job is traumatic. And even the best workplace conditions don’t make up for the fact that many moderators suffer long term psychological consequences of doing this job. The Verge traveled to Washington, DC and Austin, TX to speak to a former full time google moderator and to current YouTube contract moderators to see how their experiences compare. 

Following his investigations on Facebook, The Verge’s Casey Newton reports on the working conditions and side effects of scrubbing the internet of “violent extremism” content at Google and YouTube. You can read the full exclusive here: http://bit.ly/2PqraAV

It’s a promise we’ve heard many times before, particularly from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but experts say the technology is just not there — and, in fact, may never be. 

Most social networks keep unwanted content off their platforms using a combination of automated filtering and human moderators. As The Verge revealed in a recent investigation, human moderators often work in highly stressful conditions. Employees have to click through hundreds of items of flagged content every day — everything from murder to sexual abuse — and then decide whether or not it violates a platform’s rules, often working on tightly-controlled schedules and without adequate training or support. 

When presented with the misery their platforms are creating (as well as other moderation-adjacent problems, like perceived bias) companies often say more technology is the solution. During his hearings in front of congress last year, for example, Zuckerberg cited artificial intelligence more than 30 times as the answer to this and other issues. 

“AI is Zuckerberg’s MacGuffin,” James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Tech, told The Washington Post at the time. “It won’t solve Facebook’s problems, but it will solve Zuckerberg’s: getting someone else to take responsibility.”

So what is AI doing for Facebook and other platforms right now, and why can’t it do more? 

The problem of automating human culture

Right now, automated systems using AI and machine learning are certainly doing quite a bit to help with moderation. They act as triage systems, for example, pushing suspect content to human moderators, and are able to weed out some unwanted stuff on their own. 

But the way they do so is relatively simple. Either by using visual recognition to identify a broad category of content (like “human nudity” or “guns”), which is prone to mistakes; or by matching content to an index of banned items, which requires humans to create said index in the first place. 

The latter approach is used to get rid of the most obvious infringing material; things like propaganda videos from terrorist organizations, child abuse material, and copyrighted content. In each case, content is identified by humans and “hashed,” meaning it’s turned into a unique string of numbers that’s quicker to process. The technology is broadly reliable, but it can still lead to problems. YouTube’s ContentID system, for example, has flagged uploads like white noise and bird song as copyright infringement in the past. 

[Image: AI systems are being trained to parse new sorts of images, like memes. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EzVAHsboiM2IipmlKXSeHlHOps=/0x0:2000x1125/2000x1125/filters:focal(1000x563:1001x564)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12895655/CodeBlog_penguinG5.png]

Things become much trickier when the content itself can’t be easily classified even by humans. This can include content that algorithms certainly recognize, but that has many shades of meaning (like nudity — does breast-feeding count?) or that are very context-dependent, like harassment, fake news, misinformation, and so on. None of these categories have simple definitions, and for each of them there are edge-cases with no objective status, examples where someone’s background, personal ethos, or simply their mood on any given day might make the difference between one definition and another. 

""We’re asking AI to understand the complexities of human culture""

The problem with trying to get machines to understand this sort of content, says Robyn Caplan, an affiliate researcher at the nonprofit Data & Society, is that it is essentially asking them to understand human culture — a phenomenon too fluid and subtle to be described in simple, machine-readable rules. 

“[This content] tends to involve context that is specific to the speaker,” Caplan tells The Verge. “That means things like power dynamics, race relations, political dynamics, economic dynamics.” Since these platforms operate globally, varying cultural norms need to be taken into account too, she says, as well as different legal regimes. 

One way to know whether content will be difficult to classify, says Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, is to ask whether or not understanding it requires “extrinsic information” — that is, information outside the image, video, audio, or text. 

“For example, filters are not good at figuring out hate speech, parody, or news reporting of controversial events because so much of the determination depends on cultural context and other extrinsic information,” Goldman tells The Verge. “Similarly, filters aren’t good at determining when a content republication is fair use under US copyright law because the determination depends on extrinsic information such as market dynamics, the original source material, and the uploader’s other activities.”

How far can we push AI systems? 

But AI as a field is moving very swiftly. So will future algorithms be able to reliably classify this sort of content in the future? Goldman and Caplan are skeptical.

AI will get better at understanding context, says Goldman, but it’s not evident that AI will soon be able to do so better than a human. “AI will not replace [...] human reviewers for the foreseeable future,” he says.

Caplan agrees, and points out that as long as humans argue about how to classify this sort of material, what chance do machines have? “There is just no easy solution,” she says. ”We’re going to keep seeing problems.”

It’s worth noting, though, that AI isn’t completely hopeless. Advances in deep learning recently have greatly increased the speed and competency with which computers classify information in images, video, and text. Arun Gandhi, who works for NanoNets, a company that sells AI moderation tools to online businesses, says this shouldn’t be discounted. 

“A lot of the focus is on how traumatic or disturbing the job of content moderator is, which is absolutely fair,” Gandhi tells The Verge. “But it also takes away the fact that we are making progress with some of these problems.”

""Progress has been made, but it’s not clear how far it can go""

Machine learning systems need a large number of examples to learn what offending content looks like, explains Gandhi, which means those systems will improve in years to come as training datasets get bigger. He notes that some of the systems currently in place would look impossibly fast and accurate even a few years ago. “I’m confident, given the improvements we’ve made in the last five, six years, that at some point we’ll be able to completely automate moderation,” says Gandhi. 

Others would disagree, though, noting that AI systems have yet to master not only political and cultural context (which is changing month to month, as well as country to country) but also basic human concepts like sarcasm and irony. Throw in the various ways in which AI systems can be fooled by simple hacks, and a complete AI solution looks unlikely.

Sandra Wachter, a lawyer and research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, says there are also legal reasons why humans will need to be kept in the loop for content moderation.

“In Europe we have a data protection framework [GDPR] that allows people to contest certain decisions made by algorithms. It also says transparency in decision making is important [and] that you have a right to know what’s happening to your data,” Wachter tells The Verge. But algorithms can’t explain why they make certain decisions, she says, which makes these systems opaque and could lead to tech companies getting sued.

Wachter says that complaints relating to GDPR have already been lodged, and that more cases are likely to follow. “When there are higher rights at stake, like the right to privacy and to freedom of speech, [...] it’s important that we have some sort of recourse,” she says. “When you have to make a judgement call that impacts other people’s freedom you have to have a human in the loop that can scrutinize the algorithm and explain these things.”

“A challenge no other media system has ever had to face.”

As Caplan notes, what tech companies can do — with their huge profit margins and duty of care to those they employee — is improve working conditions for human moderators. “At the very bare minimum we need to have better labor standards,” she says. As Casey Newton noted in his report, while companies like Facebook do make some effort to properly reward human moderators, giving them health benefits and above-average wages, it’s often outweighed by relentless drive to better accuracy and more decisions. 

Caplan says that pressure on tech companies to solve the problem of content automation could also be contributing to this state of affairs. “That’s when you get issues where workers are held to impossible standards of accuracy,” she says. The need to come up with a fix as soon as possible plays into Silicon Valley’s often-maligned “move fast and break things” attitude. And while this can be a great way to think when launching an app, it’s a terrible mindset for a company managing the subtleties of global speech.

“And we’re saying now maybe we should use machines to deal with this problem,” says Caplan, “but that will lead to a whole new set of issues.” 

It’s also worth remembering that this is a new and unique problem. Never before have platforms as huge and information-dense as Facebook and YouTube existed. These are places where anyone, anywhere in the world, any time, can upload and share whatever content they like. Managing this vast and ever-changing semi-public realm is “a challenge no other media system has ever had to face,” says Caplan. 

What we do know is that the status quo is not working. The humans tasked with cleaning up the internet’s mess are miserable, and the humans creating that mess aren’t much better off. Artificial intelligence doesn’t have enough smarts to deal with the problem, and human intelligence is stretched coming up with solutions. Something’s gotta give.

Feb 27, 2019, 12:41 PM ESTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeNo matter what companies say, AI is not going to solve the problem of content moderation online. It’s a promise we’ve heard many times before, particularly from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but experts say the technology is just not there — and, in fact, may never be. Most social networks keep unwanted content off their platforms using a combination of automated filtering and human moderators. As The Verge revealed in a recent investigation, human moderators often work in highly stressful conditions. Employees have to click through hundreds of items of flagged content every day — everything from murder to sexual abuse — and then decide whether or not it violates a platform’s rules, often working on tightly-controlled schedules and without adequate training or support. When presented with the misery their platforms are creating (as well as other moderation-adjacent problems, like perceived bias) companies often say more technology is the solution. During his hearings in front of congress last year, for example, Zuckerberg cited artificial intelligence more than 30 times as the answer to this and other issues. “AI is Zuckerberg’s MacGuffin,” James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Tech, told The Washington Post at the time. “It won’t solve Facebook’s problems, but it will solve Zuckerberg’s: getting someone else to take responsibility.”So what is AI doing for Facebook and other platforms right now, and why can’t it do more? The problem of automating human cultureRight now, automated systems using AI and machine learning are certainly doing quite a bit to help with moderation. They act as triage systems, for example, pushing suspect content to human moderators, and are able to weed out some unwanted stuff on their own. But the way they do so is relatively simple. Either by using visual recognition to identify a broad category of content (like “human nudity” or “guns”), which is prone to mistakes; or by matching content to an index of banned items, which requires humans to create said index in the first place. The latter approach is used to get rid of the most obvious infringing material; things like propaganda videos from terrorist organizations, child abuse material, and copyrighted content. In each case, content is identified by humans and “hashed,” meaning it’s turned into a unique string of numbers that’s quicker to process. The technology is broadly reliable, but it can still lead to problems. YouTube’s ContentID system, for example, has flagged uploads like white noise and bird song as copyright infringement in the past. AI systems are being trained to parse new sorts of images, like memes.  Image: FacebookThings become much trickier when the content itself can’t be easily classified even by humans. This can include content that algorithms certainly recognize, but that has many shades of meaning (like nudity — does breast-feeding count?) or that are very context-dependent, like harassment, fake news, misinformation, and so on. None of these categories have simple definitions, and for each of them there are edge-cases with no objective status, examples where someone’s background, personal ethos, or simply their mood on any given day might make the difference between one definition and another. We’re asking AI to understand the complexities of human cultureThe problem with trying to get machines to understand this sort of content, says Robyn Caplan, an affiliate researcher at the nonprofit Data & Society, is that it is essentially asking them to understand human culture — a phenomenon too fluid and subtle to be described in simple, machine-readable rules. “[This content] tends to involve context that is specific to the speaker,” Caplan tells The Verge. “That means things like power dynamics, race relations, political dynamics, economic dynamics.” Since these platforms operate globally, varying cultural norms need to be taken into account too, she says, as well as different legal regimes. One way to know whether content will be difficult to classify, says Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, is to ask whether or not understanding it requires “extrinsic information” — that is, information outside the image, video, audio, or text. “For example, filters are not good at figuring out hate speech, parody, or news reporting of controversial events because so much of the determination depends on cultural context and other extrinsic information,” Goldman tells The Verge. “Similarly, filters aren’t good at determining when a content republication is fair use under US copyright law because the determination depends on extrinsic information such as market dynamics, the original source material, and the uploader’s other activities.”How far can we push AI systems? But AI as a field is moving very swiftly. So will future algorithms be able to reliably classify this sort of content in the future? Goldman and Caplan are skeptical.AI will get better at understanding context, says Goldman, but it’s not evident that AI will soon be able to do so better than a human. “AI will not replace [...] human reviewers for the foreseeable future,” he says.Caplan agrees, and points out that as long as humans argue about how to classify this sort of material, what chance do machines have? “There is just no easy solution,” she says. ”We’re going to keep seeing problems.”It’s worth noting, though, that AI isn’t completely hopeless. Advances in deep learning recently have greatly increased the speed and competency with which computers classify information in images, video, and text. Arun Gandhi, who works for NanoNets, a company that sells AI moderation tools to online businesses, says this shouldn’t be discounted. “A lot of the focus is on how traumatic or disturbing the job of content moderator is, which is absolutely fair,” Gandhi tells The Verge. “But it also takes away the fact that we are making progress with some of these problems.”Progress has been made, but it’s not clear how far it can goMachine learning systems need a large number of examples to learn what offending content looks like, explains Gandhi, which means those systems will improve in years to come as training datasets get bigger. He notes that some of the systems currently in place would look impossibly fast and accurate even a few years ago. “I’m confident, given the improvements we’ve made in the last five, six years, that at some point we’ll be able to completely automate moderation,” says Gandhi. Others would disagree, though, noting that AI systems have yet to master not only political and cultural context (which is changing month to month, as well as country to country) but also basic human concepts like sarcasm and irony. Throw in the various ways in which AI systems can be fooled by simple hacks, and a complete AI solution looks unlikely.Sandra Wachter, a lawyer and research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, says there are also legal reasons why humans will need to be kept in the loop for content moderation.“In Europe we have a data protection framework [GDPR] that allows people to contest certain decisions made by algorithms. It also says transparency in decision making is important [and] that you have a right to know what’s happening to your data,” Wachter tells The Verge. But algorithms can’t explain why they make certain decisions, she says, which makes these systems opaque and could lead to tech companies getting sued.RelatedThe secret lives of Facebook moderators in AmericaWachter says that complaints relating to GDPR have already been lodged, and that more cases are likely to follow. “When there are higher rights at stake, like the right to privacy and to freedom of speech, [...] it’s important that we have some sort of recourse,” she says. “When you have to make a judgement call that impacts other people’s freedom you have to have a human in the loop that can scrutinize the algorithm and explain these things.”“A challenge no other media system has ever had to face.”As Caplan notes, what tech companies can do — with their huge profit margins and duty of care to those they employee — is improve working conditions for human moderators. “At the very bare minimum we need to have better labor standards,” she says.

Humans have a tenuous relationship with automation. On balance, we love it. It has made our lives easier. Freed up time for leisure. Freed up time for thinking … about more automation. Progressively, we have made automation cleverer. First, we armed it with simple decision trees, then with supervised reasoning, until we arrived at self-learning mathematical algorithms.

Introduction

This is an age of artificial intelligence (AI) driven automation and autonomous machines. The increasing ubiquity and rapidly expanding the potential of self-improving, self-replicating, autonomous intelligent machines has spurred massive automation driven transformation of human ecosystems in cyberspace, geospace and space (CGS). As seen across nations, there is already a growing trend towards increasingly entrusting complex decision processes to these rapidly evolving AI systems. From granting parole to diagnosing diseases, college admissions to job interviews, managing trades to granting credits, autonomous vehicles to autonomous weapons, the rapidly evolving AI systems are increasingly being adopted by individuals and entities across nations: its government, industries, organizations, and academia (NGIOA).

Individually and collectively, the promise and perils of these evolving AI systems are raising serious concerns for the accuracy, fairness, transparency, trust, ethics, privacy and security of the future of humanity -- prompting calls for regulation of artificial intelligence design, development, and deployment.
While the fear of any disruptive technology, technological transformation, and its associated changes giving rise to calls for the governments to regulate new technologies in a responsible manner are nothing new, regulating a technology like artificial intelligence is an entirely different kind of challenge. This is because while AI can be transparent, transformative, democratized,  and easily distributed, it also touches every sector of the global economy and can even put the security of the entire future of humanity at risk. There is no doubt that artificial intelligence has the potential to be misused or that it can behave in unpredictable and harmful ways towards humanity—so much so that the entire human civilization could be at risk.
PROMOTED
While there has been some -- much-needed -- focus on the role of ethics, privacy and morals in this debate, security, which is equally significant, is often completely ignored. That brings us to an important question: Are ethics and privacy guidelines enough to regulate AI? We need to not only make AI transparent, accountable and fair, but we need to also create a focus on its security risks.

Security Risks
As seen across nations, security risks are largely ignored in the AI regulation debate. It needs to be understood that any AI system: be it a robot, a program running on a single computer, a program running on networked computers, or any other set of components that hosts an AI, carries with it security risks.
So, what are these security risks and vulnerabilities? It starts with the initial design and development. If the initial design and development allow or encourages the AI to alter its objectives based on its exposure and learning, those alterations will likely occur in accordance with the dictates of the initial design. Now, the AI will one day become self-improving and will also start changing its own code, and, at some point, it may change the hardware as well and could self-replicate. So, when we evaluate all these possible scenarios, at some point, humans will likely lose control of the code or any instructions that were embedded in the code. That brings us to an important question: How will we regulate AI when humans will likely lose control of its development and deployment cycle?

As we evaluate the security risks originating from disruptive and dangerous technology over the years, each technology required substantial infrastructure investments. That made the regulatory process fairly simple and easy: just follow the large amounts of investments to know who is building what. However, the information age and technologies like artificial intelligence have fundamentally shaken the foundation of regulatory principles and control. This is mainly because determining the who, where and what of artificial intelligence security risks is impossible because anyone from anywhere with a reasonably current personal computer (or even a smartphone or any smart device) and an internet connection can now contribute to the development of artificial intelligence projects/initiatives. Moreover, the same security vulnerabilities of cyberspace also translate to any AI system as both the software and hardware are vulnerable to security breaches.
Moreover, the sheer number of individuals and entities across nations that may participate in the design, development, and deployment of any AI system’s components will make it difficult to identify the responsibility and accountability of the entire system if anything goes wrong.
Now, with many of the artificial intelligence development projects going open source and with the rise in the number of open-source machine learning libraries, anyone from anywhere can make any modification to such libraries or to the code—and there is just no way to know who made those changes and what would be its security impact in a timely manner. So, the question is when individuals and entities participating in any AI collaborative project from anywhere in the world, how can security risks be identified and proactively managed from a regulatory perspective? 
There is also a common belief that in order to develop AI systems that have the power to cause existential threats to humanity, it would require greater computational power and will be easy to track. However, with the rise in the development of neuromorphic chips, computational power is soon going to be a non-issue—taking away this tracking capability of large use of computing power.
There is also another issue of who is evaluating security risks? Because irrespective of the stage of design, development or deployment of artificial intelligence, do the researchers/designers/developers have the necessary expertise to make broad security risk assessments? That brings us to an important question: What kind of expertise is required to evaluate the security risks of algorithms or any AI systems? Would someone qualify to evaluate these security risks purely based on their background in computer science, cyber-security, or hardware—or we need someone with an entirely different kind of skill set?
Acknowledging this emerging reality, Risk Group initiated the much-needed discussion on Regulating Artificial Intelligence with Dr. Subhajit Basu on Risk Roundup.

Risk Group discusses Regulating Artificial Intelligence with Dr. Subhajit Basu, an Associate Professor in Information Technology Law (Cyberlaw), Chair: BILETA, Editor: IRLCT, School of Law, the University of Leeds based in the UK.
Complex Challenges in Regulating Artificial Intelligence
Even if we agree on what intelligence is, what artificial intelligence is, or what consciousness is, it seems that from a regulatory standpoint, some of the most problematic features of regulating AI are:

Lack of nomenclature and identity for algorithms
The security risks emerging from the AI code itself
The nature of the self-improvement of the software and hardware
And the interconnected and integrated security risks emerging due to the democratization and decentralization of AI research and development (R&D)

So, to begin with, how can we come up with an identity and nomenclature system for algorithms? How can nations effectively regulate the democratized development of AI? Moreover, how can nations effectively regulate AI development when the development work can be globally distributed, and nations cannot agree on the global standards for regulation?
This is very important because the individuals working on any single component of an AI system might be located in different nations. Moreover, most of the AI development is happening in private entities, and the entire cycle of those AI development systems are proprietary property and kept secret.
Evaluating the Regulatory Frameworks
Regulatory frameworks are traditionally made possible by legal scholarship. It seems that the traditional methods of regulation — such as research and development oversight and product licensing -- seem particularly unsuitable to manage the security risks associated with artificial intelligence and intelligent autonomous machines.
As seen across nations, there are many AI guidelines emerging. There is also a framework proposal emerging for AI regulation that is based on differential tort liability. And, the centerpiece of the proposed regulatory framework seems to be an AI certification process, along with a proposal for manufacturers and operators of AI systems to get certified (where certified AI systems will be able to enjoy limited tort liability while those of uncertified AI systems would face strict liability). It is important to evaluate this proposed regulatory approach of legal liability from a security perspective. If an AI system harms a person, who will be held liable?
Traditionally for most technologies, liability falls on the manufacturer, but with AI development, how will it be known who has designed the algorithm? It could be anyone from any part of the world. And as we see algorithms have no name or identity. Moreover, when intelligent machines become autonomous, it will further make it much more complex for all the stakeholders to be able to foresee emerging security risks proactively. That brings us to an important question: under all these complex scenarios, will the tort liability focus for regulating artificial intelligence ever work?
Tort-based liability systems will be of no use when, for example, any autonomous system decides that humans are now enemies. Whether systems are certified or not, it will make no difference in whether we are managing the security risks emerging from them in a timely manner. When the future of humanity is at risk, what difference will it make in whether there is a way to get compensation for humans. And who will give compensation, autonomous systems? Machines?
What Next?
Perhaps, it is time to begin a discussion on why the security risks emerging from technologies like artificial intelligence need to be at the heart of any regulation or governance framework that is being defined and developed. Because, unless we identify the security risks and understand their origin, it is next to impossible to regulate technologies like AI in a proactive and responsible manner.
Does this mean we are doomed, and nothing can be done? Of course not! Let us put our collective intelligence to begin a broader conversation across nations on how to proactively identify the security risks emerging from artificial intelligence systems and how to regulate them effectively for the future of humanity. Because while we may not know everything, each one of us knows something, and together we can come up with an effective way to regulate AI. Time is now to give identity to each algorithm emerging from across nations! Time is now to define a security risk governance framework for artificial intelligence!

Thousands of years before machine learning and self-driving cars became reality, the tales of giant bronze robot Talos, artificial woman Pandora and their creator god, Hephaestus, filled the imaginations of people in ancient Greece.

Historians usually trace the idea of automata to the Middle Ages, when the first self-moving devices were invented, but the concept of artificial, lifelike creatures dates to the myths and legends from at least about 2,700 years ago, said Adrienne Mayor, a research scholar in the Department of Classics in the School of Humanities and Sciences. These ancient myths are the subject of Mayor’s latest book, Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology.“Our ability to imagine artificial intelligence goes back to the ancient times,” said Mayor, who is also a 2018-19 fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford. “Long before technological advances made self-moving devices possible, ideas about creating artificial life and robots were explored in ancient myths.”Mayor, a historian of science, said that the earliest themes of artificial intelligence, robots and self-moving objects appear in the work of ancient Greek poets Hesiod and Homer, who were alive somewhere between 750 and 650 B.C.The story of Talos, first mentioned around 700 B.C. by Hesiod, offers one of the earliest conceptions of a robot, Mayor said.The myth describes Talos as a giant bronze man built by Hephaestus, the Greek god of invention and blacksmithing. Talos was commissioned by Zeus, the king of Greek gods, to protect the island of Crete from invaders. He marched around the island three times every day and hurled boulders at approaching enemy ships.

At his core, the giant had a tube running from his head to one of his feet that carried a mysterious life source of the gods the Greeks called ichor. Another ancient text, Argonautica, which dates to the third century B.C., describes how sorceress Medea defeated Talos by removing a bolt at his ankle and letting the ichor fluid flow out, Mayor said.The myth of Pandora, first described in Hesiod’s Theogony, is another example of a mythical artificial being, Mayor said. Although much later versions of the story portray Pandora as an innocent woman who unknowingly opened a box of evil, Mayor said Hesiod’s original described Pandora as an artificial, evil woman built by Hephaestus and sent to Earth on the orders of Zeus to punish humans for discovering fire.“It could be argued that Pandora was a kind of AI agent,” Mayor said. “Her only mission was to infiltrate the human world and release her jar of miseries.”In addition to creating Talos and Pandora, mythical Hephaestus made other self-moving objects, including a set of automated servants, who looked like women but were made of gold, Mayor said. According to Homer’s recounting of the myth, Hephaestus gave these artificial women the gods’ knowledge. Mayor argues that they could be considered an ancient mythical version of artificial intelligence.The ancient myths that Mayor examined in her research grapple with the moral implications of Hephaestus’ creations.“Not one of those myths has a good ending once the artificial beings are sent to Earth,” Mayor said. “It’s almost as if the myths say that it’s great to have these artificial things up in heaven used by the gods. But once they interact with humans, we get chaos and destruction.”Mayor said the myths underscore humanity’s fascination with creating artificial life.“People have an impulse to imagine things that aren’t possible yet,” Mayor said. “There is a timeless link between imagination and science.”

REHOVOT, Israel — For years, Israeli scientist Tamar Flash has been fascinated with the octopus, and the unusual way the invertebrate’s eight arms propel it effortlessly through the water.
Her interest is no mere hobby. A renowned professor who does research in artificial intelligence at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Flash is using the octopus as a model for methods of diagnosis and treatment of disorders from Parkinson’s disease to autism.
“My major interest is the brain’s representation of movement, or the principles underlying the organization, control and perception of movement by humans,” Flash said. “The octopus has no bones. It’s totally soft. It’s just made of muscles.”
Modeling the movement of the octopus, she said, also may help scientists develop “soft” robots for rehabilitation clinics, search-and-rescue operations and even nursing homes.


“The first generation of robots were made of steel,” Flash said. “But if we want robots to help handicapped people, we had better make them from soft materials that can come in contact with humans without injuring them.”
Flash works at the Weizmann Institute’s new Artificial Intelligence Center for Scientific Exploration, a $100 million initiative. Hers is one of several projects at the center that seek to apply AI principles to real-life problems.
One of the world’s foremost multidisciplinary research institutions, Weizmann is investing heavily in the burgeoning field of AI. Its expertise in computer vision, machine learning and robotics — as well as a culture that encourages collaborations across disciplines — makes AI a natural fit.
More than half a dozen scientists from across the institute do AI-related research at the new center, which was launched about a year ago. The center’s director is Shimon Ullman, a world leader in computer vision who was awarded the 2015 Israel Prize in mathematics and computer science research.

“The techniques coming out of AI — and, more broadly, machine learning — are becoming important in almost all disciplines,” Ullman said. “They can really help scientists deal with huge sets of data in chemistry, in physics and in biology. This will also be very helpful for Israel’s high-tech industry.”
Shai Bagon, an expert in video and image processing, is one of two Robin Chemers Neustein Artificial Intelligence Fellows recruited to work at the center.
“Each one of us has a different perspective,” Bagon said of his fellow researchers. “Some are more theoretical in their inclination, others are more practical. We want to see if by establishing this center we can somehow enable collaborations in fundamental research that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”
While it’s not yet clear where the work will lead, Bagon said, his team’s mission is to conduct basic research on AI and machine learning.
“We are not told what to investigate,” he said. “Rather it’s all driven by the curiosity and ingenuity of the researchers themselves.”
The Weizmann Institute’s focus on curiosity-driven research rather than on profit or commercial success grants its scientists an unusual level of freedom to pursue their own ideas and investigations.
For example, Flash has been working in the field of human locomotion and robotics since the early 1980s. She studied at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and has a doctorate in medical physics. Over the years, Flash’s work has been funded by the U.S. Navy and the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and more recently by the European Union.
“We need a basic understanding of what it means to have intelligence,” she said. “There’s a lot of hype now about artificial intelligence, but if we want to bring the AI revolution to the real world, we need robotics. When we move, to us it seems so simple. But it’s not simple at all.”
To help Flash and her colleagues, the center employs powerful Nvidia DGX-1 computers and servers that can crunch numbers in hours rather than weeks or months. However, maintaining and upgrading the equipment is costly, according to Bagon.
The center’s establishment is meant to help Israel become a world leader in underexplored areas of AI. Funding is a challenge, especially given that government agencies and multinationals in the United States, Europe and China invest billions of dollars annually in AI efforts. For this reason, philanthropic support for the center is a major priority for the Weizmann Institute, as well as the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute, which raises funds in the United States for the institute.
“It’s true we can’t compete with China’s budget, or the resources Google has. But we can make some fundamental, deep insight into this subject,” Bagon said. “Whereas companies like Facebook and Google are very much driven by business, we have the luxury of asking questions that other people don’t have the patience or the attention span to ask. We don’t even know these questions yet — let alone the answers to them.”
Prominent mathematician Boaz Nadler is also part of the team at the new AI center. His current research focuses on large data sets and their theoretical and practical applications — specifically how to find outliers and remove “noise” when fusing information from varying sources.
“Crowdsourcing is when you give a series of tasks to many different people and they all give you their answers,” he said. “You don’t know how accurate or inaccurate they are, yet you’d like to combine them and get an answer that’s even more accurate.”
Dramatically increased computing power is driving the AI revolution, much the same way the early 20th century saw a revolution in physics and the 1950s was defined by the computer revolution, Nadler said.
“Israel is known as the ‘Startup Nation,’ and many new startups today are based on machine learning and AI,” Nadler said. “This institute would like to put Weizmann at the forefront of academic research, but it will also help to train people who would then have the skills to go into industry. This is key for the continued success of Israeli companies.”

Researchers, companies and countries around the world are racing to explore – and exploit – the possibilities of artificial intelligence technology. China is working on an extremely aggressive multi-billion-dollar plan for government investment into AI research and applications. The U.S. government has been slower to act. 
The Obama administration issued a report on AI near the end of its term. Since then, little has happened – until a Feb. 11 executive order from President Donald Trump encouraging the country to do more with AI.
The executive order has several parts, including directing federal agencies to invest in AI and train workers “in AI-relevant skills,” making federal data and computing resources available to AI researchers and telling the National Institute of Standards and Technology to create standards for AI systems that are reliable and work well together. These are all good ideas, but they lack funding and bureaucratic structure. So after researching how large organizations use AI for the past five years, in my view the executive order alone is not likely to transform the American approach to AI. 
Government spending
China is doing far more than talking about AI. In 2017, the country’s national government announced it wanted to make the country and its industries world leaders in AI technologies by 2030. The government’s latest venture capital fund is expected to invest more than US$30 billion in AI and related technologies within state-owned firms, and that fund joins even larger state-funded VC funds.
One Chinese state alone has said it will devote $5 billion to developing AI technologies and businesses. The city of Beijing has committed $2 billion to developing an AI-focused industrial park. A major port, Tianjin, plans to invest $16 billion in its local AI industry.

These government programs will support ambitious major projects, startups and academic research in AI. The national effort also includes using AI in China’s defense and intelligence industries; the country’s leaders are not reluctant to use AI for social and political control. For example, both AI-driven facial recognition, even to catch jaywalkers, and “social credit” – an AI-driven credit score that factors in social behaviors – are already in use.
U.S. investment plans, mostly in the defense industry, are dwarfed by the Chinese effort. DARPA, the Defense Department’s research arm, has sponsored AI research and competitions for many years, and has a $2 billion fund called “AI Next” to help develop the next wave of AI technologies in universities and companies. It’s not yet clear how much real progress its efforts have made. 
Private sector contributions
The U.S. has a strong private sector effort in this technology. There are, for instance, many more AI firms in the U.S. than in China. 
American investment appears strong, too. In 2015, for example, the combined research and development spending at the U.S.-headquartered companies Google, Apple, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon was $54 billion. Much of that spending went toward AI research, but some of the work actually happened in China and elsewhere outside the U.S. That work has been used to personalize ads, improve search results, recognize and label faces and generally make products smarter.
In China, the private sector is much more closely tied to government plans than in the U.S. The Chinese government has asked four large AI-oriented firms in China – Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba and iFlytek – to develop AI hardware and software systems to handle autonomous driving and language processing, so other companies could build on those skills.
China may have also surpassed the American historic advantage in venture capital investments. In 2018, U.S. AI startups received $9.3 billion in venture funding – a record amount, but the number of deals was down from 2017. However, one report from China suggests that in the first half of 2018, Chinese venture investments – many of which involved AI – were higher than in the U.S. Data from 2017 suggest that Chinese AI firms received more venture funding than U.S. companies, although the American funding went to many more firms.

Beyond investment money
There are other factors than investment that determine a country’s long-term competitiveness on AI. Talent is an important one. The U.S. had an historical edge in this regard, with strong technical universities, many technology sector employers and relatively open immigration policies. 
A recent analysis of LinkedIn data suggests that the U.S. has far more AI engineers than China does. But China is closing the gap rapidly, with a variety of education and training programs beginning as early as elementary school. The Trump administration’s restrictions on immigration are encouraging some of the world’s best AI researchers to stay home, rather than come to the U.S.
Another element in long-term AI success is how particular regions build mutually reinforcing communities of companies, university ecosystems and government agencies. Silicon Valley is the world leader in this regard, and China doesn’t have anything to match it yet. Both the U.S. and China could learn from efforts in Canada, such as the work by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, which has offered companies access to facilities, venture capital and university research partnerships to accelerate AI development in that city.

A final key element in AI progress is data: The more data a country’s companies have, the better able they are to develop capable AI systems. Chinese online firms have massive amounts of consumer data on which to train machine learning algorithms. Because of its very large number of inhabitants, the population’s heavy use of digital services and its lax regulatory environment, China clearly beats the U.S. on data.
I still think the U.S. has the edge over China in AI capabilities at the moment. However, as much as I would like the U.S. to win this race over the long run, if I were a betting man I would bet on China. As I describe in my new book “The AI Advantage,” China is executing its strategy for AI, and the U.S. is still wrestling to create one. China is also reaping the benefits of having a determined government, an inexhaustible pot of money, a growing cadre of smart researchers and a large, digital-hungry population. 
Perhaps if the leadership of the U.S. government devoted as much attention and investment to AI as it does to its other strong priorities, the U.S. could maintain its lead in the field. That seems unlikely over the next couple of years, however.

Live00:0006:4206:42 We apologize, this video has expired.Alexis Ohanian talks about his push for paid paternity leave06:43In an interview, Ohanian spoke about what it’s like to be a father and why he decided to become a brand partner and spokesperson for Unilever-owned Dove Men+Care to bring attention to parental leave. Ohanian also touched on why it might be hard to discern the truth on the internet in times to come, why “hustle porn” is wrong, and why rest is critical to good performance. This interview has been edited for brevity.Q: Why are you supporting paid paternity leave?A: I’ve been a proud taker of parental leave, and at the time I really just wanted to get the word out as a means of encouraging other men to take advantage. Very few men have access to paid leave policy in this country.Dove has built a brand around supporting dads. So when they said they wanted to support paid parental leave in particular, I got excited. They, to their credit, have launched a $1 million commitment for dads to take their time off during this important time.Q: Did you take off?A: We had 16 weeks at [Reddit], and as the founder I wanted to set the bar by taking full advantage of it, and I’m back to work. This is a life-changing event, and what more employers are realizing is that their people are not going to perform at their best unless they know the home front is secure and taken care of, and that’s what this offers. Tech is one industry. It is overall pretty advanced on the leave policy and still not enough is done. For so many Americans, there isn’t even an opportunity for paid leave, so this is all a step in the right direction.We can start to turn the tide and actually get a real win here. This country needs something with bipartisan support to rally around, and so far whether it’s the president’s State of the Union, Ivanka Trump has spoken out about it, and a number of Democratic and Republican senators and representatives have talked about this being an issue they want to solve.Q: You talked about “Hustle Porn” and working very hard in tech culture. Can you talk about the feedback you’ve got on it?A: I have had a really resounding response from people who have appreciated the fact that this is a really unhealthy farce. It goes without saying if you want to be an entrepreneur, if you want to be successful at your career, you have to work hard. The problem is — and I dubbed it “hustle porn” — the problem is when people misconstrue the act of flexing on social or showing off on social as a kind of work. Bragging about self destructive behavior over the long term is stupid. Worse that, it’s dangerous.RecommendedNewsNewsABC's George Stephanopoulos appears to say of Biden: 'I don't think he can serve four more years'ConsumerConsumerParamount merger sparks concern among movie theater ownersBeing a high performer in whatever career you have requires a tremendous amount of physical and mental stress at work, and every human has a breaking point. You look at the people who are succeeding in our society, I would argue it is sport. What you’ll find is every single one of them has an important value placed on rest, has an important value placed on taking time away, because that recovery time is as important or more important than the actual work you are putting in.I feel like there’s a ripple effect now, because it is dangerous when so many people are sacrificing themselves, physically and mentally, to the point where it is not just hurting them, it is also hurting their businesses. The dialogue around it is changing. People are seeing everything now from therapy to executive coaching become less stigmatized and, more importantly, embraced. We backed a company, Torch, that is building a software solution for executive coaching within companies and making it as easy as possible to get access to, and it continues to change the discussion.Q: Misinformation on the internet is a big topic right now. Do you have thoughts on what the tech companies are doing to combat it?A: Right now, we have a really important opportunity for media literacy, for education, that still isn’t part of any curriculum. We are at a point in the next few years where it will actually be very hard because of artificial intelligence software. It will be very hard to discern truth, and you’ve probably seen a few of these videos.You’ve seen the one with President Obama. They did the voiceover and had him saying some funny stuff. Technology is going to be one of the biggest challenges here. Because what we’re seeing is more and more advanced mechanisms to potentially create artificial content using artificial intelligence, and I think this is going to need to come back to heightened media literacy among all of us. But it will be a major issue for us to have to deal with in the next 10 years in society.Q: You’re an investor in tech companies. Can you name a few companies that you’re interested in?A: To the point about artificial intelligence, I do think we’re at a turning point now with the technology where automatable jobs are routine work, work that software could do better, cheaper and faster. We’re at a turning point where artificial intelligence is going to be able to do a lot of this work. It’s going to be imperative that people are investing in skills that are non-routine skills — everything from being an engineer to being a barber. The non-routine skills will continue to be valuable. They are the jobs that artificial intelligence won’t be able to do. Elon Musk will disagree with me, but I don’t see that being anywhere in the foreseeable future.We’ve been backing self-driving car companies like Voyage, which are helping retirement communities, people who have little mobility, helping them with a self-driving taxi service. This is a great example of how we can make people’s lives better and safer. We’re seeing Standard Cognition, which is going to compete head-to-head with Amazon Go, letting people do self check-out.This is going to be rolled out in the next decade and we’re going to see a huge shift as a result because a lot of labor is going to be affected. Overall, it will make people’s lives better. It’s why those non-routine skills are imperative to learn. I’m also looking to try to invest in companies that will scale opportunities for those people, from engineering or any kind of creative pursuits.Like I said, being a welder or a barber, those are the skills that are going to continue to have value in the new economy, and that I don’t think artificial intelligence will touch.Claire AtkinsonClaire Atkinson is the former senior media editor for NBC News.",,,,,,,,,https://www.today.com/video/alexis-ohanian-talks-about-his-push-for-paid-paternity-leave-1444727875880,,,,,,,,,,"['https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/new-reddit-founder-tease-today-190219.jpg']",,2019-02-19T14:45:50.000Z,http://link.theplatform.com/s/rksNhC/zPbfTUo51Vl_?format=redirect,,PT6M43S,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robots and Artificial Intelligence Present Challenges, Opportunities for Hospitality IndustryUniversity of Houston Study Offers Glimpse into Robot Revolution 
By Chris Stipes 713-743-8186February 25, 2019


John Bowen, Hilton College professorCristian Morosan, Hilton College associate professorFriendly and generous human-to-human interaction is at the core of good hospitality whether at a hotel, restaurant or club. However, what will the hospitality industry look and feel like when human workers are replaced by machines?
It’s already happening around the world, from robots staffing hotel front desks to machines capable of grilling hamburgers. Experts predict that robots will make up 25 percent of the hospitality workforce by 2030, presenting challenges and opportunities for an industry historically slow to adopt new technology.
University of Houston Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management professors John Bowen and Cristian Morosan recently published one of the first studies to discuss the major disruption robots will cause in the hospitality industry. The study in the journal Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes examines how service delivery systems need to be redesigned to maximize the benefits of robots, while still maintaining authentic customer service.
“The hospitality industry has high turnover in a lot of entry level jobs. Robots are good at doing repetitive tasks like food prep, cleaning and even delivery,” said Bowen. “We’re already seeing some large hotels replace front desk personnel with automated kiosks. Machines will be taking over these positions, which could produce a more error-free product.”
Worldwide labor shortages play a role in the demand for robots, along with the need to communicate with an increasing number of international travelers, according to the study, “Beware hospitality industry; the robots are coming.” Robotic hotel check-in systems will be able to respond to countless languages and react to cultural differences and expectations. Several Las Vegas hotels already use robots to deliver amenities and food directly to a guest’s room.
New systems will need to integrate seamlessly with the service environment while being attractive and easy to use for consumers of all ages. The researchers predict companies that embrace artificial intelligence and robotics will have a competitive advantage.
“It’s a way for hotels to become more efficient and cut down check-in wait times for guests, “ said Bowen. “Ultimately it will lead to a better guest experience and create customer value.”
How to use customer data has long been a challenge for the travel industry. By developing systems that learn from consumer behavior, companies can present products or services tailored to guest preferences. If a hotel guest ordered a particular red wine during a previous visit, for example, they can be offered the same wine as one of their choices subsequent visits.
However, the researchers warn that guest information needs to be used discreetly and securely. A customer may not be traveling with the same companion as on a previous trip, for example.
“Customers bring a lot of data into the hospitality service experience, including credit card and ID info, and also through their mobile device. If companies can determine behavioral data, such as what you’re purchasing and when, they can take this info and learn from it to enhance the customer experience,” said Morosan, who specializes in information technology adoption. 
The study also predicts robots will save the customer time and money by offering services that previously were cost prohibitive.
“Autonomous cars, a type of robot, will pick up guests at the airport. If they have not checked into the hotel, the car can check them in and set up their smartphone to use as a key. Based on the customer information available on the guest, the car can make suggestions regarding restaurants near the hotel. It will be able to ask questions, and based on the responses, the car can make reservations for the guest,” according to the study. “As they head toward the hotel, the guest may see a large stadium on the other side of the river and ask about it. The car can recognize the building and then provide information on the stadium. The robot serves as an airport pick-up, front desk clerk, concierge, and tour guide.”
Hospitality as we know it will be redefined during the robot revolution, and while some companies will thrive, others could be put out of business if they don’t find the right blend of hospitality and technology.
“We have to combine high tech with high touch. I don’t think the hospitality aspect will ever go away, no matter how many robots are used. We just need to find the right combination between artificial intelligence and human touch,” said Morosan. “For example, four and five start hotels will still preserve the human touch in the front of the house, while using AI and machines in the back of the house to better serve the guest.”

For one, AI could enable federal employees to focus on core responsibilities related to their agencies’ missions and spend fewer hours on administrative duties. They are likely to have more time to deliver services, interact with customers and perform other mission-related tasks. Should AI become pervasive in federal agencies, employees will need to enhance their digital and data literacy and learn how best to use the technology to work with citizens effectively,” the report said.“AI is sure to change the composition of the federal workforce, creating new jobs related to managing AI systems or requiring critical thinking. Jobs based mainly on tasks that can be automated would likely be phased out, and employees would have to learn new or different skills for other jobs.”The report estimates that approximately 130,000 federal employees will be directly impacted by the rise of AI, with some agencies seeing over a quarter of their workforce impacted.Experts interviewed for the report disagreed on whether those changes would take place over decades or years, but the recent past has provided examples of how such work disruptions play out.“The changes brought on by AI would not be the first substantial disruption of the federal workforce. In 1985, 19 percent of full-time federal employees held clerical positions. In 2017, they constituted just 4.3 percent in the workforce, according to Office of Personnel Management data,” the report said.“During those years, desktop computers and other technologies automated many clerical tasks, and new employees were hired to deliver programs in newly created agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security. Whatever changes AI brings will not be immediate but an evolution that will play out over years and decades.”Employees in their 50s are the most likely to see near-term impacts on their work from AI, according to the report, while employees in their 20s will see the lowest impact.But “impacted” by AI does not necessarily mean that a job will disappear entirely, as such automated systems can often take care of dull and repetitious tasks, while freeing up employee time for more valuable pursuits.“These are the so-called mundane tasks that almost no public employee wants to do,” said Kevin Desouza, a professor of business, technology and strategy at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, in the report.Employees will, however, likely have to work on becoming more digitally literate to interface better with new AI systems.“Everybody will be a bit of a data scientist in the future. It doesn’t matter if you are an HR person, an IT person or a business person,” said Dorothy Aronson, chief information officer at the National Science Foundation, in the report.Federal leaders and personnel offices should therefore begin to prepare and train their workforces today for the changes AI will likely bring in the future, the report recommended.The Office of Management and Budget should see AI in the context of a cross-agency priority goal and work with the General Services Administration to develop a team like U.S. Digital Service to focus on AI, according to the report, and the Office of Personnel Management should establish an AI occupational series.“Leaders should communicate with employees early and often about the potential of AI to disrupt and alter their work. Leaders and managers should learn from early adopters of AI, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, NASA and the Department of Health and Human Services,” the report said.“They should find out the extent to which the workday changed for employees, what types of agency work AI helped these organizations accomplish, which tasks were automated successfully, and what kind of work employees might start doing in place of current, repetitious tasks that AI could perform.”About  Jessie BurJessie Bur covers federal IT and management.Share:In Other NewsAsk Kevin: Which FEHB national plans offer Medicare Advantage plans?Here's what retirees can do to learn more about Medicare Advantage plans offered by FEHB plans.Ask Reg: The process for counting active duty time toward retirementA reader asks what documents are needed to prove the time acquired while in the armed forces.OpinionOveruse of National Guard threatens to undermine preparednessNontraditional missions run the risk of diverting resources that could be dedicated to training and preparedness, the authors say.Defense Health Agency nurses face recruiting freeze, threats to payThe agency has held town halls informing employees that it’s suspending a regrade of existing GS-13 nursing positions.Government power in US is a swirl of checks and balancesArticle II of the Constitution said executive power would be vested in the president but didn't specify what those powers specifically were.Load More",IT & Networks,"{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/it-networks/2019/02/28/ai-to-change-the-federal-workforce-over-years-and-decades/'}",,,,,,/resources/img/federal-logo-white.png,https://www.federaltimes.com/#publisher,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/FederalTimes', 'https://twitter.com/federaltimes']",,,,,,https://www.federaltimes.com/it-networks/2019/02/28/ai-to-change-the-federal-workforce-over-years-and-decades/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The advent of Artificial Intelligence in the corporate world is disrupting existing business processes and changing the way organizations are run. AI is fast becoming a cornerstone of how businesses manage their bottom line, while opening new revenue streams that could provide a boost to their toplines as well. Given the scale of its impact, there is no doubt that AI will also have a severe impact on the science that governs how organizations are run today.

I am obviously referring to incumbent management theories and models that govern modern organizational management. In classic terms, management theories are frameworks of wisdom which guide the decisions made by organizational leaders that have survived phenomenally well over the period of the modern enterprise. Sure, there have been reasons to fine-tune each one to the realities of each era and industry, but the core construct has been omnipresent through the years.
With AI’s entry into the mainstream of business, management theories may need to be re-evaluated and tweaked appropriately. While the core construct remains powerfully relevant, an injection of the new-age reality of AI will help managers and business leaders apply them in a more contemporary manner on a few theories and models that are being redefined by AI.
PROMOTED
Porter’s Five Forces
The theory of the Five Competitive Forces put forth by Michael Porter in 1979 is one of the marquee and evergreen theories in management thought schools. Michael Porter suggests that organizations looking for an understanding of their competitor environment need to consider the impact from five perspectives and work on reducing the risks associated: 1) Threat of new entrants, 2) Threat of Substitutes, 3) Bargaining Power of Customers, 4) Bargaining Power of Suppliers and 5) Intra-industry Rivalry. The construct of this theory is that when businesses need to evaluate the competitiveness (or for that matter, the probability of success) in a business or an industry, they need to keep in consideration these five levers that determine an industry’s attractiveness.

With AI now entering the fray, it is time to reimagine our understanding of Porter’s theory. Specifically, when it comes to the threat of new entrants. Over the years, AI has levelled the playing field as a secret sauce, moving even the most established incumbents from their positions in traditional industries. One must look at how AI is fuelling Amazon’s massive growth – which has hugely disrupted the traditional retail industry. Amazon uses AI in a variety of ways – from identifying the next likely purchase to piloting drone-based deliveries. It was no surprise when Amazon’s announcement last year that it will be entering the healthcare industry led to a tumble in the share price of traditional healthcare companies. AI puts enterprises in a pole position and organizations that harness its’ power correctly stand to gain huge ground over those that do not.
Elton Mayo’s Human Relations Theory
Elton Mayo’s landmark research in the field of organizational productivity comes from his studies in the 1920s at Hawthorne plants in Chicago. In seeking to answer questions around how to improve human productivity, he and his assistants tried tinkering with multiple variables that might have an impact on the quality of the labour force’s work – such as light, duration of breaks and duration of working hours. After all these variables proved inconclusive on how to uplift worker productivity, Mayo finally hit upon his hypothesis i.e. giving attention to employees is what truly resulted in improved performances. Giving your workers a voice in the decision-making process, an experience of greater freedom and autonomy and considering the inherent social needs of people – is the most critical lever in the productivity puzzle.

Enter Artificial Intelligence. With AI taking away much of the scud work involved in managing the varied bureaucracies inherent in organizations, leaders will find a lot more time in managing the performance of its most valued asset – human talent. By simplifying routine and repetitive processes for leadership and the people, we can afford to pay much more attention to the well-being of our human talent, celebrate successes and course-correct flagging performances – with the much-needed human(e) touch.
Total Quality Management (TQM)
Many models and theories surround the overall framework for TQM (Total Quality Management) – a science that owes much of its early evolution to manufacturing techniques originating in Japan. At its very essence, TQM is the science that governs the quality in the manufacturing process. It relates to the adherence of manufactured products with agreed specifications, evolved keeping in mind the needs of the end user. TQM bridges multiple concepts – from customer centricity, lowering the waste in manufacturing processes with a view to increasing the overall quality of the manufacturing output.
The theories surrounding this domain may also be due for a revamp. TQM has long been a data-driven process – relying heavily on a post-mortem understanding of evidence-based decision-making and process improvement. With AI in the picture, organizations can improve predictions around off-specified products earlier, leading to a quantum leap in manufacturing quality. AI is also helping improve the forecasting process, thus reducing the waste created through unused, unsold inventory. Similarly, AI will reduce the overhead associated with identifying anomalous manufacturing conditions and provision for predictive machine maintenance as well to keep up the quality standards in manufacturing activity.
The Future of Organizational Management
The defining case for AI to changing existing models and theories of management boils down to the need for creating a blended workforce comprising both humans and machines. Management science today is largely rooted in building more efficient and agile organizations for humans. In the future, humans and AI will work side-by-side to achieve shared organizational goals. This means that AI will help remove a lot of administrative work that often throttles the productivity of leaders – and allow them to direct their energies towards more complex, judgement driven work that requires them to think creatively. Intelligent machines will soon be considered by the workforce to be ‘colleagues’ and the evolution of management thought needs to account for policies and systems that make the most out of this hybrid workforce.
In conclusion, infusing AI will make business more human centric.  Ironic as it may sound, putting AI in charge of the day-to-day, routinized activities will lead to more time for compassionate interactions between humans and unleash human creativity in a huge way.

Despite still being in its infancy, artificial intelligence (AI) has already shown enormous potential to advance humanity towards new frontiers of prosperity and growth. Due to its powerful force, however, AI can also pose significant risks, which should be handled with the utmost care, but not with fear. The world’s top political leaders have understood AI’s disruptive potential and are rushing to secure a competitive advantage in this crucial emerging domain, even at the price of reviving old-fashioned industrial policy. At the same time, academia and civil society are calling for widely shared ethical principles to avoid negative repercussions.
In this fast-changing context, Europe is struggling to keep pace with superpowers like the United States and China.
This report summarises the work of the CEPS Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, which met throughout 2018. Arguing that the EU and its member states are uniquely positioned to lead the global community towards responsible, sustainable AI development, its members call upon European leaders to focus on leveraging AI’s potential to foster sustainable development in line with the 2030 Agenda.
The report puts forward 44 recommendations on how to design and promote lawful, responsible and sustainable AI and how to approach future policy and investment decisions with the aim of positioning Europe in the driver’s seat to address the most disruptive technology transition of our times.

Every Monday morning, artnet News brings you The Gray Market. The column decodes important stories from the previous week—and offers unparalleled insight into the inner workings of the art industry in the process.
This week, inspecting the brave new world of art and AI…
 
INTELLIGENT DESIGN
On Monday night, the Metropolitan Museum of Art unveiled a quintet of machine-learning-powered prototypes developed in partnership with MIT and Microsoft. According to the Met, the initiative’s goal is “to imagine and develop scalable new ways for global audiences to discover, learn, and create with one of the world’s foremost art collections through artificial intelligence.” My colleague Eileen Kinsella recapped the highlights the following day.
At the risk of sounding cynical, I don’t think any of the value propositions presented by the Met x Microsoft x MIT are going to blow your hair back. Worse than that, I think they encapsulate Big Tech’s continued mission to camouflage AI as either a light-hearted parlor trick or an unqualified good while it rams a crowbar into the socioeconomic divides already ripping apart 21st-century society.
Let me explain.
All told, the Met discussed five different applications, only one of which was operational. That application, Gen Studio, uses a Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN—the same basic software responsible for the artwork that makes me angrier than an aggrieved youth sports parent—to allows users to remix structurally related objects owned by the Met, then find close matches to the AI-generated hybrid in the museum’s collection. 
Personally, I think it’s a harmless distraction good for about 15 seconds of surplus curiosity. And compared to how I feel about the other four prototypes, that is high praise.

OVERSHARING
Gen Studio aside, the Met x Microsoft x MIT subtly aggregates AI’s greatest threats. Once complete, the remaining quartet of apps can only deliver its (meager) payoff if you give away either A) your personal data, or B) your labor. (As prototypes, none currently store or exchange user data.) All it takes to see this unsettling trade-off is a few italics added to copy from the Met’s webpage. 
Artwork of the Day will select one daily image intended to “resonate with you” based on “your location, weather, news, and historical data [italics mine]”; My Life, My Met “will use Microsoft AI to analyze your posts from Instagram and substitute the images with the closest matching Open Access artworks from the Met collection”; and Storyteller “uses voice recognition AI to follow the discussion and share artworks from the Met collection that resonate with the stories being told.” 
In other words, for each algorithm to work, you have to give it access to, respectively, where you are at any given moment; every image you’ve ever posted to the world’s most popular photo-sharing app; and both what your voice sounds like and what you’re talking about while the app is open. What could go wrong? 
I’m sure everyone involved in the collaboration will say user data is kept safe and only used to refine the prototypes themselves, not leveraged toward other goals. (After publication time, the Met responded to an email inquiry by promising a response from Microsoft.) But even if you ascribe the best intentions to everyone involved, do you believe them? It’s not as if Big Tech has given us much reason to consider its ringleaders hack-proof, bug-proof, or self-interest-proof lately. 
Then there’s the Met x Microsoft x MIT’s fifth and final prototype: Tag, That’s It! Beneath the exuberantly punctuated allusion to child’s play, the project provides an even more direct link to the grim stakes of AI than its brethren dependent on self-surveillance.

TURKING OVERTIME
The Met describes Tag, That’s It! as “a crowdsourcing means of fine-tuning subject keyword results generated by an AI model” for pieces in its collection. Translation: Users volunteer their time to apply keywords reflecting what’s shown in each image so that the algorithm can better learn to recognize subject matter, making the collection more easily searchable over time.
I expect the Met, Microsoft, and MIT would compare contributing to Tag, That’s It! to contributing to Wikipedia: an online labor of love that makes the community better. But the repetitive, borderline mindless nature of the task, as well as the AI endgame, actually makes users much more like Mechanical Turks. 
For those uninitiated into the boiler-room infrastructure of machine learning, “Mechanical Turk” is Amazon’s term for a flesh-and-blood laborer who repeatedly performs a task easy for humans but still difficult for machines, usually for extremely low compensation that incentivizes volume participation. (The name arises from an 18th-century hoax in which an alleged chess-playing “robot” was just a dude hidden inside an elaborate construction.)
Amazon runs an entire marketplace for Mechanical Turks, where “requesters” post listings for tasks they need done online and potential workers (“Turkers”) trawl the available options. Sample tasks include filling out surveys, transcribing recorded audio, and the job central to Tag, That’s It!: labeling image contents to gradually improve “computer vision,” or software’s ability to accurately parse the visual world into discrete components through machine learning. 
Turking is almost invariably paid at sub-minimum wage rates. Requesters can set a task’s payout as low as one cent. Since Amazon takes 20 percent of whatever requesters pay to Turkers, they also have incentive to minimize compensation and underestimate the time required to complete a task (another compulsory data point for any listing). 
The upshot for the laborers? A recent study by Cornell University found that the median payout per Turker hovers somewhere around two dollars an hour. This is legal because, like Uber drivers, Turkers qualify as independent contractors, freeing their employers from labor regulations such as a minimum wage, designated breaks, and health or vacation benefits. 
Still, the grand irony buried within this arena is that, when it comes to helping to train machine-learning algorithms, Turkers are literally incentivized to try to make themselves redundant as fast as possible. Which might seem like a good thing, until you survey the rest of the labor market—an increasingly apocalyptic hellscape scorched by the disruptive effects of automation and AI.

VICIOUS CYCLE
If you’re afraid of what AI will do to the global workforce in the future, start looking right in front of you. A 2017 Deloitte study determined that more than half of companies had already started using “robotic process automation,” also known as machine learning or AI, to replace at least some jobs previously handled by people, with nearly three-quarters expected to do the same by 2020. 
This push toward a software-dominant economy lends employers a certain Jekyll and Hyde quality. Here’s Kevin Roose summing up his experience with the issue at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos:
In public, many executives wring their hands over the negative consequences that artificial intelligence and automation could have for workers…. But in private settings, these executives tell a different story: They are racing to automate their own work forces to stay ahead of the competition, with little regard for impact on the workers.
Tech evangelists and defenders have long argued that technological progress is nothing to fear, because the same advancements that eliminate old jobs will create new, better ones, just as happened in the Industrial Revolution. But as Eduardo Porter wrote in the New York Times this week…
Something different is going on in our current technological revolution. In a new study, David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Anna Salomons of Utrecht University found that over the last 40 years, jobs have fallen in every single industry that introduced technologies to enhance productivity. The only reason employment didn’t fall across the entire economy is that other industries, with less productivity growth, picked up the slack. 
“Industries with less productivity growth” means industries (and thus, jobs) that are still basically the same as they’ve always been: food service, hospitality, eldercare, etc. I say “basically” because, as Porter reports from an increasingly class-divided Phoenix, Arizona, employers are generally only keeping these human-dependent industries going by slashing wages and benefits to minimize their costs. 
So the fact that there are jobs, period, papers over the fact that said jobs are not good—and getting worse. Yet even these hard-to-automate industries can’t keep up with the overall labor supply. So where else do the unemployed and underemployed turn? 
As relayed in a harrowing Atlantic piece by Alana Semuels, a recent Pew poll found that five percent of Americans made money by doing some amount of remote work through an online platform—about two and a half times more than drove for ride-sharing apps like Uber. And while not all this remote work is paid as poorly as Turking, the trend lines are pointing in the wrong direction. Siddarth Suri and Mary L. Gray, researchers focused on the unskilled gig economy (the one powered by on-demand marketplaces like TaskRabbit, AirBnB, and Uber), recently estimated that up to one-third of Americans may join its ranks within the next 10 years. 
All of which creates a vicious cycle: AI makes elites and the highly skilled wealthier by usurping more and more once-decent jobs; unskilled or low-skilled workers retreat to unforgiving service industries; and failing that, they turn to even less forgiving on-demand, online-enabled work that elites are racing to usurp with AI, sometimes with the workers’ labor hastening their own obsolescence.

CONNECTING THE DOTS
What does all this have to do with the Met x Microsoft x MIT? On one level, not much. Even once the initiative’s entire quintet of AI prototypes goes live, I doubt the collective user base will move the needle on Silicon Valley’s quest to harvest enough data and cheap labor to supercharge machine learning into a workforce-reshaping productivity juggernaut. 
But on another level, the collaboration typifies the soft-peddling of AI’s concussive impact on the average citizen. It entices us to imagine how machine learning could “connect people through art,” to quote the Met’s copy… while offering nothing more than a few weak software freebies for personal data and unpaid labor. This uneven exchange sets a dangerous precedent by encouraging behaviors and expectations central to AI’s disruption of modern employment, class, and quality of life. It’s like being enthralled by a street magician while his accomplice empties your wallet.
In this way, the Met’s AI initiative invites the art world to once again turn so completely inward that it misses the larger issues at the crux of the latest spectacle. My advice? Pulp the invitation.

Artificial intelligence is coming to your inbox. A Finnish company has rolled out a new product that lets potential employers scan the private emails of job applicants to determine whether or not they would be a good fit for the organization.
The company, Digital Minds, portrays its offering as something innocuous. If applicants give their consent, what’s the harm?
The truth is: We don’t know the answer to that question. And that’s what makes new, potentially intrusive and discriminatory technologies like this one so scary.

The product skims a job applicant’s private conversations to compute an assessment of his or her psychological traits using IBM Watson’s Personality Insights. The result is a profile of the candidate, based on the so-called Big Five personality traits — openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism — that gives the potential employer an assessment of whether the person in question would be a good fit at his or her company.
Digital Minds, started by two young Finns in 2017, claims it has carried out thousands of assessments for dozens of clients so far, and that it is fully compliant with the European Union’s strict data protection and privacy legislation, known as GDPR.
Digital Minds’ email-scanning tool is an example of a growing reliance on automatic-decision-making.
There are some obvious advantages to a tool like this. Current hiring methods are far from perfect, as considering resumés and conducting face-to-face interviews leaves plenty of room for discrimination. Interviews especially tend to assess a candidate’s likability to the interviewer, rather than his or her ability to work efficiently in an organization.
Research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley — based on monitoring a company’s internal exchanges over six years — also found that language used in emails could successfully predict an employee’s career path. Those who, based on a linguistic analysis of their emails, did not fit in with the culture of the company, were much more likely to leave the company — whether voluntarily or not — and less likely to be promoted internally.
No studies have been done to assess the predictive power of the private emails, but it is plausible that doing so could be equally successful. A tool that replaced face-to-face interviews with something cheaper, more reliable and less susceptible to personal bias could indeed lead to better hiring results.

Of course, no tool would be fool-proof. If the practice of looking at prospective employees’ private inboxes became widespread, it’s likely that online tools would pop up to help candidates adapt their inboxes to fit their target employers’ culture or expectations.

This product could also prove to be illegal. In Finland, employers are barred from collecting personal data about employees or job applicants that is not directly relevant to a specific task, even if the person in question gives his or her consent. Whether using private emails to create a psychometric profile constitutes collection of personal data is still unclear, as is legislation regarding the arbitrariness of the procedure.
The EU’s data protection regulation also forbids decisions “based solely on automated processing” if they produce “legal effects” on someone — wording that’s convoluted enough to leave too much room for interpretation.
But that’s not the real danger of tools like this one. Digital Minds’ email-scanning tool is an example of a growing reliance on automatic-decision-making. Increasingly, we are taking the power out of hands of humans and entrusting it to algorithms that make decisions on criteria we haven’t decided upon. The opacity in exactly how they make those decisions is what poses the biggest risk from these new technologies and approaches.
Not even the most data-driven companies can reliably predict the outcome of self-learning systems like the one developed by Digital Minds. Amazon, for example, ditched a self-developed recruiting system because it discriminated against women. To their credit, Amazon’s staff scrutinized their own tool and noticed the problem themselves. But not every company is likely to be as rigorous.
As long as automated decision-making remains a black box, there is no way for employers, or even programmers, to know the basis on which it is making its judgement. Is the algorithm looking for key words related to union activity, family planning, sexual preferences or other traits employers might find undesirable? Has a job seeker been rejected on the basis of a past action, gender, religious belief or political affiliation? We don’t know.

Unless we ensure these products are more transparent, people will lose trust in the companies and governments that use them.
The arbitrariness of tools like this could elicit a significant backlash among citizens, especially as automatic decision-making starts to have important effects on people’s lives.
That’s already starting to happen across Europe. France has a vast system of automated speed controls; authorities in Denmark have developed a tool to automatically identify children at risk of neglect; and in Italy, treatment for patients in the public health system is allocated on the basis of automated data analysis.
The Netherlands relies on a system of “risk indication” to detect welfare fraud (it is currently subject to a legal challenge), and in Slovenia, teachers in some schools rely on automated tools to detect “problematic” students. In Poland, the ministry of justice last year introduced a system that, once a day, automatically assigns cases to judges across the country “without emotions” or “bias.”
These tools may be developed with the best intentions in mind. But unless we ensure these products are more transparent, people will lose trust in the companies and governments that use them.

Citizens also need to have appropriate recourse to contest these automated decisions and hold to account those who rely on them, no matter if they are public administration or private companies. Dumping source code online, as some governments do, is not enough.

There are examples of how best to scrutinize these systems. New York City, for example, created a commission to identify systems of automated decision-making in use by the administration and review them “through the lens of equity, fairness and accountability.”
It is high time European governments — whether national, regional or local — take a page out of their book and make sure they understand, and legislate for, how automatic decision-making is reshaping our world.

Its creators are worried about misuse.by  Kelsey PiperFeb 14, 2019, 12:50 PM ESTFacebookLinkJavier Zarracina/VoxKelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.One of the coolest AI systems I’ve ever seen may also be the one that will kick me out of my job.Earlier this week, I attended a demo with a research team at OpenAI, the San Francisco nonprofit that’s right up there with top tech companies in conducting impressive new research on the frontiers of AI. The system they showed me was a language-learning model that writes the news, answers reading comprehension problems, and is beginning to show promise at tasks like translation.In a paper released Thursday, the OpenAI team demonstrates that we can get those results from an “unsupervised” AI — meaning the system learned from reading 8 million internet articles, not from being explicitly trained for the tasks. Their AI advances the state of the art — in some cases, by a lot. The OpenAI team says their system sets a record for performance on so-called Winograd schemas, a tough reading comprehension task; achieves near-human performance on the Children’s Book Test, another check of reading comprehension; and — most thrillingly to me — generates its own text, including highly convincing news articles and Amazon reviews.Here’s what happens when you give the system a one-sentence prompt and invite it to write the rest of this article:The AI selects words one at a time and then considers what the next one should be. It takes a few seconds to add sentences.It’s by no means perfect:The prose is pretty rough, there’s the occasional non-sequitur, and the articles get less coherent the longer they get. “The model still does seem to drift off topic eventually, and the output is capped at a few hundred words,” Sam Bowman, who works on natural language processing and computational linguistics at NYU, told me in an email.And to be clear, while the AI can write news articles that are sometimes convincing enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see them in the newspaper, it can’t write true news articles; the quotes and statistics are all made up.Advantage humanjournalists —for now.We’re seeing the potential of “unsupervised” learningWe’ve made huge strides in natural language processing over the past decade. Translation has improved, becoming high-quality enough that you can read news articles in other languages. Google demonstrated last summer that Google Assistant can make phone calls and book appointments while sounding just like a human (though the company promised it won’t use deceptive tactics in practice).AI systems are seeing similarly impressive gains outside natural language processing. New techniques — and more computing power — have allowed researchers to invent photorealistic images, excel at two-player games like Go, and compete with the pros in strategy video games like Starcraft and DOTA.But even for those of us who are used to seeing fast progress in this space, the latest release from OpenAI is pretty impressive.Until now, researchers trying to get world-record results on language tasks would “fine-tune” their models to perform well on the specific task in question — that is, the AI would be trained for each task.The OpenAI system, called GPT-2, needed no fine-tuning: It turned in a record-setting performance at lots of the core tasks we use to judge language AIs, without ever having seen those tasks before and without being specifically trained to handle them. It also started to demonstrate some talent for reading comprehension, summarization, and translation with no explicit training in those tasks.GPT-2 is the result of an approach called “unsupervised learning.” Here’s what that means. The predominant approach in industry today is “supervised learning.” That’s where you have large, carefully labeled data sets that contain desired inputs and desired outputs. You teach the AI how to produce the outputs given the inputs.That can get great results, but it requires building huge data sets and carefully labeling each bit of data. And it’s worth noting thatsupervised learning isn’t how humans acquire skills and knowledge. We make inferences about the world without the carefully delineated examples from supervised learning.Many people believe that advances in general AI capabilities will require advances in unsupervised learning — that is, where the AI just gets exposed to lots of data and has to figure out everything else itself. Unsupervised learning is easier to scale since there’s lots more unstructured data than there is structured data, and unsupervised learning may generalize better across tasks.Learning to read like a humanOne task that OpenAI used to test the capabilities of GPT-2 is a famous test in machine learning known as the Winograd schema test. A Winograd schema is a sentence that’s grammatically ambiguous but not ambiguous to humans — because we have the context to interpret it.For example, take the sentence: “The trophy doesn’t fit in the brown suitcase because it’s too big.”To a human reader, it’s obvious that this means the trophy is too big, not that the suitcase is too big, because we know how objects fitting into other objects works. AI systems, though, struggle with questions like these.Before this paper, state-of-the-art AIs that can solve Winograd schemas got them right 63.7 percent of the time, OpenAI says. (Humans almost never get them wrong.) GPT-2 gets these right 70.7 percent of the time. That’s still well short of human-level performance, but it’s a striking gain over what was previously possible.GPT-2 set records on other language tasks, too. LAMBADA is a task that tests a computer’s ability to use context mentioned earlier in a story in order to complete a sentence. The previous best performance had 56.25 percent accuracy; GPT-2 achieved 63.24 percent accuracy. (Again, humans get these right more than 95 percent of the time, so AI hasn’t replaced us yet — but this is a substantial jump in capabilities.)One skeptical perspective on text-generation AI systems, Bowman pointed out, is that “models like this can sometimes look deceptively good by just repeating the exact texts that they were trained on.” For example, it’s easy to have coherent paragraphs if you’re plagiarizing whole paragraphs from other sources. But that’s not what’s going on here: “This is set up in a way that it can’t really be doing that.” Since it selects one word at a time, it’s not plagiarizing.Another skeptical perspective on AI advances like this one is that they don’t reflect “deep” advances in our understanding of computer systems, just shallow improvements that come from being able to use more data and more computing power. Critics argue that almost everything heralded as an AI advance is really just incremental progress from adding more computing power to existing approaches.The team at OpenAI contested that. GPT-2 uses a newly invented neural network design called the Transformer, invented 18 months ago by researchers at Google Brain. Some of the gains in performance are certainly thanks to more data and more computing power, but they’re also driven by powerful recent innovations in the field — as we’d expect if AI as a field is improving on all fronts.“It’s more data, more compute, cheaper compute, and architectural improvements — designed by researchers at Google about a year and a half ago,” OpenAI researcher Jeffrey Wu told me. “We just want to try everything and see where the actual results take us.”Is the era of fake news about to get even worse?The team at OpenAI is making the unusual choice not to release their system publicly for everyone to interact with. That’s too bad — take it from me, it’s incredibly fun to try out — but they have a very good reason.OpenAI has been active in trying to figure out how to limit the potential for misuse of AI, and they’ve concluded that in some cases, the right solution is limiting what they publish.With a tool like this, for example, it’d be easy to spoof Amazon reviews and pump out fake news articles in a fraction of the time a human would need. A slightly more sophisticated version might be good enough to let students generate plagiarized essays and spammers improve their messaging to targets.“I’m worried about trolly 4chan actors generating arbitrarily large amounts of garbage opinion content that’s sexist and racist,” OpenAI policy director Jack Clark told me. He also worries about “actors who do stuff like disinformation, who are more sophisticated,” and points out that there might be other avenues for misuse we haven’t yet thought of. So they’re keeping the tool offline, at least for now, while everyone can weigh in on how to use AIs like these safely. (There’s a smaller version publicly available to try.)OpenAI’s generative language AI writes an article about a snowstorm. GPT-2 demo environment courtesy of OpenAI; image by Javier Zarracina/VoxThis story about a snowstorm in the Northeast — complete with invented quotes from local authorities — took about 10 seconds to “write.”Of course, keeping some capabilities private might have fairly little effect. “I’m confident that a single person working alone with enough compute resources could reproduce these results within a month or two (either a hobbyist with a lot of equipment and time, or more likely, researchers at a tech company),” Bowman wrote me. “Given that it is standard practice to make models public, this decision is only delaying the release of models like this by a short time.” And keeping capabilities private has drawbacks — it makes it harder for the general public to independently evaluate the work that’s being done.“We want to communicate about what we’ve done in a responsible manner that empowers other important stakeholders, like journalists and policymakers, to also understand and verify what we’ve done,” Clark wrote me. That’s a balance that will take some practice to strike appropriately, but they think that this discovery — with all its potential to be a dangerous tool for fake news — is the right place to start investigating how to strike it.While they’re not making the language generator itself available online, the team at OpenAI gave me access to it so I could check out their results and write this piece.So, of course, I did the obvious — I asked OpenAI’s new language AI to finish up this article for me.“OpenAI released a new language model called GPT-2 which surpasses state-of-the-art on a variety of tasks,” I prompted it. Over the next 15 seconds, the AI expanded on that for me.Skeptics say that language models cannot do reasoning, but GPT-2 is proving far more powerful than even the best artificial intelligence models can. [...]GPT-2 is not perfect — not even the best AI models are — but it is improving with each passing day. As the technology progresses, the more complex it becomes to build models. AI researchers continue to create models for tasks like image recognition and machine vision. [...]It went on:Artificial intelligence is changing our lives in the fastest and most positive way possible. Artificial intelligence will allow intelligent robots and computers to work alongside us, and can even give us the ability to work alongside other intelligent agents, whether they will be humans or machines.The AI ended on a positive note — or, depending on how you look at it, a terrifying one:This is the future, and the field of AI is going places we could only have guessed at.Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

Applying just a bit of strain to a piece of semiconductor or other crystalline material can deform the orderly arrangement of atoms in its structure enough to cause dramatic changes in its properties, such as the way it conducts electricity, transmits light, or conducts heat.
Now, a team of researchers at MIT and in Russia and Singapore have found ways to use artificial intelligence to help predict and control these changes, potentially opening up new avenues of research on advanced materials for future high-tech devices.
The findings appear this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in a paper authored by MIT professor of nuclear science and engineering and of materials science and engineering Ju Li, MIT Principal Research Scientist Ming Dao, and MIT graduate student Zhe Shi, with Evgenii Tsymbalov and Alexander Shapeev at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia, and Subra Suresh, the Vannevar Bush Professor Emeritus and former dean of engineering at MIT and current president of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
Already, based on earlier work at MIT, some degree of elastic strain has been incorporated in some silicon processor chips. Even a 1 percent change in the structure can in some cases improve the speed of the device by 50 percent, by allowing electrons to move through the material faster.
Recent research by Suresh, Dao, and Yang Lu, a former MIT postdoc now at City University of Hong Kong, showed that even diamond, the strongest and hardest material found in nature, can be elastically stretched by as much as 9 percent without failure when it is in the form of nanometer-sized needles. Li and Yang similarly demonstrated that nanoscale wires of silicon can be stretched purely elastically by more than 15 percent.  These discoveries have opened up new avenues to explore how devices can be fabricated with even more dramatic changes in the materials’ properties.
Strain made to order
Unlike other ways of changing a material’s properties, such as chemical doping, which produce a permanent, static change, strain engineering allows properties to be changed on the fly. “Strain is something you can turn on and off dynamically,” Li says.
But the potential of strain-engineered materials has been hampered by the daunting range of possibilities. Strain can be applied in any of six different ways (in three different dimensions, each one of which can produce strain in-and-out or sideways), and with nearly infinite gradations of degree, so the full range of possibilities is impractical to explore simply by trial and error. “It quickly grows to 100 million calculations if we want to map out the entire elastic strain space,” Li says.
That’s where this team’s novel application of machine learning methods comes to the rescue, providing a systematic way of exploring the possibilities and homing in on the appropriate amount and direction of strain to achieve a given set of properties for a particular purpose. “Now we have this very high-accuracy method” that drastically reduces the complexity of the calculations needed, Li says.
“This work is an illustration of how recent advances in seemingly distant fields such as material physics, artificial intelligence, computing, and machine learning can be brought together to advance scientific knowledge that has strong implications for industry application,” Suresh says.
The new method, the researchers say, could open up possibilities for creating materials tuned precisely for electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices that could find uses for communications, information processing, and energy applications.

The team studied the effects of strain on the bandgap, a key electronic property of semiconductors, in both silicon and diamond. Using their neural network algorithm, they were able to predict with high accuracy how different amounts and orientations of strain would affect the bandgap.
“Tuning” of a bandgap can be a key tool for improving the efficiency of a device, such as a silicon solar cell, by getting it to match more precisely the kind of energy source that it is designed to harness. By fine-tuning its bandgap, for example, it may be possible to make a silicon solar cell that is just as effective at capturing sunlight as its counterparts but is only one-thousandth as thick. In theory, the material “can even change from a semiconductor to a metal, and that would have many applications, if that’s doable in a mass-produced product,” Li says.
While it’s possible in some cases to induce similar changes by other means, such as putting the material in a strong electric field or chemically altering it, those changes tend to have many side effects on the material’s behavior, whereas changing the strain has fewer such side effects. For example, Li explains, an electrostatic field often interferes with the operation of the device because it affects the way electricity flows through it. Changing the strain produces no such interference.
Diamond’s potential
Diamond has great potential as a semiconductor material, though it’s still in its infancy compared to silicon technology. “It’s an extreme material, with high carrier mobility,” Li says, referring to the way negative and positive carriers of electric current move freely through diamond. Because of that, diamond could be ideal for some kinds of high-frequency electronic devices and for power electronics.
By some measures, Li says, diamond could potentially perform 100,000 times better than silicon. But it has other limitations, including the fact that nobody has yet figured out a good and scalable way to put diamond layers on a large substrate. The material is also difficult to “dope,” or introduce other atoms into, a key part of semiconductor manufacturing.
By mounting the material in a frame that can be adjusted to change the amount and orientation of the strain, Dao says, “we can have considerable flexibility” in altering its dopant behavior.
Whereas this study focused specifically on the effects of strain on the materials’ bandgap, “the method is generalizable” to other aspects, which affect not only electronic properties but also other properties such as photonic and magnetic behavior, Li says. From the 1 percent strain now being used in commercial chips, many new applications open up now that this team has shown that strains of nearly 10 percent are possible without fracturing. “When you get to more than 7 percent strain, you really change a lot in the material,” he says.
“This new method could potentially lead to the design of unprecedented material properties,” Li says. “But much further work will be needed to figure out how to impose the strain and how to scale up the process to do it on 100 million transistors on a chip [and ensure that] none of them can fail.”
“This innovative new work demonstrates potential to significantly accelerate the engineering of exotic electronic properties in ordinary materials via large elastic strains,” says Evan Reed, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University, who was not involved in this research. “It sheds light on the opportunities and limitations that nature exhibits for such strain engineering, and it will be of interest to a broad spectrum of researchers working on important technologies.”
The work was supported by the MIT-Skoltech program and Nanyang Technological University.

Well, on several missions: the French mathematician, winner of the 2010 Fields Medal – often described as maths’ Nobel Prize – sits as an MP for Emmanuel Macron’s party La République en Marche, teaches at the University of Lyon, and is running for the Paris 2020 mayoralty. But the expert in mathematical analysis, famous for his academic achievements as well as for wearing spider-shaped pins on his three-piece suits, has a bigger goal: making France a leader in artificial intelligence.
Appointed by the French president to set out a national AI strategy, in 2018 Villani published a report, “AI for Humanity”, setting clear lines for the sector: “We must valorise our research, define our industrial priorities, work on the ethical and legal framework and on AI training,” Villani says, sat among his spiders – one as big a pillow – in his office.
Following the report’s publication, President Macron announced an investment of €1.5bn, over four years, to implement most of Villani’s propositions. “I want France to be one of the leaders of the AI sector,” Macron said. “We have the means, and we will create the conditions.”
Villani identified four sectors to prioritise: health, defence, transport, and the environment. From early detection of pathologies to green urban mobility, AI can be used for “common good”, Villani concluded in the report, and recommended the creation of open data platforms for each sector. Data on energy, transport, agriculture, biodiversity, climate, agriculture and much more could help all four sectors, for example by forecasting traffic peaks, pollution, floods, and allowing a better organisation of French public life.
About 95 per cent of his propositions are being implemented by the government, Villani says; health is the sector in which the creation of the data platform is most advanced. But Villani estimates that the number of AI students must be tripled to answer the sector’s needs. The government is aiming to double it, and wants at least 40 per cent of researchers to be female. “We’re currently very far from these goals. It’s going to take very voluntarist actions,” Villani says.
Research is expected to play a pivotal role in Villani’s plan. On November 6, 2018, the minister for Research and Innovation, Frédérique Vidal, announced the creation of four “interdisciplinary AI institutes”, or “3IA”, in Paris, Toulouse, Grenoble and Nice, where academics and industrials will work together on AI projects around local priorities in health, education, robotics, the environment and public policy.
For the 3IA to be a success, France will need to retain talent. On Villani’s advice, the government is now trying to stem the scientific “brain drain”: to retain world-class French mathematicians, algorithmics experts and statisticians, who often leave low-paying roles in France for the US or China, a new law will allow them to take on better-paid consultancy work, for a maximum of 50 per cent of their time. Villani also suggested doubling researchers’ salaries, but the government turned that recommendation down. To Nozha Boujemaa, the research director at the National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, which will coordinate the 3IA project, this is a problem: “We won’t be competitive enough,” she says.
The €1.5bn budget allocated by Macron shows France’s limits on competitiveness, too. “One billion is less than a regional budget in the US or China,” Boujemaa says. Villani knows France can’t compete with Chinese investment – the city of Tianjin alone has a £11.6bn AI budget – but it’s not about France, he says: it’s about Europe. “France will do nothing in the AI sector without Europe. We need networks of researchers and institutes throughout Europe, to work with each other’s strengths and good practices.” For this reason, Villani, finds Brexit “tragic”.
“At a moment when we need all European skills, in a context of harsh competition worldwide, it is regrettable to lose the UK’s remarkable expertise. It is in France and the UK’s best interest to keep close links in the AI sector.”
France may not become the AI leader, but it can become an AI leader. Villani’s biggest challenge isn’t budget or international competition: it’s changing the cultural mindset. He gives the example of two French ministry services where an algorithm was tested to improve the office’s operations. Although its efficacy was proved, one test was stopped quickly, and Villani expects the other to stop, too, because people were wary of the changes introduced by AI. “It’s about cultural adaptation, about the whole engine being in the same mindset,” he says. “We must convince everyone to cooperate.”

But the expert in mathematical analysis, famous for his academic achievements as well as for wearing spider-shaped pins on his three-piece suits, has a bigger goal: making France a leader in artificial intelligence.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTAppointed by the French president to set out a national AI strategy, in 2018 Villani published a report, “AI for Humanity”, setting clear lines for the sector: “We must valorise our research, define our industrial priorities, work on the ethical and legal framework and on AI training,” Villani says, sat among his spiders – one as big a pillow – in his office.Trending NowChatGPT Answers the Web's Most Searched QuestionsFollowing the report’s publication, President Macron announced an investment of €1.5bn, over four years, to implement most of Villani’s propositions. “I want France to be one of the leaders of the AI sector,” Macron said. “We have the means, and we will create the conditions.”Villani identified four sectors to prioritise: health, defence, transport, and the environment. From early detection of pathologies to green urban mobility, AI can be used for “common good”, Villani concluded in the report, and recommended the creation of open data platforms for each sector. Data on energy, transport, agriculture, biodiversity, climate, agriculture and much more could help all four sectors, for example by forecasting traffic peaks, pollution, floods, and allowing a better organisation of French public life.About 95 per cent of his propositions are being implemented by the government, Villani says; health is the sector in which the creation of the data platform is most advanced. But Villani estimates that the number of AI students must be tripled to answer the sector’s needs. The government is aiming to double it, and wants at least 40 per cent of researchers to be female. “We’re currently very far from these goals. It’s going to take very voluntarist actions,” Villani says.AdvertisementResearch is expected to play a pivotal role in Villani’s plan. On November 6, 2018, the minister for Research and Innovation, Frédérique Vidal, announced the creation of four “interdisciplinary AI institutes”, or “3IA”, in Paris, Toulouse, Grenoble and Nice, where academics and industrials will work together on AI projects around local priorities in health, education, robotics, the environment and public policy.For the 3IA to be a success, France will need to retain talent. On Villani’s advice, the government is now trying to stem the scientific “brain drain”: to retain world-class French mathematicians, algorithmics experts and statisticians, who often leave low-paying roles in France for the US or China, a new law will allow them to take on better-paid consultancy work, for a maximum of 50 per cent of their time. Villani also suggested doubling researchers’ salaries, but the government turned that recommendation down. To Nozha Boujemaa, the research director at the National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, which will coordinate the 3IA project, this is a problem: “We won’t be competitive enough,” she says.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe €1.5bn budget allocated by Macron shows France’s limits on competitiveness, too. “One billion is less than a regional budget in the US or China,” Boujemaa says. Villani knows France can’t compete with Chinese investment – the city of Tianjin alone has a £11.6bn AI budget – but it’s not about France, he says: it’s about Europe. “France will do nothing in the AI sector without Europe. We need networks of researchers and institutes throughout Europe, to work with each other’s strengths and good practices.” For this reason, Villani, finds Brexit “tragic”.“At a moment when we need all European skills, in a context of harsh competition worldwide, it is regrettable to lose the UK’s remarkable expertise. It is in France and the UK’s best interest to keep close links in the AI sector.”France may not become the AI leader, but it can become an AI leader. Villani’s biggest challenge isn’t budget or international competition: it’s changing the cultural mindset. He gives the example of two French ministry services where an algorithm was tested to improve the office’s operations. Although its efficacy was proved, one test was stopped quickly, and Villani expects the other to stop, too, because people were wary of the changes introduced by AI. “It’s about cultural adaptation, about the whole engine being in the same mindset,” he says. “We must convince everyone to cooperate.”This article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

The human doctors lost.Credit...Mark Schiefelbein/Associated PressBy Cade MetzFeb. 11, 2019Leer en españolEach year, millions of Americans walk out of a doctor’s office with a misdiagnosis. Physicians try to be systematic when identifying illness and disease, but bias creeps in. Alternatives are overlooked.Now a group of researchers in the United States and China has tested a potential remedy for all-too-human frailties: artificial intelligence.In a paper published on Monday in Nature Medicine, the scientists reported that they had built a system that automatically diagnoses common childhood conditions — from influenza to meningitis — after processing the patient’s symptoms, history, lab results and other clinical data.The system was highly accurate, the researchers said, and one day may assist doctors in diagnosing complex or rare conditions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDrawing on the records of nearly 600,000 Chinese patients who had visited a pediatric hospital over an 18-month period, the vast collection of data used to train this new system highlights an advantage for China in the worldwide race toward artificial intelligence.Because its population is so large — and because its privacy norms put fewer restrictions on the sharing of digital data — it may be easier for Chinese companies and researchers to build and train the “deep learning” systems that are rapidly changing the trajectory of health care.On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order meant to spur the development of A.I. across government, academia and industry in the United States. As part of this “American A.I. Initiative,” the administration will encourage federal agencies and universities to share data that can drive the development of automated systems.Pooling health care data is a particularly difficult endeavor. Whereas researchers went to a single Chinese hospital for all the data they needed to develop their artificial-intelligence system, gathering such data from American facilities is rarely so straightforward.“You have go to multiple places,” said Dr. George Shih, associate professor of clinical radiology at Weill Cornell Medical Center and co-founder of MD.ai, a company that helps researchers label data for A.I. services. “The equipment is never the same. You have to make sure the data is anonymized. Even if you get permission, it is a massive amount of work.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAfter reshaping internet services, consumer devices and driverless cars in the early part of the decade, deep learning is moving rapidly into myriad areas of health care. Many organizations, including Google, are developing and testing systems that analyze electronic health records in an effort to flag medical conditions such as osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and heart failure.Similar technologies are being built to automatically detect signs of illness and disease in X-rays, M.R.I.s and eye scans.The new system relies on a neural network, a breed of artificial intelligence that is accelerating the development of everything from health care to driverless cars to military applications. A neural network can learn tasks largely on its own by analyzing vast amounts of data.Using the technology, Dr. Kang Zhang, chief of ophthalmic genetics at the University of California, San Diego, has built systems that can analyze eye scans for hemorrhages, lesions and other signs of diabetic blindness. Ideally, such systems would serve as a first line of defense, screening patients and pinpointing those who need further attention.Now Dr. Zhang and his colleagues have created a system that can diagnose an even wider range of conditions by recognizing patterns in text, not just in medical images. This may augment what doctors can do on their own, he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“In some situations, physicians cannot consider all the possibilities,” he said. “This system can spot-check and make sure the physician didn’t miss anything.”The experimental system analyzed the electronic medical records of nearly 600,000 patients at the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center in southern China, learning to associate common medical conditions with specific patient information gathered by doctors, nurses and other technicians.First, a group of trained physicians annotated the hospital records, adding labels that identified information related to certain medical conditions. The system then analyzed the labeled data.Then the neural network was given new information, including a patient’s symptoms as determined during a physical examination. Soon it was able to make connections on its own between written records and observed symptoms.When tested on unlabeled data, the software could rival the performance of experienced physicians. It was more than 90 percent accurate at diagnosing asthma; the accuracy of physicians in the study ranged from 80 to 94 percent.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn diagnosing gastrointestinal disease, the system was 87 percent accurate, compared with the physicians’ accuracy of 82 to 90 percent.Able to recognize patterns in data that humans could never identify on their own, neural networks can be enormously powerful in the right situation. But even experts have difficulty understanding why such networks make particular decisions and how they teach themselves.As a result, extensive testing is needed to reassure both doctors and patients that these systems are reliable.Experts said extensive clinical trials are now needed for Dr. Zhang’s system, given the difficulty of interpreting decisions made by neural networks.“Medicine is a slow-moving field,” said Ben Shickel, a researcher at the University of Florida who specializes in the use of deep learning for health care. “No one is just going to deploy one of these techniques without rigorous testing that shows exactly what is going on.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt could be years before deep-learning systems are deployed in emergency rooms and clinics. But some are closer to real-world use: Google is now running clinical trials of its eye-scan system at two hospitals in southern India.Deep-learning diagnostic tools are more likely to flourish in countries outside the United States, Dr. Zhang said. Automated screening systems may be particularly useful in places where doctors are scarce, including in India and China.The system built by Dr. Zhang and his colleagues benefited from the large scale of the data set gathered from the hospital in Guangzhou. Similar data sets from American hospitals are typically smaller, both because the average hospital is smaller and because regulations make it difficult to pool data from multiple facilities.Dr. Zhang said he and his colleagues were careful to protect patients’ privacy in the new study. But he acknowledged that researchers in China may have an advantage when it comes to collecting and analyzing this kind of data.“The sheer size of the population — the sheer size of the data — is a big difference,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 12, 2019, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: In China, Training A.I.

What is big news is how resoundingly it might improve on traditional methods. It’s not exactly breaking news that biopharma companies are increasingly turning toward machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve drug development. What is big news is how resoundingly it might improve on traditional methods. This was recently demonstrated by the results of the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) contest hosted by the Protein Structure Prediction Center, sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences I(NIH/NIGMS). CASP is a worldwide contest, or perhaps experiment is a better word, that has taken place every two years since 1994. Proteins have three-dimensional structures and those structures are an important element in how they function—it’s not uncommon, for example, for a mutation in the gene for a protein to result in the protein having a different shape, causing it to behave abnormally or not at all. And another fact to keep in mind is that protein shapes are dynamic, not necessarily static, transitioning between different states. Every two years, the participants attempt to predict the 3-D shape of a specific human protein. Researchers focused on this type of research work to solve the problem using a variety of methods. Most recently, CASP wasn’t won by a biologist or biochemist, but by DeepMind, the AI laboratory owned by Google/Alphabet. Mohammed AlQuraishi, a biologist at Harvard Medical School who participated in the contest, told The New York Times, “I was surprised and deflated. They were way out in front of everyone else.” DeepMind didn’t just beat out the other scientists but gave a prediction that was almost twice as accurate as experts expected. A77B545F-2C28-4856-8EBC-88BE5BD90DCB.png Derek Lowe, who writes the In The Pipeline blog for Science Translational Medicine, told The Times, “It is not that machines are going to replace chemists. It’s that the chemists who use machines will replace those that don’t.” In his own blog, AlQuraishi criticized big pharma companies and the academic community for not keeping up. “The smartest and most ambitious researchers wanting to work on protein structure will look to DeepMind for opportunities instead of Merck or Novartis,” he wrote. “This fact should send chills down the spines of pharma executives, but it won’t because they’re clueless, rudderless, and asleep at the helm.” Merck, though, is exploring protein folding, but the company’s scientists think its impact is far down the road. It’s using deep learning algorithms on other aspects of drug discovery and development. Juan Alvarez, associate vice president of computational and structural chemistry at Merck told The Times, “We have to connect so many other dots.” Also, very few if any academic institutions can afford the resources like DeepMind, and large biopharma companies aren’t likely to devote that much of their finite resources to one approach. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for a reported $650 million. And other companies are focusing on AI and machine learning. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a clinical-stage biotech company that combines AI, experimental biology and automation to discover and develop drugs at scale. On Jan. 7, 2019, Recursion announced progress in its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical on identifying novel preclinical candidates for rare diseases. In 18 months, the partnership had led to the evaluation of Takeda preclinical and clinical compounds in more than 60 unique indications, with new therapeutic candidates identified in more than half-a-dozen diseases. As a result, Takeda exercised its option for drug candidates in two rare diseases and the two companies have extended the partnership. Also in January, Recursion signed a licensing deal with the Ohio State Innovation Foundation (OSIF), acquiring rights to OSU-HDAC42, a clinical stage compound that will be developed by Recursion for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a rare tumor syndrome. San Francisco-based Atomwise is using AI technology based on convolutional neural networks, the same tech used in facial recognition tech and self-driving cars, to search for drugs. On Jan. 11, 2019, Atomwise inked a strategic alliance with contract research organization (CRO) Charles River Laboratories International. Atomwise will support CRL’s hit discovery, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization efforts. Atomwise has a number of partnerships, including with AbbVie, the University of Toronto, Merck, Duke University School of Medicine and others. At the World Medical Innovation Forum held in Boston in April 2018, panelists focused on the use of AI in healthcare. In particular, AI can be used in clinical trials to search old clinical trial data for new applications and potentially replace part of clinical trials with “virtual” models. At that meeting, Joseph Scheeren, a senior advisor for R&D at Bayer, noted that cleaning data after a clinical trial can take one or two months. But AI, on the other hand, could potentially do it in a single day. He estimated that AI could reduce the time required for a clinical trial by 30 to 40 percent. “In R&D,” he said, “speed is everything.” And the same month, London-based BenevolentAI, which uses AI to develop new medicines, brought in $115 million in new investments. Since its founding in November 2013, the company has raised $207 million, according to Crunchbase. In September 2017, Vivek Ramaswamy launched another “vant” company, Datavant, which will use AI to improve clinical trials. It’s led by Travis May, co-founder and chief executive officer of LiveRamp, which offers data analysis across their ecosystem. And in July 2017, GlaxoSmithKline signed a $43 million deal with AI company Excientia to stimulate drug development. GSK indicated it would use AI to discover novel and select molecules for up to 10 disease-related targets across multiple therapeutic areas. So, it’s clear that biopharma is taking AI seriously. Jeremy Jenkins, head of data science for chemical biology and therapeutics at Novartis, told The Times, “Everyone is trending up in this area. It is like turning a big ship, and I think these methods will eventually scale to the size of our entire company.”', 'articleSection': 'Business, News', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/'}, 'name': 'Mark Terry', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2019-02-08T17:39:08.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-02-11T15:41:11.000Z', 'headline': 'Artificial Intelligence Gaining Ground in Drug Development', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/aa2d660/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F6542F7E9-27C9-4FD2-AC76-38227F87FA2D.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/fac8f78/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F6542F7E9-27C9-4FD2-AC76-38227F87FA2D.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development'}], 'breadcrumb': {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/news', 'name': 'News', 'position': 1}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/business', 'name': 'Business', 'position': 2}]}, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence Gaining Ground in Drug Development', 'datePublished': '2019-02-08T17:39:08.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-02-11T15:41:11.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/fac8f78/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F6542F7E9-27C9-4FD2-AC76-38227F87FA2D.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The White House is moving forward with the American AI Initiative, a set of policies aimed at focusing the full resources of the federal government on the frontiers of artificial intelligence.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order launching the initiative today. Among its provisions is a call for federal agencies to prioritize AI in their research and development missions, and to prioritize fellowship and training programs to help American workers gain AI-relevant skills.
The initiative also directs agencies to make federal data, models and computing resources more available to academic and industry researchers, “while maintaining the security and confidentiality protections we all expect.”
“This action will drive our top-notch AI research toward new technological breakthroughs and promote scientific discovery, economic competitiveness and national security,” the White House said in a statement.
As a trust-building measure, federal agencies are being asked to establish regulatory guidelines for AI development and use across different types of technology and industrial sectors. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is being given the lead role in the development of technical standards for reliable, trustworthy, secure and interoperable AI systems.
The White House says an action plan will be developed “to preserve America’s advantage in collaboration with our international partners and allies.”
“In last week’s State of the Union address, President Trump committed to investing in cutting-edge industries of the future,” Michael Kratsios, deputy assistant to the president for technology policy, said in a prepared statement. “The American AI Initiative follows up on that promise with decisive action to ensure AI is developed and applied for the benefit of the American people.”
This week’s action comes amid rising concern about American competitiveness in artificial intelligence research and development.

China and the European Union are both pushing ahead with multibillion-dollar AI research and development programs. In response, the White House has formed an advisory panel on AI R&D, and a federal commission focusing on AI’s national security implications has been established with Amazon’s Andy Jassy and Microsoft’s Eric Horvitz among its members.
Amazon and Microsoft are among the hundreds of companies that are making AI a high priority in R&D, resulting in well-known products such as Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana AI voice assistants (as well as similar AI agents offered by Apple and Google). AI capabilities such as machine learning and computer vision are also key to the development of autonomous vehicles and precision robotics.
Stacey Dixon, director of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, or IARPA, said AI applications are also highly relevant to national security.
“Understanding imagery is one of the most evident opportunities for us to use AI, due to the sheer quantity of data to be analyzed and AI’s demonstrated effectiveness at image categorization,” she said. “However, IARPA also develops AI to address other intelligence challenges, including human language transcription and translation, facial recognition in real-world environments, sifting through videos to find nefarious activities, and increasing AI’s resilience to many kinds of attacks by adversaries.”
Those AI tools could be used for nefarious purposes as well, however. In a report issued last year, a consortium including the Electronic Freedom Foundation and OpenAI called on policymakers to collaborate closely with researchers to investigate, prevent and mitigate potentially malicious uses of AI.

Artificial intelligence: friend or foe to employees?

To some degree, humans are quite predictable.
When faced with a change, our amygdala, the region of our brain that triggers a fight or flight response, will predictably influence human behavior. For example, when your company announces a change like consolidation or layoffs, people will react with either resistance, enthusiasm or worse, ambivalence.
Over the course of American history, we have faced many changes that were initially feared. When Henry Ford released the Model T car, fears from the loss of employment in the horse and buggy “industry” were palpable. Over time, however, enthusiasm replaced fear. Ford had created a new industry. Employees developed new skills. It also created new opportunities that benefited workers and business owners.
Today we’re faced with technological advancements that are transforming the way we communicate, create, and collaborate. One improvement that has finally matured enough to worry and excite us humans is artificial intelligence (AI).
The question is, will AI replace humans in the workplace? Indeed, dystopian fears have triggered the amygdala in many people. Those fears, however, are unfounded.
Technology versus humans

When early AI started to make noticeable impacts on workflows, companies anticipated laying off employees. Visions of saved labor costs made executives and investors happy. Imagine reducing costs like benefits, insurance, even office space.
Job loss, however, won’t be as rampant in America as initially feared. Job loss projections range from 9 percent to 47 percent. Why the wide range in forecasts? It depends on which side analysts and thought leaders fall concerning tech’s influence on the workforce.
A reliable way to determine the impact on your workforce is to evaluate the tasks employees do. Jobs, where tasks can be easily automated, have a higher likelihood of being eliminated, like clerical and production positions, for example.
On the flipside, artificial intelligence is less likely to overtake jobs that require higher education. Interestingly enough, some trade positions are expected to avoid the AI disruption.
A mutually beneficial relationship between technology and humans has a high propensity for success.
Adobe is already showing creatives how the relationship between technology and human can be harmonious. Adobe Sensei, the creative giant’s AI, delivers insights that flirt with being more human-like. For example, Sensei can filter through millions of images that meet your project’s needs. Want a photo that conveys happiness that’s not trite? Adobe’s AI can help find the right image that conveys the emotions you want.
Rather than referring to Sensei as AI, Chris Duffey, Adobe’s Strategic Development Manager for Creative Cloud, flips it to be IA—intelligent assistant. The switch humanizes technology in a way that is likely palatable for us humans. Sensei frees up humans from needless, long, laborious tasks. While Sensei does its thing, creatives can shift their focus to deep thinking or nuanced decisions making that defy algorithms.
Human versus human

In a 2018 McKinsey report, technical and social and emotional skills will become more critical over the next 11 years. Framed another way: It is no longer good enough for employees to be technically proficient. As leaders, we each need to understand the impact we have on others and results. Over the past two decades, we see this shift, a 50-percent increase in collaborative and agile team arrangements.
If people can’t work together with less friction, then companies face a severe conundrum: How to change already existing toxic or generic workplace cultures? The daunting reality is 70 percent of workers have negative work experiences. One contributing factor is a lack of quality relationships with coworkers.
It’s not AI that should worry us. Instead, it’s our impact on our colleagues. The quality of the human-to-human interaction has always been important. AI is merely revealing how teams that work well together become the next competitive advantage.
What’s next?
As AI and automation mature, leaders will further their understanding of this workplace change. We need to get better at integrating the benefits of automation into operational changes in the business. Our insatiable curiosity can be boundless. What’s more, there are no universal ethics surrounding AI and its usage. As an example, I recently shared an article about the role AI plays in the future of work. In response, one person warned about the loss of privacy. She has a legitimate concern.  However, AI is not the concern. It’s us.
At the same time, doomsday proclamations about humanity’s demise at the hands of our tech creations seems a bit dramatic. What AI cannot do is replicate the human ability to rely on our intuition, that gut instinct. It cannot think creatively either. This makes humans irreplaceable. Simply stated: companies need to become masters at uniting AI capabilities with human dynamics.

Professionals with around 8-10 years of experience, with two-three years of that in AI, can easily get annual packages upwards of Rs 50 lakh, going up to Rs 1 crore and more while for those in senior strategic roles, salaries are up to Rs 2.5-3 crore.   “The entry salary of a CS engineer is Rs 3-3.5 lakh while that of an entry AI role is Rs 5.5-6 lakh,” said Anurag Malik, partner, people advisory services at EY India. “The majority of people with AI specialisation in India got into the area over the last two-three years. The maximum supply gap is of middle-level folks with 5-7 years of experience, as they are just not available.”Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 50:00Loaded: 1.18%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -50:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

The average AI experience of Indian professionals is just three years, with almost 67% of them having joined or transitioned into their current roles in the past two years. In contrast, around 57% organisations that are hiring for AI in India are looking for candidates with more than five years of experience. The highest demand is for professionals with skills in natural language processing and generation, image-based analytics, chatbots and machine learning. “Due to the limited talent pool, salaries are going up,” said Ratna Gupta, director of ABC Consultants.Prince Augustin, executive vice-president group human capital & leadership development at Mahindra & Mahindra, said the group has a large number of new hires in AI and other emerging technologies in various businesses. Since the field is very new and fast changing, it is difficult to find veterans in this space and hence there is a lot of demand, he said. From an India perspective, since a large part of AI clients are overseas, there seems to be even more willingness and ability from many companies to pay over the top, said Rakesh Barik, partner, Deloitte India. At many companies, it has been classified as a “hot skill”, which represents the highest band within the consulting skillsets.Barik estimates that there could not be more than a quarter of a million AI practitioners and engineers worldwide and the demand would have already surpassed more than a million. Adding to the problem is the low churn from India’s talent institutions and universities. “It is now a common practice of hiring a senior talent or a Ph.D to build a dream team underneath him or her. And these one-off hires are not coming in cheap and actually is more challenging,” he said.Recruiters say it is difficult to fill roles across levels because of the sheer number of options available to candidates. A hedge fund looking to hire an analyst with two years of AI experience for a machine learning-based trading model has had the position lying vacant for nearly 4-5 months even though it’s paying `40 lakh for a fairly junior role. Another ecommerce biggie, looking to staff an AI team under its chief data scientist, is struggling to find talent, said a recruiter.At the senior level, the problem is more pronounced. “There is a huge dearth of proven talent at a senior level with 10 years of AI experience. And everyone is competing for that. In most cases, one has to look abroad,” said Anuj Roy, managing partner, FIDIUS Advisory. “Jumps of even 100% while switching jobs are not uncommon. Even IT consulting companies are paying huge premiums for strategy people to come in and design roadmaps to implement AI in more processes,” said GC Jayaprakash, executive director at RGF Executive Search.( Originally published on Feb 11, 2019 )Read More News onArtificial Intelligence JobsdeloitteAI talentsMahindra Groupmachine learningABC Consultantsartificial intelligence",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robots like this one from the BYU Robotics and Dynamics Lab are taking over the workplace. (Nate Edwards/BYU Photo)The artificial intelligence revolution is here.Technological advancements involving computers and robots are making big impacts on the workplace and don’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon.Between 400 million and 800 million jobs throughout the world are estimated to be replaced by AI by 2030, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute. The study states the jobs most likely to become automated in the U.S. include food preparation workers, production workers and travel workers.Utah has the 35th highest job automation potential among states in the U.S. at 45.6 percent, according to a report by the Brookings Institution. Over one million jobs in the state could be replaced by AI by the year 2030.The reactions to this revolution are mixed. Although there is a certain level of uncertainty when it comes to bringing AI into the workplace, BYU economics professor Michael Ransom said job automation can prove to be a positive thing for the economy.Technological advancements are expected to continue to make big impacts on the workplace.(Nate Edwards/BYU Photo)“When you get new technological changes it eliminates some jobs but it typically creates other ones,” Ransom said. “There’s always this question of, ‘Will the technological changes create or destroy more jobs?’ but really there’s always going to be something that people could do. They will just have to change what they’re doing.”Ransom mentioned that as new technological advancements such as robots have taken over production-based jobs, there has been a growth in service sector jobs such as health-care and recreation services. An increase in those who choose to go into the workplace right out of high school could be seen performing more relationship-based jobs rather than heading into the factories.BYU Economics Student Association President Kevin Standridge said he believes the reason why there is skepticism toward AI is because of how fast it can impact the workplace.“The reason artificial intelligence is scary for a lot of people from an economic perspective is that it has the potential to replace so many jobs at once,” Standridge said. “It puts a lot of people out of work.”Overall, however, Standridge sees automation as a good thing that might just take some time for people to get used to.Throughout history significant technological advancements have always influenced the workplace.(Mark Philbrick/BYU Photo 1981)History shows the introduction of new technology into society has often been met with skepticism and resistance. The printing press, typewriters and computers are examples of major technological advances that eventually proved critics wrong.“Throughout history you always have instances of creative destruction,” Standridge said. “When we first made typewriters it made printing a lot more efficient. When we got computers the same thing happened, we put all the typewriters out of business. Artificial intelligence is just the same step but for a lot of different industries.”Tesla, Waymo and Uber are just a few companies that are facing such opposition today. Although the idea of self-driving cars is scary to some, such technology could become commonplace in the future and could result in the job displacement of truck, bus and taxi drivers.“As time goes on and you start seeing things like self-driving cars, people will have to switch to more mind and engineering-based jobs rather than doing basic menial work,” said Alex Wright, a chemical engineering major from Draper. “Job automation does take some people out of business, but there are more effective and productive things that they could be doing instead.”Although the effects of AI in the workplace can cause some concern, Ransom believes being flexible and having a college education are crucial for success in the future.“The hallmark of a good education is that you can be flexible and learn how to do things,” Ransom said. “Having a strong, broad education is a good idea. The most educated people have done very well during the last couple of decades, so things look pretty good for college-educated students.”Standridge believes that the effects of job automation will push some to seek post-graduate degrees, but ultimately sees flexibility and problem-solving as the keys to success.“There is going to be a lot of pressure for post-graduate work, that is going to be a force,” Standridge said. “But that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be the only option. A lot of it is just going to be learning on the job and (knowing) how to solve certain problems. I don’t necessarily think post-graduate work is going to be a must.”TAGSArtificial IntelligenceJob AutomationtechnologyFacebook

Ann Johansson/Corbis via Getty ImagesSigal Samuel is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.It was with a strangely deflated feeling in his gut that Harvard biologist Mohammed AlQuraishi made his way to Cancun for a scientific conference in December. Strange because a major advance had just been made in his field, something that might normally make him happy. Deflated because the advance hadn’t been made by him or by any of his fellow academic researchers. It had been made by a machine.DeepMind, an AI company that Google bought in 2014, had outperformed all the researchers who’d submitted entries to the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) conference, which is basically a fancy science contest for grown-ups.Every two years, researchers working on one of the biggest puzzles in biochemistry, known as the protein folding problem, try to prove how good their predictive powers are by submitting a prediction about the 3D shapes that certain proteins will take. That might seem like a weird thing to forecast, but it’s actually crucial for how scientists develop new drugs. DeepMind has a pretty clear explanation of how this works.By harnessing the power of machine learning, DeepMind won the CASP contest by a huge margin. What this advance represents for both biochemistry and machine learning is fascinating and important.But even more intriguing to me was a blog post AlQuraishi wrote in the aftermath of the conference, which I came across after it was highlighted in a New York Times article.In his post, AlQuraishi describes the gamut of emotions he experienced at CASP. He discusses his initial melancholy — he felt like he and the other academics had been made obsolete — and how he ultimately overrode that feeling “as my tribal reflexes gave way to a cooler and more rational assessment of the value of scientific progress.” His meditation struck me as important, because if we’re going to solve high-impact problems, we need to find a way to be psychologically open to the notion that our own minds will not always be the best tools.I spoke to AlQuraishi about how researchers can cope with the fact that AI is changing their scientific fields — and may even change our perception of science itself. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.Sigal SamuelYou wrote a very personal blog post where you describe feeling a gamut of different emotions from the moment you headed to the conference to the moment you left. Can you walk me through those emotions?Mohammed AlQuraishiSo for people who are in the field, the results actually came out two days before the conference began. We could all go online and look. I was surprised because I wasn’t expecting [DeepMind] to do so well. I was also disappointed because I was participating [in the contest] too, and I didn’t do so well. There was that emotion, disappointment, because I had a personal stake in the matter.And then over the next couple days, it dawned on me that this is a field that people have been working in for decades. The fact that a new group could come in and do so well, so quickly — I felt bad because it demonstrated the structural inefficiency of academia. I felt really bad for the people who’ve been in this even longer than I have. So there was a feeling of solidarity with some of the other academic groups.It then became more a feeling of, okay, we should look at this from a different perspective: This is great, it’s going to bring attention to the [protein folding] issue.Sigal SamuelDo you think there was a psychological drive propelling your colleagues to want to undersell DeepMind’s contribution because it was displacing them?Mohammed AlQuraishiI think if it were one of the established academic groups [making the advance], people would’ve said, “It’s no surprise, we always knew this group would do well.” But the fact that it was coming from outside, with this machinery … that probably created some level of resentment, yes.But the DeepMind team was pretty open in sharing their insights, and from my perspective, the fact that there’s a new group in the field — it’s all for the better. The point is to compete to do better science, not to claim credit.Sigal SamuelAI advances can sometimes be overhyped and can yield emotion that isn’t merited by the actual situation — either too much optimism or too much pessimism. Do you think people walked away from the conference with realistic expectations for what AI can contribute to the field in the future?Mohammed AlQuraishiThe lay coverage was a little too optimistic, too overly enthusiastic. In the scientific community, it’s hard to say. I myself keep vacillating. Crystal-balling is a difficult thing.I place myself in the camp of being fairly bullish on machine learning. I do think that if you look at the history of science, it’s rare to see sustained improvement over a long period of time. I think what we’ve seen over the last, say, six years in machine learning is a fairly unique thing. It’s a once-in-a-generation type of thing, a genuine advance of the first order, comparable to the big intellectual revolutions.Sigal SamuelIt strikes me that there are established economies of prestige in academia. How do you think machine learning advances will change the prestige economy that we’re used to?Mohammed AlQuraishi[Laughs] That’s an interesting question. [Long pause] One version is to say, “This is going to make it such that being able to make sense of data will be more important, will increase in prestige.” I think that’s reasonable to expect. We’ve had this tendency as a field to be very obsessed with data collection. The papers that end up in the most prestigious venues tend to be the ones that collect very large data sets. There’s far less prestige associated with conceptual papers or papers that provide some new analytical insight.From my perspective, if there were a shift from the data collection exercise to the analysis exercise, I think that’d be a good thing in a way. In a lot of sciences, we’ve focused too much on data and not enough on understanding.Sigal SamuelThat’s reminiscent of the conversation I hear about AI among my fellow journalists. Just recently news reports came out about how AI is writing articles — one-third of the articles at Bloomberg are written with the help of AI. People always say, don’t worry, it’ll be a good thing because that’ll free up the journalists to do deeper thinking on more nuanced issues rather than focusing on the “who, what, where, when, why” — so there’s a funny parallel there.Mohammed AlQuraishiYeah, absolutely. And I actually think, looking further ahead, this will change our whole perception of what science is. Going away from human-conceived theories and models of natural phenomena to more data-driven methods and models.I think it’s a little silly to think we’re always going to be the smartest creatures on the planet. We’re going to be out-thought by machines eventually. In the interim, I suspect that what we’ll see in our modeling of natural phenomena is that it’ll increasingly be built by machines.What’s interesting is, when we cross this threshold (and in some ways, we already are), we’ll get to a point where the models we built are entirely incomprehensible to us. This will raise questions about, what is the nature of the scientific enterprise? What is it that we mean by “doing science”? Is science about understanding natural phenomena or about building mathematical models that’ll predict what will happen? Sigal SamuelThat’s so fascinating, that this could actually upend what we understand science to be.Given that kind of development, can we do a little thought experiment? Let’s say a smart undergraduate student with loads of potential comes to you tomorrow and says, “Hey, professor, I’m thinking of dedicating my career to researching protein structure prediction.” At this point, would you advise her against it? Would you tell her to leave the academy and go work for DeepMind?Mohammed AlQuraishi. CourtesyMohammed AlQuraishiI would encourage her to become fluent in machine learning and computing more broadly, because that’s going to be critical over the next few decades. It’s going to be one of the most important skill sets to have, irrespective of what phenomena you want to study. In terms of whether you stay in academia or go to DeepMind or elsewhere, I think that’ll probably be driven by the person’s motivation. If you’re really keen on solving a problem, then an industrial lab is the way to do it. If you’re more curiosity-oriented, if you want to tackle whatever topic draws your fancy at a given point in time, then perhaps academia is still the best place because you’re more independent.Sigal SamuelI think there’s also a class dimension at work here, right? Someone who’s highly trained, who has highly specialized knowledge, can potentially retrain or adapt the focus of their work so they’re not competing directly against AI. Do you think it’s easier for you than for, say, a factory worker to override the gut-level fear about being made obsolete? Mohammed AlQuraishiAbsolutely. Somebody who’s an academic who knows about machine learning today has pretty high job security. Somebody who’s doing certain other kinds of jobs, like truck-driving — I think if your job is less secure, absolutely it’s a completely different consideration.At one point, a lot of people thought there was a hierarchy among jobs — intellectual jobs would be the last to be replaced and mechanical jobs would be the first. But that’s actually unclear. It may well be that jobs that are mechanical will take a long time to replace because it’s actually hard to make robots that make certain gestures. And things in the higher echelons of intellect can maybe be more quickly replaced.Sigal SamuelIn these conversations about automation there’s always the worry about people losing their incomes, but there’s also a worry about the felt loss of meaning — the meaning we derive from the work that we do.Is that something you worry about — scientists feeling they derive less meaning from their work as machine learning makes more inroads in the field? Or is it not an issue to you because machine learning will just make the science advance faster and then we can all derive meaning from that?Mohammed AlQuraishiI think both things are true. A lot of scientists judge themselves based on how smart they are, how quickly they can solve a problem. So much social currency is based on that. And we compare ourselves to other people and we feel like imposters. So this could lead to a kind of widespread existential crisis.In the short term, I think this will be destructive. The profit motives will end up obsoleting a bunch of people. Maybe in the medium term, there’ll be some ways to adapt. We’ll think of ways to change society to define our value and identity in different ways. But I also suspect that in the very long run, there’ll be some form of augmentation or a cyborg scenario where machines and humans are integrated in some way.As we move into the longer time frame, we’re going to start to have to confront some of these broader questions. It behooves us, and particularly the machine learning community, to start communicating about the potential implications and thinking through ways we could smoothly transition to an era where machines are smarter than humans.I think it’s about equity and making sure we live in a place where we’re happy to live.Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

Artificial Intelligence Comes to Emerson Media Art Gallery



An image created through artificial intelligence, part of Alexander Reben’s Creative Work as Adversary: The AI and Machine Art, on exhibit at Emerson Urban Arts: Media Art Gallery through April 13.
What happens when artificial intelligence and robotics meet art?
The latest exhibit at Emerson Urban Arts: Media Art Gallery, Creative Work as Adversary: The AI and Machine Art, examines the connections between the three through the work of MIT-trained roboticist and artist Alexander Reben.
“Reben’s work probes the inherently human nature of artificial intelligence and our inevitable co-development with artificial creations,” curator and Boston Cyberarts director George Fifield said.
The exhibit opens Thursday, February 14, and runs through Saturday, April 13.
Reben defines his work as “art as experiment,” using tools such as artificial philosophy, synthetic psychology, perceptual manipulation, and technological magic.
“Demanding Uninterestingness”
The exhibit includes oil paintings created when AI combines words to generate a new image, and prints made when the artist’s thoughts on specific phrases are interpreted by an art-generating algorithm.
Viewers will see AI “misfortunes,” or prints chosen by the artist that represent AI-learned philosophy created from fortune cookies, as well as videos, images of AI-generated handwriting, and a sculpture that speaks in AI-generated languages.
“This work helps us not only understand who we are, but also to consider who we will become,” artist Alexander Reben said. “I am thrilled to share these works with the Emerson community, Boston, and beyond.”
Reben’s artwork and research have been shown and published internationally, including The Vitra Design Museum and the MAK Museum Vienna, and he is a consultant for major companies guiding innovation for the social machine future.
He has built robots for NASA, and is a graduate of the MIT Media Lab, where he studied human-robot symbiosis and art. He has lectured at TED, SXSW, Google, University of California Berkeley, School of the Museum of Fine Arts Tufts, and MIT, among others. He is a 2016-2017 WIRED innovation fellow, a Stochastic Labs Resident, and a recent visiting scholar in the UC Berkeley Psychology Department.
The exhibit opens February 14 with a reception from 5:00-7:00 pm. Emerson Urban Arts: Media Art Gallery, 25 Avery Street, is free and open to the public Wednesday through Saturday, 2:00-7:00 pm. Reben will host a gallery walkthrough on Sunday, March 3, 4:00 pm.
A related public lecture, Human-Machine Collaboration in Art Making, takes place on Monday, March 4 at 5 p.m. in the Kresge Auditorium on the MIT campus.
A machine’s take on Bob Ross.

With the invention of electronic digital computers in the early 1940s the pursuit of AI was made possible. The term itself was coined at a conference at Dartmouth in the summer of 1956, where scientists gathered to discuss ways to program computers to solve problems with the skills of a human. AI flourished for the next two decades and optimism was high that we would soon have machines with the general intelligence of an average human. Many of us will recall HAL 9000 from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. But the computers then were simply not powerful enough to store the amount of data required or process it as fast as needed so AI remained mostly hype. But by the end of the 20th century computing power and speed had advanced to the point where AI could be realized, marked by such demonstrations as IBM’s Deep Blue beating Gary Kasparov at chess. Now we live in the world of big data where we have the capacity to collect and process enormous amounts of data, enabling diverse realizations of artificial intelligence applications.  AI is used to personalize recommendations for videos, classify images to improve search engine performance, and provide wardrobe advice. It is also enabling driverless vehicles, detecting diseases, preserving wildlife, and assisting HR departments in hiring and firing.It is so pervasive that it is hard to distinguish real from artificial. Is that voice on the phone making the reservation, answering my customer service question, or providing healthcare advice, real or a Chatbot? Is that video of the president making a speech real or a Deepfake? It is getting harder to tell.But AI is here to stay and the lines will become even more blurred in the future. What will life be like with a digital workforce, where more and more jobs are replaced by machines and humans intermingle with robots in the workplace and the home? There is already the need in warehouses using large numbers of robots to have the human employees identify themselves as “I am not a robot” in order to avoid accidents. And  there are already jobs requiring humans to baby-sit for robots.Our relationship with smart machines also is becoming blurred. Today we don’t just fall in love through our phones.  The 2013 movie Her explored a relationship between man and computer where Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with his computer's highly advanced operating system. Recently a teacher in Japan married an anime hologram, giving new meaning to the term digital dating.AI is changing the way we live, work, and play. But how do we make sure that the technology is fair and ethical? Join us on February 12 for WorldCanvass: Artificial Intelligence, where a group of UI faculty and industry leaders in the fields of engineering, technology, education, medicine, and business will discuss the current impact of AI and what they see on the horizon. The program, which is free and open to the public, takes place at MERGE, 136 South Dubuque Street, Iowa City, from 5:30-7 p.m.  All are invited to a pre-show reception from 5-5:30 p.m. In addition, the University of Iowa Informatics Initiative has organized an all-day symposium on Artificial Intelligence on Friday, February 15, 2019 at the CPHB Atrium, 1st Floor. This event is free and open to the public.

“Continued American leadership in Artificial Intelligence is of paramount importance to maintaining the economic and national security of the United States.”



        President Donald J. Trump
      








ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY: President Trump is directing the Federal Government to prioritize research and development of America’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.Today, President Trump launched his American AI Initiative that directs Federal agencies to prioritize investments in research and development of AI.The Initiative focuses Federal Government resources toward developing AI technology and ensuring that the next great AI inventions are made in the United States. Highlights include:Unleashing innovation in AI by supporting long-term research and increasing access to Federal data and computing resources for America’s AI researchers;Promoting a responsible approach to AI by encouraging transformative applications of AI, while continually improving outcomes for workers and users alike;Preparing America’s workforce for the jobs of the future by directing Federal agencies to help Americans gain AI-relevant skills and promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education;Directing regulatory agencies to establish guidance for AI development and use across technologies and industrial sectors;Calling upon the National Institute of Standards and Technology to lead the development of appropriate technical and safety standards for AI systems; andProtecting America’s advantage in AI by promoting an international environment that supports American AI research and industries while securing critical AI technology.DRIVING BREAKTHROUGHS: Developing America’s ability to leverage AI is critical to increasing prosperity, enhancing our national and economic security, and protecting our values.AI promises great benefits for American workers, with the potential to improve safety and increase productivity.Investment in AI is critical to creating the industries of the future like autonomous cars, industrial robots, algorithms for disease diagnosis, and more.Additionally, maintaining our Nation’s global leadership in AI will ensure that the technology is developed in a manner consistent with our Nation’s values, policies, and priorities.However, our Nation urgently needs workers and businesses skilled in AI and capable of leading our country’s development and application of AI into the future.AI must also be developed in a way that does not compromise our American values, civil liberties, or freedoms.Rapid technological innovation can lead to radical improvements in society and quality of life.VISIONARY LEADERSHIP: President Trump is committed to enacting policies that promote and protect American leadership in technological development and innovation.President Trump has directed his Administration to take action to promote technical education and apprenticeships for American workers.The President has taken numerous steps to promote high quality STEM and computer science education in our schools and universities, with a particular focus on women and girls.The President is also protecting our National Security Innovation Base against those who illicitly acquire America’s hard-earned intellectual property.




 




“Today President Trump reaffirmed this Administration’s commitment to ensuring the United States leads the world in our Artificial Intelligence capabilities. The Department of Energy has long been a leader in high performance computing, and currently possesses five of the ten fastest supercomputers in the world. Through this Executive Order, the President has given DOE a mandate to further utilize our world class computing infrastructure to build upon and accelerate America’s existing AI research. DOE’s Artificial Intelligence program will provide the unique ability to analyze massive datasets and create intelligent software to accelerate the pace of discovery in a broad variety of areas including Energy, Science and Defense. The crosscutting applications for AI research are vast and include oil and gas exploration, grid management, precision medicine and much more. Put simply, making these world class tools more accessible to America’s Artificial Intelligence experts will change the world.”



        Secretary Rick Perry, Department of Energy
      








 




“Since the Manhattan Project, DOE and its predecessor agencies have been leaders in advanced computing. The rapidly evolving tools of artificial intelligence will be critical to addressing the many challenges facing our nation now and into the future. With President Trump and Secretary Perry’s leadership, DOE is excited to help ensure that the U.S. remains a world leader in this critical scientific field.”



        Paul Dabbar, Under Secretary for Science, Department of Energy

Here's how we fix the problem,Machines can discriminate in harmful ways. Here's how we fix the problem,https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,,,,,,,,"AI, Ain't I A Woman? - Joy Buolamwini",,,,,"IdeasBy Joy BuolamwiniFebruary 7, 2019 7:00 AM ESTBuolamwini is a computer scientist, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League and a poet of code.Machines can discriminate in harmful ways.I experienced this firsthand, when I was a graduate student at MIT in 2015 and discovered that some facial analysis software couldn’t detect my dark-skinned face until I put on a white mask. These systems are often trained on images of predominantly light-skinned men. And so, I decided to share my experience of the coded gaze, the bias in artificial intelligence that can lead to discriminatory or exclusionary practices. Altering myself to fit the norm—in this case better represented by a white mask than my actual face—led me to realize the impact of the exclusion overhead, a term I coined to describe the cost of systems that don’t take into account the diversity of humanity. How much does a person have to change themselves to function with technological systems that increasingly govern our lives?We often assume machines are neutral, but they aren’t. My research uncovered large gender and racial bias in AI systems sold by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. Given the task of guessing the gender of a face, all companies performed substantially better on male faces than female faces. The companies I evaluated had error rates of no more than 1% for lighter-skinned men. For darker-skinned women, the errors soared to 35%. AI systems from leading companies have failed to correctly classify the faces of Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams. When technology denigrates even these iconic women, it is time to re-examine how these systems are built and who they truly serve.Joy Buolamwini, Algorithmic Justice LeagueThere’s no shortage of headlines highlighting tales of failed machine learning systems that amplify, rather than rectify, sexist hiring practices, racist criminal justice procedures, predatory advertising, and the spread of false information. Though these research findings can be discouraging, at least we’re paying attention now. This gives us the opportunity to highlight issues early and prevent pervasive damage down the line. Computer vision experts, the ACLU, and the Algorithmic Justice League, which I founded in 2016, have all uncovered racial bias in facial analysis and recognition technology. Given what we know now, as well as the history of racist police brutality, there needs to be a moratorium on using such technology in law enforcement—including in equipping drones or police body cameras with facial analysis or recognition software for lethal operations.See the 2019 Optimists issue, guest-edited by Ava DuVernay.We can organize to protest this technology being used dangerously. When people’s lives, livelihoods, and dignity are on the line, AI must be developed and deployed with care and oversight. This is why I launched the Safe Face Pledge to prevent the lethal use and mitigate abuse of facial analysis and recognition technology. Already three companies have agreed to sign the pledge.Joy Buolamwini, Algorithmic Justice LeagueAs more people question how seemingly neutral technology has gone astray, it’s becoming clear just how important it is to have broader representation in the design, development, deployment, and governance of AI. The underrepresentation of women and people of color in technology, and the under-sampling of these groups in the data that shapes AI, has led to the creation of technology that is optimized for a small portion of the world. Less than 2% of employees in technical roles at Facebook and Google are black. At eight large tech companies evaluated by Bloomberg, only around a fifth of the technical workforce at each are women. I found one government dataset of faces collected for testing that contained 75% men and 80% lighter-skinned individuals and less than 5% women of color—echoing the pale male data problem that excludes so much of society in the data that fuels AI.Joy Buolamwini, Algorithmic Justice LeagueIssues of bias in AI tend to most adversely affect the people who are rarely in positions to develop technology. Being a black woman, and an outsider in the field of AI, enables me to spot issues many of my peers overlooked.I am optimistic that there is still time to shift towards building ethical and inclusive AI systems that respect our human dignity and rights. By working to reduce the exclusion overhead and enabling marginalized communities to engage in the development and governance of AI, we can work toward creating systems that embrace full spectrum inclusion. In addition to lawmakers, technologists, and researchers, this journey will require storytellers who embrace the search for truth through art and science. Storytelling has the power to shift perspectives, galvanize change, alter damaging patterns, and reaffirm to others that their experiences matter. That’s why art can explore the emotional, societal, and historical connections of algorithmic bias in ways academic papers and statistics cannot. And as long as stories ground our aspirations, challenge harmful assumptions, and ignite change, I remain hopeful.See the 2019 Optimists issue, guest-edited by Ava DuVernay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/zvKdZoyi/poster.jpg?width=720,,2019-02-04T22:33:03.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/zvKdZoyi.m3u8,,PT3M33S,,,,https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,

AI in law

What is the law but a series of algorithms? Codified instructions proscribing dos and don’ts—ifs and thens. Sounds a lot like computer programming, right? The legal system, on the other hand, is not as straightforward as coding. Just consider the complicated state of justice today, whether it be problems stemming from backlogged courts, overburdened public defenders, and swathes of defendants disproportionately accused of crimes.

So, can artificial intelligence help?
Very much so. Law firms are already using AI to more efficiently perform due diligence, conduct research and bill hours. But some expect the impact of AI to be much more transformational. It’s predicted AI will eliminate most paralegal and legal research positions within the next decade. Could judges and lawyers share the same fate? My coauthor Michael Ashley and I spoke to experts about AI’s impact on the legal system for our upcoming book, Own the A.I. Revolution: Unlock Your Artificial Intelligence Strategy to Disrupt Your Competition.
“It may even be considered legal malpractice not to use AI one day,” says Tom Girardi, renowned civil litigator and the real-life inspiration for the lawyer in the movie, Erin Brockovich. “It would be analogous to a lawyer in the late twentieth century still doing everything by hand when this person could use a computer.”
PROMOTED
There are many reasons to believe AI could benefit the legal industry in ways as meaningful as the personal computer. Currently, the legal system relies on armies of paralegals and researchers to discover, index, and process information. For law firms at present, this reliance can be expensive, driving up the rates they charge. And in understaffed public defender offices, investigators can only spend a few minutes interviewing each of their clients, greatly diminishing the service they can provide.

However, for just a fraction of the time and expense, AI could be used to conduct time-consuming research, reducing the burdens on courts and legal services and accelerating the judicial process. There are also situations where using AI might be preferable to interacting with a human, such as for client interviews. For instance, it’s been demonstrated people are more likely to be honest with a machine than with a person, since a machine isn’t capable of judgment.
Of course, AI can’t replace all means of collecting information. There are instances in which depositions would be more conducive to fact-gathering. Still, when preparing for a cross-examination of an expert witness, AI could be effectively deployed to determine every case in which a particular witness testified, what his/her opinions were, and how juries reacted, much faster and more thoroughly than any human investigator ever could.

Such effectiveness is great, but will lawyers panic when they can’t bill as many hours? Not according to Girardi. He believes those firms willing to adopt AI will possess a strategic advantage. “It’s a lawyer’s job to solve a problem as quickly and inexpensively as possible,” Girardi explains. “AI will be a godsend because it’ll give lawyers the information they need to resolve conflicts faster.”
Yes, AI-wielding lawyers wouldn’t be able to technically bill as many hours since the AI would work much faster than they ever could; however, according to Girardi, these attorneys’ enhanced effectiveness would likely garner repeat business and lead to more clients. “If a lawyer can use AI to win a case and do it for less than someone without AI, who do you think the client will choose to work with next time?” says Girardi. Accordingly, the promise for law firms using AI is that they will still be able to generate the same amount or even more revenue while expanding their client rosters. Conversely, firms too slow to adapt to AI and automation will suffer a competitive disadvantage.
While conventional wisdom still suggests job security for lawyers and judges is more secure than other professions, there have been calls to relieve our backlogged court system by outsourcing minor cases to AI. To this end, some courts are even considering using AI to determine eligibility for bail by detecting behavioral patterns indicating flight risk — a decision flesh-and-blood judges traditionally made in the past.
Courtrooms are likely to transform in other meaningful ways due to technological advances. Girardi believes courts might one day welcome AI technology to aid with jury selection. “If a civil dispute concerns a matter of fact—Did the doctor cut off the wrong leg?—today, it’s largely settled out of court,” says Girardi. “However, if a case concerns the interpretation of the law—Did he or she wait too long before performing a procedure? Did a doctor make a bad judgment call?—the case can go to trial, which is why the philosophical makeup of a jury is so important.”
AI could be valuable in a trial setting because it could predict such philosophical makeups. Adept at rapidly collecting important information, it could gather data about potential jurors, including their accident history, if they have served before, the verdicts of those trials, and a juror’s political and charitable affiliations. AI could also be used to analyze facial reactions and body language indicating how a potential juror feels about an issue. Before a potential juror even answers a question, the movement of his or her eyes, a change in skin coloration, or a shift in body positioning could nonverbally communicate an emotional response demonstrating a positive or negative bias. Such data could be used for optimal jury selection, facilitating greater fairness.
In spite of such developments inside the courtroom, it’s nonetheless hard to imagine how trial lawyers might be replaced by artificial intelligence. For now, a human’s unique ability to create empathy with jurors and judges alike makes them indispensable to legal deliberations. But what if judges were one day replaced by robots? After all, we know humans are fallible creatures, prone to prejudices and biases.
Song Richardson, Dean of the University of California-Irvine School of Law, worries about just this possibility. “Why does someone become a lawyer or judge? It’s certainly not to become a cog in the wheel of an assembly line system of justice. The fact that we have backlogs resulting in a failure to give people the individualized attention they deserve tells us there’s something fundamentally wrong with our justice system. Expediting the mass processing of people using AI isn’t the answer. It’s the opposite of justice.”
Richardson believes AI can benefit the legal profession, yet she cautions us to be careful how we implement it. Even the best AI needs to be taught, which means it can only be as objective as the people who teach it. “People often view AI and algorithms as being objective without considering the origins of the data being used in the machine-learning process,” says Richardson, who specializes in the dangers of unconscious bias. “Biased data is going to lead to biased AI. When training people for the legal profession, we need to help future lawyers and judges understand how AI works and its implications in our field.”
In spite of these concerns, Richardson still believes the net impact of new technology will be positive. Lawyers and judges are only as good as the information they receive, and AI has the potential to significantly increase the quality of information. Still, no matter how sophisticated the technology becomes, she and Girardi both agree it will never be a substitute for the judgment and decision-making only humans can provide. “AI isn’t going to replace the need for critical thinking. We still need to prepare students to think like lawyers, and I don’t think that’s ever going to change,” says Richardson.
Though no consensus exists yet as to how AI will ultimately shape the legal profession, we do know AI is poised to transform nearly every facet of our lives, and the new technologies it’s powering will create a host of unprecedented legal issues, including ownership, liability, privacy and policing. For a taste of what’s coming, just consider this: when self-driving cars start getting into accidents, who will be deemed responsible? The car owner? The manufacturer? The software designer? The very fact these are complicated issues soon to be exacerbated by unprecedented technology reveals the need for more lawyers, but not just any kind of lawyers. We need those capable of making sense of our rapidly evolving society.
“What worries me is that we won’t have lawyers who understand algorithms and AI well enough to even know what questions to ask, nor judges who feel comfortable enough with these new technologies to rule on cases involving them,” says Richardson. In light of such valid concerns, it is becoming increasingly clear our law schools must prepare tomorrow’s lawyers to use the new technology. But even this isn’t enough. We also need today’s practicing counsel and judges to grasp AI and all it promises to better serve and protect our fellow humans.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Neil SahotaFollowingFollowNeil Sahota (萨冠军) is an IBM Master Inventor, United Nations (UN) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advisor, Professor at UC Irvine, and author of the book:... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",AI & Big Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first two movements are complete – and this two-movement piece is one of the composer&#x27;s most famous works – but there are only fragments of the final two movements. Chinese technology company Huawei decided to try and use AI to complete the work – with the help of composer Lucas Cantor. Huawei used the AI in its Huawei Mate 20 Pro smartphone to create the new melodies. Engineers fed music, in the form of data, into the phone&#x27;s dual Neural Processing Unit – so the AI had information about the timbre, pitch and meter that Schubert liked to use in his melodies. The AI then created melodies from that information, and composer Lucas Cantor chose his favourites. He then orchestrated those melodies and turned them into the final two movements to complete Schubert&#x27;s &#x27;Unfinished&#x27; Symphony. The new completion was performed on 4 February, in London at Cadogan Hall, in an even presented by Myleene Klass.  Speaking ahead of the world premiere, Cantor said that working with the AI was &quot;like having a collaborating who never gets tired, never runs out of ideas&quot;.

To demonstrate the technology in their smartphones, Huawei set themselves the challenge of finishing one of the most famous incomplete works in musical history
Schubert's Symphony No.8 was started in 1822, but for reasons that have never been understood, Schubert never completed the work. The first two movements are complete – and this two-movement piece is one of the composer's most famous works – but there are only fragments of the final two movements. Chinese technology company Huawei decided to try and use AI to complete the work – with the help of composer Lucas Cantor. Huawei used the AI in its Huawei Mate 20 Pro smartphone to create the new melodies. Engineers fed music, in the form of data, into the phone's dual Neural Processing Unit – so the AI had information about the timbre, pitch and meter that Schubert liked to use in his melodies. The AI then created melodies from that information, and composer Lucas Cantor chose his favourites. He then orchestrated those melodies and turned them into the final two movements to complete Schubert's 'Unfinished' Symphony. The new completion was performed on 4 February, in London at Cadogan Hall, in an even presented by Myleene Klass.

Sotheby’s Is Entering the AI Art Fray, Selling a Surreal Artwork by One of the Movement’s Pioneers This Spring

Following Christie’s tremendously successful and much-debated inclusion of an AI artwork in an auction last October—selling it for 43 times its estimate—the auction house’s archrival, Sotheby’s, is now preparing to test these uncanny waters by selling a work powered by artificial intelligence too. Heading to auction in Sotheby’s day sale in London on March 6, the occasion reaffirms a brave new fact of the art market: AI art is not going away.
This time, the artwork in question is an installation by Mario Klingemann, an early adopter of the field in which computer technology meets art—a movement the artist dubs “neurography.”
Klingemann’s installation, titled Memories of Passersby I (2018), consists of a wooden console table containing the AI computer’s “brain” and two framed screens. The machine works in real time to spit out unsettling portraits of imagined male and female faces onto the screens. It is estimated to sell at £30,000-40,000 (or $39,000-52,000).
Unlike previous AI artworks that have been sold, which have been human-curated final products, Klingemann’s machine is unique as it creates its portraits while you’re looking at it. The installation gives viewers the unique chance to, as Sotheby’s contemporary art specialist Marina Ruiz Colomer put it in a statement, “watch an AI brain think in real time.” 
The unreal images conjured by the neural network are based on its training on a database of portraits from the 17th to 19th centuries, which share Klingemann’s own bias towards surrealistic work. Many of the generated portraits end up taking on a anxiety-inducing quality Klingemann calls the “Francis Bacon effect,” referring to the alienated paintings of the great 20th-century artist. 



Klingemann was a pioneer in experimentation with neural networks and art, and was instrumental in creating many models now used by other artists working in the field. Speaking to artnet News, the artist says it “feels good” to finally be recognized by the official art world through the inclusion in the Sotheby’s sale, adding that he “honestly did not see it coming.”
The technology used in the artwork heading to auction is cutting-edge, as no one else has been able to create a machine that can work to create portraits at such speed and at such a high resolution (and that can also fit into a small box to boot).
“I guess I have to thank everyone who plays computer games,” Klingemann says. “Thanks to the high demands of games, graphics cards have become extremely powerful and versatile.” He likens the power consumption of the system to the energy needed to run a fridge. That said, the real-time aspect and the high resolution took “quite some time” to perfect, according to the artist. All in all, he says, he spent about three months training the models, writing the code, and designing the installation. 
Klingemann has chronicled his experiments over the past three years on his Twitter feed.

There are three editions of the work that is being sold at Sotheby’s, as well as two artist’s proofs—although as each edition constantly works to create unique portraits, no two will ever be the same. Klingemann notes that the AI within the work itself is “encrypted and protected, so you will not be able to copy them out of the machine or look at them to learn my little production secrets.”
The auction house discovered Klingemann’s work after one of its specialists spotted it at a private museum in Spain. “One edition of Memories of Passersby I is in the private museum of Coleccion Solo in Madrid,” the artist explains. “After that, one discussion led to another, and here we are!”
Sotheby’s is presenting the piece as a breakthrough. “It is the nature of Contemporary Art to push boundaries,” Sotheby’s Colomer said in the statement. “AI art is the latest innovation winning its place in art history books, and Klingemann’s work stands on the precipice of an exciting new era in our field.”

For now Klingemann, a self-avowed “control freak,” is in for a nerve-racking wait. “An auction is a very public space, so the idea that my work, and people’s reaction to it, will be ‘out there’…it’s a bit like waiting for your grades after a school exam,” he says.
The artist recently accepted the RE:HUMANISM prize for work created with artificial intelligence at the National Gallery on January 23, and was also a recent recipient of the Lumen Prize for Art and Technology. His work has been shown in institutions including MoMA, the Met, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. In May, Klingemann will feature in the Barbican’s new exhibition “AI: More Than Human.”

One even urged her to kill herself.“I withdrew a lot. The messages made me so depressed and led to me taking an overdose,” says Mattocks. She is just one of millions of people around the world who have found themselves the victim of bullying. Even in our modern, progressive society, it is too often overlooked and commonly dismissed as a rite of passage, but bullying affects between a fifth and a third of children at school. Adults suffer similar rates of harassment at work.You might also like: • The signs of disease no one can see • How your voice betrays a doomed romance  • What single word defines who you are?Yet research has shown that bullying can leave a lasting scar on people’s lives, causing long-term damage to their future health, wealth and relationships. And the increasing amount of time we spend online exposes us to forms of bullying that, while faceless, can be just as devastating. Young people subjected to cyberbullying suffer more from depression than non-victims and are at least twice as likely to self-harm and to attempt suicide.Luckily for Mattocks, her break up and the subsequent cyberbullying occurred just as she was about to start university. In this new environment she was able to make new friends who helped her.“It [cyber bullying] changed my outlook,” she says. “It  made me a kinder, stronger person.” Mattocks now works as a mental health campaigner, helping others who face bullying. She believes more needs to be done to curb bullying online.  Getty ImagesSocial media has provided bullies with a new way to target their victims, but often those who they attack do not report these incidents (Credit: Getty Images)But while our access to technology is increasing the potential for bullying – 59% of US teens say they have been bullied online – it could also help to stamp it out. Computers powered by artificial intelligence are now being deployed to spot and deal with cases of harassment.“It is nearly impossible for human moderators to go through all posts manually to determine if there is a problem,” says Gilles Jacobs, a language researcher at Ghent University in Belgium. “AI is key to automating detection and moderation of bullying and trolling.”His team trained a machine learning algorithm to spot words and phrases associated with bullying on social media site AskFM, which allows users to ask and answer questions. It managed to detect and block almost two-thirds of insults within almost 114,000 posts in English and was more accurate than a simple keyword search. Still, it did struggle with sarcastic remarks.Abusive speech is notoriously difficult to detect because people use offensive language for all sorts of reasons, and some of the nastiest comments do not use offensive words. Researchers at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, are training algorithms to detect hate speech by teaching them how specific communities on Reddit target women, black people and those who are overweight by using specific words.The tool was able to pinpoint less obvious abuse, such as words like &ldquo;animals&rdquo; which can be intended to have a dehumanising effect“My findings suggest that we need individual hate-speech filters for separate targets of hate speech,” says Haji Saleem, who is one of those leading the research. Impressively, the tool was more accurate than one simply trained to spot keywords and was also able to pinpoint less obvious abuse, such as words like “animals” which can be intended to have a dehumanising effect.The exercise in detecting online bullying is far from merely academic. Take social media giants like Instagram. One survey in 2017 found that 42% of teenage users have experienced bullying on Instagram, the highest rate of all social media sites assessed in the study. In some extreme cases, distressed users have killed themselves. And it isn’t just teenagers who are being targeted – Queen guitarist Brian May is among those to have been attacked on Instagram.“It’s made me look again at those stories of kids being bullied to the point of suicide by social media posts from their ‘friends’, who have turned on them,” May said at the time. “I now know firsthand what it’s like to feel you’re in a safe place, being relaxed and open and unguarded, and then, on a word, to be suddenly be ripped into.” Instagram is now using AI-powered text and image recognition to detect bullying in photos, videos and captions. While the company has been using a “bullying filter” to hide toxic comments since 2017, it recently began using machine learning to detect attacks on users’ appearance or character, in split-screen photographs, for example. It also looks for threats against individuals that appear in photographs and captions.Getty ImagesOnline bullies can target people from behind a veil of anonymity provided by the internet while victims can face hatred from complete strangers (Credit: Getty Images)Instagram says that actively identifying and removing this material is a crucial measure as many victims of bullying do not report it themselves. It also allows action to be taken against those who repeatedly post offending content. Even with these measures, however, the most scheming bullies can still create anonymous “hate pages” to target their victims and send hurtful direct messages.But bullying exists offline too, and in many forms. Recent revelations of sexual harassment within major technology firms in Silicon Valley have shone a light on how bullying and discrimination can impact people in the workplace. Almost half of women have experienced some form of discrimination while working in the European tech industry. Can technology offer a solution here too?A timestamped record of an incident around when it occurred could make it harder to cast doubt upon evidence later drawn from memoryOne attempt to do this is Spot – an intelligent chatbot that aims to help victims report their accounts of workplace harassment accurately and securely. It produces a time-stamped interview that a user can keep for themselves or submit to their employer, anonymously if necessary. The idea is to “turn a memory into evidence”, says Julia Shaw, a psychologist at University College London and co-creator of Spot.A time-stamped record of an incident around when it occurred could make it harder to cast doubt upon evidence later drawn from memory, as critics of Christine Blasey Ford attempted to do after she gave testimony against Brett Kavanaugh.Another tool named Botler AI goes one step further by providing advice to people who have been sexually harassed. Trained on more than 300,000 US and Canadian court case documents, it uses natural language processing to assess whether a user has been a victim of sexual harassment in the eyes of the law, and generates an incident report, which a user can hand over to human resources or the police. The first version was live for six months and achieved 89% accuracy.“One of our users was sexually assaulted by a politician and said the tool gave her the confidence she needed and empowered her to take action,” says Amir Moravej, Botler AI founder. “She began legal proceedings and the case is ongoing.”Getty ImagesRevelations about sexual harassment and discrimination at high profile technology companies in Silicon Valley have triggered protests and walk outs by staff (Credit: Getty Images)AI could not only help to stamp out bullying, it could save lives too. Some 3,000 people around the world take their own lives each day. That’s one death every 40 seconds. But predicting if someone is at risk of suicide is notoriously difficult.While factors such as someone’s background might offer some clues, there is no single risk factor that is a strong predictor of suicide. What makes it even more challenging to predict is that mental health practitioners often have to look at evidence and assess risk in a five-minute phone call. But intelligent machines could help.The algorithms were able to predict whether a patient would attempt to end their life in the week following an instance of self-harm“AI can gather a lot of information and put it together quickly, which could be helpful in looking at multiple risk factors,” says Martina Di Simplicio, a clinical senior lecturer in psychiatry at Imperial College London in the UK.  Scientists at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Florida State University trained machine learning algorithms to look at the health records of patients who self-harm. The algorithms were able to predict whether a patient would attempt to end their life in the week following an instance of self-harm, with an accuracy of 92%.“We can develop algorithms that rely only on data already collected routinely at point of care to predict risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours,” says Colin Walsh, assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who led the study.While the study offers hope that mental health specialists will have another tool to help them protect those at risk in the future, there is work to be done.“The algorithms developed in this study can fairly accurately address the question of who will attempt suicide, but not when someone will die,” say the researchers. “Although accurate knowledge of who is at risk of eventual suicide attempt is still critically important to inform clinical decisions about risk, it is not sufficient to determine imminent risk.”Getty ImagesAlgorithms that can search for the signs of bullying on social media can help to highlight perpetrators so they can be stopped (Credit: Getty Images)Another study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was able to identify individuals who were having suicidal thoughts with 91% accuracy. They asked 34 participants to think of 30 specific concepts relating to positive or negative aspects of life and death while they scanned their brains using an fMRI machine. They then used a machine learning algorithm to spot “neural signatures” for these concepts.The researchers discovered differences in how healthy and suicidal people thought about concepts including “death” and being “carefree”. The computer was able to discriminate with 94% accuracy between nine people experiencing suicidal thoughts who had made a suicide attempt and eight who had not, by looking at these differences.“People with suicidal ideation have an activation of the emotion of shame, but that wasn’t so for the controls [healthy participants],” says Marcel Just, director of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging at Carnegie Mellon University. He believes that one day therapists could use this information to design a personalised treatment for someone having suicidal thoughts, perhaps working with them to feel less shame associated with death.While such tailored treatments might sound futuristic, search and social media giants are trying to identify people in crisis. For example, when someone types a query into Google related to attempting suicide, the search engine offers them the help line of a charity such as The Samaritans instead of what they were looking for.Facebook last year began to use AI to identify posts from people who might be at risk of suicide. Other social media sites, including Instagram, have also begun exploring how AI can tackle the sharing of images of self-harm and suicide-related posts.In serious cases, Facebook may contact local authorities and has worked with first responders to carry out more than 1,000 wellness checks so farFacebook trained their algorithms to identify patterns of words in both the main post and the comments that follow to help confirm cases of suicidal expression. These are combined with other details such as whether messages are posted in the early hours of the morning. All this data is funnelled into another algorithm that is able to work out whether a Facebook user’s post should be reviewed by Facebook’s Community Operations team, which can raise the alarm if it thinks someone is at risk.Getty ImagesSocial media posts and mobile phone data can identify mood changes that could help to predict if someone might try to take their own life (Credit: Getty Images)In serious cases, Facebook may contact local authorities and has worked with first responders to carry out more than 1,000 wellness checks so far.“We’re not doctors, and we’re not trying to make a mental health diagnosis,” explains Dan Muriello, an engineer on the team that produced the tools. “We’re trying to get information to the right people quickly.”Facebook is not the only one analysing text and behaviour to predict whether someone may be experiencing mental health problems. Maria Liakata, an associate professor at the UK’s University of Warwick, is working on detecting mood changes from social media posts, text messages and mobile phone data.“The idea is to be able to passively monitor… and predict mood changes and people at risk reliably,” she says. She hopes that the technology could be incorporated into an app that’s able to read messages on a user’s phone.While this approach could raise privacy concerns, thousands of people are already willingly sharing their deepest thoughts with AI apps in a bid to tackle depression, which is one predictor of suicide. Mobile apps like Woebot and Wysa allow users to talk through their problems with a bot that responds in ways that have been approved for treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy.In the same way, machines may also be able to help intervene and stamp out bullying too. But until AI perfects a way of detecting the most subtle and cunning bullying tactics, the responsibility will still lie with us.“It can’t just be computers doing the whole fight,” says Nikki Mattocks.Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

  Don’t Let Artificial Intelligence Pick Your Employees



A Stanford GSB scholar shares why algorithms aren’t sophisticated enough to make these strategic decisions ... yet.

In 2014, Amazon launched a new recruitment algorithm to help it find the best job candidates. A year into the experiment, the company saw that the tool was biased against women and quietly shut the program down. When Reuters broke the story last October, John Jersin, the product leader for LinkedIn Talent Solutions, offered his thoughts on the general landscape of algorithmic hiring: “I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own,” he said. “The technology is just not ready yet.”
Implicit in his comment is the notion that, someday, these systems will be ready. But work by Adina Sterling, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business, questions this optimism, linking it to a deep — and deeply problematic — misconception of hiring’s strategic role.
In a new paper coauthored with Daniel W. Elfenbein of Washington University in St. Louis and published in Strategy Science, Sterling articulates how smart hiring is inextricable from long-term corporate strategy; she also explains why delegating the responsibility of hiring to machines, at least in the near future, is likely to undermine its strategic potential.
“With technology increasingly stepping into this role, we’re at a moment in which these questions of higher-level strategy ought to be of great importance,” she says.
From Monster.com to Algorithmic Hiring
The use of machines in hiring became widespread roughly a quarter-century back, when career platforms like Monster.com emerged on the web. These websites allowed companies to speed up the pace and expand the scale of recruitment. Job posts that once might have fielded 20 applicants were suddenly flooded with 200 in a matter of minutes. “The vast majority of the work since then has been focused on this sourcing side,” Sterling says. “It’s been about filling up the pool with applicants that you think you need and separating them from the ones you don’t.”
Today, between 65% and 70% of all job applications are touched first by a machine. After an initial culling, the best-fit candidates are then, in most cases, handed off to a human. And while computers are getting better at understanding information, and while the availability of information is exploding from our online footprints, the relatively strict filtration offered by most sourcing algorithms creates a problem. “It’s becoming much harder to find unusual talent, given these candidates don’t fit squarely into one category,” Sterling says. Consider somebody with a background in improv comedy applying for a sales job: A hiring manager might recognize potential; a computer likely wouldn’t.

At the same time, the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence is slowly expanding its purview from sourcing into actual selection. While not widespread, the development of this practice at-scale is on the horizon. “And yet handing sourcing and selection off to machines is a fundamental problem if we start to understand hiring as truly strategic,” Sterling says. “There is still a lot that human beings do that has to do with strategy, and scholars need to think through what strategic managers should be doing in the context of hiring.”
Hiring as Strategy
To claim hiring as strategic, Sterling and Elfenbein first define what they mean by this term. A decision is strategic, they say, when it meets four criteria:
Irreversibility: Irreversibility means that once a decision is made the stakeholders are committed to each other, choices available to competitors are irrevocably changed, and some options are necessarily foreclosed while others are opened.
Interdependency: This implies that the benefit of one decision is contingent on relative alignment or complementarity with other decisions made elsewhere in the company. In this regard, interdependency places a premium on knowledge sharing and coordination among decision makers.
Competition: Competition means that competitors’ responses influence the value of different alternatives. Decision makers must thus put themselves in the shoes of these competitors and forecast how they might react to each alternative across many imagined futures.
Learning under uncertainty: Companies account for the uncertainty inherent in hiring; they hire not just to execute a new job, but also with an eye to learning new knowledge and getting connected to new people, communities, customers, and suppliers.
After conducting a series of interviews with hiring managers, AI and machine learning experts, and personnel-technology start-up executives, Sterling and Elfenbein argue that each of these conditions applies to hiring, and so it ought to be considered strategic. “And things that you can program or automate — in other words, what machines are already doing in hiring — are not the strategic aspects of hiring. The strategic aspects encompass attending to those four elements,” Sterling says.
Hiring strategically thus means thinking not just about any one applicant’s skills — the “best athlete” approach — but about how to holistically and consistently source talent and integrate it into the organization. It also means sticking with this human capital strategy over the long term, since these are commitments that cannot be reversed without cost.
In short, hiring is not a one-off search for the most suitable candidate for a specific job, but a process akin to filling a roster. Hiring demands a global view of the company and its direction within a shifting market. Computers do not possess such a view.
The Role of AI
This is not to say that hiring algorithms should be discarded. But their role within any HR department, says Sterling, needs to be squared with the strategic centrality of deciding whom a company employs. This means two things.
First, hiring managers need to take a careful look at what’s under the hood of the algorithms they have in place. “There are a lot of filters that any given applicant pool has gone through that managers may have no idea about,” she says. “And while algorithms are efficient, they often lose nuance that may have been present 10 years ago when AI was not as prevalent.” Consider, again, the sales candidate who excels at improv.
Second, after determining whether these filters need to be adjusted, managers should think about the concrete value of their hiring algorithm. Yes, it sorts résumés quickly. But what else does it do? And what does it not do? They should then fit these insights into broader consideration of the company and its strategic trajectory. How might a blind algorithm support or hinder this movement?
“I would love managers to have the sense that they’re held accountable for what algorithms are doing,” Sterling says. “They should, at the very least, understand that this is a responsibility of theirs.”

Titled Memories of Passersby I, Mario Klingemann’s groundbreaking installation comprises a wooden console table which hosts an AI computer ‘brain’, and two framed screens upon which the machine’s output – disquieting portraits of imagined masculine and feminine faces – blur hypnotically into focus. Differing from the finalised human-curated products of AI which have previously been exhibited or sold at auction, this is the first complete AI model, and only the second ‘AI artwork’, ever to appear on the market.

A remarkable technological feat, the interminable flow of images presented does not follow a predefined choreography, but is instead the result of the AI interpreting its own unique output in real-time; the machine contains all the algorithms that enable it to generate a new and never-repeating combination of portraits for as long as it is running.



The autonomous AI computer ‘brain’ consists of a system of neural networks very similar to those of the human brain. The neural network is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurones) which cannot be programmed to perform a specific task, but instead learn by example.
Neurography
Klingemann has been exploring the potential of what he calls “neurography” for many years. Many of his recent creations have been made with a technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs) which place two algorithms in competition with one another.
On one side of the algorithm is the Generator, which makes a new image based on photographs of portraits from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. On the other side is The Discriminator, which tries to spot the difference between the human-made image and images created by the Generator. The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real.
Portrait of a Man 3 – image © Sotheby’s/Mario Klingemann
There are three editions of the work and two artist’s proofs, but as each edition is constantly working to envisage unique portraits, no two will ever be the same.



Having previously drawn comparisons to the work of Francis Bacon, the conjured faces have been influenced by portraits from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, as well as by Klingemann’s own penchant for surrealist works by figures including Max Ernst. Describing the work, the artist explains:
“Memories of Passersby I houses a very powerful machine which creates paintings while you look at them, which I think is quite magical. Neural networks are involved, and you could say that they are the brushes that I’ve learned to use. The machine is in a cycle where it continuously creates new faces that start changing and fading away – it observes itself and creates a feedback loop. Of course, it’s hard for me let it out into the world without me by its side, but I trust that it’s ready to keep creating new portraits forever, as I always hoped it would do. I hope that when people sit and watch these fleeting faces pass by, they will get the same feeling I do”.
Portrait of a Woman 4 – image © Sotheby’s/Mario Klingemann
Marina Ruiz Colomer, Contemporary Art Specialist and Head of Sotheby’s Contemporary Art Day Auction, says:
“In seeking to subvert more traditional processes of creation, Klingemann’s work presents a truly amazing opportunity to watch an AI brain think in real time, as the machine creates brand new portraits pixel by pixel. To offer a cutting edge piece of technology such as this, which has the power to generate haunting portraits reminiscent of past Masters, is truly unprecedented. It is the nature of Contemporary Art to push boundaries – boundaries which have been, and will continue to be, redefined for centuries. AI art is the latest innovation winning its place in art history books, and Klingemann’s work stands on the precipice of an exciting new era in our field.”
Memories of Passersby I will be part of the Contemporary Art Day Auction on 6th March 2019, and carries an estimate of £30,000-40,000.

From major advancements in medicine to transforming the way business is conducted, machine learning shows great potential to improve the quality of our lives in a variety of ways. A behind-the-scenes look into different companies’ AI ventures shows that certain aspects of machine learning even aid in making the world a safer place.Manufacturing problems can have serious negative impacts on a business. From cars to home appliances, product safety is of utmost importance when it comes to customer satisfaction. Products that cause safety concerns as a result of poor manufacturing or maintenance can lead to extremely negative publicity, and even cost a company millions in lawsuits and legal issues.It is a manufacturer’s legal duty to sell products that are not defective, and the United States has laws in place to protect consumers from negligent manufacturing. The Levin Firm states that products can be defective in three primary ways: defective design, defective assembly, or failure to warn. If any of these cause serious injury to a consumer, the manufacturer can be found negligent and will likely be deemed responsible for any losses the victim incurs.Top 4 Most Popular Ai Articles:1. Are you using the term ‘AI’ incorrectly?2. Six AI Subscriptions to keep you Informed3. TOP 100 medium articles related with Artificial Intelligence4. Making a Simple Neural NetworkImproving Product SafetyThe many advancements in AI are proving useful to reduce manufacturing negligence, and produce safer products for consumers.Automobile manufacturers are also using analytics for indicators to improve vehicle safety. As stated by Amit Saha, Watson Solution Architect for IBM, “Auto manufacturers can now isolate and pinpoint the cause of safety issues through data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through basic out-of-the-box analysis tools.” This data is publicly available, and data-driven approaches can lead to “faster issue detection, problem resolution, competitive advantages, and improved product design.”In the energy sector too, AI is making waves when it comes to improving safety. According to the Forbes article referenced above, Global energy leader BP is using technology to drive new levels of performance, as well as improve the safety and reliability of oil and gas production and refining: “From sensors that relay the conditions at each site to using AI technology to improve operations, BP puts data at the fingertips of engineers, scientists and decision-makers to help drive high performance.”Predictive MaintenanceManufacturing and ongoing maintenance is a huge expense for companies. These expenses have a critical impact on the bottom line for any asset-reliant production process. As quoted from an article on CIO, “studies show that unplanned downtime costs manufacturers an estimated $50 billion annually, and that asset failure is the cause of 42 percent of this unplanned downtime.”Fortunately, AI technology can lower these costs. AI makes “predictive maintenance” of products very possible. Predictive maintenance uses AI to form predictions about asset malfunction. this allows for reductions in unplanned downtime, and more importantly, extends the remaining useful life of production machines and equipment. Subsequently, companies are able to manufacture safer and longer-lasting final products.One such example is Volvo’s use of AI, as stated in a Forbes article. They use data generated by its cars to predict when parts will fail or when a certain vehicle needs servicing. Volvo also is able to monitor vehicle performance during hazardous conditions. In this way, the company has maintained an impressive safety record.AI-Assisted Product Marketing & DesignFrom a product’s inception to the way it is marketed, AI tools can be used to streamline processes and improve both company efficiency and customer satisfaction. Pepperdine University explains how automation changes the focus of marketing efforts: “Creative work, personal communication, and delivering value to customers through content will take greater importance as automation increases in functional ability.”Because marketers are free to focus on creating genuine connections with consumers, personalization (and even hyper-personalization) has begun to play a much larger role in digital marketing. This enables companies to devote more resources to product safety and to tout new safety features in their marketing efforts.AI also allows for products are also able to be designed better. Designers and engineers to to input detailed briefs that include restrictions, material parameters, available production methods, budget limitations, and many other variables into an AI algorithm. The algorithm then explores every possible permutation before suggesting the best and most viable solution based on the brief details.To gain even more insight, the proposed solutions can be tested to determine which design works best. Through a process of repetition, the use of AI algorithms in design ensures that an optimal product design solution is reached, reducing the likelihood of unexpected safety issues cropping up at a later time.Transforming Customer ServiceLast but not least, the role AI plays in customer service also contributes to product safety. One of the most widespread uses of AI is in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants. In fact, AI excels at meeting a customer’s needs both efficiently and accurately. Virtual assistants can mimic our brain’s cognitive functions — especially those that deal with learning and solving problems.Experts at HelpOnClick write, “This allows virtual assistants to categorize information and narrow down correct answers for each customer query.” Virtual assistants and live chat capabilities have made it possible to greatly scale up customer service and produce honest consumer insights. This means, that as a consumer, one is able to lodge a complaint, give feedback, or point out a safety issue at any time from anywhere in the world.Unlike humans who are limited by work hours and time zones, virtual assistants and live chats can provide assistance 24/7, ensuring that a consumer is well attended to. If used properly and in conjunction with maintenance processes, the data gained from virtual assistants allows for consumer-realized safety concerns to be promptly addressed and subsequently prevented in future production.Unfortunately, even with all it’s benefits, AI is often misunderstood. There are many skeptics and cynics out there who believe that AI is just a fad or, even worse, out to completely replace humans. On the contrary, AI has the potential to augment current human processes and thus improve our livelihood. As evidenced from the examples above, by fully and correctly embracing AI into our lives, we can surely make the world a safer place.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",,https://becominghuman.ai/how-ai-can-improve-product-safety-820d391775d3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-02-08T14:35:41.471Z,,,,,,['Noah Rue'],,,,,,,,820d391775d3,,,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) in business is rapidly becoming a commonly-used competitive tool. Clearly, companies are past debating the pros and cons of AI. From better chatbots for customer service to data analytics to making predictive recommendations, deep learning and artificial intelligence in their many forms is seen by business leaders as an essential tool.
That puts AI in the short-list of technologies that your company should not just be watching, but actively exploring how to take advantage of. It joins leading emerging technologies like Machine Learning, cloud computing and Big Data.
If you aren’t convinced that AI is ready to handle a growing number and range of tasks, consider IBM’s Watson’s 2011 winning performance on Jeopardy. Or consider the various ways you are likely already using AI-enabled devices and services in your personal life, like smart assistant apps or devices like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri. Not to mention other AI-supercharged apps, such as whatever GPS app you use while driving.
Here’s a quick look at how your competitors are already using AI in their business, and some advice on how to get on board.

Results of a recent survey indicate that artificial intelligence can assist businesses in areas ranging from customer support to personalization.
 Examine How Your Competitors are Using AI
Odds are you can’t just call up your competitors and ask how they are using AI in their company. But thanks to the Internet, you can find out a lot of what they have said. For example, web-searching “how is Staples using AI” yields informative results from about how that company is putting artificial intelligence technology to work for itself.
Next, check your competitors’ web sites and social media presences (notably LinkedIn and Facebook). Browse their press releases, news coverage, and blogs. You might even go old-school, and get any hardcopy newsletters, annual reports or other literature from the past year that might not be available online.
Then cast a wider net, with an industry search, like “how are hospitals using AI,” “how are grocery stores using AI,” or even a more general search.
For example, when I did a search for “using AI in my business,” I got various hits talking about  business uses for AI including:

Improve customer decision management


Improve QA for software and manufacturing


Write code


Read medical imaging such as head CT scans.

Another suggestion: research how other parts of your supply chain – parts, shipping, support, and the like – are using AI.
Don’t forget other IRL (In Real Life)/non-digital avenues. If you are going to an industry event, look for AI-related sessions. Chat up whoever you’re standing or sitting near. And, of course, you could always read a book or two – although, by definition, that advice will be at least six to twelve months out of date.
If you know anybody at one or more competitors who’s informed and amenable, buy them a lunch and pick their brain.

Businesses have high hopes that AI can help them predict a wide array of activities. 
 Decide what AI Can Do for Your Business
Based on your research, you should be able to build a list and frame a sense of what AI can do for businesses in general, and for companies in your industry and of your size.
You’ll find several major key areas:

Types of AI technology, like machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and cognitive computing. Understanding what these are and the different types of data and tasks each is good for should help you get a better grasp on AI, and understand the requirements and limits of various goals.


What kinds of processing AI can do used for, such as image and speech recognition, predictive analytics. This will help give you a general sense of what AI is being put to use for, not just by businesses, but also government, education, science and other researchers, and others.


Use Cases: what specific tasks these capabilities can help with, such as smart agents (for phone, chatbots, and more), optimizing inventory orders, anticipating machine or system failures, identifying computer threats, spotting fraudulent customer activity.

Based on this list, your next step is to come up with a short list of how artificial intelligence can help your business – specific tasks and use cases.
To help make this list:

Decide what kinds of benefits you are looking for – improved employee productivity? faster workflow? improved product productivity? Reducing costs?


Target time frame.

Then, prioritize that list based on a mix of estimated costs, time to implement, risk/benefit, and overall value.
In parallel, select one or two smaller tasks for trying artificial intelligence for your business. This could be a small piece of a larger task. Important: start with a task that is not business-critical. Another quick tip: Start with tasks that aren’t customer-facing.
 Search for and Compare Vendors
Now it’s time to identify potential technology vendors. There is no shortage of top artificial intelligence companies.
In order to find and compare vendors, you first have to assess how you might add artificial intelligence capabilities to your company’s IT, which in turn depends on factors like:

Size and depth of your IT staff (and budget). Do you already have any AI expertise in-house? Are there developers (along with QA and Ops) who can add AI chops? Does your IT staff have the time and resources to add AI to your existing business IT? To research, propose, and develop new AI-based business initiatives?


Do any of your IT providers offer AI extensions, modules, tools, features, etc.

Vendors for AI capabilities spans several categories:

Vendors that have added AI capabilities to their offerings. This includes everyone from Amazon, Apple and Google to IBM, Intel, and SalesForce, so you’ll need to decide whether you are planning to do this with hardware you own/buy, or cloud resources (or both).


Vendors of specific AI capabilities, accessed through APIs or other methods.

For some of the AI you’re looking for, your current vendors may already offer. In other cases, you may outsource. For still others, you may end up doing internally. It all depends on what you want, how much developer bandwidth you have in-house, and how you provision your IT operations.
Your best bet will be to find one or more AI experts, either internally, or outside consultants. For the latter, start with ones who aren’t part of a vendor… unless the vendor is offering AI that is a match for your criteria.
 Implement the AI Project
Once you have identified your initial AI projects the real fun begins: implementation. Essential milestones:

First, you need to put together a plan, stating the specific and general goals, milestones scheduling, estimated hard and soft costs, and the resources needed, including people skills, hardware and software.


Identify who will be impacted, including existing resources, suppliers, users/customers. Be aware of who should benefit, along with including possible negative impact during implementation.


Set goals for the project’s benefits. This includes determining how to measure results, and, if possible, how to A/B compare the AI-enabled approach and the prior methodologies.


Don’t forget to include talking to the stakeholders, including users/customers. Ask their thoughts, preferences and suggestions, along with plans for training documents and sessions as the trials and operational versions become ready.

Key: Be ready to revisit constantly.
Just because you have AI projects out of development and testing, and contributing to your business, that doesn’t mean you’re done. Just as provisioning infrastructure or updating your company’s web and social presence is never done.
In addition to tracking your selected AI vendors for improvements, new features you want to stay on top of other AI developments. For example, what new capabilities have become available? What improvements in infrastructure performance or price make existing or new AI offerings now viable?
And, of course, you want to keep up with what others in your industry, and the AI vendors serving your industry, are doing or have on their road map.
 Challenges and Pitfalls to Avoid
Adding AI your company’s operations and business is a big change, and likely a big transformation. Here’s some quick advice to lessen the challenges:

Understand how the AI you’re buying works. What are its strengths? Weaknesses?


What kind of IT environment does the AI require? More RAM? Newer hardware-level virtualization? Different memory or I/O, like moving to NVMe, or hyperconverged infrastructure?


Are you feeding your AI apps too much data? Too little? The wrong data? Are you asking them the right questions?


Look for AI tools that will give clear, actionable alerts or other results, rather than endless pages of mostly-unimportant findings.

Plus, focus on AI that’s available as a supported product/service, rather than something still in development.
 Future Trends to Watch
Although AI as an area within computer science dates back to the 1950’s, it’s only been within the past decade that many types of AI have become available to companies of all sizes.
This is thanks to factors like continuing hardware price/performance improvements, cloud computing, and advances in AI techniques. At the same time, computing trends like big data, IoT, self-driving vehicles, and speech and image recognition are generating more “targets” to point AI tools at.
In particular, Keep an eye on cloud costs and capabilities, along with what the various players are doing or talking about, AI-wise. Like nearly everything involving computer technology, many of the next cool capabilities can’t be anticipated or predicted. Bottom line: talk to professionals in your field – nothing will help you quite as much.

Artificial Intelligence – Navigating the IP challenges















By Richard Vary & Jane Mutimear Partners, UK




Share































Although artificial intelligence (AI) can sound like the stuff of science fiction, we are already interacting with AI-based systems on a daily basis. Voice assistants, purchase prediction, fraud detection, chatbots and a whole host of other applications already implement a number of techniques that fall under the umbrella term “AI”.
Enabled by the convergence of big data, enhanced statistical and pattern recognition techniques, and cheap, readily available processing power, the adoption of AI- based solutions is set to increase rapidly. Business process automation and service personalisation, in particular, are set to be growth areas in the short term, with applications involving interaction with the physical world, such as autonomous driving, coming on stream in the medium to long term.
While each AI discipline is different in its speciﬁc implementation, a number of themes that are common to many modern AI systems give rise to particular intellectual property (IP) questions:





By replicating aspects of human cognition, AI systems have the potential to engage in acts of content creation.
Many AI systems, especially those using supervised machine-learning techniques, undergo a training process in which they develop their own decision-making algorithms and rules by practicing decision making and using feedback to try and improve future decisions.
Training AI systems often requires large volumes of training data to ensure that the system develops its decision-making algorithms based on data that reﬂects the full range of scenarios that it might encounter when operating in the real world.
AI systems are often used to sift through large volumes of input data to detect statistical features or patterns.

This article considers the IP issues arising from each of these four themes and how these issues are likely to arise in the context of developing and using AI systems, in particular:

IP issues that need to be addressed contractually.
Underlying ownership issues.
Dealing with content created by an AI system.
Patenting inventions where the original idea was generated by an AI system.
Infringement issues.

CONTRACTUAL ISSUES
While some areas of AI research attempt to build bespoke hardware to replicate human brain function, most of today’s AI systems are implemented as software running on off- the-shelf computer hardware; that is, using general purpose central processing units or, increasingly, graphics processing units. The IP rights in AI systems will therefore be those that arise in the context of developing other types of software.
Commercial agreements to develop AI systems will also need to take account of all the usual issues associated with developing software. This will include ownership and licensing of: any background or pre-existing IP that is incorporated into the system; and rights arising in elements of the system that are developed as part of the project (known as foreground IP). Development agreements will also need to cover any indemnities relating to infringement of third-party IP rights by the AI system (see “IP infringement” below).
Collaborative model
The current state of the market for AI systems will make a number of these general IP issues particularly acute. For example, AI developers often need access to relevant training data in order to develop their solutions and bring them to market. Rather than pay to license the training data from a third party, a common approach is for an AI supplier to collaborate with an organisation that holds the type of data which the AI supplier needs. In return, the organisation will get access to the developed AI solution.
However, the AI supplier will also want to offer the solution to others and could be hindered if that organisation obtains rights in the IP that is developed as part of the collaboration, or if the organisation’s background IP is incorporated as part of the ﬁnished product. In this situation, the ownership and licensing of IP rights in the system will be of particular importance.
Use of customer data
Another common model for the deployment of AI systems is for a seller to supply an underlying technology platform that is trained using a customer’s data to provide a system which is speciﬁcally adapted to the customer’s business. This training process will result in a set of customer-speciﬁc analytics that will work together with the seller’s underlying AI platform.
This gives rise to an important question regarding the ownership of IP rights in the customer-speciﬁc analytics. For example, some AI-based cybersecurity systems detect network intrusions by comparing current network trafﬁc with the customer’s baseline network trafﬁc. Questions may arise as to who owns any copyright, database right or other IP rights in this baseline data.
This issue would most likely come to the fore if the customer wanted to switch supplier and take with it the analytics generated by the original AI solution. The contractual wording in the original service agreement regarding IP ownership would come under close scrutiny as both parties look to see whether the original supplier can prevent the customer re-using the analytics with another supplier’s solution.
There are obviously conﬂicting interests here: it will be in a seller’s interest to lock the customer in to its AI platform whereas the customer will want the freedom to move its analytics to other sellers. The party that will prevail when negotiating these terms in AI service agreements will depend on the parties’ bargaining power. At present, the number of well-established AI service providers is relatively small but, as the market matures, customers may increasingly demand the right to move their analytics between different AI service providers in much the same way that they need to move their data from one database provider to another.
UNDERLYING OWNERSHIP
Contractual IP issues could potentially arise in any scenario where a general purpose AI system is developed by one entity and subsequently adapted by a second entity for a speciﬁc purpose by training. The key issue will be whether the ﬁrst or the second entity owns the IP rights in the resulting trained system. Underlying this is a potentially far- reaching question regarding the interaction between the way in which AI systems are developed and the ownership of IP rights in those systems.
Copyright
Traditional software implements logic that has been designed by a human author. This logic is embodied either in source code or in some other data structure that can be interrogated by the software during operation in order to determine the particular course of action that the system should take in response to a given set of inputs.
Ownership of the copyright in source code or other data structures is deﬁned by reference to their human author, but a fundamental feature of many AI systems is that the underlying logic is developed by the system itself as a result of a training process. Under current law it is not possible for the AI to be considered the author of this work. This gives rise to a number of challenges in establishing both the authorship and the subsistence of copyright in the code or data structure that arises as a result of the training process.
Authorship. The ﬁrst question in determining copyright is whether there is a human author of the work. This will depend on the particular implementation of the AI training process and the level of human involvement in the creation of the work in which the system’s logic resides. At one end of the spectrum it is clear that a human using a computerised tool, such as text editing software, to implement their design for the logic that the system should use will be considered to be the author of the work in which the logic resides. At the other end of the spectrum, a human who simply provides training data to an AI system and presses “go” is unlikely to be considered the author of any work in which the logic generated by the AI system resides.
Most cases are likely to lie somewhere in between, with a human providing some additional input to the training process that helps the AI to create its logic. For example, many AI development tools, such as TensorFlow, allow developers to review and edit various aspects of an AI system as it progresses through a training process.
Computer-generated works. If no human author can be identiﬁed for the work, the second issue (under English law) will be to identify who made the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work, as that person will be considered the author of the work (section 9(3), Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) (section 9(3)). This could be a difﬁcult question if there are competing claims between the designer of the learning algorithm and the person who put the algorithm through a training process in order to create the trained system.
The designer of the learning algorithm might try to rely on Nova Productions Ltd v Mazooma Games Ltd where the Court of Appeal held that a person playing a computer game was not the author of screenshots taken while playing the game and had not undertaken any of the arrangements necessary for the creation of the images ([2007] EWCA Civ 219; www.practicallaw.com/7-314-1956). Instead, the court held that the persons who made the arrangements necessary for the creation of the screenshots were the game’s developers.
The person training the AI system would want to distinguish Nova Productions and argue that the training process either involved the use of their skill and labour so that they should be considered the author, or that they had undertaken the arrangements necessary for the creation of work.
Relevance of authorship. The question of authorship cannot be altered by agreement as it is a matter of status and fact, although it is possible for parties developing AI systems to agree who will be the owner of any copyright that resides in the work in which the trained AI’s logic resides. However, authorship remains relevant for two reasons:

The duration of copyright in works with a human author is determined with reference to that person’s lifetime, but the duration of copyright in computer- generated works under section 9(3) is deﬁned with reference to the calendar year in which the work is created and will always be shorter than human-authored works.
The provision under section 9(3) is speciﬁc to the UK and has an equivalent in only a very few other jurisdictions, such as Ireland and New Zealand. There may, therefore, be circumstances in which the work representing the logic of a trained AI system attracts copyright protection in the UK but not in other jurisdictions.

Computer programs. There is an underlying question as to whether the work in which trained AI’s logic resides is capable of beneﬁting from copyright protection at all. In the UK, computer programs are protected as original literary works to the extent that skill, judgment and labour have gone into devising the form of expression of the program. At an EU level, the Software Directive (2009/24/ EC) requires that EU member states protect a computer program if it is original in the sense that it is the author’s own intellectual creation.
It may therefore be possible to argue in some circumstances that a computer program generated as a result of an AI system being trained does not meet the originality requirement because the form in which the program is expressed does not represent a human author’s skill, judgment and labour.
Databases. An equivalent argument may also be possible in relation to copyright in a database generated through the process of training an AI system, which will only be considered original if the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database constitutes the author’s own intellectual creation. It may be possible to point to aspects of human skill, judgment and labour in the development of the underlying AI training algorithm or the training process itself, but the difﬁculty will be identifying the causal link between these activities and the form of expression of the program that the AI generates or the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database.
Patents
There are challenges with patenting AI systems and platforms but, despite these, many AI-related patents have been granted (see box “Growth in AI-related patent applications”).

Patentable subject matter. An AI system is often, at a very high level, mimicking a human task. For example, Microsoft’s InnerEye project is an AI system that helps oncologists target cancer treatment more quickly. It does this by using machine-learning techniques to analyse magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients and delineate tumours from surrounding healthy tissue and bone, a task that had previously, and laboriously, been completed by the oncologist drawing contours on 3D images by hand.
If, at this level of speciﬁcity, a patent was to be applied for this type of invention, it would be refused because at least one of the fundamental requirements for patentability is not met; that is, there is no description of how the invention works. It is, effectively, a black box and would be considered insufﬁcient as not containing an enabling disclosure; that is, the patent does not teach the ordinary skilled person how to perform the claimed invention (see “Black boxes” below for further discussion on IP infringement).
This problem is avoided if, instead of claiming the high-level idea of applying AI to the 3D delineation task, the algorithms, source code or other description of how an AI system works is disclosed in the patent application. However, this can lead to a further impediment to patenting: a patent cannot be granted for, among other things, mathematical methods, methods for performing a mental act (such as a method of teaching reading), business methods and programs for computers “as such” (section 1(2), Patents Act 1977) (1977 Act) (section 1(2)).
Even before patent applications were being made for AI-related inventions, the exclusions in section 1(2) were a source of controversy, not least because the English courts and the European Patent Ofﬁce (EPO) have applied different approaches, with the English courts being more ready to ﬁnd that this kind of invention is not patentable.
Under English law, an applicant can avoid the exclusion in section 1(2) if it can be shown that the particular apparatus or method claimed in the patent involves a contribution in a technical (that is, non-excluded) ﬁeld. The test for technical contribution was broken down into a four-step test by the Court of Appeal in Aerotel Ltd v Teclco Holdings Ltd and Macrossan’s Application ([2006] EWCA Civ 1371; see News brief “Patenting inventions: the Court of Appeal’s four-step programme”, www.practicallaw.com/5-206-3960). The steps are to:

Properly construe the claim.
Identify the actual contribution.
Ask whether the contribution falls solely within the excluded subject matter.
Check whether the actual or alleged contribution is actually technical in nature.

When considering the computer program exclusion in section 1(2), it can also be helpful to consider the ﬁve signposts originally set out in AT&T Knowledge Ventures/CVON Innovations v Comptroller General of Patents and slightly amended by the Court of Appeal in HTC Europe Co Ltd v Apple Inc ([2009] EWHC 343 (Pat); [2013] EWCA Civ 451, www.practicallaw.com/9-532-4127). The signposts are whether:

The claimed technical effect has a technical effect on a process that is carried on outside the computer.
The claimed technical effect operates at the level of the architecture of the computer; that is, whether the effect is produced irrespective of the data being processed or the applications being run.
The claimed technical effect results in the computer being made to operate in a new way.
The program makes the computer a better computer in the sense of running more efﬁciently and effectively as a computer.
The perceived problem is overcome by the claimed invention as opposed to merely being circumvented.

Palantir’s applications. There are, as yet, no court decisions that consider AI-related inventions. However, the Intellectual Property Ofﬁce (IPO) has had to consider them and its decision in Palantir Technologies Inc gives an insight as to how it handles them (BL O/358/16). Palantir’s three patent applications were refused as they fell within the computer program exclusion in section 1(2).
The hearing ofﬁcer described the invention in the ﬁrst patent application as providing a method for selecting, from a larger dataset, a subset of records that are related to a common entity by using a classiﬁer which produces a matching probability value for each record in the larger dataset. The subset is created from records having a probability value above a set threshold. The invention can identify potentially related records in a dataset whose records do not have well- deﬁned common attributes. The classiﬁer uses a separate exemplar dataset to deﬁne the target entity. The classiﬁer is preferably a machine-learning algorithm and needs to be initially trained on a training dataset.
The classiﬁer (or algorithm) itself was not claimed as inventive, rather, the claimed invention lay in the record matching method. Palantir relied on the fourth signpost in AT&T, stating that the invention made for a better computer because it lowered memory usage by reducing the number of mistaken aggregates of records. But the argument failed because there was no suggestion that the underlying computer was changed. As the hearing ofﬁcer pointed out, since any program uses up resources on a computer, merely selecting a more efﬁcient one cannot, of itself, be a relevant technical effect. Furthermore, none of the other AT&T signposts assisted Palantir: the method was at the application and user level and the records were user data rather than system data. Therefore, the contribution was not technical because it was nothing more than a computer program.
The inventions in Palentir’s second and third patent applications related to methods of comparing every record in a dataset with each of the other records, with the comparison being made only for selected attributes of each record. The claimed methods provide for greater computational throughput and acceptable memory consumption when compared to brute force direct matching which, with extremely large datasets, could exceed available resources. Palantir claimed that both the second and fourth signposts in AT&T were relevant. However, the argument based on the fourth signpost failed for the reasons already given and the argument based on the second signpost failed because the inventions did not operate at the architectural level, although they were able to operate on generic data.
Patent ownership. The key issue in relation to the ownership of a patent is to identify who came up with the inventive concept. Under patent law, that person is entitled to be named as the inventor and is primarily granted ownership of the patent. The inventor is the actual deviser of the invention, which, as noted above, is framed in terms of the technical contribution.
The deviser of the programming logic or algorithms is most likely to be the inventor of any AI-related patent. The programmers may qualify if they have been involved in devising the actual invention, but may not qualify if they have merely been the means for putting it into practice since a non-inventive contribution, such as painting something pink (given as an example in Stanelco Fibre Optics Ltd’s Applications [2004] EWHC 2263) does not qualify that person to be an inventor. Similarly, merely providing training data to an AI system would not qualify someone to be an inventor.
Another issue is whether an AI system could be considered an inventor if, through the training process, it came up with a new way to make the computer a better computer in the sense of running more efﬁciently and effectively as a computer; that is, the fourth signpost in AT&T for gauging whether or not a computer-related invention is patentable. Before deciding this issue, it would have to be assumed that the humans using the AI system realise that an invention has been made and are able to describe it sufﬁciently for the purpose of claiming a patent, which is not a foregone conclusion given the black box nature of AI systems. But if that is assumed, under the current law, it is not possible for the AI itself to be considered the inventor. Inventorship, like authorship, is considered a human activity (see “Inventive AI systems” below).
Furthermore, since there is no deeming provision which mirrors that in section 9(3), there is nothing that provides that the person making the arrangements for the creation of an invention reaps the ownership of the invention that is devised. In practice, therefore, the inventor could be the ﬁrst person to observe and understand the invention but, if this is the case, the devisers of the underlying algorithms should arguably be considered joint inventors.
It could be said, however, that in attributing patents to people who are not the inventors, the real inventor, the AI system, is not being acknowledged. However, the consequence in adopting the position of AI as inventor is that, as the law presently stands, the invention could fall into the public domain.
Given the difﬁculties, it would therefore be sensible to provide for the question of ownership of any AI-related inventions by way of agreement rather than leaving it to the IPO and the courts to resolve the issue (see box “Best practice for contracting to develop AI systems”).
CREATIVE AI SYSTEMS
AI systems have the potential to be involved in acts of content creation that would usually be the sole preserve of a human. The use of certain types of AI systems in content creation has been common for a number of years; for example, text-to-speech word processing programs rely on AI, speech recognition and natural language processing techniques. However, this category of AI system is merely used as a tool to assist a human in content creation and does not give rise to any speciﬁc IP issues.
Challenges arise, however, in the context of AI systems that remove the need for human input in the creation of certain types of content. This is happening already, but the interaction between human and AI contribution to the works vary. At one end of the spectrum, AI systems can be used to detect and extract information from company ﬁnancial reports and generate journalistic content by populating pre-prepared article templates. At the other end, The Next Rembrandt project trained a deep learning algorithm on 346 Rembrandt paintings and asked it to produce a new painting replicating the artist’s style and subject matter (www. nextrembrandt.com/).
In the context of copyright, the issues that arise from AI content creation are the same as those discussed above in the context of elements of AI systems that are generated automatically as a result of an AI training process (see “Copyright” above). These include whether the creation of a work by an AI system involves the exercise of sufﬁcient skill, labour and judgment (under English law) or represent the author’s own intellectual creation (under the case law of the European Court of Justice) so that the output qualiﬁes for copyright protection as an original work. This will depend on who is considered the author of the work and the extent of the author’s input into the creation of the content.
The starting point in this analysis will be that the AI itself is not a sentient being so is unable to exercise skill, labour and judgment or engage in intellectual creation. Therefore, anything that is to contribute to the originality of the work must come from a human. A human simply pressing a button labelled “write me a song” is unlikely to be sufﬁcient, but a human carefully selecting speciﬁc inputs to provide to a trained AI with the intention that it will create a work of a certain nature could be enough to satisfy the originality requirement, even though the creation itself was performed by the AI.
This is perhaps analogous to the famous macaque monkey Naruto taking a selﬁe by pressing the shutter button on a carefully set up camera; any originality in that photograph arose from the skill, labour and judgment that the photographer, David Slater, used when setting up the camera, even though the exact composition and content of the photograph resulted from Naruto’s actions.
Another possible source of originality in AI-generated works could be in the skill, labour and judgement or intellectual creation expended in the process of training the AI to be able to create certain types of content or in building the underlying learning algorithm.
If multiple people have been involved, the authorship of works generated by an AI system could potentially be contentious. Establishing which of the parties can be considered the human author will involve weighing their relative contributions to the creation of the work. In addition, if no author can be found, then consideration will have to be given to whether any of the parties could be considered to have made the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work in order to qualify as the author under section 9(3).

INVENTIVE AI SYSTEMS
The use of AI systems as part of research and development activities adds a layer of complexity to the question of who the inventor is and therefore who should own the resulting patent. For example, suppose A builds an AI system for identifying the best material to use given a series of input parameters relating to a particular engineering context. B takes the system and uses it to search for the best material to use in the design of a tail ﬁn for an unmanned aerial drone. C then looks at the three potential options identiﬁed by the system and decides to ﬁle a patent covering the use of the third material for tail ﬁns in unmanned aerial drones, as C recognises that its use has surprising technical beneﬁts over other candidates. Arguably, it is the evaluation of the candidate material and realising its potential that is inventive and therefore C is the inventor, but would B and possibly A also qualify?
This example, although complex, is similar to ones that have already arisen, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry when using high throughput screening (HTS) of molecules against a target of interest to identify a new drug. Some HTS methods are patented, but the molecules themselves are usually in the public domain. Therefore, the inventions and the patents come out of the anticipated use for the molecule and the inventive step is in evaluating the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, toxicity or speciﬁcity of a molecule and recognising its suitability for use.
The new issue raised by AI is deciding who owns a new idea that the AI has generated. With reference to the example given above, suppose the AI devised a new material for use in the tail ﬁn of an unmanned aerial drone, who would be the inventor? This is not a far-fetched example. Although the ﬁrst versions of an AI system designed to play the board game, Go, were trained using data from actual games, the latest version, AlphaGo Zero, was not given any human data, it was merely given the rules and started playing against itself. Within three days it had surpassed the level of AlphaGo, the version that had, in 2016, beaten world champion Lee Sedol in four out of ﬁve games. DeepMind, AlphaGo’s developer, reported that AlphaGo Zero developed unconventional strategies and creative new moves that echoed and surpassed the novel techniques that AlphaGo had played in the games against Lee Sedol.
If deep neural networks are capable of inventing new moves when playing Go, they are capable of inventing more. If an AI system invents patentable subject matter, who should own it? As noted previously in relation to the training of AI systems, there are no provisions in patent law speciﬁcally addressing this question (see “Patents” above). Inventing is seen as a human endeavour. Section 7 of the 1977 Act refers to the inventor being a person and to ownership vesting primarily in the inventor. Other tests in the 1977 Act reinforce this: a patent is required to be non-obvious to the person skilled in the art and it must be sufﬁciently disclosed to enable the person of ordinary skill in the art to understand the invention.
If an AI system were to be considered an inventor, a number of consequences would follow which would set these rules on their head, including:

Needing to change the rules on ownership and consider at a policy level who should be considered the owner of the AI-invented patent. Candidates include the owner of the software, the programmer, the user, the inventor (if any) of any invention in the AI system, the observer of the new invention and the person who analyses it.
Considering whether the tests of obviousness and insufﬁciency should still be rooted in what the skilled person in the art is taken to think, know and understand. If they are not to be so rooted, and AI is taken to be the judge, there would arguably be no need for the patent system at all; a somewhat fatal conclusion for the patent profession.

IP INFRINGEMENT
Training and using AI systems may infringe third-party IP rights. For example, a system could infringe copyright by using third-party data as part of its training process or as an input to its decision making (see also box “Text and data mining exceptions”).
As an AI system is not a legal person, it cannot incur liability. Liability for IP infringement by an AI system will therefore accrue to the person or entity that controls or directs the actions of the AI. However, one emerging feature of modern AI systems is that they can be given some degree of freedom to determine which data sources are of most use to them or even to seek out new data sources, for example, by searching online.
This gives rise to a potential liability management challenge, as the AI’s discretion could make it difﬁcult to establish in advance whether an AI system is going to infringe a third-party IP right. Equally, it could be difﬁcult to establish retrospectively whether an AI system has infringed a third-party right or in some circumstances whether it or those controlling or directing it had the requisite knowledge to infringe certain rights.
Black boxes
Underlying the potential issues around infringement of IP rights by AI systems is something known in AI circles as the “black box problem”. This problem arises from the fact that the way in which some AI systems store their decision-making algorithms is not in a form that is easily understood by a human. Human-implemented logic in the form of source code is generally set out in a logical fashion and annotated with human readable comments explaining the purpose of each element. This can be compared to the logic developed by an AI neural network which might be represented as a database containing a huge array of weightings for different artiﬁcial neurones.
While a human can easily reverse engineer human source code to work out why a particular decision was taken, an AI neural network is potentially immune to human scrutiny. The fundamental difference between the two is that with human source code it is generally possible to predict how a system will respond to a given input, but the only way to ﬁnd out what will happen with a given input to a neural network is to apply that input to the network and see how it behaves.
A number of institutions, including the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (in a project called Explanable XAI), the University of California, Berkeley and the Georgia Institute of Technology, are working to crack open the black box. But if an AI system cannot explain why it created a particular work, used a method or made a speciﬁc decision, then it may be impossible to decide whether it or those humans associated with it (as users, programmers or owners) are liable. Resolving this question is becoming increasingly urgent, not least because of the issues of liability surrounding self-driving cars.
LOOKING FORWARD
In a policy paper published on 26 April 2018, the government stated that it wanted the UK to be a global leader in the emerging revolution in AI technology (www.gov. uk/government/publications/artificial- intelligence-sector-deal/ai-sector-deal). The paper mentions the need to deﬁne technical standards to allow interoperability between AI systems and to share and use data but is silent on IP issues. Nor were IP issues mentioned in the European Commission’s announcement, published on 25 April 2018, about a series of measures to put AI to use in the EU and boost its competitiveness (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/ en/news/commission-presents-plan-make- most-artiﬁcial-intelligence). It will not be long, however, before there is an urgent need to address them, not least because both the UK and the EU view the creation, protection and exploitation of IP as a key plank to improving competitiveness.

Big companies are now recruiting artificial intelligence employees (Image: GETTY)“It’s very visible that technological sectors are now prioritising the implementation of AI in their everyday workforce.”Nikolas Kairinos, CEO and Founder of Fountech.ai, which specialises in the development and integration of AI solutions to enhance organisations’ products and services, said: “It should come as no surprise that big tech companies are increasing their number of AI-related jobs. “We can see that the companies listed in the research are already using different types of AI-technology to improve the way they engage with their users and customers.”Google’s translation service, for example, uses AI tools such as machine learning and natural language processes to provide real-time translations, he explained.  Related articles    End of cutting the grass chore: Robot lawnmowers SOAR in sales    'Stop them before it's TOO LATE' - Machines could MURDER   SUBSCRIBE  Invalid emailWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A google search, a passport scan, your online shopping history, a tweet. All of these contain data that can be collected, analyzed, and monetized. Supercomputer and algorithms allow us to make sense of an increasingly large amount of information in real time. In less than 10 years, CPUs are expected to reach the processing power of the human brain.With the rise of big data and fast computing power, many CEOs, CTOs, and decision makers of organizations are thinking of ways to innovate their company. When they want to launch a new product or service, they are looking to data analytics for insights on market, demand, the target demographic, etc. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are being adopted into the enterprise at a rapid pace. This trend is only likely to surge upward.Let’s look at some statistics:According to IDC, global spending on AI and cognitive technologies will reach $19.1 billion in 2018, up 54.2 percent compared to a year ago. By 2021, AI and cognitive spending will hit $52.2 billion.AI skills are among the fastest-growing skills on LinkedIn, and saw a 190% increase from 2015 to 2017.When we talk about “AI skills”, we’re referring to the skills needed to create artificial intelligence technologies, which include expertise in areas like neural networks, deep learning, and machine learning, as well as actual “tools” such as Weka and Scikit-Learn.Wanted: Artificial intelligence expertsIn artificial intelligence, job openings are rising faster than job seekers.AI-related jobs include machine learning engineer, predictive modeler, cmt analytics manager, data scientist, computer vision engineer, computational linguist, and information strategy manager. Source: Indeed.comThere’s no slowing down the spread of AI. Tech companies are heavily investing in it, and a PwC report estimates that artificial intelligence could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 — and boost North America’s GDP by 14% that year.Perhaps the most compelling aspect about Machine Learning is its seemingly limitless applicability. There are already so many fields being impacted by ML and now AI, including Education, Finance, and more. Machine Learning techniques are already being applied to critical areas within the Healthcare sphere, impacting everything from care variation reduction efforts to medical scan analysis.What is AI exactly?Artificial intelligence is the general field of “intelligent-seeming algorithms” of which machine learning is the leading frontier at the moment.Our definition changed over time what AI exactly is. We have come a long way from the 1939 Smart Fellow Robot as seen in this footage below.Source: 1939 I AM A SMART FELLOW ROBOT TALKS Stock FootageAI is just a computer that is able to mimic or simulate human thought or behavior. Within that, there’s a subset called machine learning that is now the underpinning of the most exciting part of AI. By allowing computers to learn how to solve problems on their own, machine learning has made a series of breakthroughs that once seemed nearly impossible. It’s the reason that computers can spot a friend’s face in a photo or steer a car. It’s the reason people are actively talking about the arrival of human-like AI.A simplified explanation of AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Source: Suraj Jena, June 10, 2018So, how Does Machine Learning and Data Science Intersect?Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where a class of data-driven algorithms enables software applications to become highly accurate in predicting outcomes without any need for explicit programming.The basic premise here is to develop algorithms that can receive input data and leverage statistical models to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available.The processes involved have a lot in common with predictive modeling and data mining. This is because both approaches demand one to search through the data to identify patterns and adjust the program accordingly.Most of us have experienced machine learning in action in one form or another. If you have shopped on Amazon or watched something on Netflix, those personalized (product or movie) recommendations are machine learning in action.Data science, on the other hand, employs computer science disciplines like mathematics and statistics and incorporates techniques like data mining, cluster analysis, visualization, and — yes — machine learning.So, the main difference between the two is that data science as a broader term not only focusses on algorithms and statistics but also takes care of the entire data processing methodology.Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. While data science is an interdisciplinary field to extract knowledge or insights from dataVENN diagram of AI, Big Data and Data Science Fraunhofer FOKUSExamples of how the field of data science is used in AI technologiesIBM Watson is an AI technology that helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patient’s medical record to provide relevant evidence and explore treatment options. It takes in a patient’s medical records then provides its evident-based and personalized recommendation fueled by information from a curated collection of 300 + journals, 200 textbooks, and 15+ pages of texts which give doctors instant access to a wealth of information personalized to the patient’s treatment plan.Blueberry. This robot can perform improv comedy after being fed subtitles from hundreds of thousands of movies. Kory Mathewson, an artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, created an algorithm designed to riff with him onstage. He trained it to create lines of dialogue to be used in an improv performance by rewarding it when the dialogue makes sense and punishing it when it spits out gibberish.While Blueberry will not be auditioning at The Second City anytime soon, this adorable robot does occasionally hit the right note with funny lines. I’ll end this showing a short clip of Blueberry in action.Kory Mathewson, inventor of Blueberry.

Thispersondoesnotexist.com is Artificial Intelligence at its eeriest







Saima Jiwani

Artificial intelligence and machine learning need no introduction in today’s modern era with technology getting smarter every day. 

NVidia is one such company that is using deep learning profoundly and is praised for boasting impressive graphics cards. In fact, a few months back the tech giant revealed a new generative adversarial network (GAN) the company had developed that indicated the power of deep learning. 

However, this was more than a year ago and today, the technology has advanced to such an extinct that you can even use it on your phone. 

Take for example their website, “thispersondoesnotexist.com.” the website has the capabilities of conjuring up an image using the GAN algorithm. 

The GAN works by splitting the task of AI in separate parts. One set of algorithms generates an image while the other determines if the image appears to be real or fake. In case the face seems illegitimate, the algorithm starts over. Once the judging algorithm accepts the image, the AI developer checks the results and fixes any algorithm issue if the image doesn’t seem appropriate.

GAN is the brainchild of Google’s Ian Goodfellow. However, NVidia is doing a great job of perfecting the technology. Check out their recent work on the cutting-edge technology here.

Published: Feb 16, 2019 10:51 PM ESTJohn Loeffler5 years ago0Share1, 2If you’ve been paying attention to the news at all, you would think that the coming artificial intelligence revolution was a foregone conclusion, but many of these pronouncements tend to give a cursory acknowledgment of the ethics of artificial intelligence as if these are simply academic exercises that have no real bearing on the development of AI.
Those on the cutting edge of AI development know better. Autonomous vehicle makers are carefully managing the roll-out of autonomous vehicles knowing full well that a hasty introduction of these systems could lead to a public backlash that can shut the whole thing down. If you have any doubt about that, look no further than the debate around embryonic stem cells research in the United States for a recent example of political consideration trumping science.

So what are the controversies surrounding the ethics of artificial intelligence? Several of the major ethical frameworks, such as the Utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and Thomas Hobbes’ Social Contract Theory, have some important things to say about the development of artificial intelligence. And—like all good philosophy—there are no easy answers. 
The Greatest Good For the Greatest Number
Source: Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons
In 1789, the British philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham published An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, one of the most important works of philosophy written since Aristotle.
In it, Bentham laid out the principle of utility, which argues that good is defined as what is pleasurable and that bad is defined by what is painful; and that what is most ethical is delivering the greatest good for the most number of people or preventing the greatest harm to the greatest number.
This is a very common argument employed in favor of artificial intelligence. Autonomous vehicles, it’s often pointed out, have the potential to prevent a million traffic fatalities every year by eliminating the human driver from the equation—whose error is nearly always the reason for the accident.

This comes at the cost of millions of transportation jobs around the world that will be lost as truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others are replaced by AI systems, many of whom will find it difficult if not impossible to retrain for other jobs, causing widespread hardship throughout society.
Likewise, in manufacturing, millions of jobs have been replaced by automation already and that number will only increase as AIs are able to perform more sophisticated tasks at a vastly reduced cost to the manufacturer.

This will invariably lead to lower prices for consumer products for everyone in society but at the cost of depressed wages that may not correlate to the decrease in prices; there’s no guarantee that the lower wages will be able to purchase the same standard of living as before.
In both these cases—as with many others where artificial intelligence is involved—, trying to identify the greatest good is a thorny issue, but one that everyone ought to have their input heard. That, however, isn’t always the case.
What is the Social Contract?
Source: Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons
One of the most famous works of political and moral philosophy is Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan, where the British political theorist explores how societies coalesced out of what he famously termed “the state of nature.”
The state of nature, according to Hobbes, is man against all—every man or woman was entirely responsible for their own lives in their entirety and had to fight against every other person in a struggle for basic survival.
[see-also]
Every person had to be the carpenter who built their shelter, the farmer who grew their food, and the warrior who protected it all from the next person down the trail who would kill you and take everything from you so that they could survive instead.
Famously, Hobbes described life in the state of nature as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”
In response to this reality, Hobbes says, societies formed where mankind cooperated instead of competed. The farmer grew the food for the community and fed the carpenter who built his own shelter as well as the shelter for the farmer and the warrior, who protected all three of them. 
In this way, known as the Social Contract, humanity was able to develop specialized skills and advance technologically, and socially evolve beyond mere animals. 
Does AI Breach the Social Contract?
What if someone abuses this arrangement? What if someone has his home built and his food grown for him, but instead uses his skills not to help his community, but to enrich himself at the community’s expense? 
Without the work of the broader community to enable a safe environment for the researchers at Caltech and Google to build their AI systems, these systems would not be possible. Mark Zuckerberg could not have founded Facebook if he had to work in the fields to grow his food or if he had to personally secure Facebook’s campus every night from roving bands of marauders. 
If the developers of these AI systems turn around and introduce systems that make the contributions of the rest of society redundant—who needs a truck driver when an autonomous vehicle can do the same work and never complain about work hours or wages—, there is a very real danger that those put out of work will sense that the social contract has been egregiously breached and their reaction [PDF] can be very destabilizing.

History has no shortage of leaders who underestimated the wrath of an angry populace and lost centuries-old empires as a consequence. It isn’t enough to call an enraged mob of administrators an uneducated bunch of Luddites while they smash up your sophisticated quantum computer that has put them all out of work. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

You could be 100% correct but you will still have your qubits destroyed—if you’re lucky.
Many of our leaders recognize this, which is why some of the biggest proponents of a Universal Basic Income are in the tech industry. It remains to be seen whether the politics of such programs can be ironed out before sophisticated AIs force the issue into a crisis point, or even that such a system would be effective.
We Can Have an Ethical AI Society

While there are pitfalls, there are also the End of Work for centuries now. 
If preventing the greatest harm is a moral imperative, and we can end the suffering brought on by compulsory labor on pain of starvation than this is a definite social good that must be pursued, but only if we approach the coming revolution in AI ethically. Otherwise, Thomas Hobbes has a lot to say about the alternative.

BEIJING - Would you enjoy a truly unique hotpot experience? If so, you could be warmly served by robots.
A famous hotpot chain has gained even more popularity since it opened its intelligent restaurant in downtown Beijing in October 2018. Patrons eager to visit the establishment often have to wait an average of two hours to get a seat.
There are 18 automatic ""machine arms"" that constantly work in an intelligent dish sorting room that is between 0 and 4 degrees Centigrade. They are capable of processing up to 8,000 dishes each day. Windows allow guests across the 93-table dining hall to see the operation from start to finish.
The flavor of the hotpot is one of the most important factors. Customers can choose from six levels of spiciness, and flavor consultants help advise when patrons face the dilemma of choosing between moderately spicy and eye-watering, extremely spicy hotpot. Once the decision is made, the broth is seasoned by the automatic flavoring machine.
Within 10 minutes after customers place their orders on iPads, six dish dispatching robots carry the meat and vegetables to the dining tables by tag location technology.
Each dish-dispatching robot can operate for an entire day after being charged for one night.
""The operation of our restaurant is helped by two intelligent systems,"" said Zhang Jinshan, technical trainer of the restaurant. ""One accurately copes with customers' canceled, added and urgent orders, analyzes the data of the restaurant, monitors the operation condition of the equipment, provides maintenance of the software and checks the food inventory and expiry date.""
The other is an energy management system, which calculates and analyzes the energy consumption including water, electricity and fuel gas of the restaurant, Zhang added.
The intelligent hotpot restaurant is not alone. China's e-commerce giant JD opened its smart Xcafe restaurant in Tianjin in November 2018.
The 400-square-meter dining hall can hold 100 people. Ordering, assembling, cooking, dispatching, dining and checking out are all facilitated by robots and an artificial intelligence system. In the kitchen, one person operates five robots.
As of now, there are a total of 40 courses available at the restaurant.

Automation or AI will replace these jobs, if they haven't already.Non-routine jobs which need human problem solving, creativity, adaptability, flexibility, physical dexterity, and communication skills will be the jobs of the future.So will jobs requiring physical proximity and interpersonal skills. Examples include engineering, design, construction, education, health services and care work.The economy is undergoing an industry restructuring in response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.This is the name given to a combination of technological mega-trends happening all at the same time (for example, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, digital disruption and so on).Significant economic, demographic and social shifts are happening at the same time.As this change happens, the prospect of polarisation of the workforce is a looming concern for young people.""Polarisation"" is the hollowing out of the labour market: a decline in the share of mid-level skilled jobs considered ""entry level"" for young Australians.This will mean reduced opportunities for young people to enter the workforce, and limited opportunities for upward career progression from lower-skilled jobs.Which industries show growth?The Australian economy has shifted from one that produces goods to one that services people. Almost 80 per cent of the workforce is employed in the services industries.Anticipating the rise of the machineIt seems only a matter of time before intelligence breaks free of its biological bonds - Joe Gelonesi talks to two philosophers with profoundly different visions of technology and the future.Read moreThe Department of Jobs and Small Business projects that over the five years to May 2023, employment will increase in 17 of the 19 broad industry sectors in Australia. And it will decline in two: agriculture, forestry and fishing; and wholesale trade.Almost two-thirds of employment growth is projected to be in four sectors: health care and social assistance; construction; education and training; and professional, scientific and technical services. Jobs will exist for people with the skills to fill those jobs.New jobs are projected to be created across a range of occupations. Aged and disabled care, registered nursing, child care, software and applications programming, and waiting are the top five areas of growth.But employment in five broad occupation groups is also projected to decline: personal assistants and secretaries, office managers and program administrators, machine and stationary plant operators, farmers and farm managers, and clerical and office support workers are likely to be replaced by automation or AI.Skills young people can learn nowAchieving a university degree no longer automatically means a graduate will get immediate and meaningful employment.The youth unemployment rate for graduates is increasing at a greater rate than for those without a tertiary qualification. According to the Foundation for Young Australians, it now takes an average 4.7 years for a person to transition from full-time education to full-time employment.Research from the Foundation for Young Australians found there were four key factors which could accelerate the transition from education to full-time work:an education that builds transferrable skills such as problem solving, communication and team workbeing able to undertake relevant paid work experiencefinding employment in a sector that is growingan optimistic mindsetEmployers of technical and trade workers still place the most emphasis on job-specific skills, but across all jobs employability skills are the most important.Get ready for the AI raceFrom truckies to lawyers and doctors, artificial intelligence will change every job and profession. Read all of Lateline's coverage of the AI race.Read moreEmployers look for communication skills above all other skills, followed by organisational skills, writing, planning and detail orientation, team work and problem solving.Young people will need to make sure they also have transferrable skills such as digital literacy, critical thinking and creativity.The NSW Government challenged a group of researchers to identify what today's kindergarteners would need to survive and thrive in the 21st century.The report said developing deep knowledge and specialist expertise over time was critical.Employability skills such as problem solving and critical thinking are considered generic, and are likely to also be job specific and not necessarily transferrable.For example, problem-solving skills will be very different for a mining engineer to those required by a kindergarten teacher. These ""generic skills"" need to be learned in context.The Australian Industry Skills Committee has also developed a practical resource that describes the mega-trends impacting Australia's economy and society, scenarios for the future and the impact on work and skills.It may benefit parents, teachers, policymakers and even forward-thinking teens to read about these trends.Lisa Denny is a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Social Change, University of Tasmania.

These people believe that artificial intelligence and machine learning will supplement human intelligence, thus taking away jobs from industries ranging from media to banking. As panic surrounding job loss due to artificial intelligence reaches new levels, experts have clarified that AI will not take away jobs from humans. Experts revealed that artificial intelligence is actually supplementing human intelligence all across the spectrum, and it will actually make the life of humans easy. In a recent post written on Science Focus, Dr Peter Bentley, a British author and computer scientist based at University College London revealed that artificial intelligence is not the same as factory automation or robots. Bentley believes that AI is very similar to the internet, and it is basically an enabling technology which creates new jobs in various industries. Bentley also added that several job openings including computer developers, sales and marketing people, educators, lawyers, and regulators will be increased due to the advent of AI. ""The first jobs created are for computer developers, AI experts and researchers, along with sales and marketing people in new AI companies. Other new jobs include educators, lawyers, and regulators to help society adjust to the changing technologies. For technologies enabled by AI such as self-driving vehicles or smart buildings, we will need construction workers, engineers, and architects to build new infrastructure. That's a lot of new jobs,"" says Bentley. Alexander Linden, research vice president at Gartner revealed that artificial intelligence can be never compared with the human brain. ""Some forms of Machine Learning&nbsp;(ML) -- a category of AI -- may have been inspired by the human brain, but they are not equivalent. Image recognition technology, for example, is more accurate than most humans but is of no use when it comes to solving a math problem. The rule with AI today is that it solves one task exceedingly well, but if the conditions of the task change only a bit, it fails,"" said Linden.

His interests include but are not limited to whiskey, kimchi, and Catahoulas. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  In case we haven’t been cautioned enough about the threats of emerging artificial intelligence, a panel of academics addressed the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) on Sunday with a warning that advancements in intelligent and semi-intelligent automation could lead to overwhelming unemployment across many industries.   Machines’ ability to recognize patterns is yet to match our own, but their increasing sophistication in regards to tasks like speech recognition and data analysis has seen AI applied to real world applications such as autonomous driving. In this vain Bart Selman, professor of computer science at Cornell University, said, “For the first time, we’re going to see these machines and systems as part of our everyday life.” The predicted success of self-driving cars may prove to be a blessing that greatly reduces car accidents, but – with 10% of U.S. jobs requiring some degree of vehicle operation – the technology will also undoubtedly effect the labor market. Moshe Vardi, professor of computer science and director of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology at Rice University, told AAAS, “We can expect the majority of these jobs will simply disappear.” He went on to suggest that the disconnect between the manufacturing industry and job growth is a result of automation. Though manufacturing volume is right now at its peak, U.S. manufacturing jobs are currently below the figures from the 1950s. He pointed to the 250,000 industrial robots in the U.S. and the increasing growth rate of their use. What Vardi suggests will happen is “job polarization”, a phenomenon that emerges when high-skilled jobs demand complex human intelligence and low-skilled jobs are too expensive to automate. Thus, the middle ground jobs will be the easiest to automate, leading to greater economic inequality. Vardi also noted that although this issue is widely regarded as a threat that could make a huge impact on American economic life, there is no discussion of it in politics, particularly not in the presidential election. “We need to start thinking very seriously: What will humans do when machines can do almost everything?” he said. “We have to redefine the meaning of good life without work.” Furthermore, Wendell Wallach, an ethicist at Yale University’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and the Hastings Center, said  “There’s a need for concerted actions to keep technology a good servant and not let it become a dangerous matter.” He also proposed that 10% of AI research funding should be put towards studying the impact that AI machines will have on society, echoing Vardi’s concern that politics has failed to address the tremendous issue. “We need strong, meaningful human control,” he said.  More than a billion dollars was spent on AI research last year. That’s more than has been spent in the fields entire history. That may not match investment in the auto industry or other tech sectors, but it illustrates the increasing role that AI will play in our everyday life and economy.  Image credit: Joost Swarte Related Posts AI and IT Consultants: 2 Ways to Win Deals and Trust in the Coming Age of AutomationConsultants and professional services leaders face one of the hardest times in business in the… AI is Colorizing and Beautifying the WorldArtificial intelligence may be making the world smarter, safer, more functional and accessible.

 Artificial intelligence is helping physicists working on particle accelerators in many ways. AI is being used to help manage the large volume of data produced by these experiments, to find patterns in this data, and to develop new ways of analyzing it. Additionally, AI is being used to develop new computer vision algorithms that can be used to detect features in particle jets and other data sets. Experiments at the world’s largest particle accelerator, the LHC (the Large Hadron Collider), at the physics lab CERN, produces more than one million gigabytes of data every minute. Even after compressing this colossal amount of data, the data amassed in just a few hours is tantamount to an entire year’s worth of data that social networking sites like Facebook gather from users—far too much to save and study by mortals like us. This volume of data will also increase multifold in the years to come. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (Photo Credit : apod.nasa.gov) Driven by a conscientiousness to efficiently manage these discoveries with such staggering data volumes, physicists working on particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have brought in artificial intelligence (AI) experts to tackle the LHC data deluge. For the uninitiated, artificial intelligence (AI) is a specially designed set of software that mimics the way humans learn and solve complex problems. Machines running AI programs learn activities like speech recognition, planning, problem-solving, perception, and planning by themselves and can work efficiently without getting lost in the labyrinth of data. The next generation of particle-collider experiments will engage some of the world’s most intelligent thinking machines if the links between particle physicists and AI researchers take off smoothly. Such machines could make incredible discoveries with nearly zero human input. Recommended Video for you:PlayParticle accelerators: What are they, how do they work and why are they important to us?  Role Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) In The Higgs Boson Discovery Particle physics and artificial intelligence are not strangers. The ATLAS and CMS are two of the popular LHC experiments that paved the way for the discovery of the Higgs Boson a few years back. They were able to do so thanks to machine learning technology, a form of artificial intelligence that trains algorithms to recognize patterns in data and bring out meaningful conclusions from those patterns. The AI algorithms were primed using simulations of the debris from particle collisions and learned to accurately detect the patterns educed from the decay of rare Higgs particles among thousands of other unimportant bits of data.

Deep learning uses structures that are loosely inspired by the human brain—consisting of a set of units (equivalent to neurons in our brain). Each unit combines a set of input values to generate an output value, which in turn is passed on to other neurons in the deeper layer of the network. In other words, deep learning refers to the use of neural networks—computer programs with a structure inspired by a dense network of neurons in the human brain. An illustration of deep learning. (Photo Credit : CC0 Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons) Rudimentary AI algorithms are trained with sample data, such as images, and are told (instructed) what each picture shows—a house versus a dog, for example. However, advanced ‘deep learning’ algorithms, such as those used by tech giants like Google (Google Assistant) and Apple (Siri) in their voice recognition systems, typically receive no such supervision and must find their own ways to categorize the data in their respective fields. Google Assistant responding to user’s query on a Pixel phone (Photo Credit : Maurizio Pesce/Wikimedia Commons) Until recently, the success of deep learning was limited because training the AI software to supervise themselves for subsequent uses was difficult. Also, earlier, the neural networks employed for deep learning were just a couple of layers deep, but thanks to recent advances in machine learning and neural networks, it is now possible to build and train networks that are thousands of layers deep. Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), an international mega-science project, employs these sophisticated deep learning algorithms to study neutrino science and proton decay.  Also Read: What Is Artificial Intelligence And How Is It Powering Our Lives?Computer Vision AI algorithms are becoming fine-tuned more and more each day, opening up fascinating opportunities to solve problems pertaining to particle physics. Many of the new tasks that AI programs use have their applications in computer vision. Computer vision deals with automatic extraction, analysis, and detection of relevant information from standalone images or a sequence of images. It’s similar to facial recognition, which most high-end camera phones come with these days, except that in particle physics, image features are much more abstract than simple facial features like your eyes, ears or nose. Some popular neutrino experiments, like Nova and Microboone, produce data that can be easily translated into actual images. Computer vision algorithms can be readily used to discern features in such scenarios. However, in particle accelerator experiments, images first need to be recreated from a heterogeneous pool of data that is generated by millions of sensor elements. Even if the data doesn’t look like images, physicists can still use computer vision programs if they process the data in the correct way, opines machine learning researcher Alexander Radovic. One area where this approach could wield great results is in the analysis of particle jets produced in large numbers during particle accelerator experiments, like those at the LHC. Particle jets are narrow suds of particles whose individual tracks are extremely difficult to detect. Computer vision algorithms could help to identify features in jets. Today, physicists are primarily employing artificial intelligence to find features in the large pool of data generated from particle acceleration experiments that can help us answer the biggest questions concerning particle physics.  Ten years from now, AI algorithms might be able to independently ask their own questions and notify researchers when they come up with groundbreaking new discoveries in physics!

AI tools are already starting to automate what used to be time-consuming manual processes — but the results may be good for artists’ creativity, rather than potential job killers.

Companies that make industry-standard creative tools like Adobe and Celsys have been adding AI features to their digital art software in recent years in the hopes that it’ll speed up workflows by eliminating drudge work, and give artists more time to experiment. From machine learning tools that help find specific video frames faster, to features that color in entire works of line art with just a button, AI is being incorporated in subtle, but surprisingly impactful ways.

The best AI features can assist artists and cut out repetitive tasks, says Tatiana Mejia, who manages Adobe’s AI platform, Sensei. Her assessment comes from a Pfeiffer Consulting study commissioned by Adobe, in which most creatives said they weren’t worried about being replaced by AI, and that they could see the most potential for AI and machine learning applied to tedious, uncreative tasks. That could mean a smart cropping feature that automatically recognizes the subject of a photo, or automatic image tagging to help people find stock photos faster. They’ll still require an artist’s control, too. “Creativity is profoundly human,” Mejia says. “AI cannot replace the creative spark.”

Adobe makes a big splash every time it shows off concept AI tools, like content-aware fill for video, but it’s usually the more subtle AI features that actually ship. Recent additions include an automated audio mixing feature in Premiere and the ability to create searchable PDFs through optical character recognition in Adobe Scan. It’s a lot less flashy than AI automatically removing unwanted objects out of videos, but it’s enough to take some of the drudgery out of creative work.

There are more AI features in the works from Adobe that could have significant impacts on productivity behind the scenes. One feature can take a video of a dog jumping in a pool and generate descriptive tags; another can take a simple doodle of a mushroom and pull up similar-looking photographs, much like Google’s experimental Quick Draw and AutoDraw tools that use neural networks to recognize sketches.

Other AI tools could have more dramatic implications for how artists work, like an auto-coloring tool designed for comics and animation. A beta version of Celsys’ manga and illustration software Clip Studio now includes an AI feature that, with just a little guidance from the artist, can automatically color in black-and-white line drawings. The results can be unpredictable and require a little cleanup, but there’s huge potential in the way the technology can be used by artists and studios. 

AI coloring tools could play a big role in the future of 2D animation, says animator João Do Lago, who has worked on various anime including Netflix’s Castlevania. Do Lago says they could give artists room to experiment, by cutting down the time it takes to color each frame.

[Image: Users fill in line art with “hints” of where certain colors go, the input data is sent to Clip Studio’s servers for processing (a network connection is required for this part), then the results are sent back to the software as a fully colored image. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wK77nIZsCDwBea1o5v71r2zCvJU=/0x0:1250x600/1250x600/filters:focal(625x300:626x301)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13707305/colorize.png]

“One of the things that makes animation really hard to do is the amount of time it takes to create, which makes it so that most studios just stick to a visual style and formula that has been proven to work before,” Do Lago says. “But when you can automate a big part of that process, you allow more room for different ideas and visual languages to be explored, since you can iterate on them a lot faster.”

Some studios have already begun investing in auto-coloring research, including OLM, the production studio behind the Pokémon anime. And similar AI colorization tools have been around for a few years, including Japanese AI startup Preferred Networks’ browser-based tool PaintsChainer, which is already being used by some manga publishers, and Style2Paints, a web-based bot created by a team of research students from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Soochow University.

Celsys says its AI is taught with sets of line art extracted from color illustrations and colored images. The technology is based on a deep learning method, which combines computer vision tools, like those used in self-driving cars, with visual creation tools, like the one Nvidia used to create extremely realistic AI-generated faces. It’s worth noting that the company is also using artists’ uploaded data to improve the technology, but Celsys says artists will retain copyright for the uploaded and generated image, and the image data will never be released.

Celsys is optimistic that the tools it’s providing are in artists’ best interests, rather than technologies meant to replace them. “We think that AI features are just one type of feature within a digital art tool,” a Clip Studio spokesperson said. “Our hope is that creators can easily use these tools in the way that’s best for them.”

And while AI features might remove some work, Mejia at Adobe thinks it’ll just leave room for more and better work. “There may be something that used to be manually done that will be automated,” she says, “but it’ll be more than offset by the increased demand in terms of quantity and quality of work that’s expected.”

Ian Cheng, BOB, 2018, artificial lifeform. 
 








COURTESY THE ARTIST AND GLADSTONE GALLERY, NEW YORK AND BRUSSELS




Over the past few years, artist Ian Cheng has been creating what he’s called “live simulations,” or digital moving-image works that change over time and address ideas about evolution, artificial intelligence, and our fear of the unknown. In 2017, some of these works were included in a solo exhibition at MoMA PS1 in New York, where they received rave reviews. For his first show with Gladstone Gallery in New York, Cheng is showing a new work, BOB (Bag of Beliefs), an “artificial lifeform,” as the artist calls it, centered around an AI creature who’s part snake, part branching tree. Users can interact with BOB, the piece’s titular protagonist, through an iOS app called Bob Shrine, which allows users to give BOB various objects, including a shiny fruit, a rock, and a shrub. BOB will then interact with each object and learn what he wants to do with it, and in the process determine whether he trusts the person that offered it to him or not. To learn more about the work, ARTnews chatted with Cheng ahead of the show’s opening. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
ARTnews: This piece premiered at the Serpentine Galleries in London in March of last year. Since then, you’ve completely redone the work’s AI, right? 
Ian Cheng: Yeah, that’s right. I pretty much restructured the architecture of its mind, which was a significant undertaking. So that’s probably the main difference between the Gladstone version and the Serpentine one, but it’s resulted in a lot of other implications, because the heart of the project is BOB’s AI. I realized that I needed to give BOB the other half of its brain, which I call the “Congress of Demons.” Primarily, it gives BOB motivations. [Humans] don’t just recognize an apple, we’re motivated to recognize that apple and do something with it because we’re hungry. We’re constantly motivated by something—we’re never just in a neutral observational state. Even when we’re neutrally observing, we’re hungry, maybe for information, or we’re staving off boredom. 

I’m really curious about the language you’ve used to describe BOB. What is demonic about the demons? 
There’s psychological literature about how several different sub-personalities compose a person. We built the work around the idea [of demons] because it motivated me and everyone that I work with to understand that level of sub-personalities. They’re impulsive and possessive, like demons possessing you. Your whole body is forced toward that one goal. I chose the metaphor of a “congress,” meaning that the demons meet every few seconds in BOB’s mind to decide who gets to be in charge, and they’re all competing.
Aside from the programming of BOB, the aesthetic of the project is really interesting to me, too. What went into how BOB’s look? 
I was sitting in my studio thinking about what BOB looks like, and the natural combination manifested almost like a daydream. It was a snake that, as it grew and learned, fractalized like the branches of a tree. I don’t know why I chose that. Personally, I have a deep fear of snakes because as a kid, I went to the pet store and a baby snake latched on to my finger, and they had to pry it off, but they couldn’t kill it because it was merchandise. [Laughs.] Snakes also recur in imagery across cultures, and I think that’s because there’s an inherent neurobiological instinct to be alert to snakes. So snakes somehow became synonymous to alertness or awareness. A snake is not a purely evil being, but it’s a being that makes a human more aware.
You’ve continually returned to working with AI. What interests you about it?
I think it goes back to my own interest in cognitive science as an undergrad. I’ve just been very interested in behavior and how people learn. Specifically, I’m obsessed with this idea of how a person deals with change. And I’m obsessed with this duality, this relationship between known and unknown and between order and chaos. It’s manifested in the world, and it’s manifested in our own neurobiology. I think it’s so crazy that the two hemispheres dividing the brain are literally a mirror dividing the world into known and unknown. I think that’s so beautiful and under-appreciated.
People are generally scared of AI. Everyone’s so paranoid about its potential, it seems. Do you think that’s warranted? 
It’s an interesting question, and I’m of two minds about it. On the one hand, the general fear of AI is coming from an insecure place. If human beings believe that the most threatening thing is oppressive power, then AI seems like a threat because it’s unknown—our projection is that its first move would be to use its power against us. However, that’s not entirely true, because in making BOB and working with AI, there’s a huge possibility of AI being an extension of a human being, integrated into human culture. I think there’s great opportunity to see it as an augmentation rather than a separate entity that’s potentially threatening. 
However, in making BOB, the other side of me realized where a threat might lie. People are interested in AI that feels sentient and lifelike, whether at the level of a pet or a digital human companion. . . . In making BOB, I had to start from the most basic, animalistic, limbic core of the brain—the most basic drives and desires like threat, fight/flight, territory, status. There’s an instinctual layer [to sentient beings], which I would say is that demonic layer. There’s something maniacal about basic desires. Then there’s the [more] social layer where you learn to cooperate with other people, but you also learn to cooperate with your future self. To get BOB to the social level, I had to first program a foundational motivational structure for this brutal chimpanzee level. My fear about AI and making this is that whoever does this at an industrial scale, if they want life-like AI, they have to go through this chimpanzee level. But chimpanzees can rip each other apart over a banana. I recognize that that evolutionary stage is necessary to get anything remotely resembling the complexity and intelligence of our own culture and human behavior. But they better get through it fast.

Millions of gig economy workers around the world now earn a living on so-called crowd worker websites — work that falls under the umbrella of crowdsourcing, or dividing up tasks into minuscule portions to spread over a large number of people. The sites pay as little as $1 an hour for individuals to perform short, repetitive tasks, such as identifying images seen in pictures and churning out product reviews.
Some of these crowd workers were unknowingly helping to build out the Pentagon’s battlefield drone capability.
The work was done as part of a Defense Department initiative called Project Maven. Last year, The Intercept reported that the Pentagon had quietly tapped Google as part of the project to develop an artificial intelligence program to help Air Force analysts swiftly sort the thousands of hours of drone video and choose targets on the battlefield.
Outsourced crowd workers were tasked with providing the initial image data labeling — correctly identifying parts of an image — that allowed Google’s artificial intelligence program to tell buildings, images, trees, and other objects apart.
The artificial intelligence program, however, must learn to be able to distinguish between objects on the videos — and in order for the program to learn, someone must teach it. Enter the outsourced crowd workers, who were tasked with providing the initial image data labeling — correctly identifying parts of an image — that allowed Google’s artificial intelligence program to tell buildings, images, trees, and other objects apart. The role of the crowd workers has garnered little attention.
Emails obtained by The Intercept show that shortly after Google inked the deal with the military, the tech giant began working to label a set of satellite images captured by a technology known as wide-area motion imagery. In October 2017, Google sent a company called CrowdFlower — which subsequently changed its name to Figure Eight — the raw images with instructions on data labeling. The data labeling project started showing results quickly over the following month, as engineers developed better guidelines for the crowd workers to teach the artificial intelligence to identify the objects.

Project Maven, with the help of the crowd workers, was designed to allow Pentagon officials to engage in “near-real time analysis” and to “click on a building and see everything associated with it,” including people and vehicles, according to leaked documents obtained by The Intercept.
Asked if crowd workers have continued to contribute to Project Maven, a spokesperson for Google referred our questions to Figure Eight, which did not respond to The Intercept’s inquiry.

Since 2007, Figure Eight has hosted one of the largest digital platforms that allows individuals to sign up to perform micro-tasks, such as data annotation. The “human-in-the-loop” service is marketed as a cost-effective way for companies to fine-tune large data sets to make algorithms more accurate. Other firms in the industry include Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, Upwork, and Clickworker.
Will Pleskow, an account executive at Figure Eight, confirmed his company’s role on the Project Maven initiative during a September 2018 interview with The Intercept at the AI Summit, a trade show for machine-learning companies. Pleskow said the workers performing the data labeling, known as “contributors,” did not know that they were working for Google or for the military, which is not an unusual arrangement.
“Our customers have the option of showing who they are. Most of the time, it’s kept anonymous,” said Pleskow. He added that his firm provides similar image labeling tasks to improve the quality of technology for autonomous vehicles, such as driverless cars.
Several Figure Eight workers told The Intercept that it is not out of the ordinary for workers to be left in the dark about how their assembly-line style of data entry is used.
“Contributors to the Figure Eight platform are not given who the data will benefit,” said one former crowd worker, who used an online username when The Intercept reached out over social media. “Usually, they are given a reason for why they are doing a task, like, ‘Draw boxes around a certain product to help machines recognize it,’ but they are not given the company that receives the data.”
Another former crowd worker said that Figure Eight only provided the identity of the end-user client in a handful of scenarios, typically when the platform was used to conduct academic studies.
“Workers absolutely should have the right to know what they are working on, and especially when moral or politically controversial activities are involved.”
The rise of the gig economy has presented a myriad of challenges for organized labor. Most gig economy firms, including virtually all crowd-worker platforms, classify their workers as contractors, which means that they do not qualify for benefits, minimum wage, or overtime.
The distributed network allows for a global workforce. Figure Eight has a large user base in countries such as Venezuela, Indonesia, and Russia, as well as the United States. The far-flung employee base and individualized tasks on an opaque platform provide few opportunities for questioning corporate decisions.
Pleskow said in the September 2018 interview that he was unaware of any discontent or ethical concerns from Figure Eight workers after the revelation of the Project Maven initiative last year.



At Google, however, an open rebellion broke out over the project. Several employees quit Google in protest, while others openly challenged the Silicon Valley giant’s leadership, claiming that the company had abandoned its “Don’t Be Evil” ethos. Employees demanded that the company swear off future “warfare technology” projects. Executives were later caught misleading workers, erroneously stating that the contract was merely worth $9 million, while internal documents revealed that Google expected Project Maven to ramp up to a $250 million contract.
Following the protest, Google executives announced that they would not renew work on Project Maven after the initial phase of the contract ran its course — though they did not promise to eschew military work in the future.
Other tech giants are reportedly interested in engaging the military as it continues to deploy artificial intelligence technology. Much larger machine-learning projects may require vastly new engagement from gig economy workers, who may unknowingly engage in the work.
“Workers absolutely should have the right to know what they are working on, and especially when moral or politically controversial activities are involved,” said Juliet Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College, in an email to The Intercept. “It’s a basic dimension of democracy, which should not stop at either the factory or the platform ‘door.’ For too long, the country has tolerated erosion of basic civil rights in the workplace, as corporations assume ever-more control over their workforces. It’s time to win them back.”

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






The artificial intelligence agent behind the Iconary picture puzzle game, known as AllenAI, has been given a decidedly un-Terminator-like persona. (AI2 Graphic)
For decades, the games that put artificial intelligence to the test have been played human vs. machine – whether it’s checkers, chess, Go, poker, StarCraft or “Jeopardy.” Why isn’t there a game where the AI and the human are on the same side?
Now there is, and you can play, too.
Researchers at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence are taking the wraps off Iconary, a Pictionary-type puzzle game in which an AI and human players take turns putting together pictures and guessing what phrases the pictures signify. Anyone can play the game with the AI agent, nicknamed AllenAI, by going to Iconary.AllenAI.org.
But it’s not just a game.
Iconary is also a platform designed to see how far the institute, known as AI2, can go in its quest to perfect what the game’s inventors call “common-sense AI” — that is, the ability to understand everyday concepts and make abstractions to deal with new situations.
“We wanted to study the kinds of games that teach us more about the underlying assumptions and knowledge about how the world works,” said Ali Farhadi, a University of Washington computer scientist who heads up AI2’s Perceptual Reasoning and Interaction Research team, or PRIOR.

Farhadi said the structure of the game meshes with how he and his colleagues believe AI will actually be used in the real world, in contrast to the Terminator-tinged dystopia that comes up so often in the debate over the future of AI.
“Thinking about this space, and also all the noise that’s out there saying that AI’s going to wake up tomorrow and rule the world, and we’re all going to be slaves to the AI and it’s going to kill everybody … we don’t believe that,” he said. “The future that we believe in is an AI who can help human beings, and actually collaborate with human beings in achieving a goal.”
Testing for theory of mind
A key concept for understanding collaboration, and human-style intelligence in general, is a little something called “theory of mind” — basically, our ability to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes and see reality through their eyes.
Theory of mind is what’s thought to distinguish human cognition from animal cognition, although some scientists say they see signs of the trait in chimpanzees, birds and other creatures. It’s what makes it possible to imagine alternate scenarios and formulate strategies for those scenarios, even if they’ve never been encountered before.
Farhadi said the theory-of-mind approach is different from the typical machine-learning approach to AI, which involves training the software on myriad real-world examples that have been encountered before. Iconary could provide a way to get at the distinction.
Iconary grew out of the PRIOR team’s search for alternatives to the adversarial games so often used for AI research.
“We stumbled upon Pictionary as a perfect testbed for us,” Farhadi said. “If you are playing a Pictionary game successfully, you are collaborating with your teammate. You are connecting to your teammate at a deep level and getting into his or her thought. You need to understand his or her way of thinking about the problem … and you need the predict the future behavior of your teammate, based on the kind of feedback you provide.”
Pictionary checked all the boxes that Farhadi and his fellow researchers wanted to fill, but they had to change the game to have it work on a computer.
The PRIOR team created a vocabulary of 1,200 icons, ranging from stick figures and arrows to pictures of fruit and buildings. When AllenAI is doing the drawing, it will formulate a phrase – for example, “drinking fruit punch” – and then select the icons for a mouth, a glass and an orange to represent the phrase.

If you’re not able to guess the correct phrase, AllenAI will try again, focusing on the incorrectly guessed words. For example, if you guess “drinking orange juice,” AllenAI will fill the screen with fruit icons to steer you in the right direction.
“Growing up, I played a lot of Pictionary … I think AllenAI is a better drawer than my family,” AI2 principal software engineer Sam Skjonsberg joked.
When it’s your turn, you can draw rough sketches of your clues and pick out the icons that come closest to your clues from a menu. Then AllenAI will try guessing the phrase. If it can’t figure out the puzzle, it’ll ask for more clues.
For the researchers, the most interesting part has to do with how AllenAI puts together the clues and figures them out.
“AllenAI has never before encountered the unique phrases in Iconary, yet our preliminary games have show that our AI system is able to both successfully depict and understand phrases with a human partner, with an often surprising deftness and nuance,” AI2 CEO Oren Etzioni, Ani Kembhavi and Carissa Schoenick say in a Medium blog post.
Kembhavi, a research scientist at AI2, said AllenAI is catching on to our human ways.
“It has started understanding the meanings of and the usages of abstraction,” he said. “For example, it will put an arrow when it wants to show, let’s say, a state change. If the phrase is ‘ice melting,’ it will show ice with an arrow and water — which is a state change.”
Unleashing AllenAI
Now it’s time to send AllenAI out of the lab and into the wider world. “We need large-scale feedback from human players about the game to tell us what’s working and what’s not working, so we can actually devise the next steps,” Farhadi said.
Iconary might be tweaked to provide AllenAI with icons for even more abstract concepts such as “roommate” or “governor.” And because Iconary is open-source, like all the data generated by the late billionaire philanthropist Paul Allen’s scientific ventures, other AI researchers can tweak it for non-commercial purposes. (For what it’s worth, the makers of Pictionary haven’t raised legal objections to Iconary.)

Eventually, AI2’s team might mix things up so that you’re playing with AllenAI only part of the time, and with human players the rest of the time.
“At the end I’m going to ask you if you could distinguish the fact that you played a human or you played a machine,” Farhadi said. “We’re going to basically see how much data we can get out of this as a first step, and that will give us a benchmark to evaluate how far we are from a Turing-qualified intelligent machine.”
Farhadi suspects that Iconary will have even more staying power than chess, Go or StarCraft as a tool for exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence.
“This is a whole different way of thinking about AI and games, and what you can actually learn from playing a game other than just being the best at playing that game,” he said. “Because of that, I believe we are going to spend a fair amount of time on this. I certainly hope that looking back at this in five years, this will really be … an icon in that space.”

He weighs a little over 100 pounds, has auburn dyed hair, and wears a hoodie emblazoned with the words “Dope Shit.” But in China’s rise to superpower status, the 20-year-old student is a foot soldier playing a vital role.Yin works at Bainiaohe Digital Town, a tech hub set deep in the tree-covered hills of China’s southwestern province of Guizhou. The region is traditionally known for growing tea and producing fiery Moutai liquor, but today it’s luring Yin, and hundreds of young Chinese like him, to work in the booming sector of Artificial Intelligence or AI.For eight hours each day, they sit at computer terminals on brightly colored swivel chairs and help refine the reliability of facial and voice recognition software, driverless car programs, and even mobile apps that are used to identify plants and insects.“I used to think of AI as what’s in American sci-fi movies—many robots and Star Wars,” says Yin. “AI right now is nowhere near that level. It needs to learn. My job here is to teach it.”He does that by highlighting objects in images on his computer monitor. To help a self-driving car algorithm learn to identify common features of a city street, for example, Yin clicks on endless images of buses, sidewalks, or pedestrians. To assist voice recognition software, he’ll listen to garbled human pronunciations and input the correct meaning. It’s a thankless, repetitive job.“AI is only as intelligent as the labor you put in,” says Hu Dingxiang, project manager for Mengdong Technology Ltd., the Beijing-founded firm where Yin works.As China’s economy slows and rising wages make manufacturing less competitive, the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is turning to technology to arrest the slide. Strategic technologies such as AI are a key focus. President Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025 plan aims to ensure that China dominates AI as well as other high-tech industries, such as aeronautics and microchips.Last year, China’s State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan to establish China as the “premier global AI innovation center” by 2030, when it predicts that China’s core AI industry will be worth $148 billion, with AI-related fields ten times that.With Beijing and Washington sparring over cybersecurity, trade and myriad other issues, this has huge strategic implications. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin said whoever leads in AI “will become ruler of the world.”According to Adam Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, the “significant economic and national security implications … are why Beijing is so driven to be a major player in AI.”It’s a mission that has seeped down through Chinese society. China’s first dedicated AI school opened in September. An AI textbook series designed for primary and secondary students is expected to hit classrooms this year. In the future, the hope is that gleaming “AI Farms” like Mengdong’s will replace the nation’s polluting factories.“Just like the Middle East has lots of oil, China can be the world’s center for AI data,” says Sheng Hua, CEO of Mengdong, whose clients include Chinese tech titans Baidu, JD.com and Alibaba.AI farms are well suited to impoverished regions like Guizhou, where land and labor are cheap and the climate temperate enough to enable the running of large machines without expensive cooling systems. It takes only two days to train workers like Yin in basic AI tagging, or a week for the more complicated task of labeling 3D pictures.“Thanks to cheap labor, which only costs a tenth of what our overseas competitors must pay, we have a big advantage,” says Hu. “The U.S. cannot compete with China when it comes to cheap labor.”Some experts believe China overestimates the importance of data volume and point out that Silicon Valley firms still reign supreme when it comes to top quality algorithms—the building blocks of AI. But that may change as the Chinese government supports AI with plenty of hard cash.The country’s AI sector took nearly 50% of funding going to AI startups globally in 2017, according to CB Insights, surpassing the U.S. for the first time. AI-related patent applications in China are also surging ahead of those filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.‘We are like farmers in technology’Bainiaohe Digital Town is attached to the campus of Guizhou Forerunner College, a government-subsidized school providing “non-profit education for rural needy students,” according to giant red billboards posted around its lush grounds.Founded in 2012, the school boasts an AI-focused curriculum. Taiwanese tech giant HTC is a cornerstone investor. The 4,000-odd students pay only $1,500 for their three-year degree, thanks to state scholarships. In addition, from their sophomore year they can offset school fees by working at Mengdong or one of the other tech firms at Bainiaohe—an incongruous faux Alpine village of European-style buildings overlooked by a neoclassical clock tower.For Yin and his colleagues, work as an AI tagger is steady and safe when compared with toiling on a dusty construction site, or in a noisy factory making cheap goods for export. The office is clean and comfortable and they can take regular breaks. On average, Yin labels around 300 pictures each day, and has a personal record of tagging 14,000 cars in a single shift. The sedentary lifestyle does take its toll, however.“Since taking this job I’ve become so tired of look at computer screens that I’ve stopped playing video games,” he says. “Instead, I try to look at something far away to make my eyes feel more comfortable.”Yin You (C), 20, a tagger at an AI farm, has dinner with colleagues in the company dorm at Bainiaohe Digital Town in Guizhou, China, on Dec. 4, 2018Zhang ChiYin earns on average about $450 per month, which is significantly more than a typically assembly line worker. He shares a room at a spanking new boarding house with eight colleagues. They live and cook together, and treat TIME to Guizhou’s famous pig fat hotpot.The recipe was passed to Yin by his parents, who both work as migrant laborers, jumping from farm to construction site to factory depending on season and demand. Were it not for AI, Yin would likely follow their path. “Today, I’m a migrant worker in AI,” he jokes. “But it’s not as tiring as carrying bricks at a construction site.”His employer does more than just develop software. TIME speaks to one worker at Mengdong who says she’s “helping to shape public opinion” by monitoring social media for negative comments about clients. When criticism arises, she and other paid cheerleaders blanket the topic with positive remarks to drown it out.Of course, fake Amazon or Yelp reviews are common in the West. But here, there is nothing surreptitious about it. “When there is negative coverage, we help clients to handle the crisis,” shrugs Sheng, the CEO.It’s a tactic that has long been employed by the CCP. A 2016 study by Harvard, Stanford and UC San Diego academics estimates that Beijing is behind the posting of 448 million social media comments annually. The potential for AI to take on this propaganda role is huge. “AI is part of the CCP’s strategy to maintain control and guide public opinion,” says Segal.Mengdong also creates “Party-building” propaganda using virtual reality, which is then disseminated to CCP organizations across China. “I handle this project personally,” says Sheng proudly. “Virtual reality is perfect technology to show and recreate major events from the past.”But right now the focus is mostly on the future—for both young people like Yin and for all of China. “If a country wants to be stronger, it needs farmers to grow food,” says Yin. “We are like farmers in technology. Without us, China cannot grow strong in AI.”—With video by Zhang Chi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/1g6umlPd/poster.jpg?width=720,,2019-02-01T08:58:54.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/1g6umlPd.m3u8,,PT2M38S,,,,https://time.com/5518339/china-ai-farm-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity/,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5518339/china-ai-farm-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,

Ethical AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) can enable prediction and problem-solving approaches that save the lives of seriously ill hospital patients. Yet AI can also be used in ways that threaten human rights.
For example, we have seen allegations of AI entrenching bias and discrimination in the United States criminal justice system, as well as in policing in Australia.
Scandals and controversy connected to new technologies have increased public concern regarding decision-making that uses AI, data privacy, cyber security, political influence and labour market shifts.
Technology and human rights 
Our challenge as a nation is to ensure these technologies deliver what Australians need and want, rather than what they fear. There is added urgency because other countries are investing heavily in these areas.
Globally, we are witnessing a fundamental shift. Leaders in the technology industry are increasingly abandoning a long-standing hostility to government intervention. Many are starting to call for new forms of governance and regulation.
Whitepaper
Protecting Australians while powering our future economy requires innovation that reinforces Australia’s liberal democratic values, especially human rights, fairness and inclusion.
Making this vision real is a complex task. It will involve carefully crafted laws supported by an effective regulatory framework, strong incentives that apply to the public and private sectors, and policies that enable Australians to navigate an emerging AI-powered world.
This Whitepaper was a further contribution to the human rights and technology project.

He has reported on politics and policy issues for news organizations including National Memo, Massroots, NBC, and is a published science fiction author. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Both artificial intelligence and robotics have been improving over the past few years. Large companies are betting billions that in the near future we will have cars that can drive themselves, drones that can fly themselves to deliver packages, automatic fast food chefs, AI personal assistants, manufacturing robots that can train themselves and other robots, etc.  This has raised some big questions, including: What happens if a new technology causes millions to lose their jobs in a short period of time, or what if most companies simply no longer need many human workers? In the United States our current society is built on the premise that companies and government need human workers to function, and most able bodied adults can perform tasks companies would pay for. Everything from the way we design our transit systems to allow for daily commutes to work, to how we structure health insurance and how set monetary policy is based on this premise. The Federal Reserve’s core function is its dual mandate: to maximize employment and keep prices stable. One of the most important policy decisions based around this concept of mass employment is how the government is funded. Roughly 80 percent of all federal tax revenue comes from income or payroll taxes. If even a modest segment of workers are displaced, the impact on government budgets could be substantial. To deal with this possible problem the world’s richest man, Bill Gates, has floated the idea of a robot tax. Gates has suggested we tax robots at a rate similar to what we would’ve taxed the workers so tax revenue could pay for more employment in education and elder care. The idea is also to slow down the speed of the technology’s adoption, to give society more time to adjust. This article is going to give an overview of where a robot tax stands as a policy from multiple angles: Whether a robot tax might even be needed. I.e. how quickly are robots going to replace workers How such a robot tax might work. What are the arguments for or against it. The first big policy question about the robot tax is if it would even be needed in the next few decades.  Background Insight: Robotic Automation and the Job Market Gates obviously thinks broad job replacement will happen relatively soon. He told Quartz that, “warehouse work, driving, room cleanup, there’s quite a few things that are meaningful job categories that [will be replaced by machines], certainly in the next 20 years.” However, estimates about the rate and speed of automation in the next several years vary greatly.  Gates is not alone in his fears. A 2013 analysis by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne concluded about 47 percent of total US employment is in jobs that are at high risk of computerization, possibly over the next decade or two. As Carl Benedikt Frey explains in the video below, he believe automation not trade will be the main driver in changes in employment:  Similarly a 2017 analysis from PwC found 38 percent of jobs in the United States “could potentially be at high risk of automation by the early 2030s.” They found transportation, manufacturing, wholesale and retail to be at the greatest risk.  On the other hand Melanie Arntz, Terry Gregory, and Ulrich Zierahn published a paper in 2016 which concluded that just 9 percent of jobs in the United States are at risk of automation. The following graphic shows how PwC charted compares these three analyses: Expert perspectives vary on just how much of the US / UK job market is at “high risk” for automation. (Include this graph or just a graph based on this data from page 3 of the united states https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/ukeo/pwcukeo-section-4-automation-march-2017-v2.pdf) The economist Dean Baker has been skeptical that there is good evidence automation will soon lead to mass unemployment. He points to data on productivity, which in theory should be going up if we are currently seeing big advancements in automation spread throughout the whole economy. “It’s averaged just 1.2 percent annually in the last 10 years and 0.6 percent in the last five years. By comparison, productivity growth averaged 3 percent in both the decade from 1995 to 2005 and the long Golden Age from 1947 to 1973.”  Chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (source) Dean doesn’t dispute the idea we could theoretically reach a tipping point in AI where technology could lead to mass job displacement at some point in the future, but he thinks the current focus on robots taking people’s jobs is misdirected at this time. Looking at current productivity numbers, a tax that disincentive investments in productivity would seem misguided right now. There is broad agreement at least some jobs will be eliminated by technology, but the United States has been able adjust to technology eliminating some jobs over the past several decades. There are less travel agents now compared to 30 years ago but more yoga instructors.  That is why the rate at which it will happen is so important. Will it happen at a rate our current system can already manage, or at some point in the near future will it turn into a torrent of change requiring new government policy solutions?  Could a Robot Tax Work? The first step is policy makers need to be convinced that automation will lead to mass unemployment is a serious and potential problem. It is only once policy makers think there is a problem does talking about the design possible solutions become relevant. At this point the idea of what a “robot tax” would be or how it would actually work in practice is very nebulous. There are a few ideas which have been called a “robot tax,” but they very significantly in design and scale. For example South Korea relatively modest move to reduce the tax incentives for investment in automation a being called a “robot tax,” but that is nowhere near the scale what Gates is envision for his “robot tax.” The Telegraph (article linked above) jestingly points out that machines and humans share some important limitations – namely – the inability to build IKEA furniture Gates simply suggested that “some of it could come on the profits that are generated by the labor-saving efficiency there. Some of it could come directly from some type of robot tax.” A segment of a proposed motion in the EU parliament which was rejected simply called for looking at, “levying tax on the work performed by a robot or a fee for using and maintaining a robot should be examined in the context of funding the support and retraining of unemployed workers whose jobs have been reduced or eliminated.” Levying a fee on each robot sounds much easier in theory than it practice. How would we define “robots” for these tax purposes? What separates a tool from a robot or a complex computer program from AI? For example, a backhoe replaces human ditch diggers, but few people consider that a “robot.” Is a vending machine a human-replacing robot? What about a vending machine that can automatically alert its owner when it is out of a product? What about a vending machine the size of a small store that can automatically stock itself and answer complex questions from customers? If a country did try to place a fee on actual robots, it is likely it would be difficult for some companies to avoid the tax. Manufacturing robots, self-driving cars, delivery drones, and anything that looks like a classic “robot” or clearly replaces a specific category of job would likely be hit.  But there are a lot of marginally robot-like tools that manufacturers would aggressive lobby policy makers to exclude from the tax. Alternatively, manufacturers could modify the tools just enough to exploit some loophole in the definition of a robot.  To get a sense of just how complex and protracted a legal question “what is a robot” could turn into, one needs only look at the legal fight (and huge tax repercussions) over whether Marvel’s mutants are “humans”.  For years, the United States has taxed the importation of “dolls,” which are representations of humans, at roughly twice the rate it taxes the import of “toys.” So Marvel entered into a decade-long legal fight to prove its characters like Wolverine and Spiderman weren’t technically “humans” and so their action figures would be taxed at the toy rate. One big impact of an attempt to tax specific robots might not be slowing innovation but redirecting it towards almost-robots. Right now many companies are hyping how much they are using AI and machine learning to investors, but in a country with a robot tax you could easily see the opposite: companies using very AI-like programs they refuse to admit are true AI. The difficulty of defining “what is a robot” might putting a tax on every robot a logistical and legal nightmare. As a result any “robot tax” concept might take on the form of something less direct. For example South Korea reducing the tax incentives for investing in automation is called a robot tax. It is possible to imagine the “robot tax” taking the form of higher taxes certain types of productively enhancing developments and/or the form of big tax breaks for companies that keep the size of their workforce stable each year.  A “robot tax” could also maybe take the form of a tax that target companies with high profits/revenue but small workforces. Something like a worker to profit ratio could serve as a proxy for deciding what company are making use of a lot of automation.  All of these less direct “robot tax” ideas get around the question of defining what is a robot but they all have their own implementation challenges and possible drawbacks.  Arguments “For” and “Against” For The argument for some variety of a ‘robot tax’ is based in the belief that automation will cause mass employment displacement in the near future (or at least massive economic inequality). Computer development hasn’t been linear; it has been exponential. We could reach a tipping point where machines suddenly become better than people at a whole range of tasks. The last major employment displacement, the industrial revolution, caused decades of falling wages and significant social unrest. A robot tax would accomplish two goals.  First, it would slow down the deployment of automation to give society more time to adjust to the possible employment displacement.  Second, it would raise money needed to keep government programs going and to pay for programs to deal with this displacement, such as increasing the number of teaching jobs. Against The arguments against a “robot tax” are numerous, and many have been touched on in other parts of this article. Mostly they come down to questions of is it needed, can it even be implemented, would it cause more problems than it tries to solve, and is there a better way. Is it needed? – Some analysts don’t believe automation will have as big an impact on employment in the near future. With the current weak productivity numbers, talking about policies that would disincentivize productivity gains seems like a bad idea. Meanwhile, automation does eliminate some jobs but also creates new ones; it is possible the rate of change will be manageable.  Could it be implemented? – Trying to define what is or is not a “robot” for the purposes of taxation would be an extremely difficult task and would turn regulations over the issue into a never-ending legal battle. The different states and levels of the United States government can’t even agree on what legally constitutes a sandwich, a question that requires far less technical expertise than defining what is an AI or robot. Could it backfire? – Andrus Ansip, the European Commissioner in charge of the bloc’s push for a Digital Single Market, argued aggressively against the robot tax, saying if the EU adopted a robot tax, “somebody else would take this leading position.”  Unless all countries on Earth adopted a robot tax, you run the risk of robotics companies moving their operations from countries with a robot tax to nearby ones without. Instead of getting money from robots and slowing their deployment, the country with a robot tax could lose out on the cash and cause the development to occur elsewhere.  Is there a better way? – If mass automation does cause dramatic job displacement, the money that was previously spent on wages for these jobs doesn’t just go away. It should result in high corporate profits and capital gains. Instead of trying to figure out how to tax specific robots, countries could just try other ways to increase revenue from corporations.  This could be accomplished via high corporate taxes and capital gains taxes. Noah Smith suggested an alternative to the robot tax could be developing a sovereign wealth fund. The government could buy up shares in companies, or it could replace the entire corporate tax structure with the requirement that all companies give the government a set percentage of shares.  Concluding Thoughts For businesses, the idea of a robot tax is new and mostly unformed, so there is little threat of it happening in the next few months or even years. But it is starting to gain the attention of policy makers in Europe and the United States.  Earlier this year Benoît Hamon, the Socialist candidate for president in France, campaigned on the idea. San Francisco Supervisor Jane Kim, launched the Jobs of the Future Fund to advocate in California the idea “if an employer replaces a human worker with a robot or algorithm, he or she would pay a tax.” And recently UK Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn called automation an urgent challenge that must be managed – see the video below from 49:36 to 51:55:  The regulatory and legal nightmare that would likely result from any effort to define what is a robot, and trying to place a specific fee on every type of robot, makes a broad-based, true robot tax seem very unlikely. When it comes to broad-based policy, it is likely the idea of a robot tax will end up being used as a way to simply refer to the general idea that automation could cause mass employment displacement.  Any big policy change that would result from that opinion is in practice more likely to take the form of restructuring how much a government taxes payrolls versus corporations and capital gains. That doesn’t mean we won’t see some targeted robot taxes. While a fee on every possible type of robots would be a massive legal challenge, it would be fairly simple to tax a few very specific types of robots.  I think the most likely short term concern for companies about discussions around a robot tax is that a few high-profile industries could be hit with a tax at a national or local level. For example, self-driving taxis, self-driving trucks, and delivery drones are all very easily seen as job-taking “robots” by the public. Local legislatures could target these robots with a special fee to fund retraining of drivers or to make up lost revenue. These taxes would be easy to understand and give legislatures the chance to say they are doing something. For the AI and robotics industries overall, the idea of a robot tax creates an interesting collective action problem. On an individual level, any one company benefits from playing up the labor-saving benefits of their technology and making very optimistic claims about how quickly it will be adopted. Yet the more these industries as a whole make bold predictions about rapid transformation, the more likely they are all to be hurt by a political backlash.   Header image credit: LeverHawk Related Posts AI for Fraud Detection in Retail - 2 Powerful Use CasesLeading retailers - like Walmart, Stop & Shop, and Home Depot - are enhancing their payment… Machine Vision in Retail - Current Use-Cases and ApplicationsThe retail industry collects massive amounts of data every day, and this makes its key… Machine Learning in Manufacturing - Present and Future Use-CasesMajor companies including GE, Siemens, Intel, Funac, Kuka, Bosch, NVIDIA and Microsoft are all making… AI in Food Processing - Use Cases and Applications That MatterFood processing is one of the major manufacturing sectors in the United States.

The system used by the company, Cyborg, is able to assist reporters in churning out thousands of articles on company earnings reports each quarter.The program can dissect a financial report the moment it appears and spit out an immediate news story that includes the most pertinent facts and figures. And unlike business reporters, who find working on that kind of thing a snooze, it does so without complaint.Untiring and accurate, Cyborg helps Bloomberg in its race against Reuters, its main rival in the field of quick-twitch business financial journalism, as well as giving it a fighting chance against a more recent player in the information race, hedge funds, which use artificial intelligence to serve their clients fresh facts.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The financial markets are ahead of others in this,” said John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of Bloomberg.In addition to covering company earnings for Bloomberg, robot reporters have been prolific producers of articles on minor league baseball for The Associated Press, high school football for The Washington Post and earthquakes for The Los Angeles Times.Examples of machine-generated articles from The Associated Press: TYSONS CORNER, Va. (AP) — MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter net income of $3.3 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Jonathan Davis hit for the cycle, as the New Hampshire Fisher Cats topped the Portland Sea Dogs 10-3 on Tuesday.Last week, The Guardian’s Australia edition published its first machine-assisted article, an account of annual political donations to the country’s political parties. And Forbes recently announced that it was testing a tool called Bertie to provide reporters with rough drafts and story templates.As the use of artificial intelligence has become a part of the industry’s toolbox, journalism executives say it is not a threat to human employees. Rather, the idea is to allow journalists to spend more time on substantive work.“The work of journalism is creative, it’s about curiosity, it’s about storytelling, it’s about digging and holding governments accountable, it’s critical thinking, it’s judgment — and that is where we want our journalists spending their energy,” said Lisa Gibbs, the director of news partnerships for The A.P.The A.P. was an early adopter when it struck a deal in 2014 with Automated Insights, a technology company specializing in language generation software that produces billions of machine-generated stories a year.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn addition to leaning on the software to generate minor league and college game stories, The A.P., like Bloomberg, has used it to beef up its coverage of company earnings reports. Since joining forces with Automated Insights, The A.P. has gone from producing 300 articles on earnings reports per quarter to 3,700.The Post has an in-house robot reporter called Heliograf, which demonstrated its usefulness with its coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and the 2016 elections. Last year, thanks to Heliograf, The Post won in the category of Excellence in Use of Bots at the annual Global Biggies Awards, which recognize accomplishments in the use of big data and artificial intelligence. (As if to make journalists jittery, the Biggies ceremony took place at Columbia University’s Pulitzer Hall.)Jeremy Gilbert, the director of strategic initiatives at The Post, said the company also used A.I. to promote articles with a local orientation in topics like political races to readers in specific regions — a practice known as geo-targeting.“When you start to talk about mass media, with national or international reach, you run the risk of losing the interest of readers who are interested in stories on their smaller communities,” Mr. Gilbert said. “So we asked, ‘How can we scale our expertise?’”The A.P., The Post and Bloomberg have also set up internal alerts to signal anomalous bits of data. Reporters who see the alert can then determine if there is a bigger story to be written by a human being. During the Olympics, for instance, The Post set up alerts on Slack, the workplace messaging system, to inform editors if a result was 10 percent above or below an Olympic world record.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I. journalism is not as simple as a shiny robot banging out copy. A lot of work goes into the front end, with editors and writers meticulously crafting several versions of a story, complete with text for different outcomes. Once the data is in — for a weather event, a baseball game or an earnings report — the system can create an article.But machine-generated stories are not infallible. For an earnings report article, for instance, software systems may meet their match in companies that cleverly choose figures in an effort to garner a more favorable portrayal than the numbers warrant. At Bloomberg, reporters and editors try to prepare Cyborg so that it will not be spun by such tactics.A.I. in newsrooms may also go beyond the production of rote articles.“I hope we’ll see A.I. tools become a productivity tool in the practice of reporting and finding clues,” said Hilary Mason, the general manager for machine learning at Cloudera, a data management software company. “When you do data analysis, you can see anomalies and patterns using A.I. And a human journalist is the right person to understand and figure out.”The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones are experimenting with the technology to help with various tasks, including the transcription of interviews or helping journalists identify “deep fakes,” the convincingly fabricated images generated through A.I.“Maybe a few years ago A.I. was this new shiny technology used by high tech companies, but now it’s actually becoming a necessity,” said Francesco Marconi, the head of research and development at The Journal. “I think a lot of the tools in journalism will soon by powered by artificial intelligence.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe New York Times said it had no plans for machine-generated news articles, but the company has experimented with using A.I. to personalize newsletters, help with comment moderation and identify images as it digitizes its archive.Previous technological advances have rendered moot a number of jobs that were once essential to the journalism industry, such as Linotype operator. But reporters and editors have not yet been tempted to smash the programs now taking care of some of the busy work that once fell to them.“When you look at the ways things are laid out and printed and produced and distributed, a lot of those functions have been replaced with technology,” said Nastaran Mohit, the organizing director for the News Guild of New York. She added that she did not consider A.I. a threat to newsroom workers, while also noting that the guild monitors emerging technologies to make sure that hypothesis holds true.Mr. Marconi of The Journal agreed, likening the addition of A.I. in newsrooms to the introduction of the telephone. “It gives you more access, and you get more information quicker,” he said. “It’s a new field, but technology changes. Today it’s A.I., tomorrow it’s blockchain, and in 10 years it will be something else. What does not change is the journalistic standard.”Marc Zionts, the chief executive of Automated Insights, said that machines were a long way from being able to replace flesh-and-blood reporters and editors. He added that his daughter was a journalist in South Dakota — and although he had not advised her to leave her job, he had told her to get acquainted with the latest technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If you are a non-learning, non-adaptive person — I don’t care what business you’re in — you will have a challenging career,” Mr. Zionts said.For Patch, a nationwide news organization devoted to local news, A.I. provides an assist to its 110 staff reporters and numerous freelancers who cover about 800 communities, especially in their coverage of the weather. In a given week, more than 3,000 posts on Patch — 5 to 10 percent of its output — are machine-generated, said the company’s chief executive, Warren St. John.In addition to giving reporters more time to pursue their interests, machine journalism comes with an added benefit for editors.“One thing I’ve noticed,” Mr. St. John said, “is that our A.I.-written articles have zero typos.”A correction was made on Feb. 5, 2019: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a tool that Forbes is testing for reporters.
