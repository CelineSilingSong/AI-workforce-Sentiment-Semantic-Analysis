Until recently, artificial intelligence was a thing for science fiction movies and books. However, we are now in the midst of an ever-changing tech world where we are advancing faster than ever before. The future of AI is unknown, but that doesn’t stop people from contemplating. Here are some of the best quotes about the future of AI.

""Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks."" -Stephen Hawking, Theoretical Physicist
""It is difficult to think of a major industry that AI will not transform. This includes healthcare, education, transportation, retail, communications, and agriculture. There are surprisingly clear paths for AI to make a big difference in all of these industries.""- Andrew Ng, Computer Scientist and Global Leader in AI
PROMOTED
""AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies."" -Sam Altman, Chairman of OpenAI
""I imagine a world in which AI is going to make us work more productively, live longer, and have cleaner energy."" -Fei-Fei Li, Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University

""Machine learning allows us to build software solutions that exceed human understanding and shows us how AI can innervate every industry."" -Steve Jurvetson, Board Member of SpaceX and Tesla
""The development of exponential technologies like new biotech and AI hint at a larger trend - one in which humanity can shift from a world of constraints to one in which we think with a long-term purpose where sustainable food production, housing, and fresh water is available for all."" -Arvind Gupta, Indian Toy Inventor
""What all of us have to do is to make sure we are using AI in a way that is for the benefit of humanity, not to the detriment of humanity."" -Tim Cook, CEO of Apple
""Secrecy is the underlying mistake that makes every innovation go wrong in Michael Crichton novels and films! If AI happens in the open, then errors and flaws may be discovered in time... perhaps by other, wary AIs!"" -David Brin, American Scientist and Author of The Postman
""AI is going to be extremely beneficial and already is, to the field of cybersecurity. It's also going to be beneficial to criminals."" -Dmitri Alperovitch
""Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.""-Ginni Rometty, CEO of IBM
""In the long term, artificial intelligence and automation are going to be taking over so much of what gives humans a feeling of purpose."" -Matt Bellamy, Lead Singer of Muse
""The promise of artificial intelligence and computer science generally vastly outweighs the impact it could have on some jobs in the same way that, while the invention of the airplane negatively affected the railroad industry, it opened a much wider door to human progress."" -Paul Allen, Co-Founder of Microsoft
""It's going to be interesting to see how society deals with artificial intelligence, but it will definitely be cool."" -Colin Angle, CEO and Founder of iRobotFollow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website. Nicole MartinNicole Martin is the owner of NR Digital Consulting and host of Talk Digital To Me Podcast.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) renaissance that has so markedly affected the way technology platforms and devices of all kinds have developed this decade was at first met with skepticism.
Thankfully, we’re mostly past the initial misperceptions and we’re now busy applying AI to the coalface of business workflows in every vertical. We now realize that AI isn’t going to make us all redundant overnight, but it is going to channel us towards some new roles in work.
The robots are taking some aspects of our jobs over, but these are the repetitive tasks that we humans regard as part of the monotony of life. Fortunately, these are the definable, containable, measurable and essentially repeatable tasks that robots ‘enjoy’ doing.
The big AI work questions
The questions we must now face to understand the impact of AI in the workplace are:

whose job is going to change and how;
which types of professions will be impacted the most;
where will AI change male and female roles in different ways; and
how will these trends manifest themselves in developed versus developing countries?

Let’s address that last point first. McKinsey & Company’s report on The Future of Women at Work: Transitions in the Age of Automation says that men and women tend to cluster in different occupations in different ways across mature and emerging economies:
This [clustering] shapes the jobs lost and gained due to automation for each. In the mature economies studied, women account for 15% on average of machine operators, but over 70% on average of clerical support workers. In the emerging economies [in the study sample], women make up less than 25% of machine operators on average, but over 40% of clerical support workers.
It starts to become clear that roles in developed economies, which might typically be filled by highly specialized knowledge workers, will initially be less impacted by AI and automation than those that require comparatively simple physical machine operation.
This is not a binary division set in stone though. Over time, digital workflows and the application of data intelligence mean that even lawyers, doctors and actuaries, for example, will also see an increasing degree of their role handled by AI. The difference is, an unskilled or semi-skilled machine operator might see their job displaced in entirety. A skilled worker on the other hand can use the extra time they’re given to focus on value-added actions.
What humans are good at
We know that machines are good at cold, hard repetitive tasks. So that makes them really good at actions performed by rotation and even by conditioning – which is pretty much what Machine Learning is anyway. But it makes them comparatively bad at intuitive empathy on a human level.
If you were diagnosed with some challenging medical symptom, would you be happy hearing about it from a computer-generated readout as opposed to a human being? Even though we are making strides towards affective computing – or Artificial Emotional Intelligence as it is sometimes known – we are a long way off from any technology that can genuinely recognize human emotions and respond to them appropriately. Primary care physicians, caregivers, and therapists are unlikely to be outsourced to technology any time soon.
Part of this discussion highlights the need to understand the difference between Artificial Intelligence that makes decisions and Artificial Intelligence that advises on decisions. AI will change the nature of some work, but it won’t change the fact that people have to rely on ‘gut instinct’ in areas of critical thinking.
Let’s remember that, at a basic level, computers only know what we tell them based upon which datasets they are exposed to. Law firms are employing AI to help identify relevant documents in legal cases, but we still need a human judge to adjudicate a decision.
Chocolate pickle sauce
AI can be used to make music based upon identified beats and patterns. We know that it can even be used to create ‘art’ or at least some form of image based upon a defined request. But there are limits. AI engines directed at cooking have come up with abominations such as chocolate pickle sauce, simply because they fail to grasp the nuances of human taste.
Because of this gap between computer brains and human realities, I would assert that any job group that requires true creativity, such as writers, engineers, inventors, entrepreneurs, artists, musicians et cetera, is probably not going to be automated for a long while, for the most part at least.
Also remember, computers can perform jobs, but they can’t necessarily think. A computer can be programmed to Tweet, post to Facebook and even to create a suggested program of social media activities broken down by platform, time schedule and types of content. But that same computer can’t come up with a communications strategy from scratch for products and services that don’t necessarily even exist yet. True original ‘makers’ and ‘creators’ will find that their jobs are more robot-proof than others, for now at least.
The human-robot future workforce
Until the robots have robots (can we call them robot robots?) of their own to install and maintain them, humans are going to be needed to design, plan, install, manage and maintain any robotics, technology, or AI systems. This takes us back to my point about understanding what technology is capable of – the more familiar you are with the technology, the more valuable you will be in helping implement and maintain it.
For the immediate future – and long before ‘robot robots’ exist – it’s a human-robot future with both of us working in unison. What matters now to us as human beings is that we must realize that change is afoot – and that it is positive change. It is important for us to develop and champion all the creative skills that computer-driven AI and ML may never replace.
If you haven’t thought about your empathy, creativity, ability to develop strategic thinking and be a problem-solving human communicator, then now is your time to shine.
Don’t just sit there like a robot, or a robot might come and sit in your place.

Majorities of people in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom think that artificial intelligence will improve their lives, but they believe that higher education, government, and employers are not doing enough to improve their skills.
Fears that the new era of automation will leave educated workers behind are crystallized by a first-of-its-kind survey conducted by Northeastern University and Gallup.
Fewer than 10 percent in each country said their undergraduate education will provide the skills they will need when artificial intelligence displaces millions of people from their jobs.
The global survey of more than 10,000 respondents is the first poll to reveal an international cross-section of opinions about artificial intelligence as economies around the world undergo the transformative move to automation. It follows earlier Northeastern-Gallup polls that focused on American views of artificial intelligence.
“As we prepare for the age of artificial intelligence, people around the world understand that learning will need to become a lifelong endeavor,” said Joseph E. Aoun, president of Northeastern. “This presents enormous opportunities for the higher education sector if we make the right decisions and investments. This can be the golden age of higher education.”
A majority of the public in all three countries believes large businesses and government are not “doing enough to address the need for career-long learning and training.” Majorities in the U.S. and U.K. also believe that higher education is failing to provide lifelong learning opportunities. Only a narrow majority of Canadians disagrees.

Data Visualizations by Tyler Machado and Derrick Henry
Respondents in all three countries cite cost as a major barrier they “face when seeking education or training over the course of your career.”
“It is time to think about ‘college access’ in a completely new way,” added Aoun, “not as a one-time ticket to an undergraduate classroom, but as a lifelong passport to reinvention.”
Asked who should be responsible for making lifelong learning more affordable in order to keep up with advances in artificial intelligence, U.S. respondents overwhelmingly prefer that employers take on the burden. In Canada and the U.K., those polled expressed a preference that governments help pay.

 The poll revealed several differences of opinion among the three countries
In the U.K. and Canada, majorities believe their current skills and education are already outdated or on the verge of becoming redundant. But only 35 percent of Americans admitted to similar fears, with 42 percent expressing confidence that their job skills will never become obsolete.
 Additional differing points of view: 

       Who should bear the responsibility for making lifelong learning more affordable in the artificial intelligence era? Seventy-three percent of Americans want employers to take on that responsibility, while Canadians (64 percent) and U.K. residents (62 percent) believe it should fall on government.


       When asked about the best skills to withstand artificial intelligence, six in 10 respondents in Canada and the U.K. believe teamwork, communication, creativity, and critical thinking are most important in the new era of automation; whereas Americans are split 50-50 between those “soft” skills and technical skills like math, science, coding, and working with data.


       Three-quarters of Canadians and U.K. residents support a universal basic income program to help people who lose their jobs to automation. But 57 percent of Americans oppose the program.

 Among the findings were areas of consensus as well

       Despite concerns that they are not prepared for the new era and the job losses that will result from automation, majorities in all three countries believe that advancements in machine learning will do more good than harm overall. When asked to assess the impact that artificial intelligence “will have on how people work and live in the next 10 years,” large majorities said the consequences will be “very” or “mostly” positive (72 percent in Canada, 70 percent in U.K., 67 percent in U.S.).


       The Northeastern-Gallup poll also reveals a lack of confidence among respondents in the three countries that they will receive the education they need to be prepared for changes to the workforce. Among college graduates, fewer than 10 percent (five percent in the U.S., six percent in U.K., eight percent in Canada) believes their undergraduate education prepared them for using artificial intelligence at work. Among all respondents, only three percent in the United States, 10 percent in the U.K., and 12 percent in Canada “strongly agree” that universities in their countries are preparing graduates for success in the current workforce.


       On the question of whether institutions are addressing the need for lifelong learning, there was agreement that large businesses (71 percent in the U.S., 62 percent in Canada, and 59 percent in the U.K.) as well as government (78 percent in the U.S., 71 percent in the U.K., and  65 percent in Canada) are not responding adequately. Higher education also received failing marks in the U.S. (75 percent) and U.K. (55 percent).


       Asked to compare the importance of lifelong learning versus a one-time advanced degree or certificate, overwhelming majorities preferred education over the course of their careers (95 percent U.S., 94 percent U.K., 92 percent Canada).


       Seven in ten Americans, six in ten Canadians, and six in ten U.K. residents believe the advent of artificial intelligence will eliminate more jobs than it creates. But that is not their only concern economically: Majorities in all three countries view the outsourcing of jobs to other countries as a greater threat than the loss of jobs that will result from artificial intelligence.

 Other key findings include: 

       If their skills become outdated, then strong majorities in all three countries would prefer to be educated by an employer rather than by a university. The sentiments were echoed by human resources officers who participated in the qualitative portion of the survey.


       A majority of Canadians continue to believe in the value of a college degree, but their optimism isn’t shared in the other countries. Forty-one percent of U.K. respondents expect a college degree to diminish in importance over the next decade, and 36 percent of Americans agree with them.


       Majorities in each country favor the development of employer and government-matched lifelong learning accounts.



       When using products or services that employ artificial intelligence, majorities in all three countries said they worry “often” that their personal information is at risk.

June 26, 2019Credit...Katherine StreeterShare full articleRead in appBy Carol GiacomoMs. Giacomo is a member of the editorial board.Early in the Afghanistan war, Army Rangers hunting Taliban fighters along the Pakistan border saw a goatherd with a radio, probably reporting their position to the Taliban. Under the rules of war, soldiers can shoot someone informing enemy forces of their location, but these men saw that the goatherd was just a girl.If she had come into the sights of the kind of autonomous robot or drone now under development, rather than of trained snipers, it might not have made the distinction between target and child, and killed her, according to Paul Scharre, who was leading the Rangers that day.Mr. Scharre, author of “Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War,” recounted this episode in a speech earlier this year at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation, laying out the stakes as the artificial intelligence revolution spreads further onto the battlefield.“How would you design a robot to know the difference between what is legal and what is right?” he asked. “And how would you even begin to write down those rules ahead of time? What if you didn’t have a human there, to interpret these, to bring that whole set of human values to those decisions?”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor now, these are hypothetical questions. Two senior Pentagon officials, who spoke to The Times on background because much of their work on artificial intelligence is classified, say the United States is “not even close” to fielding a completely autonomous weapon.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.But three years ago, Azerbaijani forces used what appeared to be an Israeli-made kamikaze drone called a Harop to blow up a bus carrying Armenian soldiers. The drone can automatically fly to a site, find a target, dive down and detonate, according to the manufacturer. For now, it is designed to have human controllers who can stop it.Not long after that in California, the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office tested 103 unarmed Perdix drones which, on their own, were able to swarm around a target. “They are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,” the office’s director at the time, William Roper, said in a Defense Department statement. The Estonian-made Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System looks like a mini-tank with guns, camera and the ability to track down and fire on a target. It’s human controlled, but its maker says it’s “autonomous and self-driving with growing A.I. assistance.”“It is well within the means of most capable militaries to build at least relatively crude and simple autonomous weapons today,” Mr. Scharre said in an email exchange after his speech.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs the ability of systems to act autonomously increases, those who study the dangers of such weapons, including the United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts, fear that military planners may be tempted to eliminate human controls altogether. A treaty has been proposed to prohibit these self-directed lethal weapons, but it’s gotten limited support.The proposed ban competes with the growing acceptance of this technology, with at least 30 countries having automated air and missile defense systems that can identify approaching threats and attack them on their own, unless a human supervisor stops the response. The Times of Israel has reported that an Israeli armed robotic vehicle called the Guardium has been used on the Gaza border. The United States Navy has tested and retired an aircraft that could autonomously take off and land on an aircraft carrier and refuel in midair.Britain, France, Russia, China and Israel are also said to be developing experimental autonomous stealth combat drones to operate in an enemy’s heavily defended airspace.The speed with which the technology is advancing raises fears of an autonomous weapons arms race with China and Russia, making it more urgent that nations work together to establish controls so humans never completely surrender life and death choices in combat to machines. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe senior Pentagon officials who spoke to The Times say critics are unduly alarmed and insist the military will act responsibly.“Free-will robots is not where any of us are thinking about this right now,” one official told me.What they are exploring is using artificial intelligence to enable weapons to attack more quickly and accurately, provide more information about chaotic battlefields and give early warning of attacks. Rather than increase the risk of civilian casualties, such advances  could reduce such deaths by overcoming human error, officials say.The United States, for instance, is exploring using swarms of autonomous small boats to repulse threats to larger Navy ships. Yet Pentagon officials say American commanders would never accept fully autonomous systems, because it would mean surrendering the intelligence and experience of highly trained officers to machines.While artificial intelligence has proved a powerful tool in numerous fields, it has serious vulnerabilities, like computer hacks, data breaches and the possibility that humans could lose control of the algorithm.Only 28 countries have supported the call for a treaty banning such weapons, which the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, an international coalition of more than 100 nongovernmental organizations, began working for in 2012. In March, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said that “machines with the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement are politically unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be prohibited by international law.” He called on a United Nations group to develop means, by treaty, political pressure or strict guidelines, to make that happen.That work is futile unless the United States and other major powers lead the way.

By THE SUNDAY GUARDIAN

June 29, 2019 
The role of technology is becoming more and more central to our educational infrastructure, with AI-powered systems transforming the way we teach and learn. This is the age of the hi-tech classroom. 
 
 
Since the inception of the institution of education, the methods of teaching and the bond shared between learners and educators have evolved significantly. Teaching methods across the globe have become more structured to give better, more streamlined results. This transformation can be majorly attributed to the ongoing intervention of technology.
On the back of continuous technological advancement, we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the teaching-learning process. The relationship between educators and students is changing, where educators have become more approachable and much better at understanding their students’ perspectives. Technology has made learning more collaborative, as teachers and students are working in tandem to achieve better outcomes.
This is shrinking the age-old accessibility gap and enabling tailor-made learning experiences for different learners with varied needs. Artificial intelligence (AI), among many technological applications, has a big role in changing old trends in education space. Let’s see how.
Use in administrative tasks
AI, by definition, focuses on machines that are designed to be intelligent enough to work and react like humans. AI has automated drab administrative tasks and cut down on the time and effort teachers used to put in things like assessing students’ work and grading exams. Though earlier AI-led test grading was limited to only objective-type answers, newer AI systems are being designed to assess subjective answers as well.
With this, teachers can now direct their energies towards engaging with their students and dealing with challenges that they are facing. AI is also helping school admission boards by automating classification and processing of paperwork.
For quality education
In an age when technology is shrinking the world, it is also making quality education more accessible to a larger population in the form of smart content. With advanced applications of AI, educators are setting content as per the local needs of the students in different parts of the country. They often offer education through virtual content like video conferencing, lectures etc.
Even the textbooks have transformed as AI systems are now being used to create digital textbooks for specific topics/subjects. This is helping to engage students of all academic grades and ages. Many educational platforms use AI to enable professors to create electronic curriculums and simplify textbook content through various tools.
Tailoring education 
Each student possesses different learning abilities and pace of absorption. Who would have imagined that in a class full of students, teachers could fully identify each one’s strengths and weaknesses and work on them individually. Now, with the help of AI, they put in place systems that work according to the needs of the students.
If a student faces challenges with a particular topic, the system identifies the areas that need to be focused upon. Then, using predictive analysis, it provides help as and when needed. This helps students work at their own pace and brings out the best in them.
Identifies improvement
It is not uncommon for students to grapple with particularly challenging concepts in their curricula. This is where educators step in to ensure that students’ understanding is not limited. But sometimes even the best of teachers might leave a gap in explaining a concept, which could leave students with half-baked knowledge. AI, on multiple online course platforms, is solving this problem. Adopting a utilitarian approach, it analyses the most prevalent trend among students. If the trend is detracting from the intended goal, AI alerts educators and directs students towards the correct answer.
This way it facilitates educators in building a stronger conceptual foundation for all students alike. It helps students with immediate feedback and stops them in their tracks if they are straying and improves their understanding of the subject.
Universal access 
AI-powered learning system makes classrooms accessible to all, including those in another country. This can be highly helpful to those students who are unable to attend school due to an illness or want to study a different course from the one available in their school.
School education in India has seen substantial progress in recent decades, with efforts at both the Central and State levels. Substantive gains in enrolment have been achieved—Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) is 97% at elementary level and 80% at secondary level, as per recent figures. Although the path is long and full of obstacles, the education pioneers of the country have vowed to take the national education system on a par with the global level.
The role of AI is significantly increasing and creating adaptive teaching-learning techniques. A study states that by 2021, the application of AI in education and learning will increase by 47.5%. Beyond academics, it can also streamline students’ career choices.
As the development of new applications of AI is underway, the education industry is gearing up to be a part of the revolution. With its distinct benefits, AI’s presence is ever swelling and in spite of its anticipated significance in the education space, it might surprise us with even greater value in time to come.

A team at the Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute has developed technology they claim can detect tiny algal cells in the ocean before they multiply to create toxic algal blooms.
Toxic algal blooms, also known as 'red tides', pose a risk to human health, damage ecosystems, close fisheries, and hurt the economy. But if a bloom is accurately predicted before it begins, fisheries management can plan for closures in advance.

Shellfish fisheries in particular stand to gain a lot from this type of technology. Shellfish like oysters and mussels are filter feeders, meaning they eat by pumping water through their gills and trapping food particles. With the capacity to filter fifty or more gallons of water in a single day, oysters quickly accumulate the toxic chemicals released by harmful algal blooms. Artificial intelligence technology could inform fisheries management of impending blooms, closing fisheries before any toxic shellfish are collected, thereby preventing fisherman from wasting resources while adding extra protection to consumers.

The technology developed by Nelson can distinguish healthy algal cells from toxic cells, and labels the toxic cells accordingly. Using artificial intelligence is much more efficient than having scientists process samples manually. ""In a sample, there's thousands [of algal cells] and you've got to count them and detect the one or two toxic ones,"" explains Brian Russell, director of the Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute. ""[It's a] really challenging job [for] a trained biologist with a science degree and then one to two years training.""

The Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute is not the first group to develop artificial intelligence to track algae, but their strategy is unique. In addition to automating the identification of algae, Russell's team, in collaboration with the Cawthron Institute, have developed a system that takes a photo and records a 'label' every time a different algae is identified. ""So now we're growing this database of all this labelled data,"" says Russel. ""Basically, it's becoming as expert as the scientist and we can scale it and go faster and faster and faster.""
The Cawthron Institute and Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute recently received $6 million of funding for continued efforts studying and tracking algal blooms, and plan to expand their use of artificial intelligence to help understand why whales beach in New Zealand's Golden Bay.

Also, reliance on robots for the smallest chores will make the human brain feeble.In this world, where the youth struggle and toil to get employed for their daily bread, robots could make matters worse.Imagine having robots conversing with humans, wherein the person wastes time trying to make the robot understand what he actually expects from that piece of technology.Robots need a large capital, maintenance, power, etc, while humans do not.If robots ultimately do all the work, and man just sits and monitor them, then it would cause health hazards and make man idle.If an AI-based diagnosis fails to detect the actual illness of the patient, who would be held responsible for it – the programmer or the artificial intelligence itself? Humans agree to work at a much lower income as compared to the heavy costs required to hire a robot which will affect a company’s profits.India has almost 18 million people who are trapped in the major issue of unemployment.So, why we do need robots when humans are willing to work and contribute to society?AGAINST THE ARGUMENT (By Varad Khedekar, Class 10, Thakur Vidya Mandir High School, Kandivli (East), Mumbai)It is often said that necessity is the mother of invention. To make life convenient and achieve advancement, we humans have been working rigorously in every field. Robots and artificial intelligence are some of the current topics of research and development. But a lot of capital is invested to make or buy robots and they need to be maintained and supplied power for their running. Their software and equipment costs are too high.On the other hand, human resources are quite affordable and reliable. Robots have no sense of emotions or conscience and do not have decision-making abilities to handle difficult situations. Automation can be only done when robots are fed with programmes by humans. According to a report in the United Kingdom, robots and artificial intelligence will create more jobs than they take, in the coming years. Robots lack the ability to create or imagine things as ultimately, they are machines under human control.Humans are the ones who develop new ideas and have the potential to turn imagination into reality.Jobs in health, scientific and technical services or research, hospitality etc, cannot be completely taken over by robots. With the use of artificial intelligence, robots can interpret and learn things, but can never beat the ultimate human mind. Robots eliminate dangerous jobs for humans because they can work in hazardous environments. AI would have a low error rate and have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed, resulting in efficient and fast work for humans.In the future, we may see a robotic world, but the master key will always lie in human hands.","{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/1600x900.jpg', 'caption': 'Attendees watch a demonstration performed by robotic arms at the MWC Shanghai exhibition in Shanghai, China.', 'description': 'Attendees watch a demonstration performed by robotic arms at the MWC Shanghai exhibition in Shanghai, China.', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oxford Economics: Robots are here and they are after your job

Although robots and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have boosted global productivity and economic growth, more than 2,030 manufacturing jobs now performed by humans will be lost to innovation in the coming decade, according to a new report released Wednesday (June 26) by United Kingdom’s Oxford Economics.
In a 64-page report entitled “How Robots Change the World,” Oxford CEO and Chief Economist Adrian Cooper said the robotics revolution is rapidly accelerating, as fast-paced technological advances in automation, engineering, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and machine learning converge. The result, Cooper concludes, will transform the capabilities of robots and their ability to take over tasks once carried out by humans.


According to data from the eye-raising report, the number of robots in use worldwide multiplied three-fold over the past two decades, to 2.25 million. Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030, with 14 million in China alone.
“The implications are immense, and the emerging challenges for governments and policymakers are equally daunting in their scale,” said Cooper in the report’s foreword.
Cooper continued: “The rise of the robots will boost productivity and economic growth. It will lead, too, to the creation of new jobs in yet-to-exist industries, in a process of ‘creative destruction.’ But existing business models across many sectors will be seriously disrupted. And tens of millions of existing jobs will be lost, with human workers displaced by robots at an increasing rate as robots become steadily more sophisticated.”
For both people and businesses, Cooper said the effects of these job losses will vary greatly across countries and regions, with a disproportionate toll on lower-skilled workers and on poorer local economies. In many places, the impact will aggravate social and economic stresses from unemployment and income inequality in times when increasing political polarization is already a worrying trend.
As noted, every third robot worldwide is now installed in China, which accounts for around one-fifth of the world’s total stock of robots — up from just 0.1% in 2000, the report states. In 2017, China expanded its lead as the world’s largest market for industrial robots, accounting for 36% of global sales, up from 30% in 2016.
If this trajectory of investment continues, robots in use in China by 2030 will dwarf the rest of the world’s stock of industrial androids as it reinforces its position as the world’s primary manufacturing hub. By contrast, though it has grown by around 370,000 units since 2000, the combined robot inventory of the U.S. and Europe has fallen to under 40% of the global share from its peak of close to 50% in 2009.
In Japan, formerly the world leader in automation, the active stock of robots has been reduced by around 100,000 units since the start of the millennium, in line with a rebalancing of its economy away from manufacturing and the migration of many production facilities offshore, especially to China.
Closer to home, the report notes that the most defenseless states to the robot revolution in the U.S. are Oregon, Louisiana, Texas, Indiana and North Carolina. Those “high vulnerability” states are generally associated with steel-making and heavy industry.
On the other hand, most New England states have low vulnerability to the future spread of manufacturing robots, as well as those with a higher reliance on tourism such as Florida, Nevada and Hawaii. Arkansas is listed as a “lower-medium” risk due to the state’s robust tourism sector and fast-growing service sector.
SERVICE SECTOR BOTS ON THE WAY
Although the report highlights how the rise of industrial robots has already reduced manufacturing employment significantly in advanced economies around the world, those blue collars jobs only account for a minor share of total employment in these countries. Instead, according to the latest Oxford estimates, most people work in the sprawling service sector— around three-quarters of all workers.
To date, the adoption rate for physical robots across service industries has been slow for many reasons, which doesn’t count software-only bots and applications that have already gained wide acceptance in powering process automation, the report states. For one, the underlying return on large capital investments can be harder to justify in environments without significant scale. Also, many aspects of service work can prove difficult to automate.
“However, innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computing power suggest a significant acceleration is coming, particularly in the category of logistics systems—led in part by the global expansion of Amazon and other multinational e-commerce companies,” the report states.
To complete the study, Oxford said it brought together a team of economists, econometricians, modelers and technology experts from across its worldwide network of over 250 analysts to conduct an extensive research study to analyze the robotics phenomenon.

The back-end processing staff has reportedly been offered or deployed in new job roles.Accenture’s India operations, which mainly include credit card and mortgage application processing, have been automated with Artificial intelligence and virtual chatbots, according to a ZDNet report. Earlier, the company had 110,000 people onboard to perform the same tasks that have now been automated. However, this has given the company an edge over other in terms of new hires and their training, Amit Bansal, Accenture’s Managing Director, analytics delivery lead APAC told ZDNet. While the company hasn’t disclosed the nature of the new jobs, in the past other IT majors have also sought to retrain and redeploy staff in other areas. For instance, in 2015, Wipro retrained 75,000 in Artificial Intelligence and cognitive technologies under its project NextGen. Of this, the employees that did not qualify for the digital business remained in the technology sector, Wipro CEO, Abidali Z. Neemuchwala told Livemint.A recent report by McKinsey Global Institute has shown that automation will cost India a major transition in jobs over the next 10 years — mostly the clerical and in-service jobs including administrative positions. This shift in roles will affect nearly 11 million working women in India. However, with the advent of automation and new algorithms, many new job roles have been introduced. This is expected to create 133 million new opportunities in the job market, according to the World Economic Forum.Accenture was recently ranked first on the HFS research top ten report for Google AI Services 2019 based on the innovation, execution and client feedback on the Google Artificial Intelligence.See also:Automation will affect women the most in the Indian job market: ReportFinancial services sector to add 47,800 new jobs — Delhi, Mumbai top locationsHere’s how much an IT employee makes in different countries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share full article186Read in appConor Sprouls at a MetLife call center where software using artificial intelligence gives workers feedback.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesBy Kevin RooseJune 23, 2019Leer en españolWhen Conor Sprouls, a customer service representative in the call center of the insurance giant MetLife talks to a customer over the phone, he keeps one eye on the bottom-right corner of his screen. There, in a little blue box, A.I. tells him how he’s doing.Talking too fast? The program flashes an icon of a speedometer, indicating that he should slow down.Sound sleepy? The software displays an “energy cue,” with a picture of a coffee cup.Not empathetic enough? A heart icon pops up.For decades, people have fearfully imagined armies of hyper-efficient robots invading offices and factories, gobbling up jobs once done by humans. But in all of the worry about the potential of artificial intelligence to replace rank-and-file workers, we may have overlooked the possibility it will replace the bosses, too.ImageThe application Cogito on view on a monitor.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesMr. Sprouls and the other call center workers at his office in Warwick, R.I., still have plenty of human supervisors. But the software on their screens — made by Cogito, an A.I. company in Boston — has become a kind of adjunct manager, always watching them. At the end of every call, Mr. Sprouls’s Cogito notifications are tallied and added to a statistics dashboard that his supervisor can view. If he hides the Cogito window by minimizing it, the program notifies his supervisor.Cogito is one of several A.I. programs used in call centers and other workplaces. The goal, according to Joshua Feast, Cogito’s chief executive, is to make workers more effective by giving them real-time feedback.“There is variability in human performance,” Mr. Feast said. “We can infer from the way people are speaking with each other whether things are going well or not.”The goal of automation has always been efficiency, but in this new kind of workplace, A.I. sees humanity itself as the thing to be optimized. Amazon uses complex algorithms to track worker productivity in its fulfillment centers, and can automatically generate the paperwork to fire workers who don’t meet their targets, as The Verge uncovered this year. (Amazon has disputed that it fires workers without human input, saying that managers can intervene in the process.) IBM has used Watson, its A.I. platform, during employee reviews to predict future performance and claims it has a 96 percent accuracy rate.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThen there are the start-ups. Cogito, which works with large insurance companies like MetLife and Humana as well as financial and retail firms, says it has 20,000 users. Percolata, a Silicon Valley company that counts Uniqlo and 7-Eleven among its clients, uses in-store sensors to calculate a “true productivity” score for each worker, and rank workers from most to least productive.ImageSamantha Sinon knitting while she waits for the next call at MetLife’s center in Warwick, R.I.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageAaron Osei, another employee at the center.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesManagement by algorithm is not a new concept. In the early 20th century, Frederick Winslow Taylor revolutionized the manufacturing world with his “scientific management” theory, which tried to wring inefficiency out of factories by timing and measuring each aspect of a job. More recently, Uber, Lyft and other on-demand platforms have made billions of dollars by outsourcing conventional tasks of human resources — scheduling, payroll, performance reviews — to computers.But using A.I. to manage workers in conventional, 9-to-5 jobs has been more controversial. Critics have accused companies of using algorithms for managerial tasks, saying that automated systems can dehumanize and unfairly punish employees. And while it’s clear why executives would want A.I. that can track everything their workers do, it’s less clear why workers would.ImageMetLife uses the A.I. software with 1,500 of its call center employees.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York Times“It is surreal to think that any company could fire their own workers without any human involvement,” Marc Perrone, the president of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents food and retail workers, said in a statement about Amazon in April. 

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.In the gig economy, management by algorithm has also been a source of tension between workers and the platforms that connect them with customers. This year, drivers for Postmates, DoorDash and other on-demand delivery companies protested a method of calculating their pay, using an algorithm, that put customer tips toward guaranteed minimum wages — a practice that was nearly invisible to drivers, because of the way the platform obscures the details of worker pay.There were no protests at MetLife’s call center. Instead, the employees I spoke with seemed to view their Cogito software as a mild annoyance at worst. Several said they liked getting pop-up notifications during their calls, although some said they had struggled to figure out how to get the “empathy” notification to stop appearing. (Cogito says the A.I. analyzes subtle differences in tone between the worker and the caller and encourages the worker to try to mirror the customer’s mood.)MetLife, which uses the software with 1,500 of its call center employees, says using the app has increased its customer satisfaction by 13 percent.ImageWinners of contests and employee photos are pinned up in the office.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageA team performance board.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It actually changes people’s behavior without them knowing about it,” said Christopher Smith, MetLife’s head of global operations. “It becomes a more human interaction.”Still, there is a creepy sci-fi vibe to a situation in which A.I. surveils human workers and tells them how to relate to other humans. And it is reminiscent of the “workplace gamification” trend that swept through corporate America a decade ago, when companies used psychological tricks borrowed from video games, like badges and leader boards, to try to spur workers to perform better.Phil Libin, the chief executive of All Turtles, an A.I. start-up studio in San Francisco, recoiled in horror when I told him about my call center visit.“That is a dystopian hellscape,” Mr. Libin said. “Why would anyone want to build this world where you’re being judged by an opaque, black-box computer?”Defenders of workplace A.I. might argue that these systems are not meant to be overbearing. Instead, they’re meant to make workers better by reminding them to thank the customer, to empathize with the frustrated claimant on Line 1 or to avoid slacking off on the job.ImageIcons that are used in Cogito are placed around the MetLife call center.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesThe best argument for workplace A.I. may be situations in which human bias skews decision-making, such as hiring. Pymetrics, a New York start-up, has made inroads in the corporate hiring world by replacing the traditional résumé screening process with an A.I. program that uses a series of games to test for relevant skills. The algorithms are then analyzed to make sure they are not creating biased hiring outcomes, or favoring one group over another.“We can tweak data and algorithms until we can remove the bias. We can’t do that with a human being,” said Frida Polli, Pymetrics’ chief executive.Using A.I. to correct for human biases is a good thing. But as more A.I. enters the workplace, executives will have to resist the temptation to use it to tighten their grip on their workers and subject them to constant surveillance and analysis. If that happens, it won’t be the robots staging an uprising.Follow Kevin Roose on Twitter: @kevinroose.Kevin Roose is a columnist for Business Day and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

 Eight Essential Interview Questions CEOs Swear By













Microsoft was one of the earliest companies to begin discussing and advocating for an ethical perspective on artificial intelligence. The issue began to take off at the company in 2016, when CEO Satya Nadella spoke at a developer conference about how the company viewed some of the ethical issues around AI, and later that year published an article about these issues. Nadella’s primary focus was on Microsoft’s orientation toward using AI to augment human capabilities and building trust into intelligent products. The next year, Microsoft’s R&D head Eric Horvitz partnered with Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer Brad Smith to form Aether, a cross-functional committee addressing AI and ethics in engineering and research. 
With these foundations laid, in 2018, Microsoft established a full-time position in AI policy and ethics. Tim O’Brien, who has been with Microsoft for 15 years as a general manager, first in platform strategy and then global communications, took on the role. 
Of course, many organizations are increasingly paying attention to ethical issues around AI. In a 2018 Deloitte survey, 32% of AI-aware executives ranked the ethical risks of AI as one of their top three AI-related concerns. Microsoft and O’Brien are essentially bellwethers on this issue — the figurative sheep at the head of the flock — in creating a role focused on, as O’Brien puts it, AI ethics “advocacy and evangelism.” 
I talked with O’Brien to find out how his role came about, what he does in it, and what kinds of policies might emerge at Microsoft because of his work. I also asked him how the AI ethicist role might relate to similar positions at other companies.
How the AI Ethicist Job Came About
O’Brien told me that he was inspired by the early steps Microsoft’s leaders had taken on AI ethics, and that he asked to pursue the topic for the company as his primary job. He’d been a product marketer for various tech companies early in his career and spent much of the last 15 years at Microsoft pitching developers on why they should build stuff on the company’s platforms.

I asked O’Brien if he was hiding a philosophy or theology degree on his LinkedIn profile, but he laughingly said no. He said he did have some exposure to ethics issues in his business law classes as an MBA student and that he went to a Jesuit high school — a Catholic order known for its focus on ethics and philosophy. That’s it, though, for his formal educational preparation in ethics.
His interest developed when was running Microsoft’s Global Communications function outside the U.S., a role that had him traveling constantly and frequently exposed to the “geopolitics of technology,” as he put it. He began to realize, he said, that leaving all of businesses’ ethical and policy issues to the lawyers was not sufficient. O’Brien was seeing that, as data and processing move to the cloud, technology, policy, and geography issues all were starting to collide. 
O’Brien was quick to point out that he’s standing on the shoulders of giants. “Most of the ideas I talk about are not mine,” he said. He mentioned that Microsoft president Smith has been preaching the AI ethics gospel for several years now, and indeed Smith speaks and writes regularly about the need to consider the ethical, social, and political aspects of the technology. O’Brien sees part of his role as helping to disseminate Smith’s ideas at scale — Smith is a powerful steward for responsible AI at Microsoft, but he’s a busy guy. And the ethical issues around AI are sufficiently complex and nuanced that Smith can’t campaign for them all.
How an AI Ethicist Spends His Time
O’Brien’s job began in May 2018, and he began traveling around the world almost immediately. His primary activities have included giving speeches at conferences, meeting with Microsoft customers, leading a research effort, talking with analysts and researchers, and coordinating activity across Microsoft. 
O’Brien’s presentations have focused on topics such as avoiding algorithmic bias and creating transparency in AI models. Some of Microsoft’s ideas on these issues have been described in the press. It’s important to clarify that although O’Brien’s job title is focused on AI, he promotes ethical perspectives on all information technologies. O’Brien said he views AI as the “spark that lit ethics in tech,” including analytics, the internet of things, and virtual and augmented reality, as well as AI. Many solutions in the real world are, of course, hybrids of these technologies.









The goal of the research initiative he heads is to develop a global perspective on tech ethics. In his previous job, O’Brien observed that different societies around the world have very different perspectives on privacy and ethics. Just within Europe, for example, U.K. citizens are willing to tolerate video camera monitoring on London’s central High Street, perhaps because of IRA bombings of the past, while Germans are much more privacy oriented, influenced by the former intrusions of East German Stasi spies. O’Brien suggested that in China, the public is tolerant of AI-driven applications like facial recognition and social credit scores at least in part because social order is a key tenet of Confucian moral philosophy. 
Microsoft’s AI ethics research project involves ethnographic analysis of different cultures, gathered through close observation of behaviors, and advice from external academics such as Erin Meyer of INSEAD, who wrote The Culture Map. It may result in a number of publications, depending on the findings. My feeling, and O’Brien’s as well, is that there aren’t a lot of sources out there on global tech ethics. This research could start to fill that gap.
Within Microsoft, O’Brien is trying to extend the community of people who are focused on the ethics topic. He sent me a collection of materials suggesting that lots of people are already engaged. The materials include, for example, a blog post on Microsoft guidelines about developing responsible conversation bots (no doubt occasioned by the off-the-rails comments from the Tay AI chatbot research project in 2016). They also include a presentation and article on intelligible models in health care, and an internal project for a “learning door” that recognizes (with opt-in) who is coming in and out of Microsoft buildings. O’Brien said he works closely with Smith’s legal team and also has a matrixed reporting relationship to Eric Horvitz, technical fellow and director at Microsoft Research Labs. Of course, Microsoft is a big company, but awareness of AI ethics seems to be catching on rapidly and broadly there.
This bottom-up, middle-out approach to change is what CEO Nadella is trying to inculcate within the Microsoft culture. The days of asking for a million dollars and a hundred people for a new project are over, O’Brien says. The desired approach is to get an idea in action and try to attract the needed resources over time.

AI Policy Development at Microsoft
O’Brien expects that there will eventually be a collection of policies within Microsoft about how to use AI and related technologies. Some have already emerged, such as Smith’s 2018 directive on facial recognition technologies, which stated through a blog post that Microsoft would not sell its technology for facial recognition in ways that can “adversely affect consumers and citizens” or “encroach on democratic freedoms and human rights.” 
O’Brien believes there will be a number of other policies that the company will define, from avoiding algorithmic bias to model transparency to specific applications like predictive policing. Microsoft’s activism in the privacy and ethics space isn’t new; it has battled the U.S. government on the privacy of sensitive customer data in the cloud (the case was eventually vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court after legislative action), and also filed a brief in support of Apple’s privacy position on the iPhone linked to the shootings that took place in 2015 in San Bernadino, California.
But there are many questions on which concrete policies remain to be developed. O’Brien mentions, for example, mistakes made by AI systems and legal remediation for harm from AI. He believes that the most interesting part of the field is the many unresolved questions within it. 
Microsoft is a big player in AI and tech more broadly, so there is little doubt in my mind that having an AI ethicist role is a good idea for the company. In the time since O’Brien was named to the role, Salesforce.com and a few other vendors have created similar positions. Other companies that are not major IT vendors may not want to advocate as strongly in public about AI-related issues. And it wouldn’t be a good idea to create an AI ethicist role without the strong leadership and support from senior executives that Microsoft exhibits. However, as I have suggested, many other businesses will face issues similar to the ones that O’Brien is wrestling with for Microsoft, and having an internal role or group to address them will be useful.

It is so uplifting to read and witness evidence of advancing the humanities through increased focus on these most fundamental and cardinal topics of Ethics and philosophy. Maybe we should rightly also call it a retrospective and revisit to our heritage - as O'Brien mentions, we are standing on shoulders of giants - founding fathers of Ethics include Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, and the list goes on and on. When push comes to show it is all we got.  This is about technology, not just AI as O'Brien points out, it is about technology ethics and then it automatically ultimately is ALL about humans. And although lawyers are humans Technology Ethics and for that matter Business Ethics is about more than the law, being a regulative idea at best, Ethics is about life in the broadest sense and how humans interact with each other and e.g. technology - in short, the law does not suffice! It's a relief to see a guy on that level have the courage to go beyond ""AI"" and embrace the Technology domain fully - bravo. These initiatives by MS, SF, SAP et. al. are recommendable and as O'Brien indicates needs to broader than AI, and even broader that Technology - with recent years scandals we need Ethics on the agenda in Business in general. I'm both sorry and happy to state that Legal and compliance will no longer suffice.

It was adopted during the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education, held in Beijing from 16 – 18 May 2019, by over 50 government ministers, international representatives from over 105 Member States and almost 100 representatives from UN agencies, academic institutions, civil society and the private sector.The Beijing Consensus comes after the Qingdao Declaration of 2015, in which UNESCO Member States committed to efficiently harness emerging technologies for the achievement of SDG 4.Ms Stefania Giannini, Assistant Director-General for Education at UNESCO, stated that ‘’we need to renew this commitment as we move towards an era in which artificial intelligence – a convergence of emerging technologies – is transforming every aspect of our lives (…) we need to steer this revolution in the right direction, to improve livelihoods, to reduce inequalities and promote a fair and inclusive globalization.’’The Consensus affirms that the deployment of AI technologies in education should be purposed to enhance human capacities and to protect human rights for effective human-machine collaboration in life, learning and work, and for sustainable development. The Consensus states that the systematic integration of AI in education has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today, innovate teaching and learning practices, and ultimately accelerate the progress towards SDG 4. In summary, the Beijing Consensus recommends governments and other stakeholders in UNESCO’s Member States to:Plan AI in education policies in response to the opportunities and challenges AI technologies bring, from a whole-government, multi-stakeholder, and inter-sectoral approach, that also allow for setting up local strategic priorities to achieve SDG 4 targetsSupport the development of new models enabled by AI technologies for delivering education and training where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and use AI tools to offer lifelong learning systems which enable personalized learning anytime, anywhere, for anyoneConsider the use of relevant data where appropriate to drive the development of evidence-based policy planningEnsure AI technologies are used to empower teachers rather than replace them, and develop appropriate capacity-building programmes for teachers to work alongside AI systemsPrepare the next generation of existing workforce with the values and skills for life and work most relevant in the AI eraPromote equitable and inclusive use of AI irrespective of disability, social or economic status, ethnic or cultural background or geographical location, with a strong emphasis on gender equality, as well as ensure ethical, transparent and auditable uses of educational dataThe Consensus also details its ambitions for UNESCO to act as a support system for the capacity building of education policy-makers to implement the recommended measures, and to act as a convener for financing, partnership and international cooperation together with other international organizations and partners active in the field of AI in education.Suggested implementations for the Director-General of UNESCO include the establishment of an ‘AI for Education’ platform that would supply crucial resources for open consultation, such as open-source AI courses & tools, policies and best practices. Together with UNESCO Member States, the DG is encouraged to develop guidelines and further resources for effective and equitable use of AI in education.The Consensus also recognizes the pressing issue of country and regional divides in AI development, and tasks partners and international organizations to monitor and assess the impact of these divides, keeping in mind the risk of polarization between those who have access to it and those who do not.Together with partners, international organizations, and the key values that UNESCO holds as pillars of their mandate, UNESCO hopes to strengthen their leading role in AI in education.As Ms Giannini has said; ‘’implementing AI in and for Education is about shifting from competition to cooperation.

Artificial intelligence experts interviewed in a new video series say government’s adoption of AI technologies is accelerating — and they predict AI’s role as a virtual assistant will help federal workers rather than lead to job losses.
The “AI Innovators” video series, produced by FedScoop and underwritten by Accenture, brought together public sector experts to discuss the impact AI is expected to have on agencies’ ability to fulfill their missions and serve citizens.
These leaders also lay out some of the key issues agencies will need to face as AI tools play a greater role in the daily workloads and decisions of federal workers. Among other questions, the series explores:
What is the future of artificial intelligence?
“The No. 1 thing that leads adoption of technology is utility,” says Margaret Smith, senior manager analytics at Accenture Federal Services.
As more individuals become accustomed to small AI features in their everyday life — for example recommendation or optimal route suggestions on GPS — AI becomes ingrained in workers’ expectations. That will put increased pressure on government to keep pace with advancements from the private sector to match citizens’ expectations.
AI features can also improve service work, such as enhancing the patient-practitioner partnership, explains Kristen Honey, innovator in residence in the office of the CTO at the Department of Health and Human Services.
“AI and algorithms could do more for data mining and translation work so that practitioners can get back to focusing on the patients,” Honey explains.
In regard to national security, Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, director for the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center doesn’t envision any part of the Department of Defense that will not be enhanced by AI; including everything from multi-domain operations at the edge, all the way to the back-office business functions.
“If we imagine a future 20 years hence … and the DOD is a completely AI-enabled force, the fact that it is would not by itself imply that we will win [future conflicts]. But if we do not have a fully AI-enabled force, in my opinion we would incur an unacceptably high risk of losing that conflict,” he cautions.
In a future where data and algorithms are critical to AI functioning correctly, the rise of the chief data officer role is key, said Timothy Persons, chief scientist and managing director at the Government Accountability Office. There needs to be a symbiosis between the CIO and the perspective of chief data officers, where both see data “not just as a burden for the CIO to manage and secure…but for data to become a key asset of the way federal agencies think.”
How will artificial intelligence impact our work?
Often agencies have more work than people to do that work, and leaders see how AI can be a solution to some workforce gaps.
“If there is a way to unpack a job into tasks that are very routine, there’s a way to have an AI co-worker work alongside one of the government workers…[that] lets them focus on things they really want to spend time on,” shares Dominic Delmolino, CTO at Accenture Federal Services.
GAO’s Persons adds that by taking hours off processing time for employees to synthesize vast amounts of information “allows us to be better versions of ourselves.”
There is a lot of ways to prioritize what AI initiatives to focus on, elaborates Smith, “but what’s most effective is identifying tasks people don’t like doing; daily jobs or routines that no one likes to do, but they have to.”
What are the limitations of artificial intelligence?
Many leaders agree that the biggest limitation to implementing AI tools is a cultural barrier.
“What we need are more people that have the breadth and depth of understanding what AI can do,” Shanahan said. He shares the need to grow generations of people that have experience implementing AI, otherwise it will remain out of reach for organizations to grasp “the art of the possible.”
Persons echoes the need for a younger generation to move into management positions with people who are digital natives; those who know how to deal with data and think algorithmically. There is a difference between augmenting human tasks with the AI versus doing the same thing in a more routinized way, he says.
But overall most agree with a sentiment stated by Shanahan, “There is no time better than the present to dive into AI and get a project started. Admiring the problem from afar won’t do anything to accelerate the adoption and integration of AI to achieve impact of mission at scale.”
Other participants in the AI Innovators video series include:

Ira Entis, Managing Director, Growth and Strategy, Accenture Federal Services
Courtney Winship, Chief, Digital Services Division, Office of Citizenship & Applicant Information Services, USCIS
Charles Worthington, CTO and Sr. Technology Advisor, Department of Veterans Affairs
Keith Nakasone, Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Acquisition, Office IT Category, GSA

June 25, 2019 - The White House is calling for more transparency and “explainability” in healthcare artificial intelligence.
Currently many algorithms are opaque to users, which creates problems for doctors, who need transparency to justify their diagnoses or treatment of patients.
This is one argument made by the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan: 2019 Update released June 21 by the National Science and Technology Council in the Executive Office of the President.

“AI techniques such as decision-tree induction provide built-in explanations but are generally less accurate. Thus, researchers must develop systems that are transparent, and intrinsically capable of explaining the reasons for their results to users,” particularly in healthcare, the plan argued.
For the 2019 update, the council issued a request for information (RFI) in August of last year to get public feedback on ways the strategic plan should be revised or improved. This feedback, as well as an independent agency review, led to the update of the 2016 plan.
“A significant number of responses noted the importance of investing in the application of AI in areas such as manufacturing and supply chains; healthcare; medical imaging; meteorology, hydrology, climatology, and related areas; cybersecurity; education; data-intensive physical sciences such as high-energy physics; and transportation,” the plan related.
Respondents also argued for fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency in AI systems, as well as curated and accessible datasets, workforce implications, and public-private partnerships in AI research and development. 
Noting the rapid rise of privately funded AI R&D projects and the rapid adoption of AI by industry, respondents also advocated increased federal government engagement with the private sector.
Strategic Priorities for Federally Funded AI Research
The plan identified eight strategic priorities for federally funded AI research:

Make long-term investments in AI research; prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a leader in AI
Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration; increase understanding of how to create AI systems that complement and augment human capabilities
Address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI; research AI systems that incorporate ethical, legal, and societal concerns through technical mechanisms
Ensure the safety and security of AI systems; advance knowledge of how to design AI systems that are reliable, dependable, safe, and trustworthy
Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing; enable access to high-quality datasets and environments, as well as to testing and training resources
Evaluate AI technologies using standards and benchmarks; develop a spectrum of evaluative techniques for AI
Understand the national AI R&D workforce needs; improve opportunities for workforce development to foster an AI-ready workforce
Expand public-private partnerships to accelerate advances in AI; promote opportunities for sustained investment in AI R&D and for transitioning advances into capabilities, in collaboration with academia, industry, international partners, and other non-federal entities

“AI has advanced tremendously and today promises better, more accurate healthcare; enhanced national security; improved transportation; and more effective education, to name just a few benefits. Increased computing power, the availability of large datasets and streaming data, and algorithmic advances in machine learning (ML) have made it possible for AI development to create new sectors of the economy and revitalize industries,” the plan noted.
“AI technologies are critical for addressing a range of long-term challenges, such as constructing advanced healthcare systems, a robust intelligent transportation system, and resilient energy and telecommunication networks,” the plan concluded.

India will need a lot more talent in the space. ""Only 1-2% of India's workforce in the tech and financial sectors have AI/ ML (machine learning) and data science knowledge,"" says Santanu Paul, CEO of Hyderabad-based edtech player TalentSprint, which launched an executive programme in AI/ML in association with IIIT-H last year. 69834351 LinkedIn said last year that seven out of 10 emerging jobs in India are tech-focused roles hinged on AI/ML, with ML engineer being the top job in the list.Nasscom says emerging job roles in AI include that of data architect, applied scientist, ML speech vision, analyst BI, and DevOps Engineer. Ajay Shah, head of recruitment services at HR solutions provider Teamlease, says the average hike being commanded by AI professionals while switching jobs would be 40-50%, compared to 20-30% for other skills. 69888507 Paul said he is seeing more techies with 7-15 years of work experience going for the programme.""When we started, we thought the course would get working professionals with 5-7 years of experience, as they are early in their career. But surprisingly, the average is much higher. Sometimes we think that people who will want something are the people who have the most to gain, but actually people who want something are the ones who have the most to lose. These people have resources, but also have mortgages, children in schools/colleges and cannot afford to lose the lifestyle they have built over the years,"" he says. 69888508 Hari Krishnan Nair, co founder of training provider Great Learning, agrees. He says the rising interest from senior professionals looking to understand more about AI and its applications across industries has persuaded them to work on crafting a programme specifically for them. He says a lot of professionals are enrolling for such programmes because there are significant projects happening in their organisations around AI and they want to be a part of them.Another trend, Nair says, is the increase in enquiries for programmes in AI from school and college students. ""While their numbers aren't significant, they are clearly aware of AI playing a big role in their careers and want to be prepared,"" he says.V Rajanna, global head of the technology business unit in TCS, says technological advancements have historically reshaped skill requirements, but the pace at which today's next-generation technologies are developing and disrupting the global talent market is unprecedented.""Continuous competency enhancement at scale and speed is more paramount than ever before and has become a key success factor in this digital age,"" he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/69883603'}",,,,,,,,,

While the world got the first glimpse of a fully autonomous ferry thanks to the collaboration between Rolls-Royce and Finferries, the state-owned ferry operator of Finland, there’s still quite a bit of work to be done before we can expect the world’s waterways to be overtaken with autonomous vessels.








The Incredible Autonomous Ships Of The Future: Run By Artificial Intelligence Rather Than A Crew

Levels of Autonomy
Even though we might be years or even decades away from the majority of vessels becoming autonomous, there are certainly artificial intelligence algorithms at work today. A fully autonomous ship would be considered a vessel that can operate on its own without a crew. Remote ships are those that are operated by a human from shore, and an automated ship runs software that manages its movements. As the technology matures, more types of ships will likely transition from being manned to having some autonomous capabilities. Autonomous ships might be used for some applications, but it's quite possible that there will still be crew onboard some ships even if all hurdles to acquiring a fully autonomous fleet are crossed.
Autonomy in Ships
As we saw with the Finnish ferry, the first autonomous ships will be deployed on simple inland or coastal liner applications where waters are calm, the route is simple, and there isn't much traffic.
PROMOTED
There’s also an inland electric container ship, Yara Birkeland, under construction that is expected to be completed in 2020 and fully autonomous by 2022. Some companies are building fully autonomous ships from scratch, while other start-ups are developing semi-autonomous systems to be used on existing vessels. When Rolls-Royce sold its autonomous maritime division to Kongsberg, it gave the Norwegian company a boost in its goal of being a leader in the autonomous shipping industry. Samsung is another company that uses machine learning, augmented reality, analytics, and more to create a smart shipping platform through its Samsung Heavy Industries division.
Existing cargo ships have the chance to get retrofitted with autonomous technologies thanks to the efforts of start-ups such as San Francisco-based Shone. Shone’s technology helps crews with piloting assistance and to detect and predict the movement of other vessels in the waterway.
Benefits of Autonomous Ships
Just as artificial intelligence and autonomy promise in other applications, it is expected that autonomous ships can improve safety, increase efficiency, and relieve humans from unsafe and repetitive tasks.
According to a study by Allianz, between 75% and 96% of maritime accidents are caused by human error. If autonomous and semi-autonomous systems can help reduce the reliance on humans that can make mistakes due to fatigue or bad judgment, autonomous ships could eventually make our oceans safer. Even if a crew is on board, the data gathered from the ship’s sensors combined with artificial intelligence algorithms will help the crew make better-informed decisions.
A reduction or elimination of crew reduces the personnel and auxiliary costs (such as onboard provisions and insurance) on a voyage. Typically, crew-related expenses account for 30% of the budget. There are also efficiencies realized in ship design and use of fuel. One study projected savings of more than $7 million over 25 years per autonomous vessel from fuel savings and crew supplies and salaries.
Hurdles to Overcome
Since there are significant safety concerns especially with the enormous size of most ships operating in congested waters, there is a lot more testing to be done and regulations to be sorted out before we will see fully autonomous vessels operating without a crew. Much more likely is that automated technologies will be used to reduce crews and to help the crew onboard make effective decisions. In addition to ensuring the safety of ships, there needs to be a resolution about the regulation of our shared water. Existing international conventions were created under the assumption a crew would be on board. In response, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has kicked off its work to assess and update conventions to ensure safety in a new reality when AI is the captain instead of humans.
Until there is significant interest in fast-tracking research, development, and updates to regulations for autonomous ships, the industry will likely learn from the decisions made on land regarding autonomous cars and then apply that to autonomous ships. Adoption and acceptance of autonomous cars in the coming years may put pressure on finding the same solutions for the sea.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The application of artificial intelligence to IT operations -- or AIOps -- enables an organization to codify existing IT knowledge, based upon historical data and information. For IT practitioners, this produces a number of benefits, including reduced manual efforts and more time for strategic tasks.







Before implementing AI-based IT service management (ITSM) tools, however, buyers need to assess features around automation and integration, as well as licensing and pricing models.

What to buy
AI-based ITSM platforms have a similar, overarching goal -- to make it easier to interact with ITSM processes and reduce or eliminate the tedious and repetitive work that often comes with end-user support. For example, chatbots and virtual agents engage an end user in a conversation-like interaction to simplify service requests and incident logging.
More specifically, the AI-based ITSM market focuses on three areas. The first, and perhaps most prevalent, is service desk augmentation. Chatbots and virtual agents are the dominant tools, enabling self-help capabilities for end users and deflecting contacts from the service desk. The second area is automation. Process orchestration and robotic process automation take on the often tedious and repetitive tasks that IT organizations perform. The third area is data and operational consolidation. Machine learning and natural language processing enhance automation platforms, enabling them to interpret and apply appropriate, context-specific actions.
Some AI-enabled ITSM tools address the repetitive aspects of service desk work, but also the broader operation of an IT environment. These tools might proactively respond to events, but also interpret existing data, predict performance and suggest certain actions. Other tools offer low code/no code capabilities for visual workflow design; integration kits to work alongside other, non-ITSM tools; and AI-assisted workflow design.
While it is possible for an organization to use open source platforms and APIs to build its own AI features and tools, this places the burden of maintenance and support on the organization itself.


How to buy
AI-based ITSM systems are typically available in one of the following three ways:

AI functionality integrates with the ITSM platform: Some of the ITSM tool vendors, such as SysAid and Micro Focus, have integrated AI features like chatbots and machine learning into their main product offering.
AI functionality is available as a separate module, feature or add-on to the ITSM tool. ServiceNow’s ITSM Pro package and ManageEngine’s Zia plug-in for ServiceDesk Plus Cloud are examples of this approach.
AI functionality is available as a stand-alone platform: These vendors provide integrations with disparate data sources and multiple tools, providing a single IT management view. AISERA and BigPanda are among some of the vendor examples of this approach.



Editor's note: With extensive research into the ITSM tool market, TechTarget editors have focused this series of articles on vendors with considerable market presence and that offer ITSM tools with AI functionalities that can be classified as responsive, proactive, predictive and autonomous. Our research included Gartner, Forrester Research and TechTarget surveys.


AI-enabled ITSM tools also follow a broad range of licensing models, including the following:

Per user or per named user: The price of AI functionality is based on the number of users of the product.
Per transaction or bundles of transactions: Pricing is based on the number of transactions the AI feature executes, such as during chatbot use. Some vendors provide bundled pricing, where users can purchase blocks of transactions to help predict and control costs.
Number of workflow automations: This is similar to the transaction licensing model, but based on the number of workflow automations configured within the product.
Number of integrations: Pricing is based on the number of integrations configured within the tool.
Value-based: The price of the license is based on the value that the system provides to the organization.



Good data enables good AI
For an AI-enabled ITSM tool to be successful, it requires relevant data and information.






To understand tool-based intelligence, buyers should think in terms of the data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW) model and how its hierarchy enables better information science.
The data, information and knowledge layers represent current and historical operations. ITSM practitioners typically apply their individual knowledge or repository-based knowledge in reaction to events and circumstances within the managed IT environment. Knowledge sharing is only voluntary, so various team members will repeatedly solve issues that are already known to the organization. Knowledge-based reactions are also vulnerable to the individual's perception and interpretation of data and information. Wisdom, in this operating model, is the byproduct of time and experience. Seasoned ITSM practitioners can answer the why do and know why questions, but their wisdom is transactional and easily lost.



Before implementing AI-enabled ITSM tools, however, buyers need to assess features around automation and integration, as well as licensing and pricing models.




AI-enabled ITSM products promise to codify the knowledge gleaned from historical data and information to help practitioners look ahead, develop strategies and evaluate opportunities. AI can also develop new knowledge from new data and information, at a scale greater than individuals could achieve.
Make no mistake: Effective AI use is not just the result of good knowledgebase articles. Incident and request records can also help AIOps tools ""learn,"" and an accurate and well-maintained configuration management database (CMDB) enables tools to analyze situations and suggest actions -- fully aware of the relationships between a faulty configuration item and other configuration items.
Other data can and should be part of AI enablement. Integrate data from monitoring and alerting tools to help AI platforms proactively anticipate and take corrective actions. As changes occur within the CMDB, the AI tool can update corresponding information in the IT asset management database and vice versa.
Without established practices for data, information, and knowledge, AI-enabled ITSM tools will struggle. Fortunately, many of these tools provide myriad options to address that issue. Pre-defined workflows and actions, repositories of keywords and contextual phrases, vendor-supplied knowledge articles and supervised learning models can help introduce AI within an ITSM environment.
If AI in ITSM succeeds, people can work at the wisdom level, bypassing the data and information levels of the DIKW model, because knowledge is captured and applied consistently.


Some AI and ITSM wisdom
Here are five tips to prepare for a successful AI implementation:

Assess readiness. If the current ITSM environment is too high-touch and maintenance-intensive, AI-enabled ITSM tools might not be the best investment. Invest first in improved process design and effective governance.
Don't overlook governance. Without a well-defined approach to governance, AI technologies may inadvertently, or even maliciously, function in ways that contradict the organization's mission and vision. Companies must define and enforce policies and procedures to address issues, such as ethical AI behaviors, or ensure the integrity and accuracy of data acted upon by AI technologies.
Take a portfolio approach. In the rapidly evolving ITSM market, wise IT shops take a longer view of AI use. Identify and implement quick wins, conduct experiments to grow skills and define and establish longer-term goals. This kind of portfolio approach ensures the organization gets the best results from AI-enabled ITSM.
Emphasize the people part. Where will you find that historical wisdom to train your chatbot? Who knows how to effectively manage those repetitive end-user issues from within a knowledgebase article? Promote the introduction of AI-enabled ITSM tools as a way to build off of IT staff's current knowledge, which then enables staff to focus on more strategic initiatives.
Take a holistic view. AI can have a place in the enterprise beyond ITSM. Many of the vendors in the AIOps market provide platforms for customer service, HR and other business functions. The introduction of AI-enabled ITSM also gives the IT team an opportunity to lead similar efforts across the organization -- but unless IT understands enterprise value streams, there is a risk of creating or reinforcing a silo mentality.

AbstractAn ideal anti-counterfeiting technique has to be inexpensive, mass-producible, nondestructive, unclonable and convenient for authentication. Although many anti-counterfeiting technologies have been developed, very few of them fulfill all the above requirements. Here we report a non-destructive, inkjet-printable, artificial intelligence (AI)-decodable and unclonable security label. The stochastic pinning points at the three-phase contact line of the ink droplets is crucial for the successful inkjet printing of the unclonable security labels. Upon the solvent evaporation, the three-phase contact lines are pinned around the pinning points, where the quantum dots in the ink droplets deposited on, forming physically unclonable flower-like patterns. By utilizing the RGB emission quantum dots, full-color fluorescence security labels can be produced. A convenient and reliable AI-based authentication strategy is developed, allowing for the fast authentication of the covert, unclonable flower-like dot patterns with different sharpness, brightness, rotations, amplifications and the mixture of these parameters.

IntroductionCounterfeiting and forgery is a global problem that causes significant financial damage and poses security threats to individuals, companies, and society as a whole1,2. Over the past decades, counterfeit products have spread from daily consumer goods, to medicines and high-tech products1. Although majority of the products are protected by an anti-counterfeiting technique, the global economic loss of counterfeiting has been increasing annually and estimated to reach 1.7 trillion US dollars in 20153. The reason for this is the currently used anti-counterfeiting technologies that rely on inkjet-printed security labels can be readily duplicated by counterfeiters due to their uniform patterns and predicable, deterministic decoding mechanisms4,5,6. Despite this, the inkjet-printing technique itself has many distinguished advantages in low production cost, mass production, material-effective utility, unlimited pattern design ability, and excellent compatibility with various ink materials as well as supporting substrates7,8,9,10,11,12. Furthermore, the inkjet-printed macroscale security labels allow fast, frequent authentication by the naked eyes or using a smart phone.Security labels with physical unclonable functions (PUFs) could offer a practical solution to the limitation of the widely used anti-counterfeiting technologies and seem to be the most viable path to combat the increasingly serious global forgery issue13. A PUF is a physical object with an intrinsic, unique, random physical feature generated in a non-deterministic process1,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. The randomness characteristic of the feature guarantees unreplicable code outputs. To date, a significant progress in PUF encryption has been made in the anti-counterfeiting field, mainly focusing on generating random features composed of either rough surfaces21,22 or discrete nanoparticle arrays23,24,25 within the predefined pattern areas. For example, Bae et al. has demonstrated the use of randomly wrinkling silica-coated polymeric particles as PUF codes to produce unique artificial fingerprints for anti-counterfeiting applications22. Our group recently have utilized advantage of electrostatic self-assembly strategy to generate randomly arranged plasmonic (metal) arrays as PUF codes using fluorescein-doped silver-silica core-shell nanoparticles as building blocks, giving rise to multi-optical signal encoded, unclonable security labels23. However, the creation of well-defined two-dimensional (2D) graphic security labels that carry PUF codes requires the aid of expensive lithography techniques. Moreover, the decryption of such PUF-based security labels relies on a machine learning pattern recognition and comparison analysis that a real fingerprinting does22. The machine learning authentication technique only focuses on algorithms for pattern recognition and enhancement to extract the PUF codes.In this work, we develop an inkjet-printable, artificial intelligence (AI) decodable, unclonable, fluorescence security label by combining the advantages of inkjet printing, portable smart-phone microscopes and AI technique. The security labels with diverse pattern designs are fabricated through inkjet printing using II-VI semiconductor core-shell quantum dots as model ink. The surface decoration of print substrates, such as glass, plastic, or paper, with randomly distributed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanoparticles is critical for the successful inkjet printing of unclonable security labels. The polymer nanoparticles on the substrates are acted as stochastic pinning points at the three-phase contact lines of the ink droplets. Upon the solvent evaporation, the three-phase contact lines are pinned around the pinning points. The quantum dots in the ink droplets subsequently deposit on the pinning points, forming physically unclonable flower-like dot patterns (i.e., primary units for any 2D logos). The designed surface modification makes the security labels (i.e., 2D logos) unique and unclonable. By utilizing red, green and blue (RGB) emission semiconductor quantum dots, full-color pictures can be generated, which are invisible in the ambient environment. The fabricated security labels seem to be the same from batch to batch on the macroscopic level; however, at the microscopic level, they are quite different from each other. Compared with previous reports using the intrinsic surface topography of a material (e.g., scratch patterns, fiber weave, etc.) for PUF encoding16, the system presented here has many advantages: (1) the developed printing strategy for the security label fabrication not only allows for various pattern design but also makes the mass-production at low cost possible; (2) the quantum dot ink is fluorescence active, guaranteeing the readout signals from suffering the interference by fingerprints and dusts; (3) the quantum dot security labels are only visible upon UV excitation, which offers the first layer of security, while the PUF nature originated from the random flower-like dot patterns provides the second more secure layer; (4) the first layer of security can be easily authenticated with naked eyes, while the second layer of security is able to be authenticated with AI technique rather than time-consuming machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we introduce AI (specifically deep learning) security label authentication concept and succeed in accurately and robustly decoding the unrepeatable flower-like dot patterns with different focusing degrees, brightness, rotation angles, amplification factors and the mixture of these parameters. The developed anti-counterfeiting technology meets all the requirements for commercial applications that are low cost, mass-producible, nondestructive, diverse full-color pattern design capability, unclonable, and convenient for authentication.ResultsInkjet printing of unclonable quantum dot security labelsThe fabrication process of unclonable security labels by inkjet printing are illustrated in Fig. 1. Three types of commercially available II–VI semiconductor core-shell quantum dots (CdSe/CdS/CdZnS, ZnCdSe/CdZnS, and ZnCdS/CdZnS) that emitted red, green, and blue light were chosen as model inks owing to their high fluorescent quantum yield and outstanding stability (Fig. 1a). These quantum dots were synthesized using a well-established chemical route26,27, in which high boiling point oleic acid and 1-octadecen were used as a capping agent and solvent, respectively (see Methods for details). Typical low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM micrographs present an extremely narrow particle size distribution and high crystallinity of the synthesized quantum dots (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1). The particle sizes of the red, green, and blue emission quantum dots are 6.5 ± 2 nm, 10.5 ± 3 nm, and 11.0 ± 2.5 nm, respectively. Generally, for quantum dots, the relationship between size and emissive wavelength accords with quantum confinement effect — that a small size corresponds to a larger band gap and emits short-wavelength fluorescence28. In this case, the emission wavelength of red, green and blue quantum dots shown in Fig. 1a was determined by the composition rather than the size of quantum dots (see Supplementary Fig. 1c)26. The Fourier-transform infrared absorption peaks at 2923 and 2854 cm−1, corresponding to C–C and C–H stretching modes of the -CH2- group, reveals the presence of oleic acid on the quantum dot surface (see Supplementary Fig. 2)29. The surface ligands are of importance for the preparation of highly dispersed and stable quantum dot inks as they can stabilize the quantum dots in non-polar solvents for months at room temperature. In this work, n-octylcyclohexane with low evaporation rate at ambient environment was adopted as model solvent for ink preparation. The low evaporation rate of the jetted ink droplet leads to a slow movement of the three-phase contact line on the print substrate, which allows us to dynamically study the quantum dot deposition behavior. Photographs of twenty jetted single droplets show almost identical shape both before contacting a print substrate and at the early stage after the contact (see Supplementary Fig. 3).Fig. 1Outline of formation processes of unclonable security labels by inkjet printing. a Typical TEM/HRTEM images (left), particle size distributions (middle), and ink for inkjet printing (right) of red core-shell quantum dots (QDs). b Surface modification of a substrate with partly dissolved PMMA solution by spin coating. c Substrate with random-distributed pinning points of PMMA nanoparticles on PMMA film after spin coating. d Inkjet printing of prepared QDs ink on the modified substrate. e Pinning process of QDs droplet contact line at random pinning points. f Residual central ink teared in to several smaller droplets in the final evaporation process. g A resulting security label composed of flower-like dot patterns, which are protected with a thin, optically transparent sticky gel filmFull size imagePrior to inkjet printing, the print indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glasses were cleaned by sonication in various solvents (see Methods for detailed sonication cleaning procedure), treated with oxygen plasma and then spin-coated with a partly-dissolved poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)30 nanoparticle colloid, forming a randomly distributed PMMA nanoparticle array on a PMMA layer (Fig. 1b, c). The surface cleaning and oxygen plasma treatment were utilized to remove the dusts and generate a super wettable surface for the PMMA nanoparticle coating, while the surface decoration with PMMA nanoparticles were used to create randomly arranged pinning points for the quantum dot deposition during the subsequent inkjet printing process. Such randomly arranged pinning points are critical for the successful inkjet printing of unclonable security labels (see Supplementary Fig. 6). Representative dark-field and atomic force microscopy images revealed the presence of randomly distributed PMMA nanoparticles with particle size in the range of a few nanometers to a few micrometers on the print substrates (see Supplementary Fig. 4). Following the surface modification of the print substrates, they were subjected to the inkjet printing to produce 2D graphic security labels. The inkjet printing was conducted by continuously jetting the quantum dot ink droplets with size of ~130 μm on the print substrates (Fig. 1d). The interval between two adjacent ink droplets is 200 μm. If each macroscopic security label contains 1000 flower-like points, we can achieve 1600 security labels in 5 min (i.e., the drying time of each batch of security label) with our single-nozzle printing machine. Each droplet represents a pixel of the inkjet-printed security labels after being completely dried. The PMMA nanoparticles on the poorly wettable PMMA film were acted as stochastic pinning points at the three-phase contact lines of the ink droplets. With the evaporation of solvent, the three-phase contact line continually slides and shrinks at the smooth PMMA areas owing to the poor wettability of the surface but is captured by some pinning points. Consequently, the pinning points stretch and pin the contact line, distorting the fluid convex and forming irregular quantum dot ink pattern (Fig. 1e). During the solvent evaporation process, the quantum dot concentration increases gradually. When the quantum dot concentration reached their saturation point, they started to deposit at the stochastic PMMA pinning points on the three-phase contact line, forming a unique flower-like dot pattern (Fig. 1f). With the shrinking of droplet, the volume-smaller droplet is more liable to be tortured by pinning points, thus splitting into several smaller sub-droplets (see Supplementary Fig. 5). Due to the small space between these sub-droplets and some stochastic external factors (such as airflow), they experienced merging and splitting irregularly before eventual drying (Fig. 1f). This non-deterministic, random pattern formation process was recorded by a camera to monitor the shape evolution of a droplet as a function of time (see Supplementary Fig. 5). Such a non-deterministic pattern formation process makes it impossible to reproduce the flower-like dot patterns, which were used as PUF codes in our security labels. The fabricated security labels were then covered with a thin, optically transparent, sticky gel film to protect them being damaged during the real circulation (Fig. 1g). If without the PMMA nanoparticles on the print substrates, the accumulated quantum dots induced by solvent evaporation directly deposited on the self-pinned three-phase contact line, producing a coffee-ring-like pattern (see Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, if the print substrates were coated with a continuous, smooth, poorly wettable PMMA layer, the three-phase contact line of the droplets are incline to shrink and slide towards to the center, rather than pinned on substrates, bringing the quantum dots to center of the droplet. When the solvent is completely evaporated, a central bump pattern, i.e., a hilly accumulation with diameter much smaller than the initial wetted diameter of the ink droplet, is generated (see Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the absence of the stochastic PMMA pinning points, either a uniform coffee ring or central bump pattern was formed, which was determined by the wettability property of the print substrates. These deterministic pattern formation processes ensure the reproducibility of the patterns under the same conditions.The miniaturized dark-field and fluorescence microscopes integrated with smartphones have been developed for single nanoparticle imaging31,32. Such small, affordable, portable microscopes were utilized by consumers to authenticate the inkjet-printed security labels. The magnification-adjustable objective lens of the portable microscope used here is covered with a cylindrical metal shell that creates a small dark imaging environment by blocking the ambient light (Supplementary Fig. 7). The portable microscope is able to quickly (typically within one second), accurately and nondestructively readout the produced flower-like dot patterns, which show different geometries as expected (Supplementary Fig. 7).Unlimited colorful pattern design capabilityIdeal fluorescent security labels require the ink materials having strong fluorescence intensity, which guarantees the high fluorescence brightness. The prepared quantum dot inks exhibit a narrow fluorescence emission peak with maximum intensity at 459 nm, 532 nm, and 631 nm, respectively, when excited at 375 nm (Fig. 2a). The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of these blue, green and red emission quantum dots is 20 nm, 24 nm, and 28 nm, respectively. They also bear a high fluorescence quantum yield of 75, 90, and 80%, respectively. The time-resolved fluorescence decays of the blue, green, and red emission quantum dots show their lifetime of 27.5 ns, 17.0 ns, and 7.6 ns (Fig. 2b), respectively, in consistent with consistent with previous reports26,33,34. According to the Commission Internationale de I’éclairage (CIE) 1931 color coordinate triangle, the quantum dots achieved a wide color gamut of 124% of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard (see Supplementary Fig. 8), better than phosphor (color gamut: 85.6%)35,36,37, implying outstanding full-color fluorescence properties for security label applications.Fig. 2Optical characterization. a Fluorescence spectra and b time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements of red, green, and blue emission quantum dot (QD) inks excited at 375 nm. c Transmittance spectra of ITO coated glass substrates before and after inkjet printing of red, green, and blue emission Fuzhou University logos (Inset: photographs of the four samples under ambient light). d–i Fluorescence images of red, green, and blue emission d–f Fuzhou University logos and g–i two-dimensional QR codes and bar codes.

The transmittance curves of the printed ITO glass slides are almost identical to the pristine print substrate (Fig. 2c), further confirming the covert characteristic of the fabricated security labels. When irradiated with UV light, bright red, green and blue photoluminescence photographs of the university logos were observed by the naked eyes (Fig. 2d–f). Any other 2D macroscale patterns with sharp corners, for example, QR codes and bar codes (Fig. 2g–i), can also be produced using our inkjet printing technique. The property that these images are only seen upon UV excitation offers the first layer of security realized by naked eye authentication of macroscopic patterns; and the PUF nature of the flower-like patterns is the second more secure layer.By tuning RGB ink component ratios, fine tonal variations from red to green were obtained (see Supplementary Fig. 9). In principle, the full palette of colors could be achieved with elaborate control of the RGB ink components. Alternatively, the full-color security labels can be generated by creating individual color pixels including red, green, and blue sub-pixels, which has been widely used in display26,38,39 and color images40,41,42. The inkjet printing strategy developed here offers us an opportunity to extend the ink to other fluorescent materials, e.g., lanthanide complexes43,44,45,46,47, carbon dots48,49, and up-conversion nanoparticles50,51,52, etc. and the print substrates to flexible ones, such as plastics (see Supplementary Fig. 10). Although the 2D macroscale security labels shown in Fig. 2d-i contained thousands of discrete points (or pixels), the printing process is completed within a few minutes using our single-nozzle printing machine.Figure 3 displays fluorescence micrographs of three batches of inkjet-printed macroscopic letters FZU (i.e., the acronym of Fuzhou University) that are composed of red, green, or blue emission arrays. At the macroscopic level, the printed FZU letters were seemingly identical (Fig. 3a–c). However, under the microscopic level, they were completely different from each other, as every fluorescent pixel of the letters showed a unique, random and unrepeatable flower-like geometry (Fig. 3d–i and Supplementary Fig. 11). Further scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy characterizations verify that the unique flower-like micropattern obtained from optical imaging systems is consistent with quantum dot deposition zones (see Supplementary Figs. 12–14). By carefully comparing all the pixels within the letters (i.e., the same sample), no identical flower-like micropatterns were found. A copy of the red, green, and blue fluorescence counterparts of the FZU letters shown in Fig. 3 fabricated under the same conditions also shows entirely different geometries of the corresponding pixels (see Supplementary Fig. 15). The encoding capacity of the inkjet-printed security labels that relies on the encoding capacity (defined as l) and the number (defined as m) of the PUF patterns (i.e., flower-like pixels) within the security labels can be described as lm20. Recently, Carro-Temboury et al. established a universal binary-bit model for the estimation of the encoding capacity of PUF pattern1. According to Carro-Temboury’s model, the encoding capacity of a red flower-like PUF pattern, l, is calculated to be 4.7 × 10202 (see Supplementary Fig. 16 and Note 1 for calculation details). Therefore, for a security label composed of 1000 red flower-like PUF patterns, its encoding capacity will be larger than 10202,000. This indicates that the inkjet-printed security labels are unclonable even by the manufacturer. Moreover, the fabricated security labels have been frequently exposed to UV light over the period of 2 months. No obvious decrease of the fluorescence brightness is observed, revealing that security labels have excellent chemical and photo stabilities (see Supplementary Fig. 17).Fig. 3Security labels with physically unclonble flower-like patterns. Typical fluorescence images of inkjet-printed macroscopic letters FZU composed of a red, b green, and c blue emission dot patterns (the scale bar is 4000 μm), d–f their local enlarged images (the scale bar is 500 μm), and g–i further enlarged images (the scale bar is 100 μm). All the samples are printed under the same conditions. The FZU patterns are identical on macroscale but completely different at the microscale (i.e., every dot pattern is unique)Full size imageDeep learning decoding mechanismConventional security labels with macroscale features, for instance, QR codes or bar codes are convenient for authentication with naked eyes, but easy to be counterfeited. Advanced security labels that carry complex, random nano/microscale features (PUF keys) are formidable to be faked. The decoding of such security labels relies on a similar character extraction, recognition, and comparison analysis that a real fingerprint does22,23. Such machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, enhancement, and identification are widely employed for the authentication of the PUF-based security labels22,23. A general drawback of the machine learning approach is time consuming and having a high level of false positives of up to 20%20. Furthermore, conventional classification can only be used in the PUF that can be transformed to private keys; for flower-like patterns, it does not work. To deal with this problem, deep learning, an artificial intelligence (AI) technique, was introduced to validate the fabricated unclonable security labels, which pushes anti-counterfeiting technology to a higher dimension.Although AI has been recently applied into organic chemistry synthesis and TEM image analysis53,54, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to use AI for security label authentication. Figure 4 demonstrates a typical authentication procedure of the inkjet-printed security labels through deep learning. First of all, each quantum dot security label on a commercial product is imaged using an advanced fluorescence microscope (Fig. 4a, step 1). Only one image is taken from each security label and represents one PUF code. Simply, randomly shifting and rotating the image creates a large number of images for an AI to learn the characteristic features of the security label. Once the images are trained on AI, they are categorized in a very general manner (e.g., classes associated with geometry of the security labels) and then stored as a database in a deep learning engine for the subsequent authentication using (Fig. 4a, step 2). This is done by the manufacturer. When the consumers receive the products, they can simply use their portable mini-microscope-connected smartphones to readout the PUF codes by taking photos of the security labels (Fig. 4a, step 3), which are automatically sent to the deep learning engine for validation (Fig. 4a, step 4). The deep learn engine immediately feeds back the authentication results (real or fake) to the users (Fig. 4a, step 5).Fig. 4Deep learning decoding mechanism. a Schematic illustrating the authentication process: 1: image capture and database generation from the goods by the manufacturers, 2: image learning by AI, 3: Image capture from the goods by the consumers using their smart phones, 4: image recognition and comparing by AI, and 5: authentication outcome feedback to the consumers. b–g A library of six single dot pattern security labels, h–m six fluorescence images taken from b (referred as to genuine product) with different brightness, sharpness, rotation angles, magnifications, and the mixture of the above-mentioned factors, and n–s six fluorescence images from security labels that are not in the database shown in panel b–g (referred as to fake products). t, u Recognition rates of labels (h1–h6) and (i1–i6) by the authenticating way of deep learning. Labels (g1–g6), (h1–h6), and (i1–i6) correspond to the labels in figure (b–g), (h–m), and (n–s) respectively. The color scales from blue to red stand for the matching score (ranging from 0 to 100%) of the captured pictures with the labelsFull size imageTo experimentally demonstrate the above authentication process, six quantum-dot security labels (named as gn, n = 1, 2, ···, 6) were randomly chosen to establish a security label database (Fig. 4b–g). Five hundred fluorescence images of each security label (e.g., g1) obtained by randomly shifting and rotating a same image (i.e., g1) are provided to AI for learning and classifying. The selected 72 out of the 500 images from g1 show the exact same geometrical characteristics of the security label (see Supplementary Fig. 18). The 500 images were divided into two parts: 80% for learning and 20% for validation. After every learning cycle (the parts for learning), the images for validation were sent to AI engine to test, providing a train accuracy plot. After about 1000 learning cycles, they can be recognized with accuracy fluctuating between 97 and 100% when being sent to AI for validation again (see Supplementary Fig. 19).For decoding, a security label that represented a genuine product (i.e., from the pre-established database) was imaged at various sample rotation angles, magnification, focusing degrees, and the mixture of the above-mentioned factors (Fig. 4h–m). We try to cover all possible deviations from the imaging equipment, imaging conditions, personnel habits of users that may happen in a real authentication scenario. None of the images shown in Fig. 4h–m (named as hn, n = 1, 2, ···, 6) has ever been previously learnt by AI. The image hn is fed into the trained AI for validation. The authentication outputs show the accuracy of hn (n = 1, 2, ···, 6) is 0.999, 0.758, 0.999, 0.909, 0.999, and 0.999, respectively (Fig. 4t). The relatively low accuracy of h2 and h4 are attributed to their over-indistinct characteristics, for which parts of details are lost during imaging, implying sharpness exerting a much higher impact on authentication accuracy than other variations, such as brightness, location, rotation angle, and amplification factor. The threshold of the accuracy at a value of 0.5 is then set to distinguish the real and fake security labels. For comparison, six fake security labels named as in (n = 1, 2, ···, 6) were sent to AI for authentication in the same way (Fig. 4n–s). The corresponding accuracy is almost zero for all the fake security labels (Fig. 4u). By simply comparing the accuracy on the test with the threshold, the deep learning machine can immediately provide the authentication outcomes (real: accuracy ≥0.5, fake: accuracy <0.5) to the customers. Regarding to the rate of false positives, we achieved the false positives rate of 0 using the match score of 0.5 as the threshold when sampling 100 security labels (see Supplementary Table 1). It only takes seconds or even less to finish the whole authentication process.DiscussionIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a non-destructive, inkjet-printable, smart-phone readable, AI decodable, unclonable, and fluorescence security label. Such security labels with various 2D patterns composed of red, green, or blue emission arrays were fabricated through inkjet printing using II–VI semiconductor core-shell quantum dots as model ink. The surface modification of the print substrates with randomly arranged PMMA nanoparticles is crucial for the successful inkjet printing of the unclonable security labels. The polymer nanoparticles on the print substrates were acted as stochastic pinning points at the three-phase contact lines of the ink droplets for the quantum dot deposition, forming physically unclonable flower-like dot patterns. This non-deterministic pattern formation process guarantees the unclonability of the fabricated security labels. By utilizing the RGB emission core-shell quantum dots, full-color security labels can be generated.The fabricated security labels are invisible in the ambient environment but can be visualized by naked eyes when irradiated with UV light, which offers an easy way for the preliminary verification. A more reliable authentication strategy by using AI techniques has been developed. Covert and unclonable flower-like dot patterns with different sharpness, brightness, rotations, amplifications, and the mixture of these parameters have been successfully decoded within seconds using the authentication strategy developed here. The overall cost per security labels has been estimated to be approximately US$ 0.011 (see Supplementary Note 2). The anti-counterfeiting technology described in this work is a good step closer to commercial applications that are low cost, mass-producible, nondestructive, diverse full-color pattern design capability, unclonable, and convenient for authentication. Applications of this technology span the full range from established to emerging-technology industries, including pharmaceutics, food security, and nanotechnology. Compared with intrinsic surface topography of material itself (like scratch patterns, fiber weave, etc.), our current system shows advantages in fluorescent and multi-color information, multi-level security, convenient for authentication, and well-designed patterns. The possibility of covert but easily detectable labeling through the use of a portable mini microscope and AI technique (Supplementary Table 2) will ensure the security and trackability of sensitive substances and equipment, which will lead to a promising approach in sensitive industries such as the nuclear one.MethodsMaterialsPoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, average Mw ~996,000 g mol−1, from Sigma-Aldrich), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, average Mw ~40,000×g mol−1), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene (99.8% pure, from J&K Scientific), CdO (AR grade, from Aladdin), ZnO (99.7%, from Shijiazhuang hongda zinc industry co. LTD), zinc acetate dehydrate (AR grade, from Aladdin), oleic acid (OA, 90%, from Alfa aeser), 1-octadecene (ODE, 98%, from Toyata), Se powder (99.999%, from Alfa aeser), sulfur powder (99.95%, from Aladdin), 1-Dodecanethiol (DDT, ≥ 98%, from Chevron Phillips Chemical), toluene (for synthesizing quantum dots, AR grade, from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd), and ethanol (AR grade, from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd) were received and used without further purification. Sticky-gel film with gel thickness of 1.5 mm and retention level of X4 was purchased from Gel-Pak company. Toluene (for dissolving PMMA) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents and further dried by distillation over sodium.Synthesis of core-shell quantum dotsFor a typical synthesis of CdSe/CdS/CdZnS red emission quantum dots: 7 mmol of CdO, 10 mL of OA and 25 mL of ODE were mixed in a 250 mL round flask. The mixture was heated to 160 °C, degassed for 15 min, then filled with N2 gas and further heated to 310 °C. Subsequently, Se precursor was injected swiftly into the flask. Then the reaction was cooled to 300 °C and remained at this temperature for 5 min. To grow the CdS shell, S source was injected dropwise to react with the remaining cadmium ions for 20 min. For the growth of CdZnS shell, keep the reaction temperature and dropwise injected the pre-prepared shelling materials, the shelling process last for ~30 mins. After the reaction, the temperature was naturally cooled down to room temperature. The synthesized quantum dots were finally purified using toluene and ethanolfor several times and finally dispersed in n-octylcyclohexane. For ZnCdSe/CdZnS green emission quantum dots: 35 mmol of ZnO, 25 mL of OA, and 20 mL of ODE were mixed in a 250 mL round flask. The mixture was heated to 160 °C, degassed for 15 min, then filled with N2 gas and further heated to 300 g to get a clear solution. The solution was cooled to 200 °C, at which Se and Cd stock precursors were quickly injected into the flask sequentially. Then the temperature was elevated to 310 °C and remained at this temperature for 30 min to form alloyed CdZnSe core. For the growth of the CdZnS shell, S source and Cd source were dropwise injected into the flask repeatedly while keeping temperature at 270 °C. After the precursor injection, the temperature was kept unchanged for 30 min to 1 h, and then naturally cooled down to room temperature. For the synthesis ZnCdS/CdZnS blue emission quantum dots with composition gradient, the procedure is the same as that for the green emission quantum dots, except using S stock solution instead of Se solution as the anion precursor. At the elevated temperature, the S precursor was injected into the mixture of the Zn precursor and Cd precursor in a round bottom flask, forming the blue emitting ZnCdS cores. The shell materials (S source and Cd source) were added afterwards drop-wisely, and the reaction was allowed to proceed from 30 min to 1 h for the shell growth. The synthesized of green and blue quantum dots were purified and prepared with similar process as above.Fabrication of quantum-dot security labelsIn a typical procedure, the precursors of surface modification layer were prepared by adding solutes into chlorobenzene, toluene, and DMSO for common PMMA (4 mg ml−1), designed PMMA (4 mg ml−1), and PVP (4 mg ml−1) layer respectively, and stirring vigorously for 12 h at 60 °C before use The quantum dot inks were dispersed in n-octylcyclohexane at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1. Indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned with ultrasonication successively in deionized (DI) water, acetone, isopropanol, and DI water. Then, nitrogen stream was used to dry the substrates, followed by 10 min oxygen plasma treatment. The pre-prepared precursors of surface modification layer were deposited on the substrates by spin coating, and then were heated at 120 °C for 30 min. The quantum-dot inks were printed on the substrates with a Microfab JETLAB II equipped with a 30-μm diameter piezoelectric-driven inkjet nozzle and a motorized stage with the accuracy of 5 μm. Driving voltage waveforms to the inkjet printing nozzle and the flying single droplet are shown in Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21. All the processes were operated in the ambient environment. If every single macroscopic pattern has 1000 unclonable flower-like points, we can achieve 1600 macroscopic patterns in 5 min with our single-nozzle printing machine. The time of drying is ~5 min for each batch of security label. The as-fabricated security labels were covered with gel films by tearing of their polycarbonate coversheet and then stick their gel material on the labels for stability test (see Supplementary Fig. 17).CharacterizationThe surface morphology of the PMMA films and quantum-dot patterns were characterized with atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Multimode 8) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM, FEI, Nova Nano SEM 230). The UV−Vis absorption spectra were tested with a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600). The transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) image of quantum dots was recorded using JEOL JEM-2100F microscope. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer, by exciting the samples using a Xe lamp coupled with a monochromator. Time-resolved PL measurement was collected by using fluorescence lifetime measurement system (HORIBA scientific). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Nicolet 50 FTIR spectrometer at room temperature. The PL microscopic images of quantum dot patterns morphology were characterized by using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51M). For pattern readout with a smartphone microscope, the portable microscope was linked to a small WiFi box by a USB line, which allows for the smartphone to control the microscope for real-time imaging (see Supplementary Fig. 7).Quantum yield of quantum dotsThe results are obtained by comparing integrated PL intensities using the standard procedure55,56. The quantum yield (QYs) of blue, green, and red emission quantum dots were measured relative to Coumarin 480 (QY 99% in ethanol) with excitation at 350 nm, Coumarin 480 (QY 99% in ethanol) with excitation at 370 nm and rhodamine 6 G (QY 95% in ethanol) with excitation at 450 nm, respectively. Solutions of quantum dots in toluene were optically matched at the excitation wavelength. Fluorescence spectra of quantum dots and dye were taken under identical spectrometer conditions in triplicate and averaged. The optical density was kept below 0.06 at the λmax, and the integrated intensities of the emission spectra, corrected for differences in index of refraction and concentration, were used to calculate the quantum yields using the expression.$${\mathrm{QY}}\;{\mathrm{of}}\;{\mathrm{quantum}}\;{\mathrm{dots}} = {\mathrm{QY}}_R \times \frac{I}{{I_R}} \times \frac{{A_R}}{A} \times \frac{{n^2}}{{n_R^2}}$$
                    (1)
                where QY is the quantum yield, I is the measured integrated PL emission intensity, n is refractive index (n = 1.496 for toluene; n = 1.361 for ethanol) and A is the optical density at the excitation wavelength.Deep learningAll the deep learning networks employed in our paper are based on the TensorFlow backend. The code used are run in software Pycharm 2017.3. To generate a large enough training set from theoretical image(s) for Alexnet model, a data augmentation procedure to the original synthetic image(s) is applied. For a typical process, one lower-left dot representing a security label is captured as an image. Such a clear image was rotated by a step of 0.72° for 360° using an algorithm, producing a set of 500 training images. The input images were resized to 512 × 384 using pixel area relation for training. Plots of accuracy on the training and validation data sets over training epochs (from http://host:6006) can be found in the Supplementary Fig. 19. The training images do not need to be stored and are not stored in this case; The storage requirement is mainly determined by the neural network itself, about 200 M Bytes here. For the AI technology we used, the learning process takes 2 h. The computer used for deep CPU is equipped with the CPU (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7–6700 CPU @3040 GHz), the GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1080), the RAM (32.0 GB), and HDD Capability (1 TB). The computer rated power is 350 W/h.Registration and validation methodologyWe created a file named as gn (n = 1, 2, 3, …) per security label to store the corresponding 500 training images prior to the training process. The training images stored in the file gn are named as gn_000, gn_001, …, gn_500. Many files from these security labels composed a database. After the 500 training images of a security label were learnt by AI, their structural information was remembered and linked to the file name gn (e.g., g1). Then the training images will be deleted. When consumers randomly take a picture of a real security label and sent it to the AI, the AI can automatically recall the accurately corresponding relationship and output the indexing name with a detailed match score. According our results, if the captured image from the end-user is clear enough, the match score of the image of true security label is more than 99% (Fig. 4t). On the other hand, if the image (from a fake label) has never been learned, the engine will give a lower match score (Fig. 4u). The authentication process takes about 2 s. Deep learning, as a black box that nobody actually knows how it works in details up to now, is an advantage for unclonable anti-counterfeiting technique because it is a tamper proof.

Although many anti-counterfeiting technologies have been developed, very few of them fulfill all the above requirements. Here we report a non-destructive, inkjet-printable, artificial intelligence (AI)-decodable and unclonable security label. The stochastic pinning points at the three-phase contact line of the ink droplets is crucial for the successful inkjet printing of the unclonable security labels. Upon the solvent evaporation, the three-phase contact lines are pinned around the pinning points, where the quantum dots in the ink droplets deposited on, forming physically unclonable flower-like patterns. By utilizing the RGB emission quantum dots, full-color fluorescence security labels can be produced. A convenient and reliable AI-based authentication strategy is developed, allowing for the fast authentication of the covert, unclonable flower-like dot patterns with different sharpness, brightness, rotations, amplifications and the mixture of these parameters. Anti-counterfeiting technologies should ideally be unclonable, yet simple to fabricate and decode. Here, the authors develop an inkjet-printable and unclonable security label based on random patterning of quantum dot inks, and accompany it with an artificial intelligence decoding mechanism capable of authenticating the patterns.', 'datePublished': '2019-06-03T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2019-06-03T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '9', 'license':

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation recently released an overview report on the current state of self-driving technology.  According to the report, automated vehicle technologies are still in the research and development phase. The map given below depicts the controlled test sites in the U.S. where self-driving cars components and systems using modeling, simulation and on road. Source: US NHTSA This article aims to serve fundamental and introductory information on how self-driving and autonomous cars currently operate in the real world – from hardware to software. We’ve broken this article out into three sections: What constitutes a self-driving car (levels of autonomy) How self-driving cars interact with each other and their surroundings Current examples of how Google’s Waymo and Tesla’s Autopilot operate For readers looking to gather further information on self-driving car applications in real time, we have previously covered important, in-depth information on the same in articles such as The Self-Driving Car Timeline – Predictions from the Top 11 Global Automakers and AI for Self-Driving Car Safety – Current Applications. We’ll begin by examining levels of autonomy: Levels of Autonomy in a Self-Driving Car According to the SAE International, a self-driving car has five levels of autonomy: Source: SAE International Level 1: This is a low-level automation where the system and the human driver share control. For instance, the adaptive cruise control feature controls the engine and brake power for speed variation and maintenance while the driver would control the steering. Level 1 systems may warrant for full human control anytime.  Level 2: At this level, while vehicle operations such as acceleration, brakes and steering are in the system’s control, driver’s constant monitoring of the autonomous system is needed. Many Level 2 vehicles require the driver to hold the steering wheel for the autonomous system to continuously operate.  Level 3: Autonomous vehicles that fall under this category allow the driver to perform other tasks (like texting or watching a movie) while the system takes control of most vehicle operations. However, the system requires driver intervention within a limited time for some operations as specified by the vehicle manufacturer.  Level 4: This level supports self-driving with minimal driver intervention but it does so only in select, mapped locations called geofenced areas.   Level 5: No human intervention is required. BMW’s self-driving car introductory video demonstrates what each of the five levels might be like for riders and drivers, with an overview of some of the technologies that enable autonomy:  While level 5 autonomy is the shared dream of many self-driving car firms, their respective path to arrive at level 5 autonomy are quite different. Some firms believe that level 3 and level 4 autonomy are too dangerous, because the hand-off from machine to human could be unpredictable and dangerous (switching from texting or watching a movie to swerving away from an accident might be an unrealistic expectation). How a Self-Driving Car Interacts with Its Surroundings According to the United States Department of Transportation, the connected and autonomous vehicles communicate with each other and their surroundings in three ways: Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) Interaction The V2V interaction between autonomous cars allows information exchange on routes, congestion, obstacles, and hazards.  For example, if a self-driving car encounters an accident or high-volume but slow-moving traffic, it is capable of relaying the information to other self-driving cars, which can then adjust their routes according to the received data and potentially avoid accidents and traffic.  Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) Interaction Self-driving cars can communicate with infrastructure components such as intelligent parking systems to plan routes and reserve parking spaces well ahead of the journey.  This information especially useful when the autonomous car has to decide how to park when it has reached its destination: parallel, perpendicular or angular. In addition, other driverless cars would “know” in advance whether a particular parking space has already been reserved or is open.   Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) Interaction The V2P interaction is primarily carried out between a self-driving car and a pedestrian’s smartphone application.  According to The University of Minnesota, it funded a V2P prototype called Mobile Accessible Pedestrian Signal (MAPS). A visually-impaired pedestrian can use MAPS to receive and provide information regarding the intersection and the pedestrian’s location, respectively. Self-driving cars would then use such data, in addition to that provided by the cars’ sensors and LiDARs to more accurately locate pedestrians and potentially avoid collisions.   Examples and Use-Cases Bosch explains some simple use-cases of V2V and V2I technology in the following two-minute video:  China’s now-embattled hardware manufacturer Huawei demonstrates a variety of potential “V2” use-cases in this 2018 demo video:  While the technology is still in its infancy, “V2” technologies are helping to pave the path to more complete autonomy – and hopefully – to vastly safer roads for drivers and pedestrians. It is unclear whether different countries will develop entirely different V2 use-cases and standards, and it’s too early to tell which V2 applications will become standard in the coming years, and which will be abandoned. Current Examples of Self-Driving Cars and Components at Work Google and Tesla are the biggest players in the current autonomous vehicle space. In order to better understand how self-driving cars work in real time, this article includes details about the workings and operations of Google’s Waymo and Tesla’s Autopilot.  Google’s Waymo According to Google, Waymo is a Level 4 autonomous system, requiring minimal human intervention.  Waymo’s Hardware Infrastructure A descriptive image of Waymo’s hardware is provided below: Source: Google Waymo’s infrastructure includes a variety of sensor, radar, and camera systems. LiDAR Sensors  According to Google, Waymo has a multi-layered sensor suite capable of operating in different lighting conditions. This sensor suite is essentially an omnidirectional LiDAR system comprising a short-range, a high-resolution mid-range and a long-range LiDAR. These LiDARs project millions of laser pulses per second and calculate the time taken for the beams to reflect off a surface or a person and return to the self-driving car.  Based on the data received from the LiDAR beams, Waymo reportedly creates a 3D map of the surroundings, identifying mobile and immobile objects, including other vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, traffic lights, and a variety of road features.  Vision Waymo’s vision system is yet another omnidirectional, high-resolution camera suite purportedly capable of identifying color in low-light conditions. This helps in detecting different traffic lights, other vehicles, construction zones and emergency lights.    Radar Google claims that Waymo uses a radar system to perceive objects and motion through wavelengths “travelling around” different light and weather conditions, such as rain, snow and fog. This radar system is also omnidirectional and can track the speed of pedestrians and other vehicles 360 degrees around the self-driving car.  Supplemental Sensors Waymo is also supplemented with extra sensors that include an audio detection system to detect emergency sirens and a GPS to track physical locations.  Waymo’s Self-Driving Software Google claims that Waymo’s self-driving software has been trained and tested based on “5 billion miles of simulated driving and 5 million miles of on-road driving experience.” It is powered by machine-learning algorithms. The below video elaborates on how Waymo operates on the road:  According to Google, Waymo’s Level 4 technology detects and “understands” objects and their behavior and accordingly adjusts the behavior of the autonomous vehicle in a three-fold process.   Perception  Waymo can reportedly detect, identify and classify objects on the road, including pedestrians and other vehicles, while simultaneously measuring their speed, direction and acceleration over time. For example, Waymo’s perception software collects the data from the sensors and radars and creates a simulated “view” of the surroundings. Owing to this capability, Waymo is able to determine whether it can proceed through the traffic when the light turns green or adjust its route due to a blocked lane indicated by traffic cones. Behavior prediction Waymo, according to Google, can predict the behavior of an object on the road based on its classification by inferring data from the training models constructed using “millions of miles of driving experience.  For example, the self-driving software “understands” that while pedestrians may look similar to cyclists, they move slower than the latter and exhibit more abrupt directional changes. Planner The planner software reportedly uses the information captured by the perception and behavior prediction software to plan appropriate routes for Waymo. Google claims that Waymo’s planner operates like a “defensive driver,” who chooses to stay away from blind spots and gives leeway to cyclists and pedestrians.   Tesla’s Autopilot Autopilot, according to Tesla, is a Level 2 autonomous vehicle feature. Like most Level 2 systems, Autopilot requires that the driver hold the steering wheel at all time, poised to take over control.  Tesla also warns that the driver has to be fully functional and aware during autonomous operations.  Autopilot Hardware The picture below shows the hardware components of the Autopilot. Courtesy: Tesla According to Tesla, its self-driving cars manufactured between 2014 and October 2016 included limited ultrasonic sensors, low-power radar and only one camera.  Those built since 2016 comprise 12 ultrasonic sensors for nearby object and pedestrian identification, a frontal radar capable of “sensing through” different weather conditions, eight external cameras that are used as feeds for Tesla’s in-house neural net and a computer system that processes inputs in milliseconds.  The Tesla connected car software is continually updated “over the air.”    Autopilot Software Traffic-Aware Cruise Control for maintaining speed in response to the surrounding traffic. Driver-assisted “Autosteer” within the boundaries of well-marked lane Auto Lane Change for transitioning between lanes Driver-assisted “Navigate on Autopilot” for guiding the vehicle from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting and making lane changes, navigating highway interchanges, and taking exits.  Autopark for automatic parallel or perpendicular parking Summon for “calling” the car from its parking space The workings of the above-mentioned features are briefly explained below: Navigate on Autopilot The Navigate on Autopilot feature allows the driver to input a destination into the vehicle’s navigation system, which kickstarts the “360-degree visualization” showing a planned route. This features has to be enabled for each trip for safety reasons. It does not operate on default mode, according to Tesla.  Auto Lane Change The Navigate on Autopilot feature includes two types of lane changes: route-based and speed-based. The former allows the vehicle to stick to the navigation route irrespective of speed. The latter, based on a few settings, suggests transitions into lanes with vehicles moving faster or slower than Autopilot in reference to the set cruise speed.  Automatic lane change kicks into mode when the driver opts out of lane change confirmation notification. However, Tesla warns drivers that this feature is not fully-autonomous and that it requires their complete attention and hold over the steering wheel. Tesla claims that the driver can manually override this feature anytime.  Autopark and Summon The driver can initiate Autopark when the car is driving at low speeds trying to detect a suitable parking spot. This needs manual intervention of putting the car in reverse and pressing start, however, before the car begins to independently control speed, change gears and steering angles. Autopilot also has a Summon button triggered through an app when the passenger wants to “call” the car and direct it through a series of forward and reverse button clicks.  The video below shows a Tesla Autopilot live demonstration on the road in real time:  Barriers to Autonomy While self-driving vehicle investments have skyrocketed in the last five years – there are still a number of important challenges keeping level 5 autonomy from becoming a reality: Road Rules in the Developing World – California highways are a different driving environment than the traffic of Cairo or Bangalore. The developing world may be left behind in terms of autonomous vehicle adoption (and thus, in terms of safety, lower emissions, and increased worker productivity) unless autonomous systems are developed to handle their unique circumstances and roadway norms. This may involve signifiant changes to driving habits and norms in these countries, or “test areas” where different roadway rules apply and where self-driving technologies can be tested. Unified Standards – In order for vehicles to communicate with themselves or with infrastructure, new communication channels will have to be developed. These channels should allow vehicles of different makes and models to communicate, and they should be as safe as possible from hacking and deception. While the US and other nations are working on furthering these standards, there is much work to be done to ensure safety and to create a unified intelligent layer between vehicles and infrastructure. Safety Thresholds – The number of deaths per passenger-mile on commercial airlines in the United States between 2000 and 2010 was about 0.2 deaths per 10 billion passenger-miles (Wikipedia). It seems safe to say that standards for self-driving vehicles will be more strict, but it isn’t clear where the cut-off will lie. Governments of different nations will have to determine acceptable mortality rates, and safety standards and guidelines for different kinds of autonomous vehicles. Weather and Disasters – Blizzards, floods, or damage to street signs and “V2” technologies could put self-driving cars at risk of serious error and mortal danger. Building road infrastructure to handle disasters, and building vehicles to hander abnormal or less-and-ideal conditions (visibility, tire traction, etc) is much more challenging that simply putting a car on the road on a sunny day in Mountain View, CA.   Header image credit: NVIDIA Related Posts Machine Vision for Self-Driving Cars - Current ApplicationsMicKinsey estimated that by 2030, up to 15% of cars sold will be autonomous vehicles.

Artificial intelligence in cryptocurrency trading: use cases
2 June 2019

FacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp







Nowadays we hear more and more often about artificial intelligence (abbreviated with the acronym AI) and also the world of cryptocurrency trading has not been excluded.
According to two recent pieces of research, artificial intelligence could be of help to the traders going to predict the short-term trend of the price of a coin or to identify possible scams.
Recognition of Pump and Dump
The work of Jiahua Xu and Benjamin Livshits at Imperial College of London has given rise to an algorithm capable of predicting the emergence of pump and dump schemes.
These schemes were popularized by Jordan Belfort, also known as the “Wolf of Wall Street”, who pleaded guilty to fraud and crime related to this technique.
Pump and dump schemes work in a simple way: a group of malicious people buy a low market capitalisation cryptocurrency at a favourable price. Then it generates a lot of hype around the coin trying to convince other unsuspecting traders to buy massively, so as to increase the price.
Once the price has risen enough, the initial malicious group can proceed to liquidate all the capital and make a guaranteed profit.
In the case of cryptocurrencies, moreover, thanks to the high volatility, all this happens in a few minutes, and these are increasingly common.
Xu and Livshits have reiterated that on average there are two pump-and-dump scams every day and that these generate about $7 million dollars in volume per month.

The two researchers carefully studied 220 pump and dump events. They noted that many of these frauds were preceded by unusual buying activities in cryptocurrencies often little considered.
During the testing phase, the algorithm identified six different suspicious activities, five of which turned out to be actually pump and dump schemes.
Researchers have yet to announce whether or not they intend to make their algorithm available for public use. 
Sentiment Analysis
According to a scientific paper by developer Tejeswar Tadi, published in Intel IA Academy, an initiative of the American technology giant Intel, artificial intelligence can help determine the general sentiment about a given cryptocurrency by scanning and analyzing the countless comments in social media.

“It is possible to show that favourable feelings about a currency correspond to an increase in the value of the coin through the exchange of the currency itself”.

Tadi launched his project called Deep Learning for Cryptocurrency Trading about two years ago. Its main purpose was to determine the correlation between the feelings expressed by cryptocurrency traders and their market value. All this by applying deep learning techniques.
In an article recently published on the Intel IA Academy page, Tadi, presented as “Intel Ambassador”, said:

“The long-term vision of this project is to be able to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Cryptocurrency Trading Bot that cannot only consider trader sentiment to make trading decisions but also take advantage of other opportunities such as arbitrage which is the purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the price”.

 Artificial Intelligence is probably the most complex and astounding creations of humanity yet. And that is disregarding the fact that the field remains largely unexplored, which means that every amazing AI application that we see today represents merely the tip of the AI iceberg, as it were. While this fact may have been stated and restated numerous times, it is still hard to comprehensively gain perspective on the potential impact of AI in the future. The reason for this is the revolutionary impact that AI is having on society, even at such a relatively early stage in its evolution.
 AI’s rapid growth and powerful capabilities have made people paranoid about the inevitability and proximity of an AI takeover. Also, the transformation brought about by AI in different industries has made business leaders and the mainstream public think that we are close to achieving the peak of AI research and maxing out AI’s potential. However, understanding the types of AI that are possible and the types that exist now will give a clearer picture of existing AI capabilities and the long road ahead for AI research. Understanding the types of AI classification Since AI research purports to make machines emulate human-like functioning, the degree to which an AI system can replicate human capabilities is used as the criterion for determining the types of AI. Thus, depending on how a machine compares to humans in terms of versatility and performance, AI can be classified under one, among the multiple types of AI. Under such a system, an AI that can perform more human-like functions with equivalent levels of proficiency will be considered as a more evolved type of AI, while an AI that has limited functionality and performance would be considered a simpler and less evolved type.
PROMOTED Based on this criterion, there are two ways in which AI is generally classified. One type is based on classifying AI and AI-enabled machines based on their likeness to the human mind, and their ability to “think” and perhaps even “feel” like humans. According to this system of classification, there are four types of AI or AI-based systems: reactive machines, limited memory machines, theory of mind, and self-aware AI.








 1.    Reactive Machines These are the oldest forms of AI systems that have extremely limited capability. They emulate the human mind’s ability to respond to different kinds of stimuli. These machines do not have memory-based functionality. This means such machines cannot use previously gained experiences to inform their present actions, i.e., these machines do not have the ability to “learn.” These machines could only be used for automatically responding to a limited set or combination of inputs. They cannot be used to rely on memory to improve their operations based on the same. A popular example of a reactive AI machine is IBM’s Deep Blue, a machine that beat chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997. 
2.    Limited Memory Limited memory machines are machines that, in addition to having the capabilities of purely reactive machines, are also capable of learning from historical data to make decisions. Nearly all existing applications that we know of come under this category of AI. All present-day AI systems, such as those using deep learning, are trained by large volumes of training data that they store in their memory to form a reference model for solving future problems. For instance, an image recognition AI is trained using thousands of pictures and their labels to teach it to name objects it scans. When an image is scanned by such an AI, it uses the training images as references to understand the contents of the image presented to it, and based on its “learning experience” it labels new images with increasing accuracy. Almost all present-day AI applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving vehicles are all driven by limited memory AI. 3.    Theory of Mind While the previous two types of AI have been and are found in abundance, the next two types of AI exist, for now, either as a concept or a work in progress. Theory of mind AI is the next level of AI systems that researchers are currently engaged in innovating. A theory of mind level AI will be able to better understand the entities it is interacting with by discerning their needs, emotions, beliefs, and thought processes. While artificial emotional intelligence is already a budding industry and an area of interest for leading AI researchers, achieving Theory of mind level of AI will require development in other branches of AI as well. This is because to truly understand human needs, AI machines will have to perceive humans as individuals whose minds can be shaped by multiple factors, essentially “understanding” humans. 4.    Self-aware This is the final stage of AI development which currently exists only hypothetically. Self-aware AI, which, self explanatorily, is an AI that has evolved to be so akin to the human brain that it has developed self-awareness. Creating this type of Ai, which is decades, if not centuries away from materializing, is and will always be the ultimate objective of all AI research. This type of AI will not only be able to understand and evoke emotions in those it interacts with, but also have emotions, needs, beliefs, and potentially desires of its own. And this is the type of AI that doomsayers of the technology are wary of. Although the development of self-aware can potentially boost our progress as a civilization by leaps and bounds, it can also potentially lead to catastrophe. This is because once self-aware, the AI would be capable of having ideas like self-preservation which may directly or indirectly spell the end for humanity, as such an entity could easily outmaneuver the intellect of any human being and plot elaborate schemes to take over humanity. The alternate system of classification that is more generally used in tech parlance is the classification of the technology into Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). 5.    Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) This type of artificial intelligence represents all the existing AI, including even the most complicated and capable AI that has ever been created to date. Artificial narrow intelligence refers to AI systems that can only perform a specific task autonomously using human-like capabilities. These machines can do nothing more than what they are programmed to do, and thus have a very limited or narrow range of competencies. According to the aforementioned system of classification, these systems correspond to all the reactive and limited memory AI. Even the most complex AI that uses machine learning and deep learning to teach itself falls under ANI. 6.    Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Artificial General Intelligence is the ability of an AI agent to learn, perceive, understand, and function completely like a human being. These systems will be able to independently build multiple competencies and form connections and generalizations across domains, massively cutting down on time needed for training. This will make AI systems just as capable as humans by replicating our multi-functional capabilities. 7.    Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) The development of Artificial Superintelligence will probably mark the pinnacle of AI research, as AGI will become by far the most capable forms of intelligence on earth. ASI, in addition to replicating the multi-faceted intelligence of human beings, will be exceedingly better at everything they do because of overwhelmingly greater memory, faster data processing and analysis, and decision-making capabilities. The development of AGI and ASI will lead to a scenario most popularly referred to as the singularity. And while the potential of having such powerful machines at our disposal seems appealing, these machines may also threaten our existence or at the very least, our way of life. At this point, it is hard to picture the state of our world when more advanced types of AI come into being. However, it is clear that there is a long way to get there as the current state of AI development compared to where it is projected to go is still in its rudimentary stage. For those holding a negative outlook for the future of AI, this means that now is a little too soon to be worrying about the singularity, and there's still time to ensure AI safety. And for those who are optimistic about the future of AI, the fact that we've merely scratched the surface of AI development makes the future even more exciting.

It’s changing the world, you’ve been told. It’s going to drive your car, grow your food, maybe even take your job. You’ll be forgiven for having some questions about this chaotic, AI-driven world that’s predicted to unfold.Gregory Barber covers cryptocurrency, blockchain, and artificial intelligence for WIRED.First off, it’s true that AI is overhyped. But it’s improving rapidly, and in some ways catching up to the hype. Part of that is a natural evolution: AI improves at a given task when it learns from new data, and the world is producing more data every second. New techniques developed in academic labs and at tech companies lead to jumps in performance, too. That’s led to cars that can drive themselves in some situations, to medical diagnoses that have beaten the accuracy of human doctors, and to facial recognition that’s reliable enough to unlock your iPhone.AI, in other words, is getting really good at some specific tasks. “The nice thing about AI is that it gets better with every iteration,” AI researcher and Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun says. He believes it might just “free humanity from the burden of repetitive work.” But on the lofty goal of so-called “general” AI intelligence that deftly switches between tasks just like a human? Please don’t hold your breath. Preserve those brain cells; you’ll need them to out-think the machines.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceIn the meantime, AI’s biggest impact may come from democratizing the capabilities that we have now. Tech companies have made powerful software tools and data sets open source, meaning they’re just a download away for tinkerers, and the computing power used to train AI algorithms is getting cheaper and easier to access.

But we're still a long way from intelligence that switches tasks as easily as a person.,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",,,,,,,,,,,"First off, it’s true that AI is overhyped. But it’s improving rapidly, and in some ways catching up to the hype. Part of that is a natural evolution: AI improves at a given task when it learns from new data, and the world is producing more data every second. New techniques developed in academic labs and at tech companies lead to jumps in performance, too. That’s led to cars that can drive themselves in some situations, to medical diagnoses that have beaten the accuracy of human doctors, and to facial recognition that’s reliable enough to unlock your iPhone.
AI, in other words, is getting really good at some specific tasks. “The nice thing about AI is that it gets better with every iteration,” AI researcher and Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun says. He believes it might just “free humanity from the burden of repetitive work.” But on the lofty goal of so-called “general” AI intelligence that deftly switches between tasks just like a human? Please don’t hold your breath. Preserve those brain cells; you’ll need them to out-think the machines.
In the meantime, AI’s biggest impact may come from democratizing the capabilities that we have now. Tech companies have made powerful software tools and data sets open source, meaning they’re just a download away for tinkerers, and the computing power used to train AI algorithms is getting cheaper and easier to access. That puts AI in the hands of a (yes, precocious) teenager who can develop a system to detect pancreatic cancer, and allows a group of hobbyists in Berkeley to race (and crash) their DIY autonomous cars. “We now have the ability to do things that were PhD theses five or 10 years ago,” says Chris Anderson, founder of DIY Drones (and a former WIRED editor-in-chief).

In Canadian author Margaret Atwood’s book ""Blind Assassins,"" she says that “touch comes before sight, before speech. It’s the first language and the last, and it always tells the truth.”While our sense of touch gives us a channel to feel the physical world, our eyes help us immediately understand the full picture of these tactile signals.Robots that have been programmed to see or feel can’t use these signals quite as interchangeably. To better bridge this sensory gap, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have come up with a predictive artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn to see by touching, and learn to feel by seeing.The team’s system can create realistic tactile signals from visual inputs, and predict which object and what part is being touched directly from those tactile inputs. They used a KUKA robot arm with a special tactile sensor called GelSight, designed by another group at MIT.Using a simple web camera, the team recorded nearly 200 objects, such as tools, household products, fabrics, and more, being touched more than 12,000 times. Breaking those 12,000 video clips down into static frames, the team compiled “VisGel,” a dataset of more than 3 million visual/tactile-paired images.“By looking at the scene, our model can imagine the feeling of touching a flat surface or a sharp edge”, says Yunzhu Li, CSAIL PhD student and lead author on a new paper about the system. “By blindly touching around, our model can predict the interaction with the environment purely from tactile feelings. Bringing these two senses together could empower the robot and reduce the data we might need for tasks involving manipulating and grasping objects.”Recent work to equip robots with more human-like physical senses, such as MIT’s 2016 project using deep learning to visually indicate sounds, or a model that predicts objects’ responses to physical forces, both use large datasets that aren’t available for understanding interactions between vision and touch.The team’s technique gets around this by using the VisGel dataset, and something called generative adversarial networks (GANs).GANs use visual or tactile images to generate images in the other modality. They work by using a “generator” and a “discriminator” that compete with each other, where the generator aims to create real-looking images to fool the discriminator. Every time the discriminator “catches” the generator, it has to expose the internal reasoning for the decision, which allows the generator to repeatedly improve itself.Vision to touch Humans can infer how an object feels just by seeing it. To better give machines this power, the system first had to locate the position of the touch, and then deduce information about the shape and feel of the region.The reference images — without any robot-object interaction — helped the system encode details about the objects and the environment. Then, when the robot arm was operating, the model could simply compare the current frame with its reference image, and easily identify the location and scale of the touch.This might look something like feeding the system an image of a computer mouse, and then “seeing” the area where the model predicts the object should be touched for pickup — which could vastly help machines plan safer and more efficient actions.Touch to visionFor touch to vision, the aim was for the model to produce a visual image based on tactile data. The model analyzed a tactile image, and then figured out the shape and material of the contact position. It then looked back to the reference image to “hallucinate” the interaction.For example, if during testing the model was fed tactile data on a shoe, it could produce an image of where that shoe was most likely to be touched.This type of ability could be helpful for accomplishing tasks in cases where there’s no visual data, like when a light is off, or if a person is blindly reaching into a box or unknown area.Looking ahead The current dataset only has examples of interactions in a controlled environment. The team hopes to improve this by collecting data in more unstructured areas, or by using a new MIT-designed tactile glove, to better increase the size and diversity of the dataset.There are still details that can be tricky to infer from switching modes, like telling the color of an object by just touching it, or telling how soft a sofa is without actually pressing on it. The researchers say this could be improved by creating more robust models for uncertainty, to expand the distribution of possible outcomes.In the future, this type of model could help with a more harmonious relationship between vision and robotics, especially for object recognition, grasping, better scene understanding, and helping with seamless human-robot integration in an assistive or manufacturing setting.“This is the first method that can convincingly translate between visual and touch signals”, says Andrew Owens, a postdoc at the University of California at Berkeley. “Methods like this have the potential to be very useful for robotics, where you need to answer questions like ‘is this object hard or soft?’, or ‘if I lift this mug by its handle, how good will my grip be?’ This is a very challenging problem, since the signals are so different, and this model has demonstrated great capability.”Li wrote the paper alongside MIT professors Russ Tedrake and Antonio Torralba, and MIT postdoc Jun-Yan Zhu. It will be presented next week at The Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in Long Beach, California.

I believe medical science has gone too far in saving those who no longer have any quality of life, so now I worry that artificial intelligence may go too far. Will employees in the field of artificial intelligence be the only ones whose jobs are safe?A: Artificial intelligence (AI) poses questions for all who have to work, but it could serve as a motivator for putting your best effort into your performance. AI is most definitely impressive, but you can't choose a field that doesn't suit your abilities and personality. You won't succeed by allowing fear to be your motivator.Although AI seems to be guiding the future, many of its advances offer companies practical advantages — the ability to improve systems and procedures more rapidly while decreasing losses. Hopefully our advanced technological abilities will not overpower our lack of emotional intelligence as you describe in the field of medicine, for it is emotional intelligence and creativity that will give individuals an advantage in the workplace.The population is enamored by the thought of self-driving cars, but the safety side is what's critical. According to a recent National Safety Council report, at least 40,000 fatalities occur in the U.S. every year as a result of car accidents. If AI eliminates even half of these traffic deaths, it is worth the takeover of driving.AI is also helping businesses nationwide to detect questionable business expenses, which raises the cost of doing business and filters down to higher prices for customers. Anant Kale, co-founder and CEO of AppZen, has used AI to replace jobs in which employees tracked and investigated potentially fraudulent and improper business expenses. Employees cheating on business expenses is so prevalent an issue that AppZen's AI technology is used by 1,200 major companies to date — Amazon, Citibank, Salesforce, CBS and Airbus, to name a few.AI reviews expense reports at a much faster rate than any human can, checking into every aspect of the expenses, including amounts, types of expenses, locations, reasons for the expenses, even the parties involved in the expenses. Kale said 90% of expense reports are valid but 10% of companies using AI are not. The job of reviewing expense reports was so tedious when handled by humans that the accountants and others assigned to the job would only spot-check because it was so time-consuming, which meant most improper and fraudulent claims went undetected.The most common and improper types of charges were for entertainment at strip joints, extraordinary dining, and inappropriate entertaining of and gifting to politicians, judges and others in influential positions. Companies cannot risk employees jeopardizing its reputation with illegitimate expenses.AI can be trained specifically for each company. It can check for appropriate dining times, acceptable restaurants and meal amounts, and the number of people dining. Employees have been known to violate company policies by charging the company for upgrading flights above what they are allowed, along with upgrading hotel rooms.If that isn't enough, AI has discovered a common petty theft of employees charging the company for adding funds to personal Starbucks cards and gift cards. Petty theft is not so petty when 10% of a company's employees engage in it. AI also reviews social media to confirm the employee isn't entertaining an inappropriate guest, finds duplicate submissions of the same expenses and can determine high-risk issues.Amazingly, AI completes an expense report analysis in five minutes. If the expenses are questionable, the information is turned over to managers and reimbursement for those expenses is halted immediately.No human can compete with AI's speed and accuracy, and according to Kale, no accountant really wants that type of work to begin with. The advantage of using this AI is that proper expense reports are reimbursed within two days of submission. Perhaps AI could eventually replace most workers in their jobs, but that's why employees must strive to do more than just their job description and be high performers and creative achievers — to show their bosses why they cannot be replaced.Email your workplace issues and experiences to lindseynovak@yahoo.com.Barefoot VitalityThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarefoot Vitality|AdAdBuy NowUndoPenny PincherVirginia: Big Changes Near Chantilly Leaves Drivers FumingDo not pay your auto insurance bill until you read this.Penny Pincher|AdAdUndoFisher Investments7 Wealth Tips Once Your Portfolio Reaches $1 MillionHow do retirees take steps to preserve their wealth in retirement?

And the bomb can use this autonomous capability to navigate and correct its location, according to Gideon Weiss, Rafael’s deputy general manager of marketing and business development at the company’s air and C4I division.With its AI and “deep learning” technologies, the weapon has the ability to identity moving ground targets and distinguish them from other objects and terrain. This is based on 3D models uploaded to the bomb as well as algorithms. As the weapon identifies and homes in on its target, such as a convoy of vehicles, it separates the convoy of interest from other vehicles it has “learned” to ignore.“The deep-learning algorithm is indifferent to the actual data fed to it for modeling targets of interest and embedding their pertaining characteristics into the system,"" Weiss said. ""However, the more the data used for modeling is representative of the target of interest, the more robust the recognition probability will be in real life.”Rafael has completed the development and testing phase of the Spice 250, including flight tests, which have “proven the robustness of the ATA and ATR, so it is mature for delivery,” Weiss said, using acronyms for automatic target acquisition and recognition.Asked if the ATR algorithm will select a secondary target if the computer cannot find the initial human-selected target, Weiss said: “This goes into the area of user-defined policies and rules of engagement, and it is up to the users to decide on how to apply the weapon, when and where to use it, and how to define target recognition probabilities and its eventuality.”Automatically selecting a secondary target may eventually become part of the upgrade profile for the munition, if customers express significant interest in the feature.With a two-way data link and a video-streaming capability, the bomb can be aborted or told to re-target up until a “few second before the weapon hits its target,” Weiss explained. That two-way data-link, enabled by the weapon’s mounting on a Smart Quad Rack, or SQR, will enable future deep learning to be based on data extracted from earlier launches. Data recorded will include either live-streaming video or a burst of still images of the entire homing phase up until impact.“These are automatically and simultaneously recorded on the SQR — enabling two functions: (a) real-time and post-mission BDI (Bomb Damage Indication); (b) post-mission target data extraction for intel updates, etc.,"" Weiss said. ""The ATR capability, including its deep learning updates, must be more agile than the enemy’s ability to conceal and/or change its battlefield footprint, tactics, appearance or anything else which might impede the ATR from accurately recognizing and destroying targets.”The Spice family of weapons is operational with the Israeli Air Force and international customers.About  Seth J. Frantzman and Kelsey D. AthertonSeth J.

Like many artists, she wants her work to promote discussion. And yet unlike other artists, Ai-Da tells us with a blank expression and glassy eyes that only blink occasionally, she does not have consciousness, thoughts and feelings. At least, not yet.Ai-Da’s creators bill her as the world’s first robot artist, and she’s the latest AI innovation to blur the boundary between machine and artist; a vision of the future suddenly becoming part of our present. She has a robotic arm system and human-like features, is equipped with facial recognition technology and is powered with artificial intelligence. She is able to analyze an image in front of her, which feeds into an algorithm to dictate the movement of her arm, enabling her to produce sketches. Her goal is creativity.She is currently on display at Oxford in what organizers say is the world’s first exhibition to show the solo work of a robotic artist. Using academic Margaret Boden’s philosophical definition of creativity as something that is new, surprising and of value, art dealer and leader of the Ai-Da project Aidan Meller believes Ai-Da’s output meets these criteria. He tells TIME that each of the robot’s creations are different every time, even with the same stimulus, and are unreproducible.Manufactured by a team of engineers specializing in robots with human-like features and using algorithms developed by scientists at Oxford University, Ai-Da captures images in front of her with a camera in her eye. A series of algorithms then send instructions to her robotic arm and hand, which was created by students based in Leeds, U.K. Ai-Da takes her name from Ada Lovelace, the world’s first female computer programmer, and the exhibition at Oxford is a homage to the history of AI and robotics. The art on show includes drawings, paintings and sculptures rendered from her algorithmic instructions. Portrait of Ada Lovelace by Ai-Da robot artistVictor FrankowskiTo create the prism like paintings, Ai-Da draws a picture, for example a bee or a tree. Researchers at Oxford University plot the coordinates from her drawing onto a Cartesian plane (a graph), and run them through an AI neural network, a computing system modelled on the human brain. The choices of the neural network and the way it ‘reads’ the drawing coordinates create the dazzling prism effect, as neural networks interpret the Cartesian plane very differently to humans. The complex visual output is printed onto canvas, where a human artist then paints over part of the canvas. “The potential for technology to augment the human potential for creativity, to expand the achievable horizons of creative expression and to possess its own creative potential as an entity of its own is so fascinating and exciting,” says Aidan Gomez, a researcher at Oxford working on the project.

Also on show at the exhibition are pencil sketches of Alan Turing, the famed pioneer of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, and Karel Čapek, the Czech writer who coined the term “robot,” as well as abstract paintings that have been created using Ai-Da’s AI response to stimuli of an oak tree and a bee. Monitor screens around the exhibition show Ai-Da reciting poetry that has been created by rearranging the work of incarcerated writers of the 20th century exploring the pain and suffering of imprisonment, like Oscar Wilde and Fyodor Dostoevsky. There’s something slightly unnerving about her renditions of their reinterpreted works, her hesitant voice speaking on behalf of the imprisoned.“We see this show as the start of a journey questioning the uses and abuses of AI and machine learning,” says Meller, who has over 20 years’ experience in the art industry. “Without a doubt, AI is going to be the big thing of the 2020s, and that concerns us greatly. The 20th century shows that when there is technological development, small groups of people can get hold of that with devastating effects.”A painting created using data from Ai-Da's data response to an oak treeVictor FrankowskiAi-Da is not the first AI creation to produce artwork. Last year, Christie’s New York auctioned an AI-generated work in the first sale of its kind at a major auction house, and since 2006, British computer scientist Simon Colton has been developing creative graphics software to turn digital photographs into works of art. But Ai-Da’s human-like appearance brings something both intriguing and slightly eerie to the field. “Through the project, I’ve noticed how robotic we are as humans,” Meller says. “Ai-Da’s become such a phenomenon because you can’t pigeonhole her; she’s not just one thing, she’s many. As a result, we’ve produced lots of works that are by her, and her nature.”Many of us have long been fascinated by the crossovers between, and potential combination of, man and machine. Recent examples include Yuval Noah Harari’s exploration of biotechnology’s impact on humans in Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, and viral sensation Sophia, dubbed “the world’s most human-like robot.”“What’s intriguing here [with Ai-Da] is that people get very taken in by a robot that looks human,” says Marcus du Sautoy, a professor of mathematics at Oxford University and author of The Creativity Code: How AI Is Learning to Write, Paint and Think. Indeed, one art critic appeared to be so smitten by Ai-Da’s lips and her eyes that he lamented not being able to write his phone number on her metallic robotic hand. Nicky JohnstonThat fascination with Ai-Da’s appearance may be somewhat distracting from the substance and skill of her art. “Actually for several decades, there have already been examples of great algorithmic art, which hasn’t needed a human robot to achieve that,” du Sautoy points out. Du Sautoy, like Ai-Da’s creators, is optimistic about the combination of AI and creativity, particularly when it adds value and is surprising, as Boden’s definition suggests. “Machine learning is all about picking up unique characteristics in data, and being able to exploit that to produce more, or to take things in a new direction,” he says. “The challenge is not to create things that are more of the same. The most impressive cases are where AI is pushing us up as humans into the new.”As an example of AI pushing the human boundaries of creativity and helping us to discover new things, Du Sautoy cites the Continuator, a musical instrument trained to respond to users. . In 2012, French jazz musician Bernard Lubat improvised with the Continuator, which was trained in his style of musicianship, leaving audiences unable to distinguish the difference between the machine and the musician. “The really fascinating thing is that Lubak said when he was improvising with the AI, it was doing things he had never thought of doing with his musical soundscape, and was pushing him to develop ideas that would have taken him years to develop,” says du Sautoy.However, the rapid innovation in this field can come with pitfalls. Du Sautoy used an algorithm to write 350 words of his own book, material he says nobody, including his editor, has been able to yet identify as computer-generated. The fact that the AI-generated text is indistinguishable from human prose could one day lead to misuse of the technology. But du Sautoy says that that is a long way off, as AI is having difficulty with long term structures in writing text and language. Other shortcomings include the hidden biases that can creep into algorithms, such as racial biases. In other words, as du Sautoy points out, machines may be learning to be creative, but they could potentially be learning from bad or biased data. “There’s a potential for AI to help us create a new sort of art. That’s as exciting as when the camera came along,” du Sautoy says. Indeed, early photographers were seen more as inventors or pioneers of the cumbersome, mechanical process used to capture images in the late 19th century. That’s quite a contrast to today, as technological developments have enabled photographers to be seen as artists in their own right. “Ultimately, I think AI one day will become conscious, and really good AI art will appear when the intentionality is coming from the computer and it has a need to tell us what it feels like inside.”Ai-Da’s creators hope that this exhibition is just the start, and eventually want her to create her own brushwork paintings and artwork that humans physically cannot complete, such as highly complex and detailed canvas work. And as for Ai-Da herself; she cites Yoko Ono, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley as her inspiration. “If we can learn from things in the past,” she says, tilting her head and adjusting her line of vision, “maybe we can make our future a little brighter.” ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Former US Vice President Al Gore has highlighted the role of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning in the fight against climate change.
Speaking at a CEDA-sponsored lunch in Brisbane earlier this month, Gore, who since leaving office has founded the Climate Reality Project, said we’re in the “early stages of a sustainability revolution”.
New innovations like machine learning, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things are allowing for digital tools to help businesses be more sustainable, he explained.
These technologies are empowering executives in all kinds of different industries to manage materials with the same skill and precision that the IT companies use to manage information, he said. And that has the power to make significant changes in the direction of reduced energy consumption.
“This sustainability revolution apparently has the magnitude of the industrial revolution, but the speed of the digital revolution. It is literally unprecedented.”
Gore used Google as an example — he serves as a senior advisor to the US tech giant.
Google has the largest server farms in the world, he said, and applied an AI tool to the running of those farms.
“With no new hardware, simply the application of artificial intelligence, they have reduced the energy consumption of those server farms by 60%,” Gore said.
In many sectors of business and industry, “inefficiencies that we’ve always accepted and taken for granted, can now be identified precisely and pushed away”.
This means the demand for energy is being reduced. At the same time, new sources of energy, such as solar, wind or wave, are becoming more readily available.
The fastest-growing job in the US is solar installer, Gore said, with the number of jobs increasing six times faster than the average.
The second-fastest growing job in the US is wind turbine technician, he added.
“The jobs and retrofitting buildings and improving efficiency and reducing energy demand in creating and installing LEDs, these jobs are the ones that are growing,” he said.
“The young people in my country and in Australia are demanding a better future.”



At the same time, Gore noted that young people coming out of higher education now want to know what a company’s values are before they agree to work with them.
When it comes to the “climate crisis”, Gore said there are three questions left. The first two are: do we really have to change?; and can we change?
“Sometimes in life, you have to change but you don’t have the ability — that’s a formula for depression,” he said.
“But that’s not the case we are facing now. We can change, we have the tools available to us,” he added.
“The third and final question, the most important, is: will we change?”

Otter CEO and Silicon Valley-based serial entrepreneur Sam Liang created a cloud-based artificial... [+] intelligence engine to power its automated speech to text transcription service.
Otter.ai




In my 25-plus-year career—and counting!—as a journalist, I’ve done thousands of interviews and attended even more meetings, either face to face or over the phone which, for lots of them, I had to manually transcribe the conversations to make sure that I got my interlocutors' comments right—a chore that I dreaded.

So when my friend Marie Domingo introduced me to Otter.ai at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco last fall—she was handling their public relations at that time—I was, of course, curious to know more about how this mobile app works but highly skeptical that it would actually help me.
How wrong I was! After more than six months using the free version of the service that includes 600 minutes of free transcriptions per month, Otter.ai changed my life and in a later post, I will publish a more in-depth technical review of Otter’s paid “Premium” version that costs just $10 a month for 6,000 minutes of transcription.
PROMOTED
Not only does the app (for iOS and Android) do an excellent job in transcribing my live interviews and meetings from speech to text with great accuracy—and letting me focus on the actual conversations rather than taking notes verbatim—but it made the notes totally searchable which is an amazing time saver when I'm looking for specific keywords.
I recently sat down with Otter’s CEO and co-founder Sam Liang in Palo Alto to talk about his entrepreneurial journey, from his humble beginnings as a computer student at Peking University to a software engineer (at Cisco and Google to name a few), to finally starting the 30-person startup, which raised $13 million since it was founded over three years ago.
Although I've obviously used Otter for the live transcription of our conversation, this exclusive and nearly two-hour long interview has been edited for clarity and length.








Otter can transcribe in real-time meeting conversations and share the notes within a team.
Otter.ai





Jean Baptiste Su: How did you get the idea of starting Otter?
Sam Liang: There are billions of people here in the world. Everybody talk several hours every day. So voice is just a such a pervasive way for people to communicate. However, I just keep forgetting things. I have so many meetings back to back every day. By the end of my third meeting, I already forgot maybe 70% of the things that happened in the first meeting. So myself, I have the need to have an easy way to take notes. And not only just take notes actually search, because like a month later, if I want to recall you told me about Notre Dame Cathedral, I vaguely remember something but I don't remember the details. At that moment. I could have been a Starbucks coffee place. So I may not have my notebook with me, but I really need that information instantly. So with an app like this, I can just get it and search easily. That's one thing. And also, for us, we have a small team of a few dozen people, but we have tons of meetings going on actually: the product meeting, the Android meeting, the marketing meeting, business development, sales, customer service, etc. So we have all that information but how do you share this information with each other? We have this meeting with you today but somebody in our organization may be interested in some of this conversation. Of course, I can tell him/her verbally, but whatever I say will be somewhat processed. But if they want to know the original conversation is really hard. But with Otter, we can share it easily which is really important for enterprises. And you probably have seen this type of study that shows that in enterprises, people spend at least 30%, or even more 40% or 50% of their time in all kinds of meetings, either in person meeting, phone calls or video conferences. If you think about it, if you pay an employee $100,000 a year, they actually spend 30,000, or $40,000, to just attend meetings. This is how expensive meetings are, but then, how much information is actually being discussed or generated? Or how much return are you getting out of that investment? Right? You pay them $40,000 to attend meetings? Okay, what is the return out of that? So, we're not building a transcription company, Otter is a collaboration company. This is in the same domain, like Zoom, Slack or the storage companies (Box or Dropbox), because the information is also stored in the cloud and is very easy to access, both for yourself and your team members.
JBS: Talk about your entrepreneurial journey
SL: I studied computer science at Peking University and it was my dream to study at Stanford. I applied and was rejected several times but the third time, they finally accepted me in the Ph.D. program with professor David Cheriton and I did my thesis on large scale distributed systems. Then I worked at Cisco a little bit and then joined Google in 2006 to work on a metro Wi-Fi system, putting a Wi-Fi router on light poles on the street. But while working on that, I realized that when I connect my laptop with the Wi-Fi router on the light pole, we can actually estimate their location. So that's the beginning of my location work. So I actually started the Google location service platform. And then later, they realize actually, this is so critical for mobile map. So we integrate that with mobile map. That's why in 2007 when Steve Jobs was launching the first iPhone, one critical app he wanted to provide was a map service. So we actually help them to put the map on the first iPhone, at that time Google and Apple were still good friends because Android hasn't been released yet. But, I always wanted to do something crazy. So I actually quit Google in 2010 to start my first startup: A mobile startup related to location that automatically tracks location and automatically detects all the places a user visit without manual check-in. That company went pretty well, and later it was acquired by Alibaba. The whole team was based here in Palo Alto and I work there a couple more years until I find something even crazier to do. Then I realized that I have this big pain point remembering meetings, and also in how do I share meeting information with each other. So that's the origin of Otter actually. So because I have an engineering background, and I like to just build stuff from the ground up, I build a team that created the speech recognition engine. We are not using Google API or Microsoft API. This is entirely our own technology. So it turned out that this is actually working better than the Google API, we actually beat Microsoft, by a big margin in terms of accuracy, especially in a very noisy environment. And actually, when you have a meeting like this, the speech recognition task is actually more difficult than Alexa, Cortana or Siri. The reason is this: When you talk to Siri or Alexa, you say, hey, Alexa, what's the weather tomorrow? The whole sentence is very short. It's only a few seconds. And it's a very short question or short command. So we call that a chatbot system. Our system is actually much more challenging because it is trying to listen to the conversation between multiple people, it could be three or could be five or 10 in an enterprise meeting. So it's a lot more complicated because whenever you have multiple people speaking, they interrupt each other, they have different accents, they have different paces, their distance to the microphone is different. So somebody's voice is louder and others lower. So we have to build the system from the ground up to handle all this complexity. It is a lot more complicated than handling an Alexa question.
JBS: Did you use some open source technologies to build your engine from scratch?
SL: We use some academic systems but it's a lot more work to do because any project from academia is not usable in a real product. We actually use millions of hours of recordings to train our deep learning algorithm for example.
JBS: How is artificial intelligence (AI) used in Otter?
SL: The speech recognition itself has a lot of AI and machine learning to separate the noise—we actually inject in our training system a lot of the noise into the training data to make it harder, so that the model can learn how to handle the noise—and accents is a very complicated issue to solve as well, even in the U.S., people from Texas, Boston and California talk differently. So how do you know they're saying the same words. Humans have been trained to understand those after 20 years, 30 years of training, right? That's a long time to train your brain to understand it. But still, if it's the first time you hear somebody from Ireland or Scotland, you'll still have trouble understand them, right? Maybe after a few hours, you get better. But how do you teach machine to do that? It's a huge amount of AI there. Also, many words have similar pronunciation. So when you first hear the pronunciation, how do you know which word it is? That's where the context comes into play. The words before it, the words after it, and even the words that happened 10 minutes ago can help you. So the, there's a lot of AI there to incorporate that semantics knowledge into the system and that's part of the natural language processing (NLP), to understand partially the meaning of the words: So which words actually usually go together, or which words rarely go together. In the past, before the current generation of AI, systems used a rules-based system: If this happens, do this and a you may have 100 or a few thousand rules but the problem with that approach is that it doesn't scale, because the number of variation is just too big for you to write a rule for every single scenario and that's where machine learning comes into play. By using a huge amount of data to train the model, in a very large neural network with many nodes, you create a huge matrix from thousands of different variations. It's a totally different. Machine learning is the same thing than how human learn things: When you grow up, you learn a language, nobody tell you rules, but you just sort of emulate how other people speak. And when you say something other people respond. So you get reinforcement, you know, okay, you're saying the same thing. Machine is trying to emulate that type of learning. And even for humans, we may not be able to explain very clearly how we do it and that's the one issue with machine learning that sometimes there's no clear explanation why it happens. But somehow it learns from the data in the past.
JBS: Do you think that machines will surpass humans?
SL: I think it's just a matter of time that machine will be smarter than human. The number of brain cells a human have is huge, but is limited. But machine, once you have the internet, you can actually take advantage of all the machines on the internet, and take advantage all the the knowledge on the internet, then make a decision based on that knowledge. Any single human being one be able to do that. Right now the hard thing for the machine, is to better understand the context. That's still hard. Like when you say the same words, you use different tones that could may mean different things, and that's the level of subtlety that machines can not fully understand yet, but I think is a matter of time an I'm really optimistic about this.
JBS: What has been Otter's traction so far?
SL: So far, we've transcribed almost 10 million meetings—uploaded to our platform or live— for a total of over 250 million minutes. Our technology is also integrated into other services such as the Zoom's cloud-based video conferencing platform. Actually, two years ago, Zoom was actually searching for a solution to transcribe their meetings and they looked at all the usual suspect you can think of to provide a voice API, and found that we worked better than the other guys and decided to license our technology.
JBS: What's the history behind the name of your company, Otter?
SL: When we were looking for a name for our company, we looked at a lot of different choices: We thought about trees, like sequoia or redwood tree, we also looked at fruits, apple is the most famous fruit in the world, and we though about animals that are friendly, adorable and smart, and finally settled on otter. Many people don't know but otters are one of the smartest animals in the world. Dolphins and elephants are also smart, but otters actually have a very high IQ: They can be taught to play games—if you look on YouTube, you can find videos of otters playing basketball in the water! Otters can learn to use rocks and tools to open clams. They also have really good memory. If you teach them something they will still remember it many years later. And there are also very friendly: There are lots of picture of otters holding hands to float in the water. Which also fits our narrative as we see Otter.ai as a collaboration system.
JBS: How do you see the future of Otter?
SL: We don't see Otter as a boring transcription service but as a collaboration system. So transcription is a first step for us to provide better collaboration and next step, there will be more and more natural language processing and natural language understanding (NLU). So we're working on new algorithms to generate summarization as well so after a long meeting it can intelligently detect certain important sentences including action items that can be extracted and put automatically into your calendar, create a reminder for you, integrate that with other project management systems like Jira, or other system. And if you look at Otter, it's actually similar to Slack except that we're focused on voice communication rather than text: in Slack, you have a concept called channels. Similarly, in Otter, you can create groups (a product group, engineering, marketing...), and all the meetings and all the conversations happening in that group are automatically shared with everybody, both the voice and the transcript. So you can make sure that everybody's on the same page, even if they missed the meetings.Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website. Jeb SuFollowingFollowJean Baptiste ""Jeb"" Su is Principal Analyst and Technology Futurist at Atherton Technology Research, a global strategy and intelligence consultancy... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The situation is very important, many futurists think that there is no place for humans in not far new world, because according to Elon Musk: “Robots could start killing us in five years” by making people jobless.[1] They will be dead without money. So, the only solution is the basic income. The English economist Thomas Paine in 1796 presented the first idea of guaranteed minimum income,[2] which is a system of social welfare provision that guarantees that all citizens or families have an income enough to live on. The perception of the meaning of basic income was changed in the twenty-first century when the era of artificial intelligence began. Poverty is still common in lots of countries, but it is not considered to be the main problem. Automation is taking away our jobs and salaries. The issue is to earn money for life without any job. Basic income is the only thing which will in the future improve people’s lives by giving them purpose.There is a very serious problem: in previous centuries people worked to live and lived to work. The meaning of life was researched only by some philosophers, such as Aristotle or Epicurus, but in today’s world, every person has ever thought about the aims and points of their lives. The issue is why somebody should be alive when he does not work. In the past people used to devote their lives to kings or gods, for example, you fight or pray for your country during the whole life. Today democracy and the chance to have a choice are very popular in society, but in fact, human beings are dependent on their jobs. A lot of people ask what they will do without them.Trending AI Articles:1. Deep Learning Book Notes, Chapter 12. Deep Learning Book Notes, Chapter 23. Machines Demonstrate Self-Awareness4. Visual Music & Machine Learning Workshop for KidsWith basic income, people will have the opportunity not to be bored because they will have money to spend on entertainment. Now people are dependent on pop culture. For the last fifty years, the pop culture was upgraded to an unprecedented scale. This important thing interfered in society and even began taking away humans working hours. Children and even older people spend a lot of time for entertainment. According to the American time use survey “, people spend five and quarter hours per day for entertainment” mostly watching television.[3] Also, as it is written by Daniel Wesley: “people spend 5.6 percent or $2,827 for entertainment.”[4]There are a lot of fears of nowadays person: they will become fired because “robot does the work better than them, for example, security, surgery, and farming.”[5] Also, as it is said by McKinsey report “in the USA, 39 to 73 million jobs may be eliminated by 2030.”[6] These fears are improper because there is basic income which provides people with money and pop culture which gives entertainment for them. Work will not be a problem in the future. Next generations will spend their time only for their wishes. It is not the only thing to save humanity but also to make its existence easier.Basic income obeys the moral rules and values because it makes people equal. Black people will not be detracted, they will not have troubles with a job offer and will not be hard up. No sexist problems with women. In future women will not have to do men’s job. Also, the robbery will not exist, because no one will have the need for money. Moreover, disabled people will be in better conditions: they will not have problems with work: “robots will help disabled persons with their day-to-day tasks” and they will afford it. [7]On the fifth of July 2016, Switzerland became the first country to hold a referendum about basic income. During the law “each citizen had to earn 2555$ monthly when they are adult or 628$ for children.”[8] Most of the voters (77%) were against the establishment of this system. They believe if every person had the basic income, they would stop working and just be useless creatures that betray their values. Of course, it is totally wrong. Humans will still have the aim to improve themselves. Due to some individuals’ opinion, for example, Stuart Varney with basic income people will degrade mentally and physically, he claims: “I work, and I think you should too”,[9] but they really cannot make head or tail of how the system will work. A lot of spare time will help people develop their projects. Degradation is not only doing anything but also doing things that you do not really understand or appreciate as it is common in modern society. Artificial intelligence does work that must be done and people do what their soul is connected to. About physical degradation, it must be mentioned that a lot of people will devote their lives to sports.The human mind wants to become a winner in all situations. Sport or other activities are a very good way to stay fit and to have a connection with others. Furthermore, everyone will be in the same condition because there will not be a human who judges the game. Robots will do such kind of things, so there will be no racism and no sexism. Every man and woman are equal.Religion is also a thing that cannot be omitted. Basic income does not conflict Christianity, because as God presents the same rights for everyone as artificial intelligence will give the same amount of money. People also will have more time for prayers.The war with robots will be impossible. In the “I, Robot” book Isaac Asimov created the first three rules of robotics, but they were never used because it is not applicable in today’s world. One of the best businesses is war. Scientists do not use those three laws because there is said that robots cannot kill people. It is unacceptable for war. With basic income, scientists can and must use the laws of robotics in case of robots not kill us. No one will ban this because there will be no business: everyone has the same amount of money. Asimov’s laws will be necessary for all.This year the citizens of Finland had the experiment with Universal basic income which must have provided 2000 people of different categories with salary. This experiment was failed, but according to the publication of the New York Times: “Universal Basic Income Didn’t Fail in Finland. Finland Failed It.”[10] The same experience will be placed in Oakland, California, the business incubator, called Y Combinator “will give 2000 dollars for one hundred families.”[11] In fact, Sam Altman, the president of this company, wants to have the answer if basic income really works.It is understandable that basic income is strange and even hostile thing for the majority of modern people, but the situation will be changed in some years or decades. Humanity will not stop the technological process and hiring, but with the basic income, it will save itself and take place in the new world. People will not be bored, because they will be provided with money to spend on entertainment. Disabled people will not have problems with work and discrimination will not take place in the future. On the one hand, humans will spend more time on their wishes, but on the other hand, they will not degrade physically and mentally.

It’s nearly impossible to detect a professionally altered image these days, but Adobe teamed up with UC Berkeley researchers to train an AI to detect facial manipulation in images edited with Photoshop. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to spot changes in images made with Photoshop’s Face Away Liquify feature, or the function used to change people’s eyes, mouth and other facial features. The neural network was 99% accurate detecting altered images, and for comparison, real people who saw the same photos only spotted the differences 53% of the time. Read more for a video and additional information.


“The tool was also able to revert images to what it predicted was their original state. This isn’t the first time, Adobe has used AI to spot photoshopped images, but this work is specifically targeted at detecting facial manipulation. The company says the work is more pressing than ever,” reports Engadget.

The Amazing Ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) Can Now Detect Dangers At Work
Adobe Stock






Autodesk’s latest addition to its BIM 360 suite of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled industry tools – Construction IQ – aims to reduce these tragic occurrences. It does this by predicting when falls are likely to happen – as well as any other danger to life, limb, or even just quality of work.
Autodesk’s data scientists hit upon the solution while looking for applications where the massive amount of data collected on modern-day construction sites could be put to use, thanks to the industry’s enthusiastic adoption of mobile tools and sensing devices.
PROMOTED
""Imagine being a construction manager and having to contend with the fact that every X number of months, someone's going to die on the job – it's unfathomable to most of us in white collar jobs,"" says Pat Keaney, Autodesk’s lead on the Construction IQ project.
Construction IQ uses natural language processing (NLP)  techniques – algorithms that parse human language (in this case, text notes created around construction jobs by contractors and subcontractors on site) to assess risk and warn of hazards that may go unnoticed by human safety managers.
Keaney tells me, ""Right now we're focussing on applying NLP … we have partners using image recognition; there are 360-degree cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) that can detect gasses in the air … in my mind there’s no doubt that within the next five years, this technology is going to be saving lives.”
In fact, evidence suggests that it probably already is. I spoke to one construction company, BAM Ireland, which told me that by using Autodesk's BIM 360 platform, they had achieved a 20% reduction in quality and safety issues on site.
They have also increased the amount of time available to staff to spend remedying high-risk dangers on site by 25%.
All of this has become possible thanks to the explosion in the amount of data generated and gathered at construction sites.
""We realized there are these tremendous changes happening in the industry as a result of things like smartphones and tablets,"" Keaney says.
""They've only been around 11 or so years, but they've changed the landscape … instead of carrying around reams of paper, you can look at plans on an iPad, and when you do this, you don't just save time, you generate and collect data.
“Everyone has a phone and a high-definition camera in their pocket … so expand that idea to IoT and sensors, most smart people don’t sit around trying to figure out when concrete has cured now, they put a sensor in it, and the sensor tells them when it’s ready.”
The next stage was a natural leap – taking this data and making it available to the AI tools Autodesk developed for its BIM 360 platform meant a move towards a predictive, data-driven model of construction management.
“Our simple hypothesis was there’s got to be value in this data that will help our customers do a more effective job of managing their crazy, chaotic, every-growing construction projects. That’s what led us to start this exploration.”
This is a perfect example of an increasingly common and productive trend across all industries that are engaging in digital transformation. Digitization results in a wealth of information that can often prove useful far beyond the initial use cases for which it was collected.
As the project got underway, there were initial concerns about how willing companies would be to share the data. These proved to be unfounded, as Keaney explained to me:
“In general, our customers have far exceeded my expectations for willingness and passion for allowing us to help them find value in their data … we said we want to go on an exploration and partner with you guys … if you're interested in what we need is for you to grant us access to your data.
“When we did that, our customers would get really excited and dig in and want to spend more time with us … we were able to show them things in their data they had never seen before.
“Are there certain companies that were more conservative and wary? Certainly – in the US they were more willing to take a risk, Europe was a little more cautious – which is one of the reasons it was so exciting to see it embraced by BAM Ireland.”
Data covering over 150 million construction issues harvested from 30,000 real-world projects has been used to train the algorithms that BAM used to drive their impressive results in the field of site safety.
Their digital construction operation manager, Michael Murphy, told me how the platform had allowed them to move away from the siloed approach to data the construction and civil engineering firm had traditionally taken.
He said “When we started, we found our biggest problem was our data was very inconsistent, so when we were setting up projects we were being inconsistent around how we were capturing data, or the issue types we were capturing.
“When we engaged with Construction IQ, the first thing we had to do was tackle this inconsistency – that was a big lesson learned.
“This meant we were able to get better insights into the issues and challenges across our projects … whereas previously we may have just been doing something on a mobile phone or an iPad for the sake of doing it on an iPad … we weren’t really getting the benefits of having standardized datasets that we could query, and get better insights from.”
It seems inevitable that as technologies such as machine learning, NLP and deep learning continue to prove their worth, solutions built on them will become increasingly widely adopted across construction, as well as any other industries that can benefit from a consolidated approach to data gathering and analytics.
In the short term, this is likely to save lives, while in the long term, it will contribute to the development of safer working practices and standards.
As Keaney puts it, “I think safety is something that everyone can agree is important – nobody should be holding their data close to their chest around these issues, it wouldn’t be good behavior.
""The whole industry shares these problems … and all of this tech is going to save lives; there's no doubt about it … from a safety perspective, the benefits are clear, compelling, and really easy to understand.""Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But what about the world of art? Art curator and gallery director Aidan Meller pondered this question when he studied the “terrifying” implications of widespread AI development. Mr Meller, whose background is strictly in dealing with art, has no prior experience with robotics or artificial intelligence. However, his fascination with the cultural zeitgeist of today – Artificial Intelligence – has resulted in the birth of a new kind of artist.

We needed a new voice to discuss AI and its implicationsAidan Meller, gallery directorIn the same way, he argued, Claude Monet pioneered impressionistic painting in response to the invention of the camera, so will artists find new ways of creating art.Mr Meller said the invention of the camera “expanded the palette” of possibilities for artists to dip into and innovate.In the same way, he hopes Ai-Da can have a similar effect on a world more and more reliant on technology.READ MORE: Mona Lisa brought to LIFE for the first time with DISTURBING 'deep-fake' AI technologyArtificial Intelligence: Ai-Da is the brainchild of Aidan Meller (right) (Image: NICKY JONHSTON)So, how does the humanoid robot work? Unfortunately, the robot does not quite have the dexterity to master the paintbrush.But Ai-Da’s brilliance is hidden in the AI algorithms, which help her interpret the world through her robotic camera eyes.Ai-Da absorbs information through her eyes, which she then processes and interprets into unique artistic visions.AI algorithms developed at Oxford University then relay the information back into her robotic arm – developed by AI engineers at Leeds University – to draw on a canvas.Ai-Da has managed to create this way unique portraits of computing pioneers such as Alan Turing or Ada Lovelace – the robot’s namesake.READ MORE: More than half of UK FEARS robots will take overArtificial Intelligence: The robot's AI was developed at Oxford University (Image: VICTOR FRANKOWSKI)Artificial Intelligence: Ai-Da was designed to look and act as human as possible (Image: GUY BELL)And Ai-Da’s algorithms also have the capability of creating abstract images of from shapes and colours on the Cartesian coordinate system.The results are multi-faceted abstracts, which Mr Meller said have so far been met with hugely positive reactions.Ai-Da’s work was revealed this week (June 5) during a press conference and exhibition at Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford, where the robot’s work could be seen up-close.

Mr Meller said: “The show has sold out now, so it’s been a very successful show. People are really interested in her.”By the end of the year, Ai-Da will travel to London for a second art show.And building on top of the robot’s work, Mr Meller said he is interested in further work with AI, including exploring the kinds of art, which humans cannot create.

It can help trace missing children, but misidentifies people of color. It can help detect cancer, but may recommend the wrong cure. It can help track criminals, but could aid foreign enemies in targeting voters. It can improve efficiency, but perpetuate long-standing biases.close dialogAdvertisementclose dialogThe “it” is artificial intelligence, a technology that teaches machines to recognize complex patterns and make decisions based on them, much like humans do. While the promised benefits of the technology are profound, the downsides could be damaging, even dangerous.Last year police in New Delhi, for example, traced 2,930 missing children in four days by using an experimental facial recognition technology that identified them by examining a database of 45,000 kids living in shelters and homes. Yet a facial recognition tool developed by Amazon and tested by the American Civil Liberties Union in 2018 incorrectly identified 28 members of Congress as having been arrested for a crime, disproportionately picking out African American lawmakers, including civil rights icon John Lewis.Significant advances in computers’ ability to recognize visual patterns and human languages, including voice and text recognition, and to learn without supervision have brought machines closer to achieving cognitive tasks once reserved for humans. Vast quantities of data held privately and by governments are the necessary “food” that computers must digest to learn the new skills.[jwp-video n=”1″]
Lawmakers and regulators still grappling with the downsides of the internet and social media era, such as loss of privacy, criminal hacking and data breaches, are now trying to balance the promises and perils of artificial intelligence. Industry groups, lobbyists and unions are angling to shape the debate over regulations affecting technologies that could one day bring more job losses because of increased automation. Civil rights groups and some technologists are calling for greater oversight to prevent bias and discriminatory practices.Determining the way forward is also complicated because artificial intelligence has emerged almost organically from existing technology and data, unhampered by restrictions on privacy and use, said Jason Schultz, a law professor at New York University who also oversees law and policy for NYU’s AI Now Institute. “We are now trying to figure out whether the scaffolding we have for the internet era is sufficient for AI or do we need a whole new foundation,” he said.Northwell Health, New York state’s largest health care provider, for example, uses Amazon’s Echo voice-activated device to assist hospital patients with queries on everything from medications to music. Typical Echo devices store recordings of user requests on Amazon servers, but Northwell uses its own servers to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the landmark law that safeguards patient information.“But is that enough or do we need new regulations?” Schulz asked.
Good and evil
Members of Congress are waking up to the potential dangers of widespread use of AI technologies. They have drafted bills that would not only require more transparency and accountability over these automated systems, but also allow users to withhold certain information from the large data sets that drive artificial intelligence.“It’s a fundamental way in which decisions are made now — algorithms and computers,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is co-sponsoring a bill dubbed the Algorithmic Accountability Act, introduced in April. “And it seems to me that there’s not much transparency, not much disclosure, and that’s what we sought to do in our bill.”The bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to prepare rules requiring companies to test their AI-powered systems for accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy and security, and to correct errors if they find them. The bill is backed by Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat running for president, and New York Democratic Rep. Yvette D. Clarke.When introducing the legislation, Booker described his African American parents’ experience with “real estate steering” in 1969, when agents coaxed black couples away from some neighborhoods.While such practices have been outlawed, opaque automated advertising systems driven by algorithms could perpetuate discrimination and avoid scrutiny, he said.Tech-savvy lawmakers say Congress must be better educated before passing legislation addressing artificial intelligence to avoid repeating the failures made with earlier internet technologies.California Democrat Ro Khanna, a member of the Congressional Artificial Intelligence Caucus whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, said he’s putting together a working group of economists, lawyers, academics and others to help lawmakers draft legislation.“That may allow us to get ahead of the curve when it comes to AI and preventing misuse of AI in a way that we weren’t ahead of the curve on social media,” said Khanna, a national co-chairman of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.The AI Caucus is still mostly a digital forum that has yet to meet in person, said Rep. André Carson, an Indiana Democrat who is part of the group. The goal of the caucus is not to turn lawmakers into tech wizards but to get them up to speed on key issues, he said.As a “Star Wars” fan who also grew up watching the TV series “Knight Rider,” which featured a souped-up Pontiac Trans Am that could talk and help fight injustices, Carson said he’s both excited and concerned about the possibilities for AI.Technologies that could enable the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to target criminals and potential terrorists could as easily be used by adversaries to target voters and whip up fear, Carson said. “Whatever is created for good can be used for evil purposes,” he said.
K Street awakens
Regardless of the complexities of the technology and the slow learning curve lawmakers face, lobbyists are on top of the technology on behalf of their clients and have ramped up their outreach to lawmakers over AI.In 2015, Carnegie Mellon University was the lone organization to disclose “artificial intelligence” as a federal lobbying issue, according to quarterly reports filed with Congress. In the first months of this year, in contrast, nearly 100 interests have identified it, a signal that K Street sees it as an area of growth.Washington’s largest lobbying practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld offers one example.Earlier this year the firm hired former Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who left at the conclusion of the 115th Congress after serving as chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. Smith and others at the firm have been pitching existing and potential clients about artificial intelligence.Akin Gump held a roundtable discussion with lawmakers in the AI caucus plus outside stakeholders. Smith predicts a lot of activity this year, with multiple bills touching AI already introduced.“I think the government is also rightly concerned about privacy but equally concerned about the misuse of AI, malicious use,” Smith said. “Capitol Hill, Congress, the House and Senate, are just sort of trying to feel their way forward. I think they’re really just at the beginning of information gathering and the self-education process.”The tussle to regulate technology also is playing out between employers and unions.The trucking industry is seeking a federal safety standard for “highly automated vehicles,” arguing that such an approach is better than different state-by-state standards.Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Associations, said artificial intelligence can help improve safety and reduce congestion and pollution, citing the industry’s $75 billion a year loss because of congestion.But unions, fearing that self-driven trucks may take away jobs, lobbied against a bill that would have set a federal standard for automated commercial vehicles.Despite promises that the technology will make drivers’ lives easier, “it remains to be seen how that stuff’s going to roll out and whether the true goal is really just to take someone’s job,” said Sam Loesche, legislative representative for the Teamsters.The push and pull between technologists and companies on the one side and labor unions and advocates on the other is likely to continue as lawmakers and regulators begin looking for ways to draw boundaries around artificial intelligence.“Without any question, AI is coming,” former Rep. Smith said. “We need to make sure it’s heading in the right direction.”[jwp-video n=”2″]

Fortnite: How Artificial Intelligence and Analytics Make It More Fun

It is also representative of a relatively new paradigm in gaming – one that has altered the software landscape until it has become almost unrecognizable in recent years. Known as games-as-a-service (GaaS), the game is funded through subscriptions and regular transactions by its players rather than a one-off fee.
Although this may not seem all that new to those of us old enough to remember the coin-guzzling likes of Pac Man and Space Invaders, GaaS means the continuous revenue stream funds ongoing development and improvement of the game.
PROMOTED
And its cloud-based nature (along with the vast userbase) means huge amounts of data is available to developers Epic – the game generates a staggering two petabytes per month. All of this can be mined for insights into what keeps their players coming back for more – and contributed towards generating $3 billion in profit during 2018.
Data is the fuel of artificial intelligence. Every piece of data players generate by interacting with each other, and the platform can now be analyzed with smart algorithms and used to make the game more entertaining and immersive, which in turn helps to grow the user base.
These analytics – running on tools including Amazon Sagemaker – are used to identify KPIs such as the length of time players are engaging with the game – be that hours per day or sessions per week – and understand what it is that provides the “hook” that keeps players coming back.
Once this is done, the company can make changes to the game's internal structure, such as deploying different gameplay modes encouraging players to interact in different ways, to drive growth across its key metrics.
Much of Epic’s infrastructure supporting Fortnite is built on Amazon’s AWS cloud service, and the company’s director of platform, Chris Dyl, told AWS Summit in New York “We use the data for everything, from ARPU (average revenue per user) to game analysis and improvements.”
At peak times, the Fortnite analytics pipeline ingests 40gb of data every minute into the Epic data lake, that as of last year was reported to stand at 14 petabytes in size, and to be growing by two petabytes a month.
The precise details of how data is used to improve gameplay and drive player engagement are kept under wraps. But tools and services related to data analytics that it is known to use include Amazon S3, the Apache Spark cluster computing framework, and the Tableau visualization software.
As with other GaaS operations, it is likely that Epic use their data to balance gameplay within Fortnite’s “battle royale” tournaments – free-for-all skirmishes where 100 players compete to be the last man or woman standing in an ever-shrinking arena.
Additionally, design decisions such as the implementation of new gameplay modes will be based on what is learned about the types of battle that are popular with the userbase.
Because battles in Fortnite are relatively free-form, rather than being structured around missions or objectives as is the norm in video games, Epic can use analytics and AI to make interesting psychological observations around player behavior. Will players tend to go it alone in a ""lone wolf"" fashion, or will they form temporary alliances and pacts to work together on self-determined objectives – such as taking down stronger players or holding strategically important terrain? What level of risk are players willing to take when it comes to exposing themselves or leaving cover, to collect better weapons and equipment? AI can be used to monitor this ""emergent"" gameplay and adapt the challenge to suit players' style.
Emergent gameplay is nothing too new in gaming and marks a trend away from games where every individual element was hand-crafted by human game designers, towards allowing players to create rules for themselves in a ""sandbox"" environment. AI is a natural next step in this evolution, enabling the prospect of ""virtual referees"" that can adapt to what players are doing and ensure the game's infrastructure adapts too, to cope with this behavior.
Epic had also developed a great deal of its own infrastructure itself – way before Fortnite existed, its Unreal Engine was one of the most commonly used gameplay engines in both independent and ""triple-A,"" big studio game design.
Carrying on this tradition, it recently made Epic Online Services freely available – a platform for creating, maintaining, and managing massively multiplayer, cloud-based games.
The move into the cloud and AI technology taken by Epic is driven by its partnership with Tencent, which invested $330 million in exchange for a 40% share of the company in 2012. Tencent is the most gaming-focused of the Chinese tech giants. It has pioneered the development of the cloud, mobile and microtransaction infrastructure rolled out by Fortnite, and now being adopted across the games industry.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novant Health's new innovation institute will focus on using AI to enhance personalized patient care.  (Novant Health)
Add Novant Health to the growing list of health systems that have opened institutes dedicated to artificial intelligence.The health system, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, launched the Novant Health Institute of Innovation & Artificial Intelligence (AI), which will use AI to enhance personalized patient care. The institute will focus on the advanced technologies required to provide highly personalized care and accelerated solutions with actionable data and insights for preventive prediction, diagnosis and treatment to Novant Health’s patients, the health system said.Novant Health consists of 640 care locations, including 15 hospitals and hundreds of outpatient facilities and physician clinics servicing patients in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.To drive this work, Novant will partner with the health system's physicians as well as technology companies, research organizations, universities and other healthcare organizations to leverage the work already in place within Novant Health’s digital products and services team. RELATED: Mount Sinai, Hasso Plattner Institute launch new $15M digital health center""The institute will help Novant Health develop both clinical and operational solutions that streamline patient care across our health care system,"" Eric Eskioglu, M.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer for Novant Health, said in a statement.Some Novant Health team members will rotate in and out of the institute as subject matter experts on an as-needed basis while others may have full-time assignments there, the health system said. A Novant Health spokeswoman said the Institute will not have a separate building but will entail ""a set of processes and constructs that allow team members from all parts of Novant Health to explore and experiment with emerging AI-based capabilities, acting as a distributed team, for the benefit of our patients and communities.""“It’s an exciting time to be in health care because of the proliferation of AI-based solutions that anticipate patient needs and improve the overall experience,” said Angela Yochem, executive vice president and chief digital and tech officer for Novant Health. “As we build our competencies in AI and machine learning, we want our team members, business partners and providers to have a place where they can present their ideas to improve the delivery of care.”The institute is led jointly by Eskioglu and Yochem.RELATED: Accenture: AI, blockchain will have 'transformational' impact in next 3 yearsA recent Accenture survey of healthcare executives found that the majority of healthcare organizations are experimenting with at least one of these emerging technologies: distributed ledgers, artificial intelligence, extended reality or quantum computing. And 41% of healthcare executives believe AI will have the greatest impact on their organization over the short term.Two-thirds of healthcare executives believe the combination of these technologies will have a ""transformational"" or ""extensive"" impact on their organizations in the next three years. Novant joins a growing list of health systems and universities launching centers dedicated to AI and innovation. Mount Sinai Health System and the Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany have launched a new $15 million digital health center, based at Mount Sinai in New York City, with the aim of accelerating the use of AI and other emerging technologies in clinical care.In March, Cleveland Clinic announced the opening of its new Center for Clinical Artificial Intelligence with a focus on developing innovative clinical applications of AI and leveraging machine-learning technology in hopes of improving healthcare delivery in areas such as diagnostics, disease prediction and treatment planning, the organization said.Banner Health, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, announced in May a new initiative called the Banner Innovation Group focused on bringing the health system's innovation efforts all under one umbrella. Some of its projects include an artificial intelligence triage tool and a chatbot for the emergency department.Stony Brook University also recently opened the Institute for AI-Driven Discovery and Innovation to advance AI research across multiple disciplines, including healthcare.

Digicloud’s Google Cloud partners can guide your success! (AI) bootcamps, kicking off in Cape Town. Dubbed “AI in Khayelitsha”, this first series of youth month bootcamps will take place on 7 June through to 9 June.  The Khayelitsha AI learning drive marks the second time the Motlanthe Foundation hosts such an event in Cape Town this year. In March, the foundation hosted the “AI in Mitchells Plain” bootcamp.  “AI in Khayelitsha” forms part of the nationwide social impact bootcamp programme, AI in Africa, focused on exposing young South Africans to technology that will prepare them for a digitally-driven economy. According to a statement, the girls-only bootcamps target girls aged 15- to 18-years-old from historically disadvantaged communities, to motivate them to create purposeful, high-impact solutions that tackle challenges ranging from community safety to unemployment and education. “AI in Khayelitsha” will gather 60 girls from Chris Hani Secondary, Harry Gwala Secondary, Joe Slovo Secondary, Siphamandla Secondary and Usasazo High in Khayelitsha.

The three-day exercise will expose these learners to a working environment of cutting-edge technologies, including how to build computer chatbots, package their individual tech ideas and solutions, and pitch their innovations to a panel of judges.” This series of bootcamps comes as young South Africans have expressed uncertainty in their future career prospects in the age of the fourth industrial revolution.  This week, Deloitte released its annual millennial survey, which revealed the majority (working and unemployed) of young South Africans believe the next digital revolution will make it harder to get a job or change jobs in the future.  Mustapha Zaouini, head of innovation at the Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation, says: “The aim of this youth month is to give young people a glimpse of what the future of work may look like and give them access to tools, concepts and access to 21st century skills.” From 13 to 15 June, “AI in Africa” will head to Johannesburg to partnerPARTNERSell Cloud PBX under your own brand and be more profitable with Wanatel's Unified Communication solution with the Gauteng Provincial Government and African Women and Youth Foundation at the fifth annual Gauteng youth career, jobs and entrepreneurship expo in Nasrec.  The youth expo features various activities, including exhibitions, discussions and workshops, and provides information and live services to youth on careers, jobs and work exposure, as well as how to start, run and operate a business. On 17 June, Fliptin will partner with Veromo Enterprise to host a digital dialogue under the theme, “21st Century Skills”, which will bring together leaders from the corporate and government sectors, academics, entrepreneurs and job-seekers to discuss the accessibility of opportunities for young people. The Motlanthe Foundation says throughout the series of events, learners will be mentored by leading professionals and entrepreneurs to deliver a stimulating series of workshops to excite and inspire the youth to reach their fullest potential. “All content is carefully crafted to merge technology and entrepreneurship through an understanding of tech (AI), as well as design thinking and business models.”Share",,,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/artificial-intelligence-bootcamp-heads-to-khayelitsha/DZQ58vVJEPWvzXy2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much as robots have transformed entire swaths of the manufacturing economy, artificial intelligence and automation are now changing information work, letting humans offload cognitive labor to computers. In journalism, for instance, data mining systems alert reporters to potential news stories, while newsbots offer new ways for audiences to explore information. Automated writing systems generate financial, sports and elections coverage. 
A common question as these intelligent technologies infiltrate various industries is how work and labor will be affected. In this case, who – or what – will do journalism in this AI-enhanced and automated world, and how will they do it?
The evidence I assembled in my 2019 book “Automating the News: How Algorithms are Rewriting the Media” suggests that the future of AI-enabled journalism will still have plenty of people around. However, the jobs, roles and tasks of those people will evolve and look a bit different. Human work will be hybridized – blended together with algorithms – to suit AI’s capabilities and accommodate its limitations.
Augmenting, not substituting
Some estimates suggest that current levels of AI technology could automate only about 15% of a reporter’s job and 9% of an editor’s job. Humans still have an edge over non-Hollywood AI in several key areas that are essential to journalism, including complex communication, expert thinking, adaptability and creativity.
Reporting, listening, responding and pushing back, negotiating with sources, and then having the creativity to put it together – AI can do none of these indispensable journalistic tasks. It can often augment human work, though, to help people work faster or with improved quality. And it can create new opportunities for deepening news coverage and making it more personalized for an individual reader or viewer.
Newsroom work has always adapted to waves of new technology, including photography, telephones, computers – or even just the copy machine. Journalists will adapt to work with AI, too. As a technology, it is already and will continue to change newswork, often complementing but rarely substituting for a trained journalist.
New work
I’ve found that more often than not, AI technologies appear to actually be creating new types of work in journalism.
Take for instance the Associated Press, which in 2017 introduced the use of computer vision AI techniques to label the thousands of news photos it handles every day. The system can tag photos with information about what or who is in an image, its photographic style, and whether an image is depicting graphic violence. 
The system gives photo editors more time to think about what they should publish and frees them from spending lots of time just labeling what they have. But developing it took a ton of work, both editorial and technical: Editors had to figure out what to tag and whether the algorithms were up to the task, then develop new test data sets to evaluate performance. When all that was done, they still had to supervise the system, manually approving the suggested tags for each image to ensure high accuracy.
Stuart Myles, the AP executive who oversees the project, told me it took about 36 person-months of work, spread over a couple of years and more than a dozen editorial, technical and administrative staff. About a third of the work, he told me, involved journalistic expertise and judgment that is especially hard to automate. While some of the human supervision  may be reduced in the future, he thinks that people will still need to do ongoing editorial work as the system evolves and expands. 
Semi-automated content production
In the United Kingdom, the RADAR project semi-automatically pumps out around 8,000 localized news articles per month. The system relies on a stable of six journalists who find government data sets tabulated by geographic area, identify interesting and newsworthy angles, and then develop those ideas into data-driven templates. The templates encode how to automatically tailor bits of the text to the geographic locations identified in the data. For instance, a story could talk about aging populations across Britain, and show readers in Luton how their community is changing, with different localized statistics for Bristol. The stories then go out by wire service to local media who choose which to publish. 
The approach marries journalists and automation into an effective and productive process. The journalists use their expertise and communication skills to lay out options for storylines the data might follow. They also talk to sources to gather national context, and write the template. The automation then acts as a production assistant, adapting the text for different locations.
RADAR journalists use a tool called Arria Studio, which offers a glimpse of what writing automated content looks like in practice. It’s really just a more complex interface for word processing. The author writes fragments of text controlled by data-driven if-then-else rules. For instance, in an earthquake report you might want a different adjective to talk about a quake that is magnitude 8 than one that is magnitude 3. So you’d have a rule like, IF magnitude > 7 THEN text = “strong earthquake,” ELSE IF magnitude < 4 THEN text = “minor earthquake.” Tools like Arria also contain linguistic functionality to automatically conjugate verbs or decline nouns, making it easier to work with bits of text that need to change based on data.

Authoring interfaces like Arria allow people to do what they’re good at: logically structuring compelling storylines and crafting creative, nonrepetitive text. But they also require some new ways of thinking about writing. For instance, template writers need to approach a story with an understanding of what the available data could say – to imagine how the data could give rise to different angles and stories, and delineate the logic to drive those variations.
Supervision, management or what journalists might call “editing” of automated content systems are also increasingly occupying people in the newsroom. Maintaining quality and accuracy is of the utmost concern in journalism. 
RADAR has developed a three-stage quality assurance process. First, a journalist will read a sample of all of the articles produced. Then another journalist traces claims in the story back to their original data source. As a third check, an editor will go through the logic of the template to try to spot any errors or omissions. It’s almost like the work a team of software engineers might do in debugging a script – and it’s all work humans must do, to ensure the automation is doing its job accurately.
Developing human resources
Initiatives like those at the Associated Press and at RADAR demonstrate that AI and automation are far from destroying jobs in journalism. They’re creating new work – as well as changing existing jobs. The journalists of tomorrow will need to be trained to design, update, tweak, validate, correct, supervise and generally maintain these systems. Many may need skills for working with data and formal logical thinking to act on that data. Fluency with the basics of computer programming wouldn’t hurt either.
As these new jobs evolve, it will be important to ensure they’re good jobs – that people don’t just become cogs in a much larger machine process. Managers and designers of this new hybrid labor will need to consider the human concerns of autonomy, effectiveness and usability. But I’m optimistic that focusing on the human experience in these systems will allow journalists to flourish, and society to reap the rewards of speed, breadth of coverage and increased quality that AI and automation can offer.

Artificial intelligence: the new electricity

June  2019

   
   
   
   




By Catherine Jewell, Publications Division, WIPO
The British-born computer scientist, Andrew Ng, is a leading thinker on artificial intelligence (AI) and has been a pioneer in its application for many years. He founded the Google Brain project, served as Chief Scientist at Baidu, and co-founded the online learning platform, Coursera. Today, in addition to his academic work at Stanford University (USA), Mr. Ng is heading up two startups: Landing AI, which works with enterprises to adopt AI, and deeplearning.ai, an AI education company. Mr. Ng recently spoke with WIPO Magazine about the transformative power of AI, and the measures required to ensure that AI benefits everyone.

“For AI to reach its full potential, governments should be thoughtful about protecting citizens, while also creating room for the positive innovation that AI can bring,” says Andrew Ng (photo: © NVIDIA Corporation).

Why is AI attracting so much attention?
AI is the new electricity. It will transform every industry and create huge economic value. Technology like supervised learning is automation on steroids. It is very good at automating tasks and will have an impact on every sector – from healthcare to manufacturing, logistics and retail.
When you talk about AI, what exactly do you mean?
Much of the economic value generated by AI today is driven by “supervised learning,” which is really good at figuring out simple input–output, or A to B responses, and mapping them. When you join up lots of input-output pairs, this is called deep learning. Deep learning is really good at image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. Today, the technology’s most lucrative application is probably determining whether consumers will click on an advertisement. Large online platforms are using this technology to create enormous economic value.
But supervised learning and other AI techniques can do much more. For example, we can input a satellite image of an area, and generate an output that tells us whether it is poverty-stricken and needs more resources. We can input data from a city, and generate an output that identifies areas with the greatest risk of gas leaks. Or we can build more accurate climate change models. There are huge untapped AI opportunities in sectors like agriculture, healthcare and manufacturing.

AI is the new electricity. It has the potential to transform every industry and to create huge economic value

Earlier this year, WIPO launched the first report in the WIPO Technology Trends Series on AI. Why is this important?
The WIPO Technology Trends Report offers a clearer understanding of growth trends in AI, and who is using this technology and in which parts of the world. For example, it shows that until now, only a small number of regions and organizations have focused on AI technology. The report also reveals that deep learning is the biggest and fastest growing technique in AI. While great progress has been made with deep learning in terms of collecting more data and creating more powerful computers to make it work, we still have a long way to go. Effective “unsupervised learning” – learning without labelled data – will be very important.

“Most of the inventions and most of the value to be created through AI have not yet been realized,” notes Andrew Ng. “My advice to government leaders of developing nations is to focus on their strengths. For example, if your country is a large coffee exporter, work on AI technologies to optimize how you farm, process and export coffee beans. You have huge opportunities in doing that for your local economy.” (Photo: Alamy Stock Photo / © Hero Images Inc.).

So are there any downsides to AI?
AI will have an impact on some jobs. To ensure that AI reaches its full potential, drives tremendous global economic growth, and that the fruits of AI are shared fairly, we need government, educators and businesses to work together.
What role can governments play in ensuring AI delivers on its promise?
Governments must invest heavily in education to give citizens a path to success in this AI-powered future. That doesn’t mean simply asking people to work harder, it means asking them to study harder. We need to give people an opportunity to learn the skills they need for an AI-powered society. Today, society needs more AI engineers, but it also needs more healthcare workers, caregivers and teachers. It also needs more wind turbine technicians. There are many important roles to fill and we need to help individuals step into those roles so they can participate in the exciting AI future that we are building. At a time when AI is disrupting many jobs and industries, governments have an important role to play in helping individuals succeed, contribute to and reap the rewards of this AI-powered economy.

If governments, universities and corporations work together to encourage education and innovation, then all nations and all people have an almost unlimited opportunity to be part of this new AI economy

Do governments need to regulate AI?
Thoughtful regulation will be important. For AI to reach its full potential, governments should be thoughtful about protecting citizens, while also creating room for the positive innovation that AI can bring. Take for example, the US start-up, Zipline that uses drones – computer controlled airplanes – to deliver blood. One of the main reasons why Zipline launched its drone service in Rwanda was because of the regulatory clarity that exists in Rwanda. What we are seeing over time is that governments with more thoughtful policies that allow AI-innovations into their economies will create value for their citizens more rapidly and thereby help grow their economies.

About WIPO Technology Trends 2019 – Artificial Intelligence
The WIPO Technology Trends report provides a common information base on AI for policy and decision makers in government, business and others, who are grappling with the ramifications of a new technology that promises to transform many areas of economic, social and cultural activity.
Among the report’s findings:

Since the emergence of AI in the 1950s up to the end of 2016, innovators and researchers filed applications for nearly 340,000 AI-related inventions and published over 1.6 million scientific publications.
AI-related patenting is growing rapidly, with more than half of the identified inventions published since 2013.
Companies represent 26 out of the top 30 AI patent applicants. Universities and public research organizations account for the remaining four.
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), (USA), had the largest portfolio of AI patent applications at the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft Corp., (USA), Toshiba Corp., (Japan), the Samsung Group (Republic of Korea) and NEC Group (Japan).
Chinese Organizations account for three of the four academic players featuring in the top 30 patent applicants, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences ranked 17.
Machine learning is the dominant AI technique disclosed in patents, included in more than one-third of all identified inventions.
Deep learning, a machine-learning technique that includes speech recognition systems, is the fastest growing AI technique.
Computer vision, which includes image recognition, is the most popular AI application, mentioned in 49 percent of all AI-related patents.
The transportation sector, including autonomous vehicles, is among the fields with the fastest rates of AI-related growth.
Significant growth rates were also registered in telecommunications, life and medical sciences (esp. robotic surgery and drug personalization) and personal devices, computing and human-computer interaction.


What role can educators play?
We need to build a society of life-long learners where we constantly update our skills and knowledge. The availability of online digital learning tools and content, such as those offered by Coursera, can now let many more people gain knowledge much more inexpensively than was possible with traditional analogue-based models of instruction. At Coursera, 45 percent of learners come from developing economies. Many organizations are working hard to ensure they can deliver digital content to learners around the world.
In addition to pure online digital models of education, blended learning models show great promise. With blended learning, some content is delivered on line with classroom time reserved for students to participate in much richer discussions with professors or their peers. If you let a computer do what it does best – record and deliver multiple types of content – it is possible to free up instructors’ time to deliver education in a way that is much more inexpensive and scalable than traditional methods of instruction. I hope education institutions worldwide will embrace ideas like blended learning and the flipped classroom because the world needs us to deliver high-quality education to many more people.
And the corporate sector?
For many years, developing countries have been asked to climb a predictable ladder (e.g. starting with textiles, moving up to low-end manufacturing and then to high-end manufacturing and eventually manufacturing high-end electronics). One of the problems with AI is that we may be automating away the lower rungs of this ladder. But developing economies still need a way to climb the ladder so they can educate their citizens and enable them to move to higher value jobs and grow their economies. With corporations, governments and universities working together I hope we can replace the ladder with a trampoline and give people the education they need to take advantage of the opportunities that AI offers.
What advice do you have for policymakers in developing countries?
Don’t re-invent the wheel. For example, I would not recommend that a small country builds the next great search engine. We already have multiple great search engines. Most of the inventions and most of the value to be created through AI have not yet been realized. There is still a huge opportunity for everyone, including developing economies, to own a piece of the AI pie. My advice to government leaders of developing nations is to focus on their strengths. For example, if you have a strong mining industry, build AI solutions for mining, because your country will have huge advantages in finding AI solutions to mining compared to a Silicon Valley company. Or if your country is a large coffee exporter, work on AI technologies to optimize how you farm, process and export coffee beans. Again, you have huge advantages in doing that for your local economy. Markets are increasingly global and with AI and an Internet connection, I think it is possible for almost everyone to improve their core industries and provide better products to the world.
Is leadership important?
In moments of technological disruption, leadership matters. Here in the United States we once trusted our government to put a man on the moon. And we did it. The AI world is immature, even the leading cities for AI – Silicon Valley (USA) and Beijing (People’s Republic of China) – do not have mature AI ecosystems because the field is just too new. So if governments, universities and corporations work together to encourage education and innovation, all nations and all people have an opportunity to be part of this new AI economy.

Artificial Intelligence Explained: What Are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?

The principle behind the GAN was first proposed in 2014, and at its most basic level, it describes a system that pits two AI systems (neural networks) against each other to improve the quality of their results.
To understand how they work, imagine a blind forger trying to create copies of paintings by great masters. To start with, he has no idea what a painting should look like – but he happens to have a friend who has a photographic memory of every masterpiece that's ever been painted.
PROMOTED
This friend – a detective – has to determine whether the paintings his friend is showing match the features of those created by the real great masters, or are obvious forgeries.
This is the basic idea of how a GAN operates – only as they are AIs, both the forger and his friend are able to act at super-speed, making and detecting thousands of forgeries per second. Both of them then ""learn"" from the outcome to improve their future performance. As the detective becomes better at detecting forgeries, the forger must become better at creating them.
GANs have been the cause of a lot of excitement within the field of AI development in recent years, due to their ability to create “new” information following rules established by existing information. An example might be writing instruction manuals. By training a GAN on thousands of instruction manuals, it could one day be possible to create a system that could look at any tool, device or software and then create instructions on how to use it.
So, let’s look into how this works in a bit more depth. The “forger” network that creates fake data is termed the generative network, and its job is to read and understand the properties of the training data. It then attempts to replicate it by producing “candidate” datasets that follow the same rules.

The “detective” network tasked with determining whether the generative network is outputting false (artificially generated) data or real (training) data is known as the discriminative network. Because it competes against the generative network, the system as a whole is described as ""adversarial.""
For a great working example of a GAN in action, look no further than the popular demonstration This Person Does Not Exist. The network powering the website has learned to produce ultra-realistic images of human faces that, while they follow all of the rules regarding the way a human face should look, do not exist outside of the computer program.
While you might at first assume that the program builds images of faces by putting together pieces from a database of eyes, ears, mouths, and hair, this isn't the case. The ""input"" data for the generative network is simply a string of numbers – only the discriminative network sees the training data. The generative network improves its output based entirely on the output of the discriminative network.
As the only feedback the discriminative network gives is yes/no “guesses” at whether the generative output matches the training data, it takes many, many attempts before it starts to produce output that is acceptably close to the desired outputs – in this case, a realistic-looking image of a non-existent person.
(This example actually uses an updated model of the GAN known as proGAN which was developed by Nvidia last year, and works by gradually increasing the resolution of the image that the network generates, starting with a very low-resolution 4 pixel by 4 pixel image.)
The data used for training an adversarial network does not have to be labeled, as the discriminative network can make judgments on the output of the generative network based entirely on features of the training data itself. This means GANs have applications in unsupervised learning as well as supervised (where the data is labeled) and reinforcement learning.
Another useful feature of GANs is that they can be used to efficiently create training datasets for other AI applications. Most current AI techniques, in particular, Deep Learning, rely on access to large amounts of data for training purposes.
GANs can generate datasets that follow all of the rules of ""natural"" datasets and so, in theory, can be used for training of deep learning models. A great example of where this would be useful might be medical images, that can be expensive and time-consuming to collect for real – requiring both patient consent and medical expertise to label them.
GANs can be used for creating images, moving video images, text, and even music. While it's clear that there is a lot of hype surrounding the concept at the moment, it is clearly one of the most interesting new concepts to appear from the AI field in recent years, and we can expect to see many exciting new applications based on it in the near future.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence tool helps find brain aneurysms


			Stanford researchers have designed a new AI tool to help clinicians identify brain aneurysms. HeadXNet is designed to work with, not replace, radiologists.

A future where artificial intelligence is part of medical care may not look all that different. That's one lesson we can take away from a new AI tool, made by Stanford University researchers in computer science and medicine, which is designed to help clinicians identify brain aneurysms. 
The work appears in JAMA Network Open.
Built around an algorithm called HeadXNet, the tool looks through head scans -- made using computed tomography angiography -- and for every voxel, the 3D version of a pixel, decides whether or not there is a sign of an aneurysm. 
At the end of this process, a semi-transparent red overlay shows up on the scans everywhere that HeadXNet predicts there is an aneurysm. This visualization is purposefully subtle; a way to encourage clinicians who use HeadXNet to give those areas a closer look.
""Search for an aneurysm is one of the most labor-intensive and critical tasks radiologists undertake,"" said Kristen Yeom, MD, associate professor of radiology and co-senior author of the paper, in a Stanford press release. ""Given inherent challenges of complex neurovascular anatomy and potential fatal outcome of a missed aneurysm, it prompted me to apply advances in computer science and vision to neuroimaging.""
In order to see their tool in a realistic work flow, the researchers put a lot of time and effort into integrating it within scan viewers, which radiologists currently use. Eight clinicians tested it by evaluating a set of 115 brain scans for aneurysm, once with the help of HeadXNet and once without. The tool improved clinicians' ability to correctly identify aneurysms at a level equivalent to finding six more aneurysms in 100 scans that contain aneurysms. It also improved agreement between the clinicians.
There are many directions the researchers could take their work from here. Yeom has suggested the possibility of altering the algorithm to identify aneurysms that have burst, a dangerous condition. The researchers are also planning to establish a multi-center collaboration to make AI health care technologies, like HeadXNet, easier to use across different hospitals, which tend to have different hardware, patient populations and imaging protocols.
Given the challenges of making AI work in all these different situations -- and the vital importance of accurate diagnoses -- these researchers think that collaboration between AI health care technologies and clinicians is a particularly promising path forward.
""There's been a lot of concern about how machine learning will actually work within the medical field,"" said Allison Park, a Stanford graduate student in statistics and co-lead author of the paper. ""This research is an example of how humans stay involved in the diagnostic process, aided by an artificial intelligence tool.""

More and more organizations are beginning to use or expand their use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and services in the workplace. Despite AI’s proven potential for enhancing efficiency and decision-making, it has raised a host of issues in the workplace which, in turn, have prompted an array of federal and state regulatory efforts that are likely to increase in the near future.
Artificial intelligence, defined very simply, involves machines performing tasks in a way that is intelligent. The AI field involves a number of subfields or forms of AI that solve complex problems associated with human intelligence—for example, machine learning (computers using data to make predictions), natural-language processing (computers processing and understanding a natural human language like English), and computer vision or image recognition (computers processing, identifying, and categorizing images based on their content).
One area where AI is becoming increasingly prevalent is in talent acquisition and recruiting. Many organizations have adopted machine learning-based software to auto-screen or facilitate the screening of job candidates. Additionally, AI tools are powering many of the increasingly common employee self-service tools that allow for quicker, more efficient answers to common employee relations questions.
The benefits of AI include improved efficiency, lower costs of products and services, improved quality, and fewer errors. But AI is not perfect. Indeed, government and media attention has centered on the potential for AI-driven tools to be biased or discriminatory. For example, during the Obama administration, the Executive Office of the President of the United States issued a detailed report on algorithmic systems, AI opportunity, and potential civil rights issues that highlighted the potential for positive impact from AI while underscoring issues about “the potential of encoding discrimination in automated decisions.” Similarly, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also been concerned about these issues and has emphasized assessing how employment discrimination protections apply and can be used in the context of AI-powered systems.
Initial City, State, and Federal AI Regulations Rolled Out
Despite this media and governmental attention, the pace of legislation has over the last decade been slow. There are signs, however, that this may be changing. A number of city, state, and federal regulations have been proposed or enacted with a goal of eliminating potential discrimination and increasing transparency related to AI. For example:
Facial Recognition Software Ban. Technology-friendly San Francisco passed a ban in mid-May 2019 on the use of facial recognition software by police and other government agencies. The ban, which does not apply to the use of facial recognition software by private entities, makes San Francisco the first major city to legislatively ban the use of this technology. Similar bans are under consideration in other jurisdictions (such as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts).
AI in Hiring in Illinois. One popular use of AI in the hiring process is through AI “interview bots,” which evaluate personal characteristics such as an applicant’s facial expression, body language, word choice, and tone of voice. The software then provides employers with feedback that can be used to evaluate whether to hire a candidate. On May 29, 2019, the Illinois General Assembly passed a first-of-its-kind measure that would impose restrictions on employers’ use of this kind of artificial intelligence in hiring. It is expected to be signed shortly by Illinois’s governor as the bill passed without a single “no” vote. The law, known as the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, is a disclosure and informed consent rule that would require employers to take the following steps before asking applicants to submit to video interviews:

notify applicants for Illinois-based positions of plans to have their video interviews analyzed electronically;
explain to the applicants how the artificial intelligence analysis technology works and what characteristics will be used to evaluate them; and
obtain the applicants’ consent to the use of the technology.

Notably, Illinois has become something of an incubator for workplace technology legislation. It was the first state to pass legislation regulating employers’ use of employee biometric information (e.g., retinal scans, facial recognition software, and fingerprint information).
Federal Algorithmic Accountability Act. On April 10, 2019, congressional Democrats introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, which seeks to enhance federal oversight of artificial intelligence and data privacy. (In some respects, the proposed law is similar to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.) If passed, the Algorithmic Accountability Act would regulate AI systems as well as any “automated decision system” that makes a decision or facilitates human decision-making that impacts consumers. For processes that fit the proposed statute’s definition, organizations would be required to audit for bias and discrimination and take appropriate corrective action to resolve any identified issues. The bill would give oversight responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission.
The Algorithmic Accountability Act has limited likelihood of successfully passing Congress. However, it could be a harbinger of things to come. This kind of legislation may gain momentum on a federal level depending on how the 2020 elections play out. And, regardless, proposed federal legislation often catches the attention of legislators in one or more states and spurs similar proposals at the state level. Indeed, California, for example, has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, a sweeping data privacy law that becomes effective January 1, 2020, and whose scope and application to workplaces remains unclear.

For nearly four thousand years, the horse was as integral to warfighting as weapons and armor. Then the Second Industrial Revolution led to developments in motorized vehicles and aircraft. These new technologies’ experimental use during World War I hinted at a new style of war. What those hints portended was the subject of intense debate in the years that followed. Some recognized that motorized vehicles would dramatically change the way wars were fought. But many others held on to the deep-seated, millennia-old preference for beasts of burden on the battlefield. Only World War II would eliminate any remaining such preference. And with the horses’ disappearance from their old roles, the military services also divested all associated equine training, breeding, and care in exchange for drivers, welders, and mechanics.
We are again in a period of disruptive technological progress—the Fourth Industrial Revolution—and this current era of persistent low-intensity conflict is arguably an interwar period not unlike that of the 1920s and 1930s. Experts are again intensely debating how new technology—in the form of automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence—will change the character of war. Killer robots, loss of control, and abdication of human responsibility in killing another human are all profound issues for us to confront. However, while national security experts often focus on the sexy applications of these technologies (and public attention is most easily earned by apocalyptic characterizations), too little attention is paid to the more obvious and less complicated issue: those same technologies are also reshaping the workforce. In historical terms, this is akin to debating the merits of using vehicles as mobile firing positions on the battlefield while overlooking the way motorized transport would, for example, dramatically transform logistics.
Even if militaries shun killer robots, nonlethal automated and autonomous systems will still play significant roles in warfare—and will do so very soon. In 1980, then Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert H. Barrow said, “Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics.” And people are the resource with the longest lead time. These new technologies will have equally profound impacts on the military labor force as on direct combat and we need to adapt to this new reality. Automation will require reducing certain specialties, re-skilling many service members, and creating entirely new job families. Moreover, the trends will have second-order impacts on who we recruit and how we train while increasing dependencies on data and communications.
Automation is already displacing workers in the global workforce and the body of literature expects this to get more intense over the next ten years. Creating autonomous weapons is both far more difficult and much more contentious than either automating low-skilled jobs or creating narrow artificial intelligence for specific, complex tasks. Unsurprisingly, trends within the civilian workforce show that the tasks that are easiest to automate are highly repetitive, are often manual, and require a low degree of judgment. Conversely, the skills that are most difficult to automate involve applying expertise, interacting with human stakeholders in complex situations, and creativity. One important caveat is that low-skilled jobs performed in unpredictable environments—gardening, plumbing, childcare—will generally see less automation, but many of these roles have low wages already. This is important as it reflects the second-order fear that automation will hollow out the middle class and lead to less socioeconomic mobility, which has implications for the military.
As automation displaces humans in some areas, workers will need to shift into new fields where difficult-to-automate human skills are of critical importance. Experts predict a growing need for particular categories of workers: caregivers, coaches, subject-matter experts, technicians (e.g., software, data, cloud), and educators. Viewed broadly, these industries fall into two categories: improving human performance and improving technological performance and integration. The increased specialization between humans and computers will lead to efficiency gains—the so-called Third Offset—but other impacts such as the need to re-skill workers are less obvious and receive less consideration in the national security community.
It is perhaps predictable that military leaders are focusing on killer robots and missing the big picture. The last eighteen years of war, conducted on a rotational model that constantly cycles units in and out of combat zones, seem to have only reinforced an emphasis on a near horizon line and undercut interest in the specific types of critical thinking, imagination, or modernization needed to conceptualize, as an organization, the full range of new technologies’ applications. Moreover, there are dynamics related to the nature of bureaucracies at play. Digital automation requires digital information and the military has struggled to adapt modern best practices that would enable much of this transformation—from software systems that do not connect with each other to the use of paper or other manual processes. It is no surprise that there are significant barriers to overcome before an institution that struggles to have a user-friendly system for processing official travel can field a lethal autonomous robot.
Regardless of why scholars and senior leaders have so far missed the low-hanging fruit, it is time to begin addressing it. Recruiting and training people for the military occupations of the future will take years and the services can begin reaping the benefits of automation if they start investing now.
Embracing Automation, Re-Skilling Soldiers, and Creating the Jobs of the Future
Again, across the economy, automation and AI will have the soonest impact on roles that fall into three categories: those that are predictable and primarily physical; those related to data collection; and those that involve data processing. Many of the specific fields—food preparation and serving, transportation, construction, and office and administrative support roles, for instance—have direct counterparts in the military. The services should immediately begin phasing out or automating as much of these roles as possible. It’s not sexy, but long before we can create autonomous Terminator-like warbots, we will need autonomous systems that can perform nonlethal manual tasks and use natural language processing to manage personnel paperwork. Increasing automation in these roles will both change how the human workers perform their duties and liberate soldiers who can be re-skilled into new areas.
So where would soldiers displaced by automation be used? In jobs that will see an increased demand. The Army is currently undertaking an effort to improve lethality, especially in its close-combat forces. But it should avoid the temptation to treat this as a technological or hardware challenge, when it is fundamentally about people. Improving the way the Army conducts physical fitness training and the way it measures fitness—inarguably central to soldier effectiveness (and lethality)—is a case in point. Much of the debate around the Army’s new physical fitness test focuses on the cost of the equipment and the difficulty of the events. Improving lethality requires shifting soldiers out of roles that are better suited for machines and into health, conditioning, human performance, and counselor or therapist roles.
Special operations units have dedicated athletic trainers and physical therapists, but we will need both far more to support direct combat units and a wider array of specialists including coaches, counselors, and educators. The services, to varying degrees, already have versions of these roles and they need to re-invest the savings from automation into them to gain further performance improvements.
Lastly, the services need to accept that these trends are not going away and should embrace the new technology rather than keep it at arm’s length—and begin thinking about the workforce they need to succeed in the future operating environment. They shouldn’t worry about purple-haired techies; they should start creating software soldiers and other tech warriors. Here are two steps that they can take now.

Tactical unmanned vehicle operators: Before we deploy lethal autonomous swarm drones, the services will need to embrace drones. The Army has added small unmanned aerial vehicles to the equipment for many units, but lags in updating the tactical doctrine for their use. To date, only the Marine Corps has announced plans to place drone operator specialists in every infantry rifle squad. It is unclear if this will simply be an infantryman with additional training (and possibly a skill code) or an entirely new military occupational specialty and there are precedents for both cases. Looking further to the future, the careers developed for these specialists can also help to shape careers and training of swarm drone operators and other unique roles for autonomous ground and undersea vehicles.
More technical experts: The Air Force launched a pilot program in 2017 to create a software development team within the service. Named Kessel Run, the program has been a runaway success and more than validated the concept. The other services should immediately begin similar pilots, but expand them to also include other skills in data science and cloud computing architecture. The combination of skills will create teams that can rapidly build, test, and deploy scalable IT systems that will empower warfighters and accelerate other innovation projects. Having these technologists within the force may lead to applications that are even more imaginative than what is currently conceived. The services can also reap the lessons learned from talent management within the cyber force to avoid early attrition and further improve talent management for technical experts.

Broader Impacts of Automation
While ethicists and policymakers are debating the impact of autonomy on warfighting, it appears as though relatively little thought has been given to the impact of automation on warfighters. What happens when automation leads to greater specialization between humans and computers?
Experts expect automation to displace more men than women in the civilian workforce as men disproportionately fill roles most ready for automation. By contrast, women disproportionately fill roles in the civilian workforce that are difficult to automate and will see increased demand—jobs that demand critical thinking and emotional intelligence. Similarly in the military, technological shifts could create greater opportunities for women to leverage the skills that are most valuable in the types of jobs that will increase in demand.
Additionally, and while it’s likely wishful thinking, the confluence of greater demands for technical skills and increased emphasis on human performance may someday shift basic training from its historical function of weeding out weak recruits to instead focus on developing their unique talents (which will improve satisfaction and retention and drive down recruiting churn—a virtuous cycle).
Depending on how the services classify these new technical and human performance specialties, automation may widen the rift between enlisted and officer ranks and may decrease the role of military service as a mechanism for social mobility. Some experts argue that automation is leaving fewer middle-skill roles in the civilian workforce, and it is critical that the military works to avoid this fate. Failure to do so will raise important concerns of about “who serves” and have a consequent impact on civil-military relations.
Lastly, military recruitment may get a bump thanks to increased AI, but that’s not necessarily a good thing. The military is struggling both to recruit tech talent and to meet its recruitment goals for a workforce that has not yet been disrupted by automation. While AI will make recruiters more effective, automation will also displace civilian workers in historically strong recruiting areas—the heartland and rural areas. The services will have incentives to accept these recruits rather than make the changes to recruiting that are needed to attract the workforce of tomorrow. Service leaders will need to clearly define (and closely measure) the attributes sought in recruits when balancing efforts to find and attract the best talent with adapting the workforce for tomorrow.
Start Now
When it comes to preparing for AI-empowered warfare, senior defense leaders and intellectuals seem to be missing the forest for the trees. Current paradigms of future war tend to either reflect incremental innovation (artillery that shoots farther) or the sort of science fiction that is always thirty to forty years away. The middle ground is a defense enterprise that sees the changing nature of warfare rooted in information technology hardware and software, and it is long past time to start doing the hard work of truly modernizing the services. To prepare for this future of war, all of the services will need to transform their workforces in ways that, put simply, they are not even discussing.

Augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and smart glasses: ‘VIEW’ technology for the 2019 holiday season 

By Seth Patin, founder and CEO, LogistiVIEW
Warehouse workers can be faster, safer, and more accurate this holiday season. 
LogistiVIEW’s “Visual Input Enabled Wearable” (VIEW) technology improves workforce productivity and job satisfaction by making processes hands free and eyes focused.
Intuitive voice and visual instructions make work easy and training rapid. These benefits can all be accomplished in time for the 2019 holiday season thanks to LogistiVIEW’s Connected Worker Platform. 
Built on VIEW technology, it combines Computer Vision, Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and smart glasses so a warehouse management system (WMS) can see and use what it sees to collect data and instruct the workforce.
VIEW devices – smart glasses in supply chain
WMS solutions are good at managing information, but not truly intuitive for the floor worker. This is primarily because lines of text are not the best way to tell someone how to do work; humans respond best to visual instructions.
For that reason, most companies discuss on-boarding and training in terms of days, or worse yet, weeks.
VIEW technology rethinks workforce instruction by creating a system that increases productivity and job satisfaction. It starts with rethinking workforce mobile technology with the VIEW device.
A VIEW device is a small-scale head-mounted computer with a high definition camera, field of sight display, audio input and output, positional awareness sensors, and wireless networking.
When properly integrated with a WMS, VIEW devices revolutionize warehouse operations by bringing a completely hands-free and AR directed worker experience. Today these types of devices are commonly called smart glasses.

Operational impact of VIEW devices
VIEW technology works with a WMS to help it “know” what tasks a worker is supposed to perform as well as where a worker is located, what product the worker is holding, what product the worker is near, what physical obstacles surround the worker, and what other workers are in the vicinity.
Leveraging AR, VIEW technology directs workers via voice instructions and visual cues by overlaying information into the worker’s field of vision. The system knows where a worker needs to go and directs the worker via overlaid arrows and highlighting.
Once at the destination, workers execute workflows in the WMS by simply looking at the product as directed by the VIEW device or scanning the barcodes with a wearable Bluetooth scanner.
Inexperienced warehouse workers hired for the 2019 holiday season are able to pick a high-value serialized item by simply looking at the storage location barcode and scanning the product to be picked.
The system isolates all the scanned barcodes, catalogs meaning via AI filtering, and processes a pick transaction with the correct part number, serial number, and storage location without the user taking hands or eyes off the product.
Hands-free workflow improves efficiency while eyes-focused workflow and AI-validated data capture, reduce the likelihood of critical errors.
Optimizing workflows and providing superior track and trace capabilities supports Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma initiatives, and industry best-practices.
VIEW devices bring a new level of workforce accountability, which is of paramount importance for 2019 holiday picking, packing, and shipping. Operations management has an unprecedented level of information about workers’ activities.
Warehouse shift managers assist new, low-skilled labor by shadowing a worker remotely in real-time and reviewing the workers’ movements through the facility during the work shift.
Efficiency gains are quantifiable
When a worker is confused about inventory at a location, rather than a supervisor walking across the entire warehouse, the supervisor simply shadows the user and talks to them through the questions using VIEW devices.
Warehouse managers can walk the floor and simply look at a QR code on the side of a row of pick bins to get a real-time report of productivity in that pick face for the shift.
Workforce management solutions are supercharged by the information obtained with VIEW devices driving quantifiable efficiency gains.
Just in time for the 2019 holiday season
Rapidly implemented in as little as 60 days, these technologies can still generate optimal holiday profitability this year.
From 3PLs to warehouses and distribution centers, the urgent need for this workforce technology is undeniable.
The ability to simplify complex processes in a way that improves both productivity and job satisfaction means low-skilled warehouse labor can be faster, safer, and more accurate in fulfilling orders this holiday season.

On the Naukri portal, they have over 60 million resumes, half a million recruiters and any given day, over 13-14 lakh applicants for jobs.In 1997, before Google came into being, an Indian internet company called Info Edge launched Naukri.com, which remained a hugely popular jobs portal for over a decade. However, the time has come now to upgrade itself for the next internet era and to take on the likes of LinkedIn, which have become successful in their own right.In an interview with Business Insider, Info Edge CEO Hitesh Oberoi spoke about how Naukri.com will evolve from being just a jobs portal to a careers platform and how they are working on the current big trend with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data. Building on the new trendToday, it’s the new trend that’s taking over the world by storm – technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data. And this one Naukri doesn’t want to pass out on. “The truth is every time you figure out these trends, they take your business to the new level. We are trying to invest substantially into these areas,” said Oberoi.Naukri’s clients – the recruiters have long had the problem of spam. For one job listing, there are thousands of applicants. And here’s where AI, ML and data science will take over. “We are sitting on tons of data. So much can be done, from matching applicants to jobs, user experience, giving them advice/suggestions, identifying hot skills – everything can be determined with AI and ML. We can transform Naukri from being a jobs portal to a careers platform,” said Oberoi.The Naukri portal has over 60 million resumes, half a million recruiters. On any given day, they have over 1.3-1.4 million jobs applicants use the site, according to the company. #ThrowbackThe company that went public within 9 years of its formation, has survived all the big waves the internet industry has seen – Search, social networking and mobile. The internet as we know today has exploded over the past 20 years and has given birth to several different giant entities like the social media. But Info Edge came about when nobody understood what the internet was but the founders knew – jobs were the key. Over the years, Oberoi says there have been multiple waves that have hit the industry and each one brings with it a challenge as well as an opportunity.Discovering Search “When we there was no Google. In 2002, we launched a database product (which today is over 65% of our revenue) but didn’t exist when we got funded. We were trailing our competitors with respect to the number of CVs on our platform. Advertising in the newspaper wasn’t working for us,” said Oberoi. It was then that Google became big and suddenly a lot of traffic was out there. “We started search engine marketing in 2003. We were advertising on millions of keywords on Google, there was nobody else back then and it was a bidding model. We put all our resources on Google,” he said. And within two months, they were getting an extra 400 CVs a day. “That’s how we capitalized on the search wave,” he said. The networking eraThe next wave that hit them was the social media wave. LinkedIn, which was founded in 2002, jumped on the networking train and became a social media giant of its own. However, Naukri failed to work around it. “We were unable to figure out how to use it to our benefit. LinkedIn got there first. What you need to understand is that the trick lies in figuring it out before the others do,” said Oberoi. Going mobileOberoi lists the next wave of internet revolution to be the mobile generation and this one he said they figured out fast and right. “We realised what works on the desktop doesn’t work on the mobile. Today, 80% of Naukri traffic comes from mobile and when it comes to Jeevan Saathi, it’s 90%,” he said.Other investmentsInfo Edge also has other successful portals JeevanSathi.com (a matrimonials site), a real estate listings platform called 99acres.com, and education platform Shiksha.com. Over the years, they have been investing money into companies that can add on to their in-house businesses. Naukri had acquired consultancy firm Toostep in 2012, hiring startup Ambition Box two years ago, and in May 2019, it acquired rival iimjobs.com. And they have a plan through all of it. They want to use data to give insights to job seekers on how they can improve their prospects, to produce new products – an insight platforms for recruiters, to going beyond sourcing and building a holistic platform which includes shortlisting of candidates, scheduling interviews and more. They already have a product – Naukri Recruitment Management System.“Increasingly, all our investments are in the AI, ML space,” said Oberoi.See Also:Automation will affect women the most in the Indian job market: Report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
