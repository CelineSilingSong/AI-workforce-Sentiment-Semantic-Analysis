It warns that “use of algorithmic surveillance, management and monitoring technologies that undertake new advisory functions, as well as traditional ones, has significantly increased during the pandemic”.Under the act workers would be given the right to be involved in the design and use of algorithm-driven systems, where computers make and execute decisions about fundamental aspects of someone’s work – including in some cases allocation of shifts and pay, or whether they get a job in the first place.The report also recommended that corporations and public sector employers fill out algorithmic impact assessments, aimed at ironing out any problems caused by the systems, and expanding the new umbrella body for digital regulation, the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, to introduce certification and guidance for use of AI and algorithms at work.The MPs added that the use of AI and algorithms produced a sense of unfairness and lack of independence among workers, who also aren’t aware of the role of personal information in guiding decisions about how they go about their jobs. Regulation of social media and video platforms will also be included in the online safety bill, which will become law towards the end of next year.David Davis MP, the Conservative chair of the APPG on the future of work, said: “Our inquiry reveals how AI technologies have spread beyond the gig economy to control what, who and how work is done. It is clear that, if not properly regulated, algorithmic systems can have harmful effects on health and prosperity.”Clive Lewis, a Labour member of the APPG, added: “Our report shows why and how government must bring forward robust proposals for AI regulation. There are marked gaps in regulation at an individual and corporate level that are damaging people and communities right across the country.”The APPG inquiry was established after the publication of a report into the role of AI and algorithms in modern work in May this year by the Institute for the Future of Work, a research body, entitled the Amazonian Era. The report focused on retail workers and included testimony from delivery drivers and checkout workers who complained of monitoring systems and target-setting that produced high levels of anxiety.“A lot of professional drivers will sometimes jump a red light or brake too hard because they are under time constraints and often they have to use their mobile while driving,” one supermarket delivery driver said in the report. The IFoW study also included testimony from manufacturing workers who had to log 95% of their activity on shifts, so their working day could be planned more intensively.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Employment lawSurveillanceGig economyMental healthWork & careersnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policyJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden hasn’t done enough to ease age concerns, former top Obama adviser says – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is AI really ready to solve the problems that have had art historians stumped?

Did Rubens really paint the National Gallery’s Samson and Delilah?

The attribution of the National Gallery’s Samson and Delilah (c. 1609–10) to Peter Paul Rubens has long been debated. When the painting resurfaced on the market in 1929, it was offered as a work by the Dutch Caravaggist Gerrit van Honthorst; the scholar Ludwig Burchard immediately declared it as a Rubens but questions have remained over the style and provenance of the work. Earlier this autumn, several media outlets reported that a Swiss company using artificial intelligence (AI) to assess the authenticity of artworks had calculated a 91.78 per cent probability that Samson and Delilah was not painted by Rubens. The same company also wrote a report on another painting in the National Gallery – A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning (c. 1636) – which stated a 98.76per cent probability that Rubens painted the work. (To our knowledge, the attribution of this painting has not been questioned.) This news, with its highly confident claims and oddly precise probabilities, surprised us as researchers who have been deeply involved in problems around art attribution for many years, specialising in developing AI technology and scientific methods for these questions. While the call for a deattribution of a significant painting at a major museum is ripe for publicity, without an in-depth publication of the AI methods employed in the peer-reviewed literature, it is difficult to take these particular conclusions at face value.
Is AI ready to tell us whether or not Samson and Delilah was painted by Rubens? To address this question, an AI researcher would first create ‘training sets’ that contain many examples of paintings by Rubens in one set, and many examples of works by other artists who might be confused with Rubens in another set. Through well-established algorithms that ‘teach’ the AI to accept paintings similar to the first set and reject paintings in the second set, the AI will learn to differentiate Rubens’s paintings from the others with (ideally) sufficient accuracy to answer attribution questions. However, this process has a number of pitfalls that must be properly understood if they are to be avoided.
One of the problems in identifying the work of Rubens and other Old Masters is their workshop practice. As a successful and sought-after painter, Rubens ran a large workshop where multiple assistants would sometimes work on a single painting. The challenge of definitively attributing such a painting based on an overall AI analysis nonetheless provides a wonderful opportunity to explore an interesting question: how can we identify the ‘hand of the master’ in contrast to the workshop assistants? Usefully, both the hands of the master and of the assistants are in the same painting, so there are none of the differences between paintings that would otherwise be additional factors to complicate the analysis.
Many available pre-built AI methods designed for image recognition are built to analyse and categorise images as similarly to a human observer as possible. Common examples include software for facial recognition or image classification (to identify a cat versus a dog, for example). When an artwork has been misattributed – or worse, created to deceive – the images and features are of course similar to that of an authentic painting. An AI designed merely to mimic human judgement and (mis)interpretation will fall prey to the same mistakes that a forger relies upon. The AI will replicate the viewpoint of the connoisseur, but may not improve upon it. But forgers have created paintings to deceive human eyes and human judgement when viewed in visible light. Under different illumination such as infrared or ultraviolet light, or by using pigment identification, the forgery may become readily apparent. So we must further develop AI methods that focus on more subtle aspects of the work – for example, by characterising individual brush strokes.
Other issues can arise when AI methods key in on irrelevant details that would be promptly disregarded by an art historian. Images provided by museums have been captured with various equipment cameras and scanners. AI can easily detect the irrelevant features introduced from the equipment, such as image compression or lens distortion,  and use them as ‘shortcuts’ instead of discriminating based upon the relevant features, which are more difficult to analyse, such as the brush strokes of the artist. An inappropriate AI method can reject the attribution of a work simply because its image was captured by a particular device or compressed using a particular technique. Two recent examples from the medical imaging field showed that deep learning models in pneumonia and Covid-19 could learn shortcuts based on spurious text on the hospital X-rays or other imaging artefacts instead of the medically relevant factors in the image. For these reasons, the AI must be trained on a set of images that have been collected in consistent and well-documented conditions.
By analysing a work stylistically, AI can complement traditional connoisseurship in an automated fashion and at scale. Nevertheless, machine learning methods should not supplant or hide the problems that bedevil connoisseurship behind an apparently uncontestable result from an AI. Recognising the current early development phase of AI, any conclusions must be drawn with an understanding of the limitations of the training set, and be contextualised and subjected to a ‘reality check’ by incorporating multiple approaches. Such a multi-pronged approach will add to the interpretative power of this tool and teach us more about the artists’ working methods and ultimately attribution. As Jennifer Mass, founder of Scientific Analysis of Fine Art (SAFA), notes, ‘the most robust attribution approach is always one in which a painting is examined with a range of methodologies using experts across multiple disciplines. The approach of a single person or analysis tool acting as a sole arbiter of attribution is outdated.’ We believe AI has great potential for questions of attribution, but only if it is done with sound methods. The AI method must be transparently validated and scientifically peer-reviewed so that collectors and researchers can understand both its capacity and limitations.

Here at Mind Matters, we have often covered the way that humans are used to supplement Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence has generally been misunderstood as replacing human effort in society, while, in reality, it is usually leveraging it, instead. Whether using humans to find good training data, mining content for intentionality, or even using humans directly within machine learning algorithms, today’s most prominent “AI” systems are actually strange hybrids of humans and computers. As a matter of fact, the market for human supplementation of AI is so large that Amazon has an entire service built around it.
While much of this work is done either for free (oftentimes through games on the Internet) or through traditional paid office work, a growing amount is being done through “microtasks,” through systems such as CloudFlower and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. These services take tiny jobs that require a human touch (i.e., “what keywords best describe this image”) and pay people small amounts per job to perform the task. Because this is behind the scenes, and oftentimes people don’t even know there is a human there, it is often termed “ghost work.” But who are the workers behind this new class of vocation?
The book Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass attempts to provide a sociological profile for this new kind of work and worker. This book looks into the lives and work of the people on these platforms, what they do on a daily basis, why they do it, and the problems they face. On the whole, the book does a good job of helping people understand this new class of work and why and how it is done, but seems to have some fundamental misunderstandings about choices, tradeoffs, and economics, which make them often misunderstand their own subjects and present “solutions” that would probably be more problematic than the problems they look to solve.
On the good side, this book is the first real book to describe the role of humans in artificial intelligence. Most people assume that artificial intelligence means that humans are being replaced with computers, but this isn’t the case at all. In fact, the authors show that this is a long misunderstood part of technological development, which they call the “last mile paradox.” In nearly every automation from the industrial revolution to the present, there is always some amount of “finishing work” that needs to be done by hand. In the textile industry, this is known as “piece work,” where difficult-to-automate aspects of clothing continue to be done by hand even after the large-scale takeover of industrial machinery. It is called “piece work” because the people that this is outsourced to are paid by the “piece” instead of by the hour. 
In the modern day, computer automation requires what can be essentially described as “algorithmic piece work,” where things that are not adequately handled by algorithms can be doled out to people who work by the job instead of by the hour. Most technology users are wholly ignorant that this works even goes on, and assumes that there is automation, not humans, behind all of the tasks that get performed on computers. How do computers tell if an image is pornographic? How can they tell if a “trending hashtag” is a legitimate phenomenon or some kind of scam or hack? How can you tell if someone who cut their hair differently still matches their photo on file? These are all things that computers do not have the context or programming to handle, but still need to be done on algorithmic platforms. These often get farmed out to systems such as Mechanical Turk for a human to process. The book does a great job describing this process and the people behind it.
The book, however, also aims to correct what the authors perceive as injustices towards the workers. However, most of the time the injustices that the authors perceive are either (a) contradicted by the authors’ own reporting, (b) misunderstanding the choices that lay behind the perceived injustice, or (c) something that has nothing to do with the subject (i.e., “ghost work”), but is simply endemic to being underprivileged.
As an example, the authors seem to think that ghost workers should be given the protections of full-time employees, and indicate that it is problematic that they don’t have the same protections. However, why are there different protections for full-time workers than contractors? The authors note that because these workers are not in offices and can work their own hours they therefore aren’t qualified to consider themselves full-time workers. However, the entire reason for considering protections for employees is that, when you work on-site, your employer is responsible for the conditions of your workspace. That is, whatever safety measures are or aren’t there is entirely in the hands of the employer. Additionally, to the extent that an employer asserts their own authority over your life (requiring specific hours, requiring overtime, etc.) also makes them responsible for how they do so. In the case of ghost work, the employee is working from their own home and they can work at any time, day or night. Thus, the employer exhibits no influence whatsoever on the working conditions of the worker and asserts no authority over the worker’s life. Therefore, there is no moral reason why they should treat the worker as someone over which they have a large amount of responsibility.
Additionally, the authors complained about the tough competition for jobs while simultaneously complaining about how difficult it is to join the workforce, specifying the many hurdles people in underdeveloped countries face. However, making it easier to join actually exacerbates the problem of competition. The authors seem fully ignorant of this basic aspect of markets. 
The authors also seem to be unaware of the conditions required for the very existence of this type of employment. They spend a good amount of time critiquing the anti-fraud measures of the system, while completely ignoring the fact that the Internet is rampant with fraudsters trying to play such systems. If the systems can’t eliminate fraud, and don’t have the flexibility to do so economically, then this entire area of the economy disappears. Like most people today, the authors seem fully unaware that there are preconditions for the existence of certain types of work.
There is one criticism, however, that I found helpful: Companies need to have a better way to appeal automated decisions. This is true everywhere. Companies are looking to automate, which is great. But having a fallback, a way to address grievances (or even communication) by a human in the company that has authority to resolve or escalate issues, is extremely important. I think that whether technology becomes a tool of freedom or oppression may largely hinge on this one question, not just for ghost work, but across all aspects of the economy.
In all, Ghost Work does a good job of helping people understand how the underbelly of our technological systems work as well as the people making it happen. However, its prescriptions for modifying these work arrangements are incoherent and problematic for the very people they want to benefit.

Virtual and augmented reality headsets are designed to place wearers directly into other environments, worlds and experiences. While the technology is already popular among consumers for its immersive quality, there could be a future where the holographic displays look even more like real life. In their own pursuit of these better displays, the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab has combined their expertise in optics and artificial intelligence. Their most recent advances in this area are detailed in a paper published Nov. 12 in Science Advances and work that will be presented at SIGGRAPH ASIA 2021 in December.

At its core, this research confronts the fact that current augmented and virtual reality displays only show 2D images to each of the viewer’s eyes, instead of 3D – or holographic – images like we see in the real world.“They are not perceptually realistic,” explained Gordon Wetzstein, associate professor of electrical engineering and leader of the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab. Wetzstein and his colleagues are working to come up with solutions to bridge this gap between simulation and reality while creating displays that are more visually appealing and easier on the eyes.The research published in Science Advances details a technique for reducing a speckling distortion often seen in regular laser-based holographic displays, while the SIGGRAPH Asia paper proposes a technique to more realistically represent the physics that would apply to the 3D scene if it existed in the real world.Bridging simulation and realityIn the past decades, image quality for existing holographic displays has been limited. As Wetzstein explains it, researchers have been faced with the challenge of getting a holographic display to look as good as an LCD display.One problem is that it is difficult to control the shape of light waves at the resolution of a hologram. The other major challenge hindering the creation of high-quality holographic displays is overcoming the gap between what is going on in the simulation versus what the same scene would look like in a real environment.Previously, scientists have attempted to create algorithms to address both of these problems. Wetzstein and his colleagues also developed algorithms but did so using neural networks, a form of artificial intelligence that attempts to mimic the way the human brain learns information. They call this “neural holography.”

“Artificial intelligence has revolutionized pretty much all aspects of engineering and beyond,” said Wetzstein. “But in this specific area of holographic displays or computer-generated holography, people have only just started to explore AI techniques.”
Yifan Peng, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab, is using his interdisciplinary background in both optics and computer science to help design the optical engine to go into the holographic displays.
“Only recently, with the emerging machine intelligence innovations, have we had access to the powerful tools and capabilities to make use of the advances in computer technology,” said Peng, who is co-lead author of the Science Advances paper and a co-author of the SIGGRAPH paper.
The neural holographic display that these researchers have created involved training a neural network to mimic the real-world physics of what was happening in the display and achieved real-time images. They then paired this with a “camera-in-the-loop” calibration strategy that provides near-instantaneous feedback to inform adjustments and improvements. By creating an algorithm and calibration technique, which run in real time with the image seen, the researchers were able to create more realistic-looking visuals with better color, contrast and clarity.
The new SIGGRAPH Asia paper highlights the lab’s first application of their neural holography system to 3D scenes. This system produces high-quality, realistic representation of scenes that contain visual depth, even when parts of the scenes are intentionally depicted as far away or out-of-focus.
The Science Advances work uses the same camera-in-the-loop optimization strategy, paired with an artificial intelligence-inspired algorithm, to provide an improved system for holographic displays that use partially coherent light sources – LEDs and SLEDs. These light sources are attractive for their cost, size and energy requirements and they also have the potential to avoid the speckled appearance of images produced by systems that rely on coherent light sources, like lasers. But the same characteristics that help partially coherent source systems avoid speckling tend to result in blurred images with a lack of contrast. By building an algorithm specific to the physics of partially coherent light sources, the researchers have produced the first high-quality and speckle-free holographic 2D and 3D images using LEDs and SLEDs.
Transformative potential
Wetzstein and Peng believe this coupling of emerging artificial intelligence techniques along with virtual and augmented reality will become increasingly ubiquitous in a number of industries in the coming years.
“I’m a big believer in the future of wearable computing systems and AR and VR in general, I think they’re going to have a transformative impact on people’s lives,” said Wetzstein. It might not be for the next few years, he said, but Wetzstein believes that augmented reality is the “big future.”
Though augmented virtual reality is primarily associated with gaming right now, it and augmented reality have potential use in a variety of fields, including medicine. Medical students can use augmented reality for training as well as for overlaying medical data from CT scans and MRIs directly onto the patients.
“These types of technologies are already in use for thousands of surgeries, per year,” said Wetzstein. “We envision that head-worn displays that are smaller, lighter weight and just more visually comfortable are a big part of the future of surgery planning.”
“It is very exciting to see how the computation can improve the display quality with the same hardware setup,” said Jonghyun Kim, a visiting scholar from Nvidia and co-author of both papers. “Better computation can make a better display, which can be a game changer for the display industry.”

Stanford graduate student is co-lead author of both papers Suyeon Choi and Stanford graduate student Manu Gopakumar is co-lead author of the SIGGRAPH paper. This work was funded by Ford, Sony, Intel, the National Science Foundation, the Army Research Office, a Kwanjeong Scholarship, a Korea Government Scholarship and a Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesBy Kate Conger and Daisuke WakabayashiNov. 15, 2021Google executives told employees last week in a companywide meeting that it is interested in a Pentagon contract for cloud computing and that working for the military would not necessarily conflict with principles created by the company for how its artificial intelligence technology would be used.Google is pursuing the contract three years after an employee revolt forced the company to abandon work on a Pentagon program that used artificial intelligence and to establish new guidelines against using A.I. for weapons or surveillance.The pursuit potentially sets up another clash between company leaders and employees. Google’s cloud unit prioritized preparation for a bid on a Pentagon contract, The New York Times revealed this month, pulling engineers off other projects to focus on creating a winning proposal.The rush to pursue the contract is a dramatic shift for Google, which said in 2018 that it would not bid on a major cloud computing contract with the Defense Department, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, because the work would conflict with its A.I. principles.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe JEDI cloud computing contract was estimated to be worth $10 billion over 10 years, and was awarded to Microsoft in 2019. But facing legal challenges from Amazon, the Pentagon scrapped the contract in July and announced a new plan to purchase cloud computing technology. The new version of the contract, known as the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, will split the work between multiple companies.The segmented nature of the contract allows Google to work on parts of the Pentagon cloud without violating its ban on weapons, Google executives told employees in the videoconference meeting on Thursday, a recording of which was obtained by The Times.The exact scope of the work is still unclear because the government has not submitted a formal request for proposal. While it has not been invited to bid, Google has said it is interested.In a blog post published the same day as the meeting, Thomas Kurian, who oversees the company’s cloud unit, wrote: “If we are invited to be part of the J.W.C.C. contract, we will absolutely bid.”At the meeting, Mr. Kurian said there are many areas where Google’s capabilities and expertise can be applied “with no conflict to Google’s A.I. principles.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We have governance processes that provide guidance and oversight into what A.I. products we will offer and what custom A.I. projects we will and we will not pursue, and we will follow those governance processes,” he said.Mr. Kurian’s remarks, which were reported earlier by CNBC, were made in response to a question from an employee about Google’s interest in the Pentagon contract and The Times’s reporting on it.“We understand that not every Googler will agree with this decision, but we believe Google Cloud should seek to serve the government where it is capable of doing so and where the work meets Google’s A.I. principles and our company’s values,” Mr. Kurian said.Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, echoed his remarks. “I think we are strongly committed to working with the government in a way that’s consistent with our A.I. principles,” Mr. Pichai said.A spokesman for Google declined to comment.Kate Conger is a technology reporter in the San Francisco bureau, where she covers the gig economy and social media.

Just a few years ago nobody would have thought that AI would be a vital part of business today, but businesses around the world are continuing to find new reasons to use it to eliminate day-to-day inefficiencies. This is eliminating any sense of a  level playing field for businesses that aren’t utilizing this technology yet, and creating a growing concern about the overall power AI will have over the future workforce. 
Despite its potential, AI also brings up concerns about job displacement, economic instability, and skills shortages. Despite these concerns over the potential implications of AI, the technology still holds great potential for human empowerment. It also gives us the tools we need to automate redundant tasks, spot patterns in the data we collect and uncover important insights that could improve our lives for the better.
Integrating AI into the Workforce
Voice AI communication isn’t only outperforming humans, but it’s also helping streamline the process so we can get things done before they’re due. These are just a few of the ways AI is being used today. About half of America’s workforce feels their company’s AI deployment is greatly outpacing the accuracy and productivity of comparable human activity. This is something that business leaders are already quite aware of. They also realize AI’s potential ethical and human dilemmas. In fact, 69 percent of C-level executives say their employees are concerned that AI technologies will replace them. To help employees feel more comfortable with using AI, companies need to focus on training employee to develop these skills.
How AI is Transforming Business as We Know It
Live Mint says AI helps with human decision-making. This is because algorithms are growing smarter and computing power is growing. While AI still can’t complete common-sense tasks today, it can process and analyze data faster than the human brain can. It will then provide you with many synthesized courses of action so you can figure out the possible consequences of each action and streamline your decision-making process. When this is merged with human interactions, it’ll help you meet your customers’ needs. 
One of the best examples of this is Google’s search engine. It uses thousands of human ‘raters’ to assess the quality of its AI-driven search results. In this way, you can see how AI leverages self-learning systems (e.g. data mining, pattern recognition, natural language processing) as a key advantage over human intelligence. This is something that you can scale in such a way that your bottom line is drastically improved while errors are greatly decreased. Its longevity, coupled with continuous improvements and its ability to document processes is quite rewarding for all types of businesses today—including healthcare, education, auto, banking, and retail. A great example of this is Amazon. According to Live Mint today, they’re using AI to cut costs and improve their platform—making it superior, intuitive, and smart. All of this happens because AI can analyze customers’ social media feeds so they can improve search results and recommendations.
This is just one example of how AI has effectively helped businesses decode patterns in their customers’ online behavior—to the point that they can now predict the probability of a customer returning a product. This also helps businesses segment customers, based on their data, into groups who share the same attributes. By doing this they can improve customer loyalty since they’re able to offer more personalized, relevant marketing messages. 
Customers are growing reliant on AI when they need to find new businesses to engage with. These businesses then rely on AI to help them offer their customers the services or products and support they need. Employees have also grown more dependent on this technology to get their work done each day. All of this is slowly taking a more central role in today’s business world, so businesses can’t afford to have an AI strategy in place today. When this is designed with the customer in mind, AI solutions can drive customer loyalty, engagement, consumption and satisfaction. It won’t take long before companies start seeing AI’s real potential.
Leaders are also embracing the greater presence of AI. Once it becomes more integrated into their operations, leadership will need to be refined. This includes revising their overall strategy, customer experience, technology, and human capital. Most C-level executives recognize this shift in leadership and are working to build their future business strategy around the opportunities AI technology has made available to them. 
Techemergence claims that about 80 percent of C-level executives are confident that their executive team can adapt their leadership skills as they adopt new AI technologies. Another 70 percent of them strongly agree that AI will benefit employees at all levels throughout their organization. This demonstrates the positive view they’re taking toward AI and the transparency it brings in regards to running an autonomous business. Techemergence claims that 52 percent of CEOs today are afraid that leadership will become less transparent with help from AI and automation.
What All This Means to You
There are some companies that are already experiencing AI’s benefits as it grows more mainstream in today’s business world. Those who aren’t already experimenting with AI are at risk of being left behind. To remain competitive, any business who invests in AI should also invest in their employees. As AI continues to change the business world as we know it, those who embrace training and re-skilling their current employees stand to gain tangible benefits.
Clearly, it’s important for your business to be transparent about AI initiatives and how they’ll both benefit and improve your company. This won’t only help you find new opportunities for your business, but it’ll also head off any potential risks before they turn into major problems or hurt your customers, employees or reputation. You can’t simply train your employees then forget about it though. To be truly successful you must adopt a culture of lifelong learning and encourage your staff to continuously develop new skills.

            -10.21% Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price has skyrocketed over the year-to-date, jumping 132% as of Thursday. But CEO Jensen Huang isn’t concerned about share prices overheating. Rather, he sees it as a response to people being excited about the work the chip giant is doing in artificial intelligence.“Artificial intelligence is unquestionably the most powerful technology force the world has ever known,” Huang told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re always seeking to improve our performance, improve our efficiency, and improve our growth opportunities. And artificial intelligence is understandably the best way for that going forward. And I think people are excited about that.”Earlier in the week, Huang kicked off Nvidia’s GTC 2021 conference with a virtual keynote that featured discussions about the company’s efforts in AI, the metaverse, robotics, and self-driving cars.The most valuable chipmaker in the world with a market cap of $749 billion, Nvidia has gone from functioning solely as a maker of graphics cards for gamers to an AI powerhouse thanks to the processing power of its chips.Its gaming arm still brings in the majority of its revenue, about 47% to its data center business’s 36%, but that gap is shrinking more and more each quarter. And while the company is dead set on continuing to be the top card maker in the world, investors recognize Nvidia’s AI and data center businesses as an important and growing piece of the company’s overall strategy.Part of Nvidia’s secret sauce is the fact that while it builds everything from chips to supercomputers, it also produces the software that its customers use to develop their own artificial intelligence capabilities. In other words, the company is a one-stop shop for its clients’ AI needs.Nvidia showed off an AI-powered toy version of CEO Jensen Huang during its GTC 2021 conference. (Image: Nvidia) (Nvidia)“People are excited about the fact that Nvidia is not a traditional semiconductor company,” Huang said. “We’re rich with software, and we are rich with the ability to open to new markets.”According to the CEO, the software that Nvidia makes is essential for accelerated computing, and without it, the computing model the company pioneered doesn’t work.Nvidia’s AI efforts touch everything from its work on self-driving cars, to training robots, to language models, and its own Omniverse. The company’s metaverse platform, Omniverse is the plumbing Nvidia customers can use to build out their own virtual worlds.Customers can use Omniverse to create so-called “digital twins” that they can work with inside of a virtual environment rather than the real world. An automaker might, for instance, use a digital twin to reconfigure one of its manufacturing plants using Omniverse. That could help it spot potential bottlenecks that it might not have noticed until it already spent millions building out the site in the real world.Story continuesNvidia is currently using its Omniverse software to build out its self-driving car efforts by running virtual cars through digital twins of the real world. That allows the vehicles’ to collect the data the company needs to program cars in the real world, without ever having them touch pavement.“I think people are excited about the technology that we’ve created,” Huang said. “I’m delighted that people see the potential in our company, and I’m looking forward to the future we’ve discussed.”Sign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletterMore from DanNvidia CEO: ‘We don’t have any magic bullets’ to deal with chip shortageNvidia is on top of the world, but its rivals are gaining steamNvidia announces deeper push into healthcare industry at GTC 2021Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and redditGot a tip?

A model of lifelong learning: NUS equips staff with data literacy and artificial intelligence skills









NN
The Data Literacy Programme (DLP) and Artificial Intelligence Competency Course (AICC) aim to equip staff with pertinent skills for a digital future.






The changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic are still unfolding but its demand on new skills and ways of working is clear, as organisations seek to survive and thrive in the uncertain times ahead. Many businesses have trimmed back on employee development, but NUS has bucked the trend by putting in huge investment to arm its administrative staff with skills that are critical for success in the digital future. By launching comprehensive training programmes in data literacy and artificial intelligence since last year, NUS is demonstrating its commitment to prepare staff for the digital future.Using data to derive business insights and drive performance The University has set its sights on arming and upskilling its administrative employees on data literacy and analytics, with the Data Literacy Programme (DLP) conducted over the past year.“The DLP reaffirms the University’s commitment to lifelong learning and the development of our staff, and is our first step to prepare them for the digital future,” said NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye.“NUS is not only committed to deliver innovative student programmes, we are also committed to ensure our staff are equipped with the relevant skills to stay ahead in these rapidly evolving times, and be ready for new roles in the economy including data analysts and data scientists.”Data is an important resource for all organisations, and is key to deriving meaningful insights to drive business decisions and performance. “All organisations including NUS need to have a higher level of data literacy to unlock these resources to improve our decision efficacy.”Learners give the thumbs upSince its launch in mid-2020, over 2,400 employees have completed or are currently attending the DLP Basic course.The course is being delivered via a blended, hybrid learning approach requiring learners to complete a suite of eLearning sessions, attend 15 hours of hands-on workshops, and complete a group project.Specially designed and helmed by a dedicated group of professors and instructors, including Associate Professor Roger Tan, Associate Professor Carol Anne Hargreaves and Dr Vik Gopal, the DLP is tailored for staff with little to no background in data literacy so that a common ground can be established for staff.Feedback has been positive. The DLP has garnered an 80 per cent programme satisfaction rate, with the majority signaling that they will recommend the course to other colleagues.In addition, many learners wish to pursue higher levels of DLP to deepen their data literacy skillsets – to this end, the DLP will roll out intermediate and advanced levels, to cover data engineering and data visualisation.Learners who have become strong advocates of DLP include Ms Ho Yuen Ping from NUS Enterprise, who expressed her hopes of administrative staff in NUS being equipped in baseline data literacy to make better decisions for the University.“I look forward to the day when all administrative staff have gone through DLP – it means that when we present data for managerial decision-making, everyone will understand and be talking the same language.” Mr Li Xin from the NUS Faculty of Science has experienced the usefulness of the in-person workshops. “Sometimes, what we need is a good starting point and very useful guidance from the teachers so that we can get started. Thereafter, maybe Google is useful. But before that, you really don’t know what you don’t know so it is very difficult.”The University’s efforts to upgrade employees’ skills has led to a greater appreciation for data among employees. Ms Ann Koh Lay Boon from the NUS Office of The President recognises that DLP has led her to appreciate the process of working with data.“My experience doing DLP is very interesting. In fact, I have been encouraging people to go on DLP. Now when I look at a report and the data, I understand how much work has gone into (giving you this kind of information). I get a better idea of how things are done,” she shared.Data-driven projectsDLP presents an invaluable opportunity for learners to collaborate with their colleagues across the University to embark on work-related projects, harnessing data to generate meaningful results.Over 400 projects have been presented with 13 winning projects identified based on the depth of data insights generated, the potential impact on the community, and the application of data storytelling techniques.These projects hold much potential in adding value to the work done in NUS. For instance, a team that worked on data related to the NUS internal bus shuttle system explored the different safety events on the bus routes. With in-depth analysis of the data, their project uncovered hotspots for safety events and the types of dominant safety events such as cornering and braking.Another team investigated the data related to the NUS claims system. The project delved into the claims made by different units in NUS qualitatively and quantitatively, generating interesting insights that have prompted the finance team to provide new services and tighten gaps. This project has helped generate savings for NUS.Unleashing AI-based thinking  Following close on the heels of DLP, NUS also rolled out the Artificial Intelligence Competency Course (AICC) for staff, to train them to create smart systems and applications using modern machine learning and deep learning techniques.Designed by faculty members from NUS School of Computing, including Associate Professor Tan Wee Kek, Dr Lek Hsiang Hui and Dr Akshay Narayan, AICC is a series of courses structured according to three levels of competency – basic, intermediate and advanced. The basic course aims to train learners to be conversant in AI, able to explain what AI is and identify opportunities to apply AI within the University to create positive impact.The intermediate and advanced courses are targeted at interested employees who want to apply AI in their workplace to solve real problems and improve productivity.AICC also adopts a hybrid learning approach with participants attending a weekly three-hour in-person discussion with the instructors, culminating in a group project at the end of five weeks.Just six months into the launch of AICC, the programme has already started to bear fruit with participants proposing various innovative AI projects to improve the productivity of their daily work and create new opportunities for the University. For instance, a team from the NUS School of Design and Environment and NUS Centre for English Language Communication has proposed an AI system to automatically verify the correctness of supporting documents that are submitted for postgraduate admission applications.Staff from the NUS Centre for Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing (CRISP) have conceptualised an AI system to automate the cloud masking process when analysing satellite images, while a team from the NUS Development Office has put forth the idea of creating an AI application to better engage with alumni and potential donors.Ms Kelly Fong Guan Wen from the NUS Office of Human Resources has found AICC to be helpful in her daily work as well as for her general understanding of the potential of AI.“I believe this will come in handy for all colleagues in time to come and I am very grateful to be part of this learning experience.”Spirit of lifelong learning coded in the NUS DNA  NUS aims for all in the University’s community to embody the spirit of lifelong learning.The University has also established a Skills Transformation Fund account for administrative employees. Employees are empowered to take ownership of their development and utilise the fund to enroll in learning courses that build essential skillsets for their jobs.This will help staff to adapt, transform and innovate to better meet the needs of tomorrow’s challenges.“Learning should be a key differentiator in our value proposition as an employer,” said Prof Tan.  By the NUS Office of Human Resources

A draft EU regulation on artificial intelligence risks exclusion of the social partners and lack of compliance with data-protection requirements.
Introduced by agreement, AI may be enabling—an engineer helps an operator programme a robot arm for a production line (Gorodenkoff/shutterstock.com)
Discussions about a European regulation on artificial intelligence have burgeoned since the European Commission published its proposal in April. In the aftermath, we wrote about potential threats to labour and employment rights. The text, of course, is not definitive and it is possible the final version will significantly diverge—there is indeed room for improvement.
Amid calls from employers for a ‘laser-sharp’ definition, which would be prone to circumvention and unable to keep pace with technical developments, AI is described in the draft by reference to some of its functions: prediction, optimisation, personalisation and resource allocation. Due to the pandemic-induced digital acceleration, almost everyone is now familiar with the promises and perils of AI-enabled tools adopted to perform decisional tasks in a large variety of domains and, in particularly sensitive contexts, as working ecosystems.
The draft regulation mentions both ‘AI systems intended to be used for recruitment or selection of natural persons, notably for advertising vacancies, screening or filtering applications, evaluating candidates in the course of interviews or tests’ and ‘AI intended to be used for making decisions on promotion and termination of work-related contractual relationships, for task allocation and for monitoring and evaluating performance and behavior of persons in such relationships’. This largely encompasses the managerial functions entrusted to data-driven management models, often lumped together under the popular formula of ‘algorithmic bosses’.

The commission acknowledges that these ‘high-risk’ AI systems ‘pose significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights of persons’. In the draft, however, a ‘laissez-faire’ approach prevails, and such systems have merely to comply with a ‘set of horizontal mandatory requirements for trustworthy AI’. These include ‘appropriate data governance and management practices’, package-insert-like documentation proving compliance with current rules, transparency of procedures, human oversight and ‘an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity’. The practice, however, is mainly based on self-certification via the ex-ante ‘conformity assessment procedures’ conducted by providers themselves or, in a few cases, delivered through standard-setting bodies.
Ceiling rather than floor
We had expressed the concern that the regulation could end up being a ceiling for labour protection rather than a floor. Its liberalising legal basis is article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on harmonisation in the internal market. This could be used to trump existing national regulations providing for involvement of the social partners before introduction of any technological tool apt to monitor workers’ performance. This is all the more so when AI applications are embedded in ordinary tools already used at the workplace to protect business assets, assess working performance and track productivity—or flag deviant behaviours.

Several member states have devised a dedicated model for surveillance technology in employment, whereby worker representatives or public bodies are required to be involved and, in some cases, may exercise veto powers. While most ordinary monitoring devices have often to pass a codetermination phase before being introduced in professional environments, the model envisaged by the AI regulation risks displacing all these procedural protections. They, in fact, could be interpreted as exorbitant and disproportionate relative to the safeguards provided and thus hampering the free provision of AI-related services the instrument aims to promote. Hence, more protective domestic laws risk being watered down, if read as incompatible with the harmonisation aims of the regulation.
The regulation should specifically provide that it is without prejudice to any existing or future labour and employment protection aimed at governing the introduction and use of any AI-enabled tool in European workplaces. This would avoid the regulation being used to lower or abrogate labour standards, harming privacy, freedom of expression, human dignity and equality.
More specific rules
Such a provision would be consistent with the commission’s claim that its proposal ‘is without prejudice and complements the General Data Protection Regulation’. A paramount provision of the GDPR, article 88, allows member states, ‘by law or collective agreements’, to ‘provide for more specific rules to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees’ personal data in the employment context’.
The GDPR refers ‘in particular’ to ‘the purposes of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work’, as well as ‘the protection of employer’s or customer’s property and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship’.
Crucially, according to article 88 these rules ‘shall include suitable and specific measures to safeguard the data subject’s human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights, with particular regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and monitoring systems at the work place’.
This aims to allow responsive solutions to the emergence of new instruments and practices that may significantly affect workers. The reference to ‘law or collective agreements’, moreover, provides an opportunity to bring worker representatives to the table.
National data-protection authorities have read this in conjunction with article 5 of the GDPR, which establishes its principles of ‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’ along with other guiding tenets. In particular, compliance with domestic provisions on employee monitoring and privacy regulation has been considered a precondition for fulfilling the principle of lawful processing, thus strengthening integration between the GDPR and national rules.
Explicit provision
The purposes for which article 88 encourages member states to adopt specific labour and employment protection correspond to, and even go beyond, the potential use of tools envisaged by the AI regulation. Therefore, interpreting the draft as preventing national measures providing specific labour and employment safeguards would be incompatible with article 88 of the GDPR, which explicitly allows for such measures. And if that were the case, the AI regulation would not operate ‘without prejudice’ to the GDPR, as the commission claims.
To foster legal certainty, for the benefit of providers and users, an explicit provision excluding any national labour and employment regulation being ‘dismembered’ under the AI regulation would be opportune. Moreover, AI-enabled managerial tools pose severe risks to workers’ rights, well beyond the realm of privacy. Therefore, consistency must be ensured with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and secondary union legislation on consumer protection, non-discrimination and equality, health and safety.
As citizens, trade unions, data-protection authorities and litigators gradually master the ability to utilise the GDPR strategically to tame algorithmic bosses, it is crucial to explore the full potential of the rights it confers. Its role would be severely undermined should the proposed AI regulation become operative as a prevailing EU secondary-law instrument. On the contrary, an AI act must be seen as one piece of a complex, multidimensional jigsaw, whose twofold goal is to uphold data flow while guaranteeing that European citizens’ and workers’ rights are fully respected.

When I talk to retailers about artificial intelligence, their eyes glaze over, like I’m speaking a foreign language and very few people want to talk about it. But it’s coming, it’s unavoidable. AI is going to pervade almost every aspect of retail, big and small.


Here's a case in point: The EPA estimates that a supermarket of 50,000 square feet, that's a large store but not excessively so, uses about $200,000 worth of electricity and natural gas in the course of a year. According to the EPA, about half of that cost is in refrigeration and lighting. Most such large stores have freezers that consumers go into to pick out their frozen food. But they also have a freezer in the back of the store that consumers don't see, where they keep their inventory. Now imagine this: the store hires a very smart young college graduate just to watch that freezer in the back. That employee's job is only to stand and watch the freezer door to minimize the number of times it gets opened and manage the thermostat accordingly to reduce the electrical cost. Over time, the employee learns how to make adjustments so that the door openings lead to the least amount of additional energy used to keep products cold.

Now imagine that instead of hiring a person, software could do the job. The software would have to learn how a store operates and the climate and temperature of the store region. That's the idea behind a company called COI Energy Services. In just a few hours, they can install and set up their software. Over a year's time, they will save a supermarket of 50,000 square feet $60,000 on their electric and gas costs, that’s 40% of their total costs. That's not theoretical, Publix Supermarkets, the fifth largest grocer in the country, uses the system and is rolling it out to all its stores.

PROMOTED
If you're Publix's competitor with a store across the street from them, Publix can now afford to hire one more employee than you can because Publix is using AI to save $60,000 that you're not saving. You could keep ignoring the potential of AI or you could do what Publix is doing and save the money. Only one choice is right but it means embracing a new and different kind of technology. It also means allowing technology to control certain things in the store, like the thermostat on the freezer, that has always been run by a person. That’s scary to many people; change is always scary.

You may say to yourself, controlling a freezer is one thing, what makes AI so important?

When you combine the nuances of each of these criteria and steps, there are literally billions of possible decisions that are possible and they get adjusted too often for any human being to manage. Until now, decision-makers relied on their instincts or “gut” and while some people are gifted at brand management, most people aren’t. That’s why AI can help and competing against a brand managed with the help of artificial intelligence is more than anyone could handle. Everyone is going to have to do this.
How does the software work and why is artificial intelligence different from software you’re used to? The answer is called “machine learning.” Machine learning means is software is programmed to go out into the digital universe and constantly search for relevant information. It ingests and analyzes that information and the analysis is the difference between artificial intelligence and everything else. The software learns over time and improves its own decision-making. It takes in far more information than any human being can and all day and night it analyzes its previous judgments to make better decisions and recommendations.
For artificial intelligence to be effective, it’s not always necessary to turn decision-making entirely over to a computer although there are times when that makes sense. In the case of a freezer’s thermostat, it’s probably always better for the software to decide on the temperature than for a person to second-guess the machine. But in the case of brand management, having a computer make recommendations allows a person to consider what the computer says and let it be one more input. There are ways in which the computer can make better decisions but in the case of high-level decisions, it’s a useful tool. Over time we will learn whether the software can make better high-level decisions than humans. With enough time and enough data, my money’s on the software.
Most important, better decision-making at levels big and small is not a fad and it’s not a foreign language, it’s an opportunity. But in retail, no one wants to be first and no one wants to be last, everyone wants to be second. For artificial intelligence, the time to be second is now. Brands like Keurig and Harry’s are using ProQuo AI to help them manage their brands and a company like Publix keeps its freezers at the right temperature with AI technology.
According to a study done by business monitoring company Anodot, retailers who are employing AI right now use it more for non-customer facing applications, like detecting fraud. But they expect to migrate the use of AI to more consumer-facing applications like personalization and visual search.
It’s time for everyone else to leap over their hesitation and embrace what’s coming. If artificial intelligence is relevant to both brand management and the temperature of a freezer in a supermarket, then it will eventually be ubiquitous at every retailer.

Summary
In April 2021, the European Commission released its 108-page proposal to regulate artificial intelligence (“AI”), describing it as an attempt to ensure a “well-functioning internal market for artificial intelligence systems” that is based on “EU values and fundamental rights.”[1] It is the bloc’s first major attempt to comprehensively regulate such systems, and could have global repercussions.
The proposed Artificial Intelligence Act comes amid growing concern, in Europe and beyond, about how AI and other forms of algorithmic decision-making are increasingly woven into the social safety net, affecting social and economic rights. The former UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, and academics and civil society groups, have warned against the use of high-tech tools to deny or limit access to lifesaving benefits and other social services, at a time when these programs are a critical bulwark against growing poverty and income inequality.[2]

While the EU regulation broadly acknowledges these risks, it does not meaningfully protect people’s rights to social security and an adequate standard of living. In particular, its narrow safeguards neglect how existing inequities and failures to adequately protect rights – such as the digital divide, social security cuts, and discrimination in the labor market – shape the design of automated systems, and become embedded by them.[3]
This Q&A highlights how algorithmic decision-making is transforming the administration of welfare benefits and other social protection measures in Europe, and the human rights concerns created by this transition to algorithmic governance. It also examines how the proposed regulation fails to address these concerns, and what the European Parliament should do to fix these shortcomings.

Part I: Algorithmic Decision-Making
and the Right to Social Security
1. How does the regulation define “artificial intelligence”?  
The definition of artificial intelligence in the regulation covers a wide range of computational methods designed to perform certain tasks, such as generating content, assisting in decision-making about people’s social security benefits, predicting an individual’s risk of committing fraud or defaulting on a loan, or recommending advertisements on social media platforms.[4]  
The regulation is not only concerned with the latest advances in artificial intelligence that have attracted intense government and public scrutiny in recent years, such as the use of self-learning technologies to recognize faces or generate text. It would also cover rules-based algorithms that, by most technical definitions, would not be considered artificial intelligence – in other words, algorithms programmed with a well-defined sequence of rules to make a decision, prediction, or recommendation, such as the amount an individual should receive in their social security payment, the likelihood that they will find a job in the next year, or their grades on a particular exam.[5]  
 2. Do EU member states have a duty to protect the right to social security?
Yes. Article 34 of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union “recognises and respects the entitlement to social security benefits and social services” in a broad range of cases, such as when people lose employment.[6] Article 34 further establishes the “right to social and housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient resources.”
Member states also have a duty to protect the right to social security under international human rights law and regional standards, which may be broader than their corresponding duty under the EU charter.[7]
Article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) recognizes the right of everyone to “social security, including social insurance.”[8] All EU member states have ratified the covenant. 
The UN body that monitors compliance with ICESCR has found that states violate social security rights when they fail to take “sufficient and appropriate action” to protect people’s access to benefits (such as by passing weak regulations).[9] The treaty body also warned against adopting “deliberatively retrogressive measures” that deprive people of benefits based on irrational or discriminatory eligibility criteria, such as their place of residence.[10]  
International human rights law also recognizes the right of everyone to an “adequate standard of living … including food, clothing, and housing,” which often requires securing social security benefits.[11] 
All EU member states are members of the Council of Europe and have ratified at least one of the two versions of the European Social Charter (ESC): the 1961 original, and the 1996 revised version.[12] Articles 12, 13, and 14 of the Charter guarantee the right to social security, the right to social and medical assistance, and the right to benefit from social welfare services respectively. Article 30 of the 1996 revised version also guarantees the right to protection against poverty and social exclusion.
In March 2021, the European Committee of Social Rights, which oversees compliance with the Charters, issued a statement on social rights observing “that the rapid digitalisation of social and other services during the pandemic has tended to accentuate the social exclusion of people living in poverty due to lack of equipment, broadband connections and digital skills (the digital divide).”[13]
 3. How are governments using automation to monitor and control access to benefits and social security programs? 
In Europe, governments have relied on algorithmic decision-making at three key stages in the social security delivery cycle: 1) verifying a person’s identity; 2) assessing a person’s eligibility for benefits and the amount to which they are entitled; and 3) preventing and investigating benefits fraud. Automating these decisions can make social security administration more efficient for the government. But it can also compromise the privacy of people in need, make it more onerous for them to prove they qualify for government assistance, and profile them in harmful ways.  
I. Identity verification
In a bid to curb identity fraud in cash assistance programs, public authorities are capitalizing on technological advances in identity authentication to ensure that benefit applicants are who they say they are. But automating identity checks imposes heightened evidentiary requirements that are intrusive and unduly burdensome for many people who rely on benefits.  
In Ireland, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP), the national welfare office, generally requires applicants for welfare benefits to verify their identity using the Public Services Card (PSC), a government-issued identity card.[14] To obtain a PSC, applicants are required to submit evidence of their identity and address (such as their passport and a utility bill), and schedule an in-person registration appointment at their local welfare office.[15] During the appointment, the office will ask the applicant security questions, record their signature, and take their photo. The DEASP uses facial recognition to compare this photo with data drawn from past applicants’ photos to ensure that they have not registered more than once or under a different identity.[16]
The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, a human rights organization, has criticized the DEASP for collecting more personal data than necessary to perform identity checks.[17] It is unclear, for example, why the DEASP collects and analyzes facial images when less invasive means of checking people’s identity, such as authenticating their passport and proof of address, should ordinarily suffice.[18]
Conditioning access to benefits on facial recognition checks also heightens the risk of discrimination. A 2019 study by the US National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST), a United States government laboratory that has conducted one of the most comprehensive global studies of facial recognition algorithms, has found that facial identification is less accurate for darker-skinned women than for white men.[19] When government agencies use this technology to conduct law enforcement investigations, NIST has warned that these inaccuracies could lead to false accusations.[20] DEASP has not published any information about the accuracy rates of its software. 
The former UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has also raised concerns that the identity verification process is invasive and exclusionary, because its requirements create high barriers to access benefits.[21] Several PSC applicants who were adopted as children told the online publication The Journal.ie that they struggled to provide evidence of their adoption status that was satisfactory to DEASP.[22] Migrants with incomplete identity documents, and rural residents who live far away from the nearest welfare office may also face difficulties registering for a PSC.[23]  
Despite these concerns, the DEASP has suspended welfare payments to hundreds of people who have failed to register for the PSC, claiming that the “vast majority” of them are no longer in the country.[24] In some cases, however, people who are eligible have been denied access to essential social security support. In 2017, a woman in her 70s was denied her pension for 18 months – about €13,000 total – when she refused to register for a PSC because she did not think it was mandatory.[25] The DEASP restored her pension after her situation received widespread media coverage. In 2019, the DEASP denied welfare benefits to a teacher who broke her ankle in an accident and was out of work for seven weeks, after she was unable to travel to the welfare office to register for a PSC.[26] She also objected to the PSC for privacy reasons.  
Although the United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU, its benefits system, Universal Credit, reflects one of the most ambitious efforts to automate an essential public service, and provides critical insight on how welfare automation can affect rights.[27]
In 2016, the government introduced “GOV.UK Verify”, a revamped online process for people to verify their identity when applying for Universal Credit, filing taxes, or using other government services.[28] The service is operated by third-party identity providers. Users of this service are required to upload evidence of their identity, such as a driver’s license, bank account details, and mobile phone contracts. The providers check this information against data they have collected (such as people’s credit histories) and passport and driver’s license data held by the government.
The Verify service has proven difficult to use for the majority of people applying for benefits, since many of them lack the online presence or proof of identity needed to complete its verification checks.[29] In 2019, the UK’s National Audit Office, which monitors public spending in Parliament, found that only 38 percent of people who applied for Universal Credit were able to successfully verify their identity using the service.[30] Many people submit evidence of their identity at their local unemployment office instead.
In March 2020, when the government imposed Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, there were complaints that the Verify service was slow and unusable, forcing the government to revert to an older verification process for the sudden influx of people claiming Universal Credit.[31] The government also gave people the option to verify their identity over the phone.
In July 2021, the government announced plans to develop a new centralized digital identity platform that will enable a single “sign-on” for access to all government services.[32] It is unclear, however, how this platform will be designed to avoid the problems that plagued the Verify service, which was also intended to centralize identity verification checks.  
 II. Eligibility Assessment and Means Testing
Governments also use automated decision-making to assess whether people satisfy the eligibility criteria of the benefits they are claiming, and adjust the size of their benefit payments based on changes in their income.
In France, the Caisse des Allocations Familiale (CAF), the government agency that oversees the administration of social security benefits, uses an automated system to calculate and distribute benefit payments. In June 2021, CAF admitted that recent changes to the system had caused benefit delays and errors for “1 to 2%” of the approximately six million people receiving a housing allowance known as Aide personnalisée au logement, or APL.[33] By this estimate, at least 60,000 to 120,000 people have experienced delays or errors.
These problems stem from a software update that CAF introduced in January 2021, to implement policy changes to APL’s means-testing formula. The new formula mandated recalculating the benefit every three months based on the income history over the preceding 12 months of the person receiving it.[34]
Mediapart, a French investigative news outlet, reported that the update caused delays to people’s benefits or saddled them with debt they did not owe.[35] A 52-year-old woman living in Poitiers told Mediapart  that she did not understand why CAF deducted 110€ from her benefit payment in April. When she logged on to her CAF account after the deduction, her confusion and anxiety grew when she saw that she owed the agency 1,400€ in overpaid benefits. A case worker she contacted found that this was a software error, but could not correct it in the system. To cope with the benefit cut, she borrowed money from her friends and cut back on groceries and food.  
In an article for the digital rights NGO AlgorithmWatch, Lucie Inland, a journalist, reported that CAF sent her an automated debt notice in March, two months after the software update.[36] The notice informed her that she owed 542€ in overpaid benefits, and that 60€ would be withdrawn from her benefit payments every month. A caseworker she contacted told her that this was a software error, and CAF subsequently withdrew their decision and canceled the debt. Inland described the ordeal as an “emotional rollercoaster.”
In the United Kingdom, the government is using a flawed algorithm to calculate people’s benefit payments under Universal Credit.[37] The algorithm is supposed to adjust how much people are entitled to each month based on changes in their earnings. But the data the government uses to calculate these changes only reflects the wages people receive within a calendar month, and ignores how frequently people are paid. If an individual receives multiple paychecks in one month – common among people in irregular or low-paid jobs – this can cause the algorithm to overestimate earnings and drastically shrink their payment. This is not just a technical error; the government deliberately chose this method of calculation because it was easier to automate, increased administrative efficiency, and reduced operational costs.[38]
This design choice has led to people going hungry, falling into debt, and experiencing psychological distress. Although an appeals court ordered the government to fix the flaw for a limited number of claimants in June 2020, reports of similar errors persist.[39]
 III. Countering Fraud
To help prevent and investigate benefits fraud, some government agencies are using automated decision-making to assign scores to people predicting how likely they are to commit fraud. One of the more prominent examples is Systeem Risico Indicatie or SyRI in the Netherlands, an automated program developed to score people based on their risk of engaging in benefits and tax fraud.[40] The government experimented with variations of SyRI’s technology as early as 2006, and passed a law authorizing the program in 2014.[41] Although the government discontinued SyRI in April 2020, it offers a cautionary tale about the dangers of risk-scoring tools.

SyRI’s secret algorithm assigned risk scores based on an analysis of personal and sensitive data collected by various government agencies, such as employment records, benefits information, personal debt reports and education and housing histories.[42] When SyRI profiled an individual as a fraud risk, it notified the relevant government agency, which had up to two years to open an investigation into possible criminal behavior or illegal acts.
SyRI, which the government used to profile residents in predominantly low-income neighborhoods, drew widespread criticism for discriminating against poorer people and racial minorities.[43] On February 5, 2020, a Netherlands court held that the lack of transparency about SyRI’s risk calculation algorithm made it impossible for people to challenge their risk scores, violating their right to privacy.[44] Two months later, the government announced that it would not appeal the ruling, and halted the use of SyRI.[45] However, civil society groups have raised alarm about a bill in Parliament that would authorize data sharing between public authorities and the private sector to detect fraud and potentially revive the use of risk scoring.[46]    
 4. How else are governments using automation to allocate social security support? 
Some governments are using scoring tools to assess the employment prospects of job seekers, and to offer job support measures (such as publicly financed apprenticeships or training courses) based on these predictions. But whether a person will find a job is contingent on complex and highly subjective factors such as their health, educational background, and interpersonal skills. Trying to reduce these factors into a single, individualized score can deny people support they need, and intensify discrimination in the labor market.   
In Austria, the Public Employment Service (Arbeitsmarktservice or “AMS”) uses an algorithm to predict a job seeker’s employment prospects based on factors such as gender, age group, citizenship, health, occupation, and work experience.[47] AMS prioritizes access to its services – such as job search assistance, job placement and training schemes – for job seekers with moderate employment prospects. At the same time, it reduces AMS support to job seekers with low or high employment prospects, reasoning that such support would have a negligible effect on their hiring chances.
The government contends that job seekers with low prospects require different kinds of intervention to “stabilize their personal situation and strengthen their motivation.” They are redirected to another government agency that specializes in helping people in “crisis situations” that prevent sustainable employment, such as addiction, debt, and family problems.[48]

Academics and civil society groups have found that the algorithm discounts people’s employability when they are women over age 30, women with childcare obligations, are migrants, or have disabilities.[49] Misclassifying people from these groups and limiting them to crisis-oriented support is discriminatory, and could undermine their ability to find and maintain a job and enjoy their right to an adequate standard of living.
The algorithm can also discriminate against people in subtler ways. For example, the algorithm factors the employment rates where the job seeker lives into its prediction of their hiring chances.[50] Since lower employment rates in some areas of the country may be linked to discrimination against racial or ethnic minorities, this seemingly harmless variable can put them at a disadvantage.   
In May 2014, Poland’s Ministry of Labor and Social Policy began using an automated profiling tool that categorized job seekers into three categories: 1) job seekers with appropriate professional qualifications and interpersonal skills; 2) job seekers “requiring support” because their professional skills are limited or outdated; and 3) job seekers that are “distant from the labor market.”[51]
The digital rights nongovernmental organization Fundacja Panoptykon found that the government provided scant employment resources to job seekers in the third category, cutting them off from critical job support measures such as publicly financed apprenticeships, childcare reimbursement, and training courses. Job seekers in the third category were disproportionately likely to be women, older people, people with disabilities, and people with little or no formal education. In 2019, the country’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the government’s use of job seekers’ personal data to profile them was unconstitutional, because it was done without legislative approval.[52] In December that year, the government discontinued the profiling tool.
 
Part II: The EU AI regulation
5. How is the regulation’s risk-based approach to regulating AI systems expected to work? 
The regulation outlines a four-tiered approach to regulating risks posed by AI systems, with different rules applying to each level of risk. The categories are:

A ban on “unacceptable risk” (article 5):[53] The regulation deems certain types of social scoring and biometric surveillance to be an “unacceptable” risk to privacy, nondiscrimination, and related human rights. Public authorities are banned from scoring people’s “trustworthiness” in one aspect of their lives (e.g. their ability to repay debt) to justify “detrimental or unfavourable treatment” in another, unrelated context (e.g. denying them the right to travel).[54] Scoring people’s trustworthiness to justify “detrimental and unfavourable treatment … that is unjustified and disproportionate to their social behaviour or its gravity” is also prohibited.

The regulation also imposes a partial ban on law enforcement uses of “‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems” in publicly accessible spaces (such as facial recognition cameras in train stations that continuously monitor whether the faces of passers-by match anyone on a watch list).[55] It would, however, permit their use in a troublingly broad range of situations – such as when they are “strictly necessary” to discharge specific law enforcement functions such as finding missing children, preventing terrorist attacks, or identifying the suspect for a criminal offense punishable by a detention sentence of three years or more.[56]  It requires judicial authorization for such use, except in emergency situations.

“High-risk” AI systems (articles 6 and 7): The regulation designates an expansive list of AI systems as “high-risk” that would require extra safeguards to deploy.[57] These systems include those used to identify and categorize people based on their biometric data (such as Ireland’s facial recognition checks on people applying for identity cards), and manage access to social security benefits and other social services (such as France’s housing benefit calculation algorithm).

Other “high-risk” systems include automated hiring software used to sort through CVs and recruit workers, and law enforcement tools that predict a person’s risk of committing a criminal offense. At the heart of regulation is the provision that “high-risk” systems are required to comply with a series of risk mitigation “requirements,” which outline the types of information that should be kept and disclosed about a system, safeguards against bias and error, and measures to ensure human oversight, accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.[58]   

Limited-risk AI systems (article 52):[59] These systems include “biometric categorization,” emotion recognition, and deep fake systems.[60] These do not require the same procedures as high-risk systems. The EU’s advisory body on data protection has defined biometric categorization as the process of “establishing whether the biometric data of an individual belongs to a group with some predefined characteristic in order to take a specific action” – for example, “an advertising display may show different adverts depending on the individual that is looking at it based on the age or gender.”[61]

Providers and users of limited-risk systems have far fewer obligations than those that develop and sell “high-risk” AI systems. For example, a company that sells intelligent advertising displays is required only to make sure that these displays notify people exposed to them that they are “interacting with an AI system.”[62] A department store that uses these displays needs to make sure that customers exposed to them are aware of their operation. The regulation, however, lets law enforcement off the hook from even these minimal notification requirements when they use this type of system to detect and prevent crime.

Minimal-risk AI systems are all other systems not covered by the regulation’s requirements and safeguards.[63]  

 6. Does the regulation prevent government agencies from scoring or profiling people applying for benefits or job support?   
It is unclear. The regulation’s ban on “trustworthiness” scoring appears to have originally been designed to prevent public authorities from deploying “general purpose” scoring systems – a dystopian future where our lives are reduced to a single social score that controls whether we can board a plane, get a loan, or take certain jobs.[64]  
But if the ban is limited to only such “general purpose” scoring systems, then it would fail to capture the reality of current scoring practices or their harm. The fraud detection software previously used in the Netherlands and the employment profiling algorithm in Austria, for example, are more limited in scope. Nevertheless, they can still have devastating human rights consequences, such as when they incorrectly flag people as a fraud risk or deny them the support they need to find a job.  
 7. Does the regulation ban the use of facial recognition to screen people who apply for social security support? 
No, since current applications of facial recognition to verify the identity of people who apply for welfare benefits – such as Ireland’s registration process for Public Services Cards – do not appear to involve the real-time collection and analysis of facial images in public spaces. Instead, the regulation would classify this use, and most other forms of automated decision-making about social security benefits, as “high-risk” systems subject to heightened safeguards.
 8. The bulk of the regulation’s safeguards falls on “providers” of welfare technology rather than the agencies that simply use them. Why does this matter?
This unequal distribution of regulatory burden means that harm caused by technologies bought “off-the-shelf"" are not regulated as well, even when they are just as severe as those caused by bespoke software.
If a social security agency designs its own software for assessing whether benefit applicants are a fraud risk, they would be a “provider” of a “high-risk” AI system.[65] As a result, the agency is required to comply with risk mitigation requirements, such as disclosing when they began or stopped using the software, and establishing procedures that enable staff to override and correct software errors.
But the same agency would be considered a software “user” rather than a provider if they purchase the risk scoring tool off-the-shelf.[66] This would free them from disclosing their reliance on the tool, and give them broad discretion to outsource their oversight responsibilities to the software provider itself, or a third party.[67]
This discrepancy owes to the regulation’s assumption that providers are best placed to forecast, identify, and mitigate the main harms that stem from the systems they create. But this is not always true. In public-private partnerships to deliver social services, for example, public authorities bear ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the software they use protects rights. 
 9. Will the proposed regulation protect people who apply for or receive social security support from algorithmic discrimination?
The regulation mandates providers to examine the data they use to develop “high-risk” systems for biases, gaps, and shortcomings, but these safeguards fail to grapple with the root causes of algorithmic discrimination.
The discriminatory effects of Austria’s employment profiling algorithm, for example, are not merely due to the biased inferences it draws from labor market data about the job prospects of women, people with disabilities, and caregivers. The broader purpose of the algorithm is also suspect. According to one study, austerity policies are “one of the main drivers” of the algorithm:[68]

“While the initial goal was to serve a growing number of jobseekers with a stagnating budget, the ... algorithm was later seen as a means for budget cuts by the then responsible Ministry of Social Affairs.” 

The algorithm helps to legitimize those cuts by reinforcing the narrative that people with poor job prospects are “unstable and unmotivated” and undeserving of the state’s investments in job seekers. The appearance of mathematical objectivity obscures the messier reality that people’s job prospects are shaped by structural factors beyond their control, such as disparate access to education and job opportunities.
Centering the rights of low-income people early in the design process is critical, since correcting human rights harm once a system goes live is exponentially harder. In the UK, the defective algorithm used to calculate people’s Universal Credit benefits is still causing people to suffer erratic fluctuations and reductions in their payments, despite a court ruling in 2020 ordering the government to fix some of these errors.[69] The government has also resisted broader changes to the algorithm, arguing that these would be too costly and burdensome to implement.[70]  
A more holistic due diligence process should transcend questions of technical bias and examine the human rights implications of automating essential government functions. Algorithmic impact assessments should probe whether a government’s attempt to automate access to social security support could result in an overall reduction in people’s benefits, or a disproportionate reduction for vulnerable and marginalized groups. These assessments should also examine whether the use of technology imposes more restrictive conditions on access and eligibility (for example, by making it more difficult for people with low digital literacy to provide proof of their identity or submit an online application).
 10. Will the regulation’s transparency requirements help us know more about how governments use AI in social security administration? 
The regulation is a step in the right direction, but loopholes are likely to prevent meaningful transparency. The regulation would create a centralized database of high-risk AI systems developed and used in the EU.[71] This is a measure that will help people understand how their government is automating public services. Notably, however, the database only publishes generic details about the status of an automated system, such as whether it’s active or discontinued, and in which EU countries the system is active.[72] Disaggregated data critical to the public’s understanding of a system’s impact, such as the specific government agencies using it, dates of service, and what the system is being used for, will not be available. In other words, the database might tell you that a company in Ireland is selling fraud risk scoring software in France, but not which French agencies or companies are using the software, and how long they have been using it.      
Buried in the regulation’s dense language are key exemptions from disclosure requirements that could hinder transparency and accountability for AI systems, creating grave risks to rights. Notably, the regulation provides significant exemptions for law enforcement and migration control authorities. For example, providers are supposed to disclose “electronic instructions for use” that explain the underlying logic of how a system operates or makes decisions, such as the source code for the algorithms tasked with calculating benefits.[73] But the regulation states that the information “shall not be provided in the areas of law enforcement and migration, asylum and border control management.”[74] As a result, it is likely that critically important information about a broad range of law enforcement technologies that could impact human rights, including criminal risk assessment tools and “crime analytics” software that parse large datasets to detect patterns of suspicious behavior, would remain secret.
There is a risk that this broadly drafted exception will be applied to automated social security systems that also serve a law enforcement purpose. Anti-fraud systems have been designed to flag potential benefits fraud and can trigger criminal investigations. In The Netherlands, immigration authorities, the police, and prosecutors were authorized to request people’s SyRI scores in pursuit of an investigation.[75] The UK’s Department for Work and Pensions, the country’s welfare agency, relies on commercially developed risk scoring software to detect and investigate benefits-related offenses.[76] The regulation could restrict transparency about how tools like these are programmed to make decisions.
 11. Will the proposed regulation’s requirements on human oversight protect people from the failures of welfare automation?
The regulation superficially acknowledges the importance of oversight measures that enable people to understand and override a system’s flawed decisions, but fails to set standards that address real-world obstacles to this goal.
The proposal omits a provision from a previous draft that would have allowed people to “decide not to use the high-risk AI system or its outputs in any particular situation without any reason to fear negative consequences.”[77] Professor Valerio Di Stefano, an expert on the automation of work, points out that this lack of “explicit workplace protection” could have a chilling effect on human oversight, since workers (such as those working in social security agencies) might hesitate to exercise their formal authority to override a system’s outputs without safeguards against retaliation or disciplinary action. [78]
Also missing from the regulation is a deliberative process that involves workers responsible for oversight in the design and implementation of AI systems, as well as training and resource requirements that support them in exercising oversight.[79] These gaps not only create a problematic work environment but also threaten the rights of people they are supposed to safeguard. In France, the Mediapart investigation found that caseworkers were experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety because they were struggling to fix software errors that caused erratic reductions and fluctuations in people’s benefit payments.[80] These problems mirror those experienced by Universal Credit staff, some of whom told The Guardian in 2018 that they were slow or unable to fix social security payment delays or errors that people reported because of confusing or overly prescriptive official guidance.[81]
Even though agencies using AI systems serve as a critical backstop against flawed automation, the regulation does not extend oversight requirements to them. The outsourcing of identity verification checks in the United States shows how this loophole could harm human rights. State unemployment agencies across the country are using a commercial platform to verify the identity of people applying for jobless benefits, and relying on the provider to correct verification errors.[82] Many of these agencies do not provide a clear or timely appeals process for benefit errors or denials, or offline alternatives to verify. This creates a single point of failure in the identity verification process, forcing people who are unable to resolve verification issues with the provider to abandon their application altogether. Extending oversight requirements to both providers and the agencies using them gives people directly affected by software errors and other flaws multiple pathways for redress.
 12. Who will hold providers of welfare technology accountable to the regulation’s safeguards?
For most “high-risk” social security systems, such as means-testing algorithms and case management software, the regulation allows providers to assess whether their systems are consistent with the regulation’s limited rights protections (a process defined as a “conformity assessment procedure based on internal control”).[83] Once they sign off on their own systems (by submitting a “declaration of conformity”), they are free to put them on the EU market.[84]
This embrace of self-regulation means that there will be little opportunity for civil society, the general public, and people directly affected by the automation of social security administration to participate in the design and implementation of these systems. The regulation also does not provide people who are denied benefits because of software errors a direct course of action against the provider, or any other means of redress. The government agencies responsible for regulatory compliance in their country could take corrective action against the software or halt its operation, but the regulation does not grant directly affected individuals the right to submit an appeal to these agencies.[85]
For social security and employment systems with biometric capabilities, such as anti-fraud checks that require beneficiaries to verify their identity using facial recognition, providers can also sign off on their own systems provided they follow “harmonised standards” that govern the technology.[86] These standards translate high-level EU rules that range from safety to accessibility, and environmental impact to concrete technical instructions on how to bring products and services up to code. The harmonized standard on the accessibility of information and communications technology products, for example, requires providers to include design features that are responsive to the needs of users who are deaf and blind.[87]
These harmonized standards are to be developed by privately run nonprofit associations known as European Standardization Organizations.[88] According to EU technology policy experts, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) are the most likely candidates to distill the regulation into harmonized standards.[89] In anticipation of this role, both organizations have set up a joint committee dedicated to developing European standards on AI.[90]
The complex process of proposing, amending, and approving standards is generally controlled by CEN and CENELEC members, comprising the national standards bodies of the 27 EU countries, the United Kingdom, Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.[91] Civil society participation is largely confined to a trio of European organizations representing consumers, workers, and environmental interests.[92]
Human rights and civil society groups can partner with these organizations to influence the standardization process, but some have raised concern that they have neither the technical know-how nor the resources to participate.[93] It is also unclear whether harmonized standards – which are voluntary and non-binding in principle, but could attract widespread adoption in practice – can be challenged in court.  
THE EU AI ACT: WHO SIGNS OFF ON AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEMS?

 13. Can a member state establish its own rules to make up for the regulation’s shortcomings and protect rights?  
Generally, no. The regulation lays down a single set of rules for developing, marketing, and using AI systems; member states cannot impose their own rules “unless explicitly authorized by the Regulation.”[94] If a member state requires providers of employment profiling software to disclose which government agencies they are doing business with, the latter could resist this mandate, arguing that it conflicts with the regulation's more limited transparency requirements. Member states may counter that their own rules are needed to protect rights, but the European Court of Justice has set a high bar for such claims.[95] This inflexible design makes it even more critical for the EU to ensure that the regulation incorporates the strongest possible protections for rights.
 
PART III: Recommendations
 
 14. How can the EU strengthen its ban on systems that pose “unacceptable risk”? 
The starting point of AI regulation should be consistent with relevant human rights standards. In some cases, this will require a clear prohibition on AI applications that threaten rights in ways that cannot be effectively mitigated.
The current proposal to ban some types of “trustworthiness” scoring over a “certain period of time” is vague and impossible to meaningfully implement.[96] Instead, the regulation should prohibit any type of behavioral scoring that unduly restricts or has a negative impact on human rights, including the rights to social security, an adequate standard of living, privacy, and non-discrimination. For example, scoring systems that try to predict whether people are a fraud risk based on records of their past behavior, or serve as a pretext for regressive social security cuts, should be banned. 
More broadly, the regulation should codify a strong presumption against the use of algorithms to delay or deny access to benefits. To prevent government agencies from outsourcing harmful scoring practices, the ban should apply to both public authorities and private actors.      
 15. How can the EU ensure that the regulation deals with emerging threats? 
The EU should design a system of checks and balances that promptly identifies and addresses human rights concerns with AI applications as they arise. Policymakers are understandably focused on the “unacceptable risks” created by behavioral manipulation, social scoring, and “real-time” biometric identification; systems that the regulation bans in some instances. But this limited catalog of “unacceptable risks” is unlikely to capture every threat that the fast-moving and ever-changing field of AI will pose to human rights.
To ensure that the regulation is responsive to human rights concerns that policymakers cannot foresee, the EU should establish a mechanism for proposing and making additions to the list of systems that pose “unacceptable risk,” and a clear and inclusive process for public and civil society participation in such amendments. There should also be a process for upgrading “high-risk” systems to “unacceptable risk” systems, particularly if the deployment of these systems creates unnecessary or disproportionate restrictions on rights.
 16. How can the EU ensure that “high-risk” systems comply with human rights standards? 
The regulation should mandate human rights impact assessments throughout the entire life cycle of “high-risk” systems. During the design and procurement phases of an AI system, these assessments could expose human rights risks that may otherwise elude existing risk management processes, such as bias testing or data protection assessments. To ensure that these assessments are meaningful, Human Rights Watch recommends the following amendments:  
I. Procurement, Design, and Modification

Require users to conduct and publish human rights impact assessments prior to deploying or procuring “high-risk” AI systems, identifying how the system could protect or violate human rights, and the means to prevent or mitigate human rights risks;
Require these assessments for “substantial modifications” of the AI system that create or amplify human rights risks (for example, modifying the means-testing or risk scoring criteria of an automated system);[97]
For AI systems that are integrated into welfare and social protection programs, ensure that these assessments incorporate an analysis of the system’s benefits and risks to people living in or near the poverty line, such as whether the introduction of the system lowers overall benefit levels or the availability of benefits to informal workers and other groups historically underserved by social security measures; 
Address the obstacles that people with low digital literacy or unreliable internet access might face throughout the life cycle of an AI system, from applying for social security measures to understanding or challenging an automated decision;   
Require government providers and users to provide opportunities to participate in procurement, design, or relevant modification processes, such as through public hearings, notice and comment procedures, and consultations and testing with directly affected stakeholders, such as welfare case workers and beneficiaries; and
Establish a duty on users to consult relevant public bodies, such as equality bodies and national human rights institutions before deploying “high-risk” AI systems.  

II. Post-Deployment 

Once a system is deployed, require providers to publicly disclose the results of bias audits and subsequent corrective action;
Require regulatory inspections that assess the human rights impact of “high-risk” systems with reference to their organizational and social context, such as the training, resources, and protections provided to workers operating or overseeing these systems, or the socioeconomic factors that make it difficult for people to access, understand, or challenge an AI system;[98]
Require the creation of an independent oversight body at the national level that is responsible for conducting regulatory inspections;  
Establish a flagging mechanism that gives the public the right to request that the independent oversight body investigate an AI system within its jurisdiction for compliance with human rights standards, including whether human rights impact assessments were adequately performed;
Adequately staff and resource independent oversight bodies to perform inspections and investigations, ensuring that they have human rights expertise; and
Require providers or users of systems that consistently fail bias audits or regulatory inspections to cease providing or using these systems.

III. Transparency

Clarify that the publication of “electronic instructions for use” of AI systems under Annex VIII requires the publication of all previous and current versions of the source code;
Remove blanket exemptions to the publication of “electronic instructions for use” in Article 51, Annex VIII, permitting redactions only when necessary and proportionate to a legitimate government aim; and
Require agencies or other entities using these systems to publish information about their use of “high-risk” AI systems, including their organizational name, the start and end dates of use, and the specific purpose for which they are using these systems (e.g. the specific benefits program for which they are using the system, and the specific tasks assigned to the system).

IV. Oversight  

Require the development of whistleblower mechanisms and other anti-retaliation safeguards that protect workers when they override or otherwise challenge an automated decision;
Ensure that public authorities do not leverage the introduction of automated systems to justify reductions in government staff that end up hindering their ability to operate and oversee these systems; and  
Require public authorities to provide appropriate training and resources to support staff in operating and overseeing an AI system.

V. Remedy and Compliance

Establish a right to appeal decisions facilitated by an automated system; and
Impose fines and other penalties for non-compliance with human rights impact assessments and other risk mitigation requirements, taking into account the nature and severity of the regulatory non-compliance.

[27] Although the UK is not a member of the EU, the regulation will affect how UK providers design automated systems that they want to place on the EU market. The UK also remains a member of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC). According to technology policy experts, the CEN and CENELEC will be responsible for developing technical standards that implement key requirements of the EU AI regulation. All CEN and CENELEC members, including the UK, “commit to adopt identically European Standards and withdraw national conflicting standards” – in this case, standards that govern the design and upkeep of automated systems that are provided to the EU market. See “CEN and CENELEC General Assemblies agreed new governance arrangements that will provide a category of full membership for British Member BSI,” CEN and CENELEC, June 24, 2021, https://www.cencenelec.eu/news-and-events/news/2021/briefnews/2021-06-24-full-membership-bsi/.

When it came to the proportion of all job openings that were linked to artificial intelligence, related job postings rose in September 2021, with 2.9% of newly posted job advertisements being linked to the topic.
This latest figure was an increase compared to the 2.5% of newly advertised jobs that were linked to artificial intelligence in the equivalent month a year ago.
Artificial intelligence is one of the topics that GlobalData, from whom our data for this article is taken, have identified as being a key disruptive force facing companies in the coming years. Companies that excel and invest in these areas now are thought to be better prepared for the future business landscape and better equipped to survive unforeseen challenges.

Probably the most obvious examples of this success can be found in consumer-facing internet businesses like Google, Amazon, Netflix, or Facebook.
Landing AI: Unlocking The Power Of Data-Centric Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock

Over the last two decades, companies such as these have grown into some of the world's largest and most powerful corporations. In many ways, their growth can be put down to their exposure to the ever-growing volumes of data being churned out by our increasingly digitized society.

But if AI is going to unlock the truly world-changing value that many believe it will – rather than simply making some very smart people in Silicon Valley very rich – then businesses in other industries have to consider different approaches. Companies in, for example, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, or logistics simply are not going to have millions (or billions) of people signing up to freely share volumes of data, in the way that they do with Google or Facebook – the models of interaction between consumers and the businesses are completely different.

PROMOTED
For the last decade, it’s generally been assumed that AI – and in particular, deep learning, which relies on complex deep neural networks – requires enormous volumes of data in order to surface the insights needed for genuine transformation. But what if we could get insights from smaller volumes of data?

This is the starting point taken by Dr. Andrew Ng with his current venture, Landing AI. Ng will need no introduction to those familiar with the recent history of AI. For the benefit of those who aren’t, he was the founder of Google’s deep learning research group, Google Brain, and chief scientist at Baidu’s Artificial Intelligence Group. He also co-founded the online learning portal Coursera, is a former director of Stanford University's AI Lab, and is widely considered a pioneer in the field of AI – in particular, deep learning.

Having played a leading role in integrating AI into some of the industries where it is obviously proving highly transformational, with Landing AI he decided to shift focus to some of the areas where its impact is yet to be fully felt. There’s a good reason for this, he believes – and it’s down to the heterogeneous nature of operations. Once you move beyond the world of public-facing consumer web services, industry is no longer built around homogenous infrastructure staples – web browsers, cloud servers, mobile apps, and a small number of standard operating systems. This means that “plugging in” AI-as-a-service solutions becomes less straightforward, and the customization that's necessary becomes expensive.

 The solution? Focus on the data, rather than the models and the technology, he tells me, when we got together recently for a conversation.
""I think machine learning has transformed the consumer software companies"", Ng says. ""Google and Baidu have AI teams, also Microsoft, Facebook – but once you look into other industries, candidly, I'm not seeing the potential value of AI being realized yet today.”

Shortly after deciding to take his mission to unlock the value of AI to legacy industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture, Ng realized that perhaps he had been, in his own words, “a little naive.”
“That recipe that a lot of us had collectively built at [internet companies] – that recipe doesn’t work at all these other industries.
“So at Landing AI, one of the things we've been doing is working out that recipe … I'm excited about that; it's a big thing that those of us in AI have to figure out.""
To start with, Ng and the rest of the team at Landing AI are focusing their efforts on the manufacturing sector. In order to do this, they have just completed a series A funding round, raising $57 million from investors, including industrial IoT-focused fund McRock Capital, as well as Insight Partners, Intel Capital, and Samsung Investment Fund.
It has just unveiled its manufacturing-focused MLOps platform, LandingLens, which applies computer vision to the problem of visually detecting defects during the manufacturing process.
Due to the heterogeneous nature of manufacturing, Ng tells me, ""One of the things that excites me is taking tools that exist like supervised learning, and building the platforms that make it possible for there to be thousands or tens of thousands of unique neural networks for manufacturing.
“I think this is an AI-wide problem – take healthcare for example – every hospital has a slightly different way of coding their records, so you can’t have a single monolithic neural network to process every single hospital record.”
Due to the current setup of the AI industry, this can often lead to situations where AI vendor companies need to do a huge amount of customization, effectively becoming consulting companies rather than platform and service providers capable of operating at scale.
“My challenge is how can I help maybe 10,000 companies build and deploy machine learning models without having to grow Landing AI to have 10,000 machine learning engineers to do all this customization?
“The only solution is to build vertical platforms, which is what Landing AI is doing … platforms that are fast and easy … to enable the manufacturers’ [workforce] to be able to train and deploy their own AI systems, so we can then collectively tackle this very heterogeneous world of manufacturing and other industry sectors.""
At the heart of the solution is a new, “data-centric” approach to tackling the challenges faced by these industries.
Ng tells me, “Here’s the idea … for a lot of applications, the code, or the neural network software, is basically a solved problem.
“The open-source thing that someone can download off the internet, from Github, works just fine. But what’s needed is to engineer the right dataset to feed into that open-source neural net AI model to then get the performance that you want.”
The challenge, therefore, is to get very high-quality data to train the AI – rather than simply high volumes of data. In order for this to work, the domain knowledge of experts working in the field becomes essential.
“If we can provide state of the art, cutting-edge neural net architectures that provide unique tools to help domain experts express their knowledge … is this discoloration in an LCD panel acceptable or not acceptable? What is a scratch versus a dent versus a piece of dirt that can be blown away? If we can provide tools to help a manufacturing plant express this domain knowledge by generating and labeling precise data, I think that's a very doable task for a manufacturing organization, and it allows these powerful systems to be created, deployed, and maintained.""
This is clearly a step away from the software-centric development that has been the driving force behind the rollout of AI and deep learning in consumer software and applications. A step away from “big data”, perhaps, towards “good data” that accurately summarises the information needed to achieve insights.
Another big advantage of this approach is the fact that it’s achieved by leveraging the talent that companies already have – domain experts – rather than relying on workers specifically trained in AI system architecture and deployment, which we all know are in short supply.
From my own observations, working with companies in many industries to deploy data solutions, it’s clear that a lot of effort is still involved when it comes to customizing machine learning and AI tools to work with existing legacy systems.
Landing AI’s approach is to enable this customization to be automated by leveraging expert knowledge already within organizations to focus on the data rather than the coding, modeling, and algorithms. It certainly has the potential to play a part in rolling out AI adoption in industries where, although there is certainly an appetite for change, challenges around scaling and skills have meant many organizations have achieved only limited success.

Which areas of the country are hiring the most artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning experts? If you look at the data, some of the nation’s biggest tech hubs also have the biggest hunger for A.I. talent—perhaps no surprise, given all the local companies that want to seed A.I. into their products and services.   
As you can see from the following chart, generated from data in CompTIA’s latest job report, employers in Texas cities are on the hunt for artificial intelligence talent, joining New York City, Silicon Valley, Boston, Seattle, and Chicago. Check out the full chart:   
  
The prevalence of Texas is no surprise when you consider how many companies have recently set down roots in Austin, Dallas, and Houston, attracted by those metro areas' growing tech scene and favorable taxes. For example, Tesla recently announced that it would move its corporate headquarters to Austin.  
Responding to a survey by Blind (which anonymously surveys technologists) in 2020, some 29 percent of technology professionals said that Texas was “the next Silicon Valley” and that they planned to move, versus the 36 percent who said that “Silicon Valley will always be the tech hub” (and that they’re staying). Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Oracle, and dozens of other tech companies large and small have opened new facilities and factories in cities across the state—and they’re evidently looking for A.I. talent.  
For those interested in a career working with artificial intelligence, the rewards are potentially vast: O’Reilly pegs the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.); salaries increased an average of 2.25 percent per year. A.I.-related salaries in California averaged $176,000; in Texas, they hit $147,000; and in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Washington, DC, these salaries drifted at around the $150,000 level.    
No matter where you work and live, in other words, you can draw hefty compensation if you know your way around the latest A.I. and machine learning tools. Keep an eye on emerging A.I. trends such as automation and analytics—they could prove good for your career.

To close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and to accelerate advances in artificial intelligence and the sciences, we must encourage and support women on all levels, from the government to enterprise and establish equal employment opportunities for all..Women make up a fraction of the artificial intelligence workforce, whether in the form of research and development or as employees at technology inclined firms. According to the World Economic Forum, &quot;Non-homogeneous teams are more capable than homogenous teams of recognizing their biases and solving issues when interpreting data, testing solutions or making decisions.&quot; In other words, diverse teams and especially those that emphasize women at their epicenter, are a necessary provision for enterprises to adopt, build, realize and accelerate enterprise AI maturity levels. At present, unfortunately, few enterprises understand the criticality of women to boost AI maturity levels..STEM, data science, and AI fields experience a lack of female role models. Without female role models for girls to look up to, it becomes difficult for young women to envision future careers in science, technology, and engineering fields. A 2018 Microsoft survey shows that female STEM role models boost the interest of girls in STEM careers from 32 percent to 52 percent. Therefore, we must showcase the achievements of women in the sciences and engineering across the world to capture the attention of females everywhere..One of the biggest pressures that females face in STEM careers is cutthroat competition amongst male counterparts and the toxic workplace culture that it creates. An HBR article found that three-fourths of female scientists support one another in their workplace to ease tensions. Moreover, women are likely to be demoted as inferior by men holding equivalent positions, whether those jobs are in engineering, data science, or AI. All of these factors contribute to females swiftly dismissing STEM jobs to avoid such disquieting workplace circumstances..According to a survey conducted by BCG, when it comes to STEM, &quot;Women place a higher premium on applied, impact-driven work than men do: 67% of women expressed a clear preference for such work, compared with 61% of men.&quot; This finding highlights a significant fact: women are vastly more likely to pursue STEM roles that provide them with meaning, purpose and produce impactful results, but many women don't perceive this purpose and impact in STEM jobs. Therefore, without a clear high impact-driven pathway insight, females tend to turn their heads on STEM, data science, and AI-related careers..Studies have shown that communication is of the utmost importance when it comes to getting more women involved in STEM careers. According to BCG GAMMA, just 55% of women feel like they know enough about employment opportunities in data science. Furthermore, vague explanations of job qualifications, such as &quot;being strong in data science,&quot; and, conversely, incredibly in-depth job descriptions in search of data wizard talent, tend to steer females clear of STEM-related jobs. Moreover, an HBR study found that female engagement with STEM employers falls far behind men and that this should come as no surprise as, &quot;Given the selection bias that accompanies personal work networks, especially in a young and still male-dominated field.&quot;.It isn't enough to pique the interest of girls and young women to pursue STEM careers: the goal is to maintain, foster, and grow that interest. A study published in the Social Forces journal found that women in STEM are much more likely to abandon their jobs than if they held other careers. More precisely, the study highlights that some 50% of women holding STEM careers left after 12 years on the job, whereas that number dropped to 20% for women in other fields. On average, females tend to distance themselves from STEM after 5 years of industry involvement. But why? According to the same study, &quot;Women with engineering degrees said they left engineering because of lack of advancement or low salary, along with other working conditions.&quot; These facts show that retention of women in the STEM, data science and AI workforce is chief among challenges to address..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The health sector, education sector, business sector, manufacturing sector, and agricultural sector are largely driven by technology. AI has also created many jobs opportunities for common people. There are a lot of debates on AI and robotics about how they are increasingly taking over jobs. As it removes jobs, it also opens various opportunities for people. AI is here to stay and help people work efficiently. AI in worker's rights is very crucial..AI increases productivity in the workplace.All the sectors are trying to bring in AI to help their employees improve their productivity. It helps in solving problems, carrying out complex tasks, and increasing workers' efficiency by eliminating human errors. From information gathering to analyzing it and giving feedback about the same can be done very easily with AI and robots.  For example, many big organizations like Amazon or Flipkart use chat boxes for daily and direct communication with their customers. It is an automatic response system that responses within seconds. This is widely used for timely customer support. This in turn increases productivity and has been very profitable..AI turns complex data into simple illustrations.For every sector, AI in work is very important for analyzing data. Hiring somebody to read and analyze them to provide proper insights is difficult. Good data analytics are very difficult to find. In this case, AI helps in identifying important changes and creating detailed reports that help an organization to analyze its problem and come to the right track. They help in understanding changing customer behavior that might create problems and predict key business strategies that would help the business in the long run..Increases security.The leak of important documents without the knowledge of the employees is a common problem faced by companies nowadays. But with AI a company's data and documents are secured. For example, media giants like Facebook and WhatsApp are using more secure AI technology so that messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted which means messages, calls, or any audio-visual stay between us and the people we choose to disclose..As Artificial intelligence is giving a boost to the working sector, it is also challenging the workers' rights. A lot of workers are losing their jobs due to the inclusion of efficient machinery and technology which in turn is reducing the effectiveness of manpower. Manpower is increasingly being replaced with smart systems and automated functions..AI is more accurate and handles complex tasks than humans.It is the nature of humans to make mistakes. Artificial intelligence on the other hand is not susceptible to errors. They are very accurate in whatever task they perform. Jobs like data entry, typing, data analytics have to be error-free, or else it might result in confusion. AI can take over all these jobs efficiently. Various works in the factories get people seriously injured or killed. AI in this case can be used to keep workers out of danger and finish the work effectively. While machines can also be damaged or destroyed but they are enough to withstand dangers..AI machines are cheaper in the long run.Through the manufacturing cost for machines are higher but the overall operation cost of using machines is much cheaper than paying wages to employees. Running a machine only requires electricity and maintenance but when it comes to workers they need to be trained, given proper salaries and benefits that must be paid out. This is the reason why big companies are investing more in machines than manpower to get maximum benefits in the long run..Even though AI is having a lot of advantages but it still cannot take over jobs. This is because:.Machines lack creative thinking.However great AI may be at carrying tasks but at the end of the day, it is humans who have to think creatively, plan out strategies during the crisis and use their brains for doing the groundwork and important decision making. AI can be a helping hand but cannot successfully run an organization without humans. Any job that requires critical thinking or creative problem solving cannot be replaced by AI..AI cannot build good connections.Business is all about building connections with other organizations and customers. Machines or robots do not have the ability to establish human-to-human trust and connection in order to get people to relax, discuss something and open up. Machines help in technical stuff but lack human intimacy. Machines and robots lack empathy, communication skills, common sense, strategic thinking, and decision-making abilities like humans possess..Human needs to program AI for its smooth functioning.Robots and artificial intelligence are the creation of humans themselves. They cannot function if they are not programmed or charged properly on time. As technology is getting more and more advanced, humans are coming out with better versions of AI. Machines and AI needs to be updated and can replace anytime anywhere depending on their needs. If humans can make it, they can also break it..Therefore, AI along with humans can do wonders in every sector. It is difficult to say whether technology can take over workers' rights or not. Robots taking over humans is an exaggerated fear. However, maintaining a balance between the both would help in taking all the sectors towards its success..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The pace of AI adoption has accelerated during the Covid crisis but the increased rate of adoption is likely to place significant extra demand on computing resources and supporting infrastructure.Appen’s recent State of AI report found that 55 percent of companies had accelerated their AI adoption in 2020 and 67 percent expected to ramp it up further this year. As AI adoption intensifies, overhead costs will become a major consideration and there is a risk these costs could snowball if organizations do not plan ahead. Top of mindThe trend was reinforced by IDC group vice president for AI and Automation Research Ritu Jyoti who said the pandemic had “pushed AI to the top of the corporate agenda, empowering business resilience and relevance.”

AI in the data center; still a work in progress for all but the hyperscalers


While the hyperscalers have the scale and technical nous, deploying AI en masse is still an ongoing effort for most data center operators




He added: “We have now entered the domain of AI-augmented work and decision across all the functional areas of a business. Responsible creation and use of AI solutions that can sense, predict, respond and adapt at speed is an important business imperative.”Jyoti’s comments accompanied publication of IDC estimates that the global AI market will increase by 15.2 percent this year to a value of $341.8 billion. The market is expected to surpass $500 billion by 2024.When it comes to infrastructure, businesses have to adapt and be flexible. This need for flexibility is making cloud, particularly hybrid cloud, the foundation of AI, especially as the need for substantial amounts of data ratchet up. Using hybrid cloud, companies can meet the technology demands of AI at the right cost level for their businesses and their workloads.Infrastructure-as-a–Service (IaaS) gives organizations the ability to use, develop and implement AI without sacrificing performance. But there are a number of infrastructure elements that organizations need to bear in mind when evaluating potential IaaS providers.1 Computing performanceBusinesses need access to significant performance computing resources, including CPUs and GPUs, to fully take advantage of the opportunities presented by AI. Machine learning algorithms require speed and performance to transact a huge number of calculations. While a CPU-based environment can handle basic AI workloads, deep learning involves multiple large data sets and the capability to deploy scalable neural network algorithms.CPU-based computing might not be able to meet those objectives and GPUs could be a better option. The greater performance provided by GPUs can significantly accelerate deep learning compared to CPUs. But that speed comes at a higher cost and in some instances it may not be cost-effective to switch from CPU to GPU. It is important to get the right balance for the required tasks.2 Storage capacityThe ability to scale storage as data volumes grow is fundamental for many businesses. Organizations need to ascertain what types of storage they need and there are a number of factors to consider, including the level of AI they plan to use and whether they need to make real-time decisions. For example, a FinTech company using AI systems for real-time trading decisions may need fast all-flash storage technology, while other companies could be better served by larger capacity but less rapid storage. Businesses need to calculate how much data their AI applications will generate because AI applications make better decisions when they are exposed to more data. Databases grow over time so companies need to monitor their storage capacity and plan properly for expansion. 3 Networking infrastructureNetworking is another key component of AI infrastructure. Good, fast and reliable networks are essential to maximise the delivery of results. Deep learning algorithms are highly dependent on communications, so networks need to keep pace with demand as AI efforts expand. Scalability is a high priority and AI requires a high-bandwidth, low-latency network. It is important to ensure the service wrap and technology stack are consistent for all regions.  4 SecurityAI can involve handling sensitive data such as patient records, financial information and personal data, so it is imperative the infrastructure is secured end-to-end with state-of-the-art technology. It goes without saying that a data breach would be a disaster for any organization but with AI any infusion of bad data could cause the system to make incorrect inferences, leading to flawed decisions.5 Keep it cost-effectiveAs AI models become more complex, they become more expensive to run, so it’s critical to get extra performance from the infrastructure to keep costs under control. As companies increase their use of AI, they will place heavier burdens on the network, server and storage infrastructures.  Businesses need to make careful choices and identify IaaS providers that can offer cost-effective dedicated servers as a means to boost performance and to enable them to continue investing in AI without increasing their budget.What IaaS providers can doOrganizations looking to deploy AI services must ensure they have the right foundations in place to support them. Any IaaS provider needs to be able to deliver the right infrastructure for customers building their services on AI.The onus is on IaaS providers to:constantly investigate and invest in the latest CPU and GPU technology because this is key to deploying successful AI workloads;improve networks for greater speed and delivery;use automation to deliver a large percentage of their service to speed up the time to action for clients;improve performance by utilising automation tools to monitor their system and to use the most efficient routes.

“Do you think you know me better?”This is the question British artist Gillian Wearing asks at the end of her five-minute-long video work Wearing, Gillian (2018), produced in collaboration with the advertising agency Wieden + Kennedy. To create the work, Wearing used an artificial intelligence (AI) technique known as deepfaking to superimpose her face onto those of actors, essentially using her likeness as a mask.Deepfaking is an AI technology that aims at synthesizing videos of faces by transferring the speech of one subject into the facial animation of another. This is achieved by separating the facial appearance from the lip movements and facial expressions associated with the spoken words in video. One of the earliest plausible examples was a fake video of President Barack Obama, created by researchers at the University of Washington in 2017. Wearing employed deepfake technology to explore the masquerade of identity and selfhood, and to highlight the potentially concerning impacts of AI, namely the spread of disinformation and the increasing inability to trust the authenticity of what we see.While Wearing’s practice does not center on technology in itself, Wearing, Gillian is an example of how AI can be used to create art—something with which more artists have been experimenting. But even when deepfaking is not the specific technique used, this question of identity and authenticity comes up time and again when we consider what the future could be like when AI contributes more significantly to the generation of content.Since the development of the first digital computer in the 1940s, scientists have pushed the limits of what computers can do. Capable of carrying out complex undertakings, computer technology is now being infused with various abilities—such as learning, perception, language use, and reasoning (known collectively as AI)—that facilitate the automation of tasks that were once only accomplishable by humans.Now that AI capabilities are permeating areas previously exclusive to human creativity, such as art, music, and cinematography, it is natural to ask: What will be the future of art in an AI-driven society? This is something that artists such as Trevor Paglen, whose work focuses on looking at parts of the world that are otherwise out of sight, have begun to investigate in depth through their practice. “Over the last ten years or so, powerful algorithms and artificial intelligence networks have enabled computers to ‘see’ autonomously,” Paglen wrote in 2017. “What does it mean that ‘seeing’ no longer requires a human ‘seer’ in the loop?”Most AI tools come pretrained and preloaded with tens of thousands of images, videos, and sounds, and because AI programs are developed by humans, they are inevitably impacted by biases that have developed from our assumptions, expectations, and societal norms. This is where the question of identity and authenticity comes into play for artists who are experimenting with the technology. If an artist’s work is influenced by anything other than their own creative process, is their artistic identity compromised? How can the individuality of the artists come through when more than one artist is using the same AI technology? And if the AI is already trained with certain imagery, is the artist’s role reduced to curating the outcomes of such AI?Understanding the role of the artist is fundamental in accepting AI as an artistic medium. A similar issue appeared in art history before, in the late 19th century with the emergence of photography. In his book Art and Photography (1968), Aaron Scharf highlights a French court case from 1861, brought by photographers Léopold Mayer and Pierre-Louis Pierson against other photographers pirating their prints, that explored whether photography can be protected by copyright as art. Scharf comments, “For photography to be considered an art it became necessary to settle the question of whether or not it was possible for the photographer to manipulate his medium in the way that a painter could his.”Does an AI program preloaded with content ultimately permit an artist to manipulate the medium in a way that allows the expression of their individual identity? There have been incidents in which artists from opposite sides of the globe, using the same AI program, generated almost exactly the same works and disputed their attribution. In my work at Playform, an AI tool designed for making art, I’ve found that this is the most significant concern artists have around incorporating AI into their practice.What’s more, the AI could have generated the same exact result randomly without the artist. At Rutgers University’s Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, we developed AICAN, an AI program with enough knowledge of artistic styles and aesthetics to generate its own images. AICAN’s works have been exhibited globally and have even sold at auctions. A study that my colleagues and I conducted several years ago found that people could not distinguish artworks created by AI from those created by contemporary artists. Seventy-five percent of the time, people thought that works by AICAN had been produced by humans.Fortunately, with advances in AI, it is now possible to use AI as a creative tool without preloaded content restricting artistic expression. Some artist-centered platforms, such as Playform, allow users to train their own AI from scratch, making the case of their individual identity unquestionable. Due to the nature of the medium itself, however, there will always remain biases that we may never fully understand.As for how AI will ultimately shape the future of art-making—we’ll have to wait and see.See Wearing’s work in the exhibition Gillian Wearing: Wearing Masks, on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, through April 4, 2022.

Google said it wouldn’t renew the contract and announced guiding principles for future AI projects that forbid work on weapons and surveillance projects “violating internationally accepted norms.”At the same time, Google made clear it would still seek defense contracts. “While we are not developing AI for use in weapons,” CEO Sundar Pichai wrote, “we will continue our work with governments and the military in many other areas.”In the three years since, Google has stayed true to his word. The company has built a significant line of business atop deep relationships with defense and intelligence agencies, including a series of contracts that haven’t drawn the same scrutiny or outcry as Project Maven.Trending NowRE:WIRED 2021: The mRNA Revolution: COVID-19 and BeyondGoogle’s thriving defense portfolio includes a project detecting corrosion on Navy vessels by applying machine learning to drone imagery and another supporting aircraft maintenance for the Air Force. Google also supplies cloud security technology to the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit, set up to help the agency work more closely with tech companies. In November 2020, Google won a piece of a large CIA cloud contract. And in May, it jointly won a $1.3 billion deal with Amazon to supply cloud services to the Israeli government, including its defense agencies.Events this month suggest there may be more big defense deals in Google’s future. Two weeks ago the company said it had received a Pentagon security certification allowing it to handle “controlled” government information. The same day, The New York Times reported that Google was preparing a bid for the Pentagon’s most significant cloud contract yet, the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability. Not long after, Google launched a webpage touting its contracts and support for the “critical missions of [its] military and national security personnel,” and its cloud chief Thomas Kurian was photographed, beaming, with the Army’s chief information officer. In a blog post Friday, Kurian confirmed his interest in the warfighter cloud project, saying Google will serve “proudly” if selected and will adhere to its AI principles.The Pentagon likes what it sees. Mike Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit, said this month that a vocal minority of protesters caught Google “flat footed” a few years ago, but management had since made clear “they want to pursue business” with the Department of Defense. “Personally I think we need Google,” he said. “I’m glad to see the change.”AdvertisementGoogle declined to comment and referred WIRED to Kurian’s blog post. He has led Google’s cloud unit since 2019 and previously had a long tenure at Oracle, known for a sales-driven culture and comfort with US defense and intelligence agencies—the CIA was its first customer.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDSome Google employees distrust their bosses’ increasingly open embrace of defense and intelligence work. Around 700 signed a letter sent to Kurian and Pichai in October asking them to abandon the deal with the Israeli government, because it would contribute to surveillance and unlawful data collection on Palestinians. Some Amazon workers wrote to their own bosses; employees from both companies penned an opinion piece in the Guardian.One Google employee who works in AI research and signed the letter feared that a contract with a close US ally could help Google make sales to the Pentagon and other agencies. The employee says the Israeli deal, known as Project Nimbus, was a “bellwether” for Google's ability to cement military contracts. Such contracts make it “inevitable our technology will be used to harm or surveil our own users because we’re a global company,” the employee says.The Googler would prefer Google abandon military work altogether and takes little comfort from its AI principles. The Israeli finance ministry has said the contract bars companies from denying services to specific parts of the government. “Google has shown very little transparency around any of the details of these contracts or the AI principles reviews they supposedly undergo,” the employee says.“I think they just want plausible deniability.”Jack Poulson, ex-Google employee and head of Tech InquiryIt would be challenging for any employee protest to achieve the scale or impact of the Maven protests. Google’s legendarily freewheeling internal culture has become more locked down since then, for example by tightening access to information about projects in development. Some leaders of protests against Maven and other causes at Google have complained of retaliation and left the company. The company is fighting charges from the US National Labor Relations Board that it inappropriately monitored, interrogated, or fired several workers involved in labor organizing or protesting a cloud contract with Customs and Border Protection. In the past year, prominent AI researchers Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell were forced out after managers objected to a paper urging caution with software that processes text.Google has worked with the US military since long before it sold cloud computing. The Federal Procurement Data System shows the Coast Guard bought licenses to Google Earth in 2005; the Army did the same in 2007. The Pentagon had a sympathetic ear at the top. In 2016, Eric Schmidt, formerly Google’s CEO and then Alphabet’s executive chair, became chair of the department’s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, which promoted tech industry collaboration with the agency.Google won the Maven contract in late 2017, just before Schmidt stepped down as Alphabet’s chair. There were Googlers who disagreed with the project from the start. Early in 2018, Bloomberg later reported, a group of nine workers unhappy with Maven delayed plans to deploy a security feature called an “air gap” needed for Pentagon certifications. The project continued, but the Maven protests burst noisily into the open, prompting management to let the contract expire and announce the AI principles.

In the three years since, Google has stayed true to his word. The company has built a significant line of business atop deep relationships with defense and intelligence agencies, including a series of contracts that haven’t drawn the same scrutiny or outcry as Project Maven.
Google’s thriving defense portfolio includes a project detecting corrosion on Navy vessels by applying machine learning to drone imagery and another supporting aircraft maintenance for the Air Force. Google also supplies cloud security technology to the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit, set up to help the agency work more closely with tech companies. In November 2020, Google won a piece of a large CIA cloud contract. And in May, it jointly won a $1.3 billion deal with Amazon to supply cloud services to the Israeli government, including its defense agencies.
Events this month suggest there may be more big defense deals in Google’s future. Two weeks ago the company said it had received a Pentagon security certification allowing it to handle “controlled” government information. The same day, The New York Times reported that Google was preparing a bid for the Pentagon’s most significant cloud contract yet, the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability. Not long after, Google launched a webpage touting its contracts and support for the “critical missions of [its] military and national security personnel,” and its cloud chief Thomas Kurian was photographed, beaming, with the Army’s chief information officer. In a blog post Friday, Kurian confirmed his interest in the warfighter cloud project, saying Google will serve “proudly” if selected and will adhere to its AI principles.
The Pentagon likes what it sees. Mike Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit, said this month that a vocal minority of protesters caught Google “flat footed” a few years ago, but management had since made clear “they want to pursue business” with the Department of Defense. “Personally I think we need Google,” he said. “I’m glad to see the change.”
Google declined to comment and referred WIRED to Kurian’s blog post. He has led Google’s cloud unit since 2019 and previously had a long tenure at Oracle, known for a sales-driven culture and comfort with US defense and intelligence agencies—the CIA was its first customer.
Some Google employees distrust their bosses’ increasingly open embrace of defense and intelligence work. Around 700 signed a letter sent to Kurian and Pichai in October asking them to abandon the deal with the Israeli government, because it would contribute to surveillance and unlawful data collection on Palestinians. Some Amazon workers wrote to their own bosses; employees from both companies penned an opinion piece in the Guardian.
One Google employee who works in AI research and signed the letter feared that a contract with a close US ally could help Google make sales to the Pentagon and other agencies. The employee says the Israeli deal, known as Project Nimbus, was a “bellwether” for Google's ability to cement military contracts. Such contracts make it “inevitable our technology will be used to harm or surveil our own users because we’re a global company,” the employee says.
The Googler would prefer Google abandon military work altogether and takes little comfort from its AI principles. The Israeli finance ministry has said the contract bars companies from denying services to specific parts of the government. “Google has shown very little transparency around any of the details of these contracts or the AI principles reviews they supposedly undergo,” the employee says.
It would be challenging for any employee protest to achieve the scale or impact of the Maven protests. Google’s legendarily freewheeling internal culture has become more locked down since then, for example by tightening access to information about projects in development. Some leaders of protests against Maven and other causes at Google have complained of retaliation and left the company. The company is fighting charges from the US National Labor Relations Board that it inappropriately monitored, interrogated, or fired several workers involved in labor organizing or protesting a cloud contract with Customs and Border Protection. In the past year, prominent AI researchers Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell were forced out after managers objected to a paper urging caution with software that processes text.
Google has worked with the US military since long before it sold cloud computing. The Federal Procurement Data System shows the Coast Guard bought licenses to Google Earth in 2005; the Army did the same in 2007. The Pentagon had a sympathetic ear at the top. In 2016, Eric Schmidt, formerly Google’s CEO and then Alphabet’s executive chair, became chair of the department’s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, which promoted tech industry collaboration with the agency.
Google won the Maven contract in late 2017, just before Schmidt stepped down as Alphabet’s chair. There were Googlers who disagreed with the project from the start. Early in 2018, Bloomberg later reported, a group of nine workers unhappy with Maven delayed plans to deploy a security feature called an “air gap” needed for Pentagon certifications. The project continued, but the Maven protests burst noisily into the open, prompting management to let the contract expire and announce the AI principles. Google says it has internal review processes to enforce those guidelines that have turned away some commercial business.
It now appears that while the Maven protests slowed Google down, they didn’t significantly trim its ambitions in national security.
Jack Poulson, a former Googler who is now executive director of nonprofit Tech Inquiry, says the air gap and Maven protesters deserve credit for hindering the company’s plans and forcing it to introduce some AI oversight. But he says the broad exceptions built into the AI principles and Google’s permissive interpretation makes them into a shield used to deflect scrutiny rather than a meaningful moral compass. “I think they just want plausible deniability,” Poulson says. He quit Google in late 2018 over a project that would have adapted search technology to comply with Chinese internet censorship.
Alphabet Workers’ Union, which represents a small minority of Google employees, tweeted Monday that although Google’s AI principles say the technology should always be “socially beneficial,” Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability would “modernize the DOD's tools of war & lead to the extrajudicial killing of people around the globe.”
Google remains far behind Amazon and Microsoft in competing for both commercial cloud computing deals and for government and defense contracts. Both have higher security certifications than Google, allowing them to handle classified information. And both are more openly supportive of working with the US government on national security.
Amazon has deals with many parts of the Pentagon, including one with Special Operations Command using AI to analyze media seized by US troops.

Google’s chance to compete for the sweeping Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability contract came after the Pentagon in July nixed the original version, named JEDI and worth up to $10 billion, which was awarded to Microsoft. Amazon and Oracle had claimed in lawsuits the award process was unfair.

That structure could be good for Google. The company said in late 2018 that it would not bid for JEDI because it might breach its AI principles and—significantly—it lacked security certifications. Kurian said in his blog post Friday that missing certificates had been the “foremost” reason but that Google now had additional certificates. He said JWCC’s format would allow Google to pick contracts within the scope of its AI principles, leaving more fraught work to others.

Davis·FollowPublished inDataDrivenInvestor·6 min read·Nov 17, 2021142ListenShareImage by the Author from CanvaArtificial intelligence is one of the most exciting technologies to emerge in recent years. It’s still early days, but there are already lots of applications that are adding value to our lives and we can expect many more developments in the coming months and years.Here are just a few reasons to be excited about this technology:1. AI will make existing products betterAI will not replace human workers; instead, it will help organizations and employees run their businesses and maximize productivity. For example, Google recently improved its search function by installing an AI system called RankBrain which helps match relevant web pages with user queries.This has improved the accuracy of searches for highly complex or technical terms or when users use colloquial language or spelling errors.AI could also help Amazon warehouse employees sort packages more quickly by telling them which box to grab next. AI systems have been developed that can predict a person’s movements and interactions with products in a store, allowing for faster processing of customer orders.In the legal field, AI systems are being designed to sift through documents and summarize relevant information for lawyers so they don’t have to spend hours reading through large volumes of material.2. AI will produce new types of jobsAI has the potential to solve a lot of our problems — from diagnosing illness and driving cars safely to performing high-level tasks like financial analysis or management consulting.But when we think about this technology, it is easy to get caught up in the negative aspects of job loss.One study suggests that about 47% of U.S. employment is at risk from AI and other forms of automation, but this shouldn’t give us cause for alarm because it also creates the opportunity to develop new technologies and service industries which will generate lots of new jobs.In fact, a recent paper found that only 5% of jobs will be fully replaced by technology like AI while the rest will be either augmented or complemented by it. Already we see people who are training themselves to become data scientists to take advantage of all the opportunities that exist in analyzing large amounts…A Day In The Life Of A Copywriter. Here’s What It Looks LikeIn this article you’ll find out what a typical day is like for a copywriter — from finding inspiration for blog posts…jamesjdavis.medium.com3. It can help us solve crimesOne area where AI has already been successfully implemented is in catching criminals.In the United States, the Los Angeles Police Department has been working with Palantir Technologies to analyze large data sets in order to discover patterns and identify individuals who could be engaged in criminal activity.This is based on software that was initially designed for counter-terrorism operations but can be applied much more widely to help fight crime.For example, it can be used to detect fraudulent activities by employees at a company or predict where crimes are most likely to occur so that police officers can patrol those areas.4. It will enable us to explore space more efficientlyAI systems are also being used in aerospace engineering and research into new materials, including for use in building spacecraft that will enable us to explore Earth’s orbit.These AI systems are helping to find new planets beyond our solar system, enabling scientists to gain a better understanding of the origins of life. They are also being used to investigate materials that can be used in building space elevators that will transport material into space at a fraction of today’s costs.5. AI can be applied to almost anythingThe technology involved in AI is basically the ability for computers to learn from data so they can make sense of it and reason about it without any human input or specific programming.This means AI possibilities are endless because there is so much data available today — whether it’s medical records, financial information, social media posts or online shopping habits — and we haven’t even come close to maximizing its potential yet.Many companies have been successful in applying AI to a range of different tasks, from making movie recommendations to predicting energy consumption.6. It can help us design more effective drugsPharmaceutical companies are working on combining machine learning with molecular simulations to create new molecules that could potentially be used as the basis for drug development.The hope is this will enable them to develop more effective and economical medicines because they will have a better understanding of what makes the most promising candidates work so they can quickly narrow down their options and save time and resources.7. It could lead to breakthroughs in many different fieldsIn addition to all these practical applications, the possibilities of AI extend into all sorts of other areas such as art, education and healthcare. For example, there are researchers who are using AI to make paintings based on data sets.It could also be used in educational settings, such as providing personalized learning paths for students, helping them learn faster and more efficiently, receiving instant feedback on their progress and enabling them to work at their own pace.And AI can also help doctors treat patients by providing an early warning system for medical conditions that may not yet present symptoms or diagnosing diseases by scanning patient records for anomalies.8. We can expect even more exciting things from AIThe field of artificial intelligence is growing fast with big strides being made each year so it’s important to remind ourselves that this isn’t just about doing the same things faster — it’s about doing new things that were previously impossible which will have a huge impact on our lives.We can expect even more exciting things from AI as the technology progresses and becomes more widespread so there’s no doubt it will continue to be part of our everyday lives in the future.9. AI can help you write texts and headlines for your articlesImage by the Author from JarvisI’m sure I’ve told you guys about my successful attempt at using AI to write articles and headlines for me.I used a program called “Jarvis Conversion AI” and it was pretty easy to use. You just paste in what you want to be written and then tell the software what genre the text is and how formal it should be.It also has a section where you can specify what type of people the article is targeting, which is really helpful if you do SEO (search engine optimization).Anyway, so I told it I wanted it to be within the “-ing” genre with a formal writing style for an audience of professionals. You can have it written in multiple genres and styles too if you need some variety.I also asked Jarvis to rank itself on certain keywords like “Artificial Intelligence” and “Future Technology”. Then, let the program do its work!When I checked back 5 minutes later, it had written all kinds of content that was pretty interesting to read!It’s easy to think of AI as a futuristic technology that we can’t wait to see, but it’s already right in front of us. It’s almost as if it has been hiding in plain sight all this time.There are many reasons to be excited for the future of AI and here are just a few- from helping fight crime more efficiently, enabling exploration into space with less effort, being able to apply it across different industries or even making breakthroughs in healthcare.As companies continue developing smarter algorithms and building on what they’ve learned so far about how best to leverage the power of artificial intelligence systems, there is no doubt that our lives will change dramatically because of them.If you’re interested in learning more about how these cognitive neuroscience principles may be able to help you become more persuasive, check out the free persuasion guide here.If you want to support my writing, become a Medium member.

Elizabeth Bondi ’16 (imaging science) 
Faculty: Carl Salvaggio




Elizabeth Bondi explored a range of technical and research skills during her years as an imaging science student at RIT. She used those skills to develop an algorithm that aided in preventing poaching in South Africa, and now she’s pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard University.












“Seeing how different technologies apply in the real world is very inspiring to me.”
Elizabeth Bondi ’16 explored a range of technical and research skills during her years as an imaging science student at RIT. The Innovative Freshman Experience piqued her curiosity, taught her how to ask good questions and how to push through obstacles that came up often in research. And she’s never looked back. Today, she’s continuing her research as a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Harvard University.
Before arriving at RIT as a student, Elizabeth was able to try out the imaging science program through the Imaging Science Summer High School Intern Program. As a high school intern, she used Yarbus software in eye tracking research and conducted experiments using mobile and stationary eye trackers. After enrolling at RIT, Elizabeth took full advantage of the work and research opportunities available. She started as an Imaging Science Research Assistant, processing historical manuscript images using ENVI 5.0 Classic and IDL. Elizabeth earned a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF, now called SURE!) and automated this process during that time. In 2014 she traveled to Italy to image manuscripts at the Museo del Tesoro del Duomo in Vercelli.
Elizabeth also secured two co-ops while at RIT. She worked in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Mars Rover where she used images and ArcGIS Desktop to characterize possible landing sites for the Perseverance and InSight missions to Mars. As an image science intern with L3Harris, Elizabeth created a feature matching algorithm that used both spatial and spectral information.
Thanks to the broad exposure to programming, image processing, and automation in the image science coursework, research, and internship opportunities, Elizabeth was confident she wanted to pursue computer vision and artificial intelligence further. She enrolled in the Computer Science Ph.D. program at the University of Southern California and worked as a Graduate Student Research Assistant. Her research focused on developing an algorithm to aid in efforts to prevent poaching in South Africa. The algorithm would suggest unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight locations and interventions based on estimates of the number of animals and distance to various park features like boundaries, rivers, and roads. Park rangers could also choose flight locations based on their prior knowledge. Then they used thermal infrared (8-10 μm), UAV-based imagery to automatically detect humans and animals during the flight.
After transferring to the Computer Science Ph.D. program at Harvard University, Elizabeth continued to work in computer vision and deep learning, remote sensing, and multi-agent systems, especially applied to conservation and sustainability. Compared to her peers, Elizabeth feels she brings a new perspective to problem-solving and interdisciplinary research. For example, she was able to demonstrate that we should consider the uncertainty in predictions based on thermal images.
Elizabeth also founded a non-profit organization called Try AI that seeks to increase diversity in the field of artificial intelligence. The organization connects high school and college students with research opportunities in AI, especially as it applies to society.
Through it all, Elizabeth has found that perseverance, curiosity, and a willingness to ask questions were essential skills to do her work. She advised, “To do research it helps to be curious about what will or won’t work, and to want to find those answers, even through the ups and downs. Make sure to take the time to ask questions of yourself, your data, your collaborators, your professors, your users, and people otherwise affected by your work.”
Elizabeth recommends that high school students consider the Imaging Science Summer High School Intern Program. She also encourages all students to try things early to see if they like them. Elizabeth found her passion and path through the many research and work opportunities she took advantage of at RIT.

We sat down with April19 founder Dr. Suran Goonatilake to talk about the merging of the two.While we had a lot of fantastic conversations at the largest psychedelic medical conference of all time last week, it’s fair to say we found ourselves picking up our jaws from the floor at Microdose Miami as we learned about April19’s results so far. But first, just so you can wrap your head around Goonatilake’s work before April19, he is a visiting professor at the University College London Centre for Artificial Intelligence. He has already founded companies in the AI space and had successful exits. Goonatilake got his Ph.D. in machine learning and co-founded Searchspace for the finance sector. He is the co-editor of the books “Intelligent Systems for Finance and Business” and “Intelligent Hybrid Systems.” He was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2005.“AI does the work so humans can be on the beach. That’s the general gist of it,” Goonatilake told L.A. Weekly. Essentially, April19 taught the AI the work of Alexander Shulgin. Shulgin is the godfather of modern psychedelic science and most notably invented MDMA among an array of other beneficial substances he would sample with his wife before bringing them to dinner parties with friends. April19 told the AI to go nuts. In the process, the AI identified 17 new compounds that have the potential to provide healing benefits. But it gets crazier. With the DEA’s approval of an increase in the psychedelic research supply chain, there is going to be tons of data for the AI to process over the next 24 months as more psilocybin and MDMA is eventually divided up between researchers across the nation. The AI will be able to use any kind of human data it’s able to get its hands on moving forward to make its process even more refined. “What we’ll show today is that you can use the power of evolution. So this is a particular style of AI called evolution machines to discover new psychedelic components,” Goonatilake said. “Evolution is arguably the most powerful problem-solving issue we know. That’s why we’re all here. And that’s what we’re trying to harness. That’s what we have harnessed. So the starting point for the work that we presented today was that the Godfather of psychedelics.”Goonatilake took a minute to go heavy on the Shulgin praise given most of the psychedelic compounds of the last 50 years were discovered by him. He argues the entire industry is built on top of a foundation built by Shulgin. April19 would start its work with the same four compounds that were known at the start of Shulgin’s work. They are DMT, LSD, psilocybin and mescaline.“We started with those four compounds and then we applied this evolutionary approach called evolution machines, which effectively combines different parts of the molecule into different novel ways,” Goonatilake explains. “And in this case, we can test whether those things are good enough based on how well it fits into your receptor – in this particular case, this receptor – and you’ll let this run continuously producing better and better campaigns.”The AI allows the April19 team to replicate decades’ worth of lab work rapidly. And the machine learning process never stops. As I type this, as you read it, the machine is hunting down new compounds regardless of water and food. “Then we let it run further. We let it run longer,” says Goonatilake. “And then we have 21 AI modules that test whether those molecules are any good or not.”The modules check things like whether the compound will be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier or be toxic to your heart. “After all that testing they get to potential candidate molecules that you can take orally as opposed to injections because the injections are a pain in the neck and it looks like a central nervous system drug,” Goonatilake notes. “And then we come up with a whole bunch of new molecules which were never known before that we’re now ready to license.”So far, 17 molecules have checked all the boxes when reviewed by the AI modules. Each one, separately, is considered very promising for its potential. And now that Goonatilake and the team at April19 have done the cutting edge part, they can push their work into a more traditional biopharma model to capitalize on it in hopes of eventually getting these compounds to consumers down the line. The next step for April19? New substances that work on even more receptors in the brain. “Turn on not one but many other receptors as well,” Goonatilake explains. “And some of them partially, not fully. I think that’s going to be one area where future blockbuster drugs are going to be and another area that people are very excited about. It is about psychedelics that are not hallucinogenic.”Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

Do not forget to check these crucial AI ethical questions..Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly shaping modern life. From choosing TV shows to making business decisions, AI is practically everywhere. But despite all these remarkable possibilities, there is also the potential that AI might cause more harm than good — sometimes inadvertently, as in the case when AI makes biased predictions, or sometimes intentionally when it is used to manufacture misinformation or convincing deepfakes. To get a job in the field of artificial intelligence, then you need to prepare for the crucial questions for the AI interview. Every interview is indeed different as per the job profiles. Companies are offering various opportunities to tech-enthusiasts. If you are looking for crucial questions for an AI interview, Analytics Insight presents the top ten usually asked AI ethical questions in interviews. And they are as follows:.What happens if AI replaces humans in the workplace?.As machines have taken on more and more monotonous and dangerous types of work, and people have been able to switch to more interesting mental work. This is one of the crucial AI Ethical questions usually asked in an interview..How do we protect access to AI from bad actors?.As AI becomes more powerful in society, it will also become more dangerous as a weapon. It is possible to imagine a scary scenario where a bad actor takes over the artificial intelligence model that controls a city's water supply, power grid, or traffic signals. Cybersecurity will become more crucial than ever..How will machines affect human interactions?.This is one of the most sensitive AI ethical questions asked in an interview where your presence of mind is tested, and the way you answer this question will decide your position in the company. An interesting ethical dilemma of artificial intelligence is the decline in human interaction. Now more than any time in history it is possible to entertain yourself at home, alone..Artificial intelligence simply being a codification of existing biases, what is your opinion about it?.Bias is a well-established facet of AI (or of human intelligence, for that matter). AI takes on the biases of the dataset it learns from. This means that if researchers train an AI on data that are skewed for the race, gender, education, wealth, or any other point of bias, Artificial Intelligence will learn that bias. This is also one of the most important questions for an AI interview..WHAT BUSINESS &amp; ACCOUNTING SCHOOLS SHOULD TEACH ABOUT AITOP EDGE AI COMPANIES TO KNOW AND WATCH OUT IN 2021 FOR SURETOP PROS AND CONS OF AI IN CLOUD COMPUTING FOR YOU TO KNOW.What is ethical artificial intelligence, and why is it important?.Ethical AI ensures that the AI initiatives of the organization or entity maintain human dignity and do not in any way cause harm to people. That encompasses many things, such as fairness, anti-weaponization, and liability, such as in the case of self-driving cars that encounter accidents..How do we protect against unintended consequences?.What if artificial intelligence itself turned against humans? This does not mean turning &quot;evil&quot; in the way a human might or the way AI disasters are depicted in Hollywood movies. Rather, we can imagine an advanced AI system as a &quot;genie in a bottle&quot; that can fulfill wishes but with terrible unforeseen consequences..How do we stay in control of a complex intelligent system?.Here an interviewer wants to see your knowledge about the technology and the complex intelligent system. The reason humans are on top of the food chain is not down to sharp teeth or strong muscles. Human dominance is almost entirely due to our ingenuity and intelligence..How do we define the humane treatment of AI?.As neuroscientists are working on unlocking the secrets of conscious experience, people understand more about the basic mechanisms of reward and aversion. This question is one of the widely asked AI Ethical questions in a job interview..How can we guard against mistakes made by artificial intelligence?.When you look for crucial questions for an AI interview, you will definitely come across this question. Intelligence comes from learning, whether you are human or machine. Systems usually have a training phase in which they &quot;learn&quot; to detect the right patterns and act according to their input..Do you think AI can or should have rights?.Now you have come to the part where the ethical concern is whether AI can or should have rights. As a piece of computer code, it is tempting to think that artificially intelligent systems cannot have feelings. You can get angry with Siri or Alexa without hurting their feelings. However, consciousness and intelligence operate on a system of reward and aversion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Ryan writes and edits AI industry trends and use-cases for Emerj's editorial and client content. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The Walt Disney Company began in 1923 as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio. By 1940, Walt Disney Productions issued its first stock. Today, the multinational family entertainment and media conglomerate is one of the Big 6 media companies.  As of 2021, Disney trades on the NYSE with a market cap that exceeds $300 billion. For the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020, Disney reported revenues of $65.3 billion, according to its Fiscal Year 2020 10-K. Twelve years ago, Disney established DisneyResearch|Studios, its Swiss-based research arm that puts its research talent to work in applying machine learning, artificial intelligence, and visual computing innovations to its movies and media content. Disney also operates the Disney Accelerator program, which supports venture-backed, growth-stage startups with capital, workspace, and guidance from entertainment and technology leaders, including Disney top executives.  In this article, we will look at how Disney has explored AI applications for its business and industry through two unique use-cases: Creating Clouds that Look Real — Disney uses machine learning and deep learning to create realistic clouds that model directional light and are influenced by the sun and sky around them.  Analyzing and Acting upon Audience Reactions — Disney uses computer vision and machine learning to determine, predict, and influence an audience’s reaction to target content. We will begin by examining how Disney has turned to deep scattering, which uses advanced neural networks to add clouds to its animated films that look realistic and lifelike. Creating Clouds that Look Real Creating realistic, immersive 3D worlds that convince and entertain today’s audiences pushes the limits of technology and the imagination. Simulating the effect of light on these virtual environments—a critical process for making them realistic—is a massive technical challenge.  Light transport—part of the larger production rendering process—takes time and adds to the costs of films that feature these 3D worlds. When forming clouds for digital scenes, for example, the “characteristic silver lining and the ‘whiteness’ of the inner body” are challenging when relying on Monte Carlo simulation or diffusion theory alone, writes a team of Disney Research/ETH Zürich authors in a 2017 publication.   The business value in seeking faster, more resourceful methods to design these clouds is clear when these new technologies can lead to the more efficient deployment of both human and computational resources.  In their 2017 paper, the Disney/ETH Zürich research team points out that rendering a realistic sunlit cloud can take some 30 hours using traditional methods, called light tracing. However, when neural networks can predict how the sun will light that cloud, the entire process can be accomplished with the new deep scattering process in a matter of minutes.     To accomplish this, Disney Research Studios brings machine learning to the production rendering and light transport process. To accelerate the process, the researchers looked to develop new machine learning, and deep learning, algorithms that could provide: Path guiding for efficient simulation of light paths Production-ready denoising Deep scattering in atmospheric clouds To inform their algorithms to create the clouds, the researchers studied “the spatial and directional distribution of radiant flux” over dozens of sample cloud formations. With that information, they claim, clouds in new scenes could then be sampled, by creating the formation and geometry of the cloud while modeling realistic light sourcing and shading, a process they call deep scattering.  In the below video, Disney researchers show deep scattering and how to render clouds with radiance-predicting neural networks:  The deep neural networks then deliver the predicted radiance and improve these predictions over time, according to the research team. In creating clouds, Disney Research claims, the deep learning technology can be used for a variety of situations, including: Modeling directional light Modeling sun and sky Sunrise/sunset scenarios Our research was unable to locate any financial information specific to this technology alone, however, Disney Research Studios claims that its researchers help deploy tools into production that support Pixar and Disney Animation in RenderMan and Hyperion, their proprietary 3D rendering solutions.  Analyzing and Acting upon Audience Reactions To succeed in entertainment, you have to know your audience—sometimes even better than the audience knows itself. In the past, entertainment companies like Disney had to sample their intended population using focus groups and ask them what they thought about target content as they tested market fit.  Data scientists then had to correct for sampling error when they went to extrapolate their findings and estimate the reaction they could expect from larger audiences. This cost Disney time, money, and resources, and uncertainty around confidence levels.  Today, Disney is developing tools that can bring accuracy, confidence, and efficiency to the process. Disney is creating technologies that use computer vision to observe an audience and machine learning to gauge their reaction to content, based on visual cues like:  Facial expressions  Body movements  Eye movements  From a Disney Research online publication, this graphic shows how Disney uses facial landmarks to gauge and study audience reactions to its content. Disney is exploring Affective AI, an emerging technology designed to detect and analyze human emotional states. With Affective AI, Disney could realistically model and predict audience reactions that the company could then use to influence a character or plotline, or even make content decisions on a regional or demographic basis, for instance.    In a recent research paper, researchers from Disney Research, Queensland University of Technology, and Carnegie Mellon University describe using infrared cameras to record the subtle movements of moviegoers to determine their reactions to content. To test those reactions, the researchers say, they compared them to ratings recorded on commercial sites like rottentomatoes.com.     In another application of the technology, detailed in a 2017 Disney Research phys.org article, researchers used four infrared cameras in a 400-seat theater and observed faces in the audience.  Ultimately gathering a dataset of 16 million “facial landmarks” from over 3,000 individuals, the team applied deep learning models to predict, with high accuracy, the facial expressions an audience member would show during an entire movie, based on watching them for just a few moments.    By gathering this data and gaining confidence in the conclusions reached, Disney hopes, they can determine how their content evokes certain emotions and to what extent. Through its Audience Understanding effort, Disney claims, the company can test whether their content produces the desired effect and even predict, using machine learning, which emotions content will evoke, “moment-to-moment.”   While Disney does not share specific financial details related to its Audience Understanding effort, the company does disclose that insights from the project are “used by the Disney-ABC Television Group to inform content decisions.”  Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at Oracle - Two Current Use-CasesFounded in 1977 by a team of engineers led by Larry Ellison, Oracle became the… Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twins at General ElectricGeneral Electric (GE) was founded in 1889 by J.P.

How AI Creates Synthetic SpeechAdobe Stock

What is different these days is that the quality of synthesized speech is improving, thanks to several companies using AI to create voice skins for enterprise companies and content creators that give more options for turning text into speech.

LOVO, an AI voice and synthetic speech startup company, uses a voiceover API to turn text into speech in real-time using 200+ human-like voices in 33 languages using their “voice library.” Users also can clone their own voices to create their own skins, simply by reading 15 minutes of a script.

Traditional text-to-speech robotic voices you hear on software or hardware products like Amazon Echo, Google Home, your GPS, or your ebook reader are fast and cheap for companies to create, but they can also be unoriginal and unrealistic.

Artificial intelligence or AI voice operates a little differently. AI voice uses deep learning to create higher-quality synthetic speech that more accurately mimics the pitch, tone, and pace of a real human voice.
For example, if you wanted to use LOVO AI to generate synthetic text, you can upload a script that you want to turn into audio content. Then choose one of the voices in their library, based on language, style, and character. With a click of a button, LOVO turns your script into audio that sounds pretty lifelike.
You can also clone your own voice by reading a short script, and LOVO will generate a custom voice skin you can use over and over again for videos, audiobooks, or anything else that requires voiceover.
Here’s a side-by-side comparison of original voices and voice clones:

Will AI voice technology replace voiceover professionals? Tom Lee, Co-founder and COO of LOVO, says no.
“I believe that isn’t going to happen. If you think about how humans and how AIs work, we can complement each other. As a voice actor, you can only do 6 or 7 hours of work a day. You can't work 24/7, and you want to focus your energy on the most important gigs, or maybe you want to have a day job, and then you want your AI voice to make money while you sleep. You can record once with us, then take the revenue shares. One of our most famous voices is raking in a couple of grand a month without doing any work.""

The Many Potential Uses of Synthetic Speech
AI voice has a myriad of use cases, including:
Translation: Papercup is using AI voice to translate videos by generating voices that sound like the original speaker.
Video or audio ads: You can upload a script and create an ad without the added expense and time involved in hiring a voiceover artist. Descript has a collaborative audio/video editor that works just like a regular Word document.
E-learning (for kids, or for corporate training): Teachers and trainers will be able to make written materials more accessible for different types of learners with the help of AI voice automation.
Augmented reality and virtual reality: With the AR and VR markets exploding right now, there is a huge need for realistic, authentic human voices for apps and websites.
The global text to speech (TTS) market is estimated to reach $5.0 billion by 2026, according to marketsandmarkets.com – so the sky's the limit for this exciting new technology.

But what do the strengths and weaknesses of these tools tell us about the future of artificial intelligence?",,Read-write intelligence.,,,,"TechThe future of AI is a conversation with a computerAI writing tools can tell us a lot about artificial intelligenceBy  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.Illustrations by Micha Huigen Nov 1, 2021, 9:16 AM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Micha HuigenHow would an AI writing program start an article on the future of AI writing? Well, there’s one easy way to find out: I used the best known of these tools, OpenAI’s GPT-3, to do the job for me. Using GPT-3 is disarmingly simple. You have a text box to type into and a menu on the side to adjust parameters, like the “temperature” of the response (which essentially equates to randomness). You type, hit enter, and GPT-3 completes what you’ve written, be it poetry, fiction, or code. I tried inputting a simple headline and a few sentences about the topic, and GPT-3 began to fill in the details. It told me that AI uses “a series of autocomplete-like programs to learn language” and that these programs analyze “the statistical properties of the language” to “make educated guesses based on the words you’ve typed previously.” So far, so good, I thought. I hit enter again, and the program added a quote from Google’s head of AI, Jeff Dean, then referenced an experimental piece of software from the 1960s before promising that an “AI Revolution” was coming that would reap immense rewards across the fields of science, technology, and medicine. The medium included plausible fabrications; endless output; and, crucially, an opportunity to respond to the robot writerFine, I thought. Then I thought a little more and did some googling. I soon discovered that the quote from Dean was made up, that the experimental software never existed, and while the promise of an “AI Revolution” was all well and good, it wasn’t any different from the vague nonsense found in hype-filled press releases. Really, what was most revealing about the future of AI was not what GPT-3 said but how it said it. The medium is the message, as Marshall McLuhan pointed out many years ago. And here, the medium included plausible fabrications; endless output; and, crucially, an opportunity to respond to the robot writer.If we’re looking ahead at the next 10 years of AI development, trying to predict how we will interact with increasingly intelligent software, it helps to consider those tools that can talk back. AI writing models may only be digital parrots, able to copy form without understanding meaning, but they still create a dialogue with the user. This is something that often seems missing from the introduction of AI systems like facial recognition algorithms (which are imposed upon us) or self-driving cars (where the public becomes the test subject in a dangerous experiment). With AI writing tools, there is the possibility for a conversation. If you use Gmail or Google Docs, then you’ve probably already encountered this technology. In Google’s products, AI editors lurk in the blank space in front of your cursor, manifesting textual specters that suggest how to finish a sentence or reply to an email. Often, their prompts are just simple platitudes — ”Thanks!”, “Great idea!”, “Let’s talk next week!” — but sometimes these tools seem to be taking a stronger editorial line, pushing your response in a certain direction. Such suggestions are intended to be helpful, of course, but they seem to provoke annoyance as frequently as gratitude.  To understand how AI systems learn to generate such suggestions, imagine being given two lists of words. One starts off “eggs, flour, spatula,” and the other goes “paint, crayons, scissors.” If you had to add the items “milk” and “glitter” to these lists, which would you choose and with how much confidence? And what if that word was “brush” instead? Does that belong in the kitchen, where it might apply an egg wash, or is it more firmly located in the world of arts-and-crafts? Quantifying this sort of context is how AI writing tools learn to make their suggestions. They mine vast amounts of text data to create statistical maps of the relationships between words, and use this information to complete what you write. When you start typing, they start predicting which words should come next. Their ability to actually understand language is a topic of hot debate, but their fluency across genres is undeniableFeatures like Gmail’s Smart Reply are only the most obvious example of how these systems — often known as large language models — are working their way into the written world. AI chatbots designed for companionship have become increasingly popular, with some, like Microsoft’s Chinese Xiaoice, attracting tens of millions of users. Choose-your-own-adventure-style text games with AI dungeon masters are attracting users by letting people tell stories collaboratively with computers. And a host of startups offer multipurpose AI text tools that summarize, rephrase, expand, and alter users’ input with varying degrees of competence. They can help you to write fiction or school essays, say their creators, or they might just fill the web with endless spam.The ability of the underlying software to actually understand language is a topic of hot debate. (One that tends to arrive, time and time again, at the same question: what do we mean by “understand” anyway?). But their fluency across genres is undeniable. For those enamored with this technology, scale is key to their success. It’s by making these models and their training data bigger and bigger that they’ve been able to improve so quickly. Take, for example, the training data used to create GPT-3. The exact size of the input is difficult to calculate, but one estimate suggests that the entirety of Wikipedia in English (3.9 billion words and more than 6 million articles) makes up only 0.6 percent of the total. Relying on scale to build these systems has benefits and drawbacks. From an engineering perspective, it allows for fast improvements in quality: just add more data and compute to reap fast rewards. The size of large language models is generally measured in their number of connections, or parameters, and by this metric, these systems have increased in complexity extremely quickly. GPT-2, released in 2019, had 1.5 billion parameters, while its 2020 successor, GPT-3, had more than 100 times that — some 175 billion parameters. Earlier this year, Google announced it had trained a language model with 1.6 trillion parameters. Push them on any given topic or stray from the most obvious fields, and they will lie thoughtlesslyThe difference in quality as systems get larger is notable, but it’s unclear how much longer these scaling efforts will reap rewards in quality. Boosters think that sky’s the limit — that these systems will keep on getting smarter and smarter, and that they may even be the first step toward creating a general-purpose artificial intelligence or AGI. But skeptics suggest that the AI field in general is starting to reap diminishing returns as it scales ever up.  A reliance on scale, though, is inextricably linked to the statistical approach that creates uncertainty in these models’ output. These systems have no centralized store of accepted “truths”; no embodied understanding of “what the world is like for humans” and, hence, no way to distinguish fact from fiction or to exercise common sense. Quiz them on simple trivia, like capital cities or the birthdays of US presidents, and they are right most of the time. But to these systems, truth is simply a statistical feature of their training data. They answer questions correctly because the text they’ve been fed has presented them with the correct information with enough frequency. This means that if you push them on any given topic or stray from the most obvious fields, they will lie thoughtlessly, making up quotes, dates, biographical details, and anything else you want to hear. The same probabilistic approach also means they can stumble over common sense questions. Start quizzing them with slightly fantastical queries, and they will confidently assert, for example, that a pencil is heavier than a toaster or that a blade of grass only has one eye. Such answers reveal the gulf between statistical and embodied intelligence. To get a better understanding of these AI language models, I’ve been playing with a variety for the past few weeks; from tools sold to copywriters to flexible, multipurpose systems like GPT-3. The experience has been dizzying. Often, I’m amazed by the fluency, insight, and creativity of these systems. As part of a project for The Verge’s 10-year anniversary, for example, I used GPT-3 to write technopagan spells for a zine, feeding it a prompt (below in bold) which it completed with a four-step ritual (of which I’m showing only the first step):Technopaganism is a new sort of magic that blends traditional witchcraft with the power of being online all the time. What follows is a technopagan spell designed to protect your phone from spam and improve the quality of messages you receive. Step 1) Take your cell phone and go outside. Close your eyes, hold the device in front of you, and intone: “I offer you, O Spirit of Technopagan Magic, my eternal and unending electronic connection to the net. And in return I ask you for magick to combine my will with the will of the system — make me impervious to the garbage that flows through my inbox. Make all messages flow together, and I will choose among them what is right for me to see. Grant me the Finger of the Internet, and I will strike at spam, and cast out the spammers back to the dark places where they come from.” But other times, I’m stunned by how limited these programs are. Something that’s often overlooked is just how much human curation is needed to shape their output. The text above was not the first response I received from GPT-3, and I had to go through several iterations to generate a response that was both cogent and funny. It helped, of course, that the task I’d set GPT-3 was an imaginative and open-ended one: it played into the program’s strengths (and I think GPT-3’s success in such tasks has led some users and observers to exaggerate the intelligence of these systems). Other times, though, the software produced nonsensical content even within the fanciful framing I’d given it. Another “spell” it generated in response to the same prompt was much less focused, adding fictitious social media handles, tech headlines, and non-existent URLs to the spell’s instructions: Perform a ritual to seal the crown circle into the device. May the gods help us all, the Apple iPhone X reference for is broken! Destroy the holy symbol! —tianong xiong (@tianongxiong) September 13, 2018 To confirm the rumor: Facebook Messenger’s search bar does have a search bar hidden right next to it pic.twitter.com/DghBL5DmhU — Warl Darkh (@dkpt) September 12, 2018 You can argue that this is just creativity of a different sort, and that of course a proper technopagan spell would include URLs. But it’s also obvious the machine has gone off-piste.Despite such weaknesses, there’s already talk of AI systems taking over writers’ jobs. Naturally, I wondered if a computer could write articles for The Verge (and not just this one). I played around with different models, inputting opening paragraphs into these systems and asking for story ideas. Here is some more from GPT-3 on large language models: “The human brain is just a really fancy computer,” said Jeff Dean, a Google hardware engineer and AI expert, at a company event in 2016. “It’s a computer made of meat.”To understand GPT-3, you first have to know a little about how the brain learns. The brain isn’t born knowing how to speak or understand speech. It must first acquire this ability through exposure to the outside world, which is why children tend to learn language so quickly, and why being raised in a household where a language isn’t spoken presents a major obstacle.As neuroscientist Mark Changizi has shown, the process of learning a language is a massive project. “Language is one of the most complex things that brains can do,” he writes, “and it emerges from the brain’s more basic skills, like vision, hearing, and motor control.”But how does the brain acquire all this knowledge? The short answer is: via autocomplete.All these points make sense if you’re not concentrating too hard, but they don’t flow from sentence to sentence. They never follow an argument or build to a conclusion. And again, fabrication is a problem. Both Jeff Dean and Mark Changizi are real people who have been more or less correctly identified (though Dean is now head of AI at Google, and Changizi is a cognitive scientist rather than a neuroscientist). But neither man ever uttered the words that GPT-3 attributed to them, as far as I can tell. Yet despite these problems, there’s also a lot to be impressed by. For example, using “autocomplete” as a metaphor to describe AI language models is both accurate and easy to understand. I’ve done it myself! But is this because it’s simply a common metaphor that others have deployed before? Is it right then to say GPT-3 is “intelligent” to use this phrase or is it just subtly plagiarizing others? (Hell, I ask the same questions about my own writing.)Where AI language models seem best suited, is creating text that is rote, not bespoke, as with Gmail’s suggested replies. In the case of journalism, automated systems have already been integrated into newsrooms to write “fill in the blanks” stories about earthquakes, sporting events, and the like. And with the rise of large AI language models, the span of content that can be addressed in this way is expanding.“Mostly, it’s people in the content marketing industry who have company blogs to fill, who need to create content.”Samanyou Garg is the founder of an AI writing startup named Writesonic, and says his service is used mostly by e-commerce firms. “It really helps [with] product descriptions at scale,” says Garg. “Some of the companies who approach us have like 10 million products on their website, and it’s not possible for a human to write that many.” Fabian Langer, founder of a similar firm named AI Writer, tells The Verge that his tools are often used to pad out “SEO farms” — sites that exist purely to catch Google searches and that create revenue by redirecting visitors to ads or affiliates. “Mostly, it’s people in the content marketing industry who have company blogs to fill, who need to create content,” said Langer. “And to be honest, for these [SEO] farms, I do not expect that people really read it. As soon as you get the click, you can show your advertisement, and that’s good enough.”It’s this sort of writing that AI will take over first, and which I’ve started to think of as “low-attention” text — a description that applies to both the effort needed to create and read it. Low-attention text is not writing that makes huge demands on our intelligence, but is mostly functional, conveying information quickly or simply filling space. It also constitutes a greater portion of the written world than you might think, including not only marketing blogs but work interactions and idle chit-chat. That’s why Gmail and Google Docs are incorporating AI language models’ suggestions: they’re picking low-hanging fruit. The choice to use this filler on a wide scale will have structural effectsA big question, though, is what effect will these AI writing systems have on human writing and, by extension, our culture? The more I’ve thought about the output of large language models, the more it reminds me of geofoam. This is a building material made from expanded polystyrene that is cheap to produce, easy to handle, and packed into the voids left over by construction projects. It is incredibly useful but somewhat controversial, due to its uncanny appearance as giant polystyrene blocks. To some, geofoam is an environmentally-sound material that fulfills a specific purpose. To others, it’s a horrific symbol of our exploitative relationship with the Earth. Geofoam is made by pumping oil out of the ground, refining it into cheap matter, and stuffing it back into the empty spaces progress leaves behind. Large language models work in a similar way: processing the archaeological strata of digital text into synthetic speech to fill our low-attention voids. For those who worry that much of the internet is already “fake” — sustained by botnets, traffic farms, and automatically generated content — this will simply mark the continuation of an existing trend. But just as with geofoam, the choice to use this filler on a wide scale will have structural effects. There is ample evidence, for example, that large language models encode and amplify social biases, producing text that is racist and sexist, or that repeats harmful stereotypes. The corporations in control of these models pay lip service to these problems but don’t think they present serious problems. (Google famously fired two of its AI researchers after they published a detailed paper describing these issues.) And as we offload more of the cognitive burden of writing onto machines, making our low-attention text no-attention text, it seems plausible that we, in turn, will be shaped by the output of these models. Google already uses its AI autocomplete tools to suggest gender-neutral language (replacing “chairman” with “chair,” for example), and regardless of your opinion on the politics of this sort of nudge, it’s worth discussing what the end-point of these systems might be. In other words: what happens when AI systems trained on our writing start training us? Despite the problems and limitations of large language models, they’re already being embraced for many tasks. Google is making language models central to its various search products; Microsoft is using them to build automated coding software, and the popularity of apps like Xiaoice and AI Dungeon suggests that the free-flowing nature of AI writing programs is no hindrance to their adoption. Like many other AI systems, large language models have serious limitations when compared with their hype-filled presentations. And some predict this widespread gap between promise and performance means we’re heading into another period of AI disillusionment. As the roboticist Rodney Brooks put it: “just about every successful deployment [of AI] has either one of two expedients: It has a person somewhere in the loop, or the cost of failure, should the system blunder, is very low.” But AI writing tools can, to an extent, avoid these problems: if they make a mistake, no one gets hurt, and their collaborative nature means human curation is often baked in. “A deity that rules communication is an incorporeal linguistic power.”What’s interesting is considering how the particular characteristics of these tools can be used to our advantage, showing how we might interact with machine learning systems, not in a purely functional fashion but as something exploratory and collaborative. Perhaps the most interesting single use of large language models to date is a book named Phamarko AI: a text written by artist and coder K Allado-McDowell as an extended dialogue with GPT-3. To create Phamarko AI, Allado-McDowell wrote and GPT-3 responded. “I would write into a text field, I would write a prompt, sometimes that would be several paragraphs, sometimes it would be very short, and then I would generate some text from the prompt,” Allado-McDowell told The Verge. “I would edit the output as it was coming out, and if I wasn’t interested in what it was saying, I would cut that part and regenerate, so I compared it to pruning a plant.” The resulting text is esoteric and obscure, discussing everything from the roots of language itself to the concept of “hyper-dimensionality.” It is also brilliant and illuminating, showing how writing alongside machines can shape thought and expression. At different points, Allado-McDowell compares the experience of writing using GPT-3 to taking mushrooms and communing with gods. They write: “A deity that rules communication is an incorporeal linguistic power. A modern conception of such might read: a force of language from outside of materiality.” That force, Allado-McDowell suggests, might well be a useful way to think about artificial intelligence. The result of communing with it is a sort of “emergence,” they told me, an experience of “being part of a larger ecosystem than just the individual human or the machine.”It’s impossible that this exchange will only be good for usThis, I think, is why AI writing is so much more exciting than many other applications of artificial intelligence: because it offers the chance for communication and collaboration. The urge to speak to something greater than ourselves is evident in how these programs are being embraced by early adopters. A number of individuals have used GPT-3 to talk to dead loved ones, for example, turning its statistical intelligence into an algorithmic ouija board. Though such experiments also reveal the limitations. In one of these cases, OpenAI shut down a chatbot shaped to resemble a developer’s dead fiancée because the program didn’t conform to the company’s terms of service. That’s another, less promising reality of these systems: the vast majority are owned and operated by corporations with their own interests, and they will shape their programs (and, in turn, their users) as they see fit. Despite this, I’m hopeful, or at least curious, about the future of AI writing. It will be a conversation with our machines; one that is diffuse and subtle, taking place across multiple platforms, where AI programs linger on the fringes of language. These programs will be unseen editors to news stories and blog posts, they will suggest comments in emails and documents, and they will be interlocutors that we even talk to directly. It’s impossible that this exchange will only be good for us, and that the deployment of these systems won’t come without problems and challenges. But it will, at least, be a dialogue. Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: ring any bells?

Well, there’s one easy way to find out: I used the best known of these tools, OpenAI’s GPT-3, to do the job for me. 

Using GPT-3 is disarmingly simple. You have a text box to type into and a menu on the side to adjust parameters, like the “temperature” of the response (which essentially equates to randomness). You type, hit enter, and GPT-3 completes what you’ve written, be it poetry, fiction, or code. I tried inputting a simple headline and a few sentences about the topic, and GPT-3 began to fill in the details. It told me that AI uses “a series of autocomplete-like programs to learn language” and that these programs analyze “the statistical properties of the language” to “make educated guesses based on the words you’ve typed previously.” 

So far, so good, I thought. I hit enter again, and the program added a quote from Google’s head of AI, Jeff Dean, then referenced an experimental piece of software from the 1960s before promising that an “AI Revolution” was coming that would reap immense rewards across the fields of science, technology, and medicine. 

""The medium included plausible fabrications; endless output; and, crucially, an opportunity to respond to the robot writer""

Fine, I thought. Then I thought a little more and did some googling. I soon discovered that the quote from Dean was made up, that the experimental software never existed, and while the promise of an “AI Revolution” was all well and good, it wasn’t any different from the vague nonsense found in hype-filled press releases. Really, what was most revealing about the future of AI was not what GPT-3 said but how it said it. The medium is the message, as Marshall McLuhan pointed out many years ago. And here, the medium included plausible fabrications; endless output; and, crucially, an opportunity to respond to the robot writer.

If we’re looking ahead at the next 10 years of AI development, trying to predict how we will interact with increasingly intelligent software, it helps to consider those tools that can talk back. AI writing models may only be digital parrots, able to copy form without understanding meaning, but they still create a dialogue with the user. This is something that often seems missing from the introduction of AI systems like facial recognition algorithms (which are imposed upon us) or self-driving cars (where the public becomes the test subject in a dangerous experiment). With AI writing tools, there is the possibility for a conversation.

If you use Gmail or Google Docs, then you’ve probably already encountered this technology. In Google’s products, AI editors lurk in the blank space in front of your cursor, manifesting textual specters that suggest how to finish a sentence or reply to an email. Often, their prompts are just simple platitudes — ”Thanks!”, “Great idea!”, “Let’s talk next week!” — but sometimes these tools seem to be taking a stronger editorial line, pushing your response in a certain direction. Such suggestions are intended to be helpful, of course, but they seem to provoke annoyance as frequently as gratitude.  

To understand how AI systems learn to generate such suggestions, imagine being given two lists of words. One starts off “eggs, flour, spatula,” and the other goes “paint, crayons, scissors.” If you had to add the items “milk” and “glitter” to these lists, which would you choose and with how much confidence? And what if that word was “brush” instead? Does that belong in the kitchen, where it might apply an egg wash, or is it more firmly located in the world of arts-and-crafts? Quantifying this sort of context is how AI writing tools learn to make their suggestions. They mine vast amounts of text data to create statistical maps of the relationships between words, and use this information to complete what you write. When you start typing, they start predicting which words should come next. 

""Their ability to actually understand language is a topic of hot debate, but their fluency across genres is undeniable""

Features like Gmail’s Smart Reply are only the most obvious example of how these systems — often known as large language models — are working their way into the written world. AI chatbots designed for companionship have become increasingly popular, with some, like Microsoft’s Chinese Xiaoice, attracting tens of millions of users. Choose-your-own-adventure-style text games with AI dungeon masters are attracting users by letting people tell stories collaboratively with computers. And a host of startups offer multipurpose AI text tools that summarize, rephrase, expand, and alter users’ input with varying degrees of competence. They can help you to write fiction or school essays, say their creators, or they might just fill the web with endless spam.

The ability of the underlying software to actually understand language is a topic of hot debate. (One that tends to arrive, time and time again, at the same question: what do we mean by “understand” anyway?). But their fluency across genres is undeniable. For those enamored with this technology, scale is key to their success. It’s by making these models and their training data bigger and bigger that they’ve been able to improve so quickly. Take, for example, the training data used to create GPT-3. The exact size of the input is difficult to calculate, but one estimate suggests that the entirety of Wikipedia in English (3.9 billion words and more than 6 million articles) makes up only 0.6 percent of the total. 

Relying on scale to build these systems has benefits and drawbacks. From an engineering perspective, it allows for fast improvements in quality: just add more data and compute to reap fast rewards. The size of large language models is generally measured in their number of connections, or parameters, and by this metric, these systems have increased in complexity extremely quickly. GPT-2, released in 2019, had 1.5 billion parameters, while its 2020 successor, GPT-3, had more than 100 times that — some 175 billion parameters. Earlier this year, Google announced it had trained a language model with 1.6 trillion parameters. 

""Push them on any given topic or stray from the most obvious fields, and they will lie thoughtlessly""

The difference in quality as systems get larger is notable, but it’s unclear how much longer these scaling efforts will reap rewards in quality. Boosters think that sky’s the limit — that these systems will keep on getting smarter and smarter, and that they may even be the first step toward creating a general-purpose artificial intelligence or AGI. But skeptics suggest that the AI field in general is starting to reap diminishing returns as it scales ever up.  

A reliance on scale, though, is inextricably linked to the statistical approach that creates uncertainty in these models’ output. These systems have no centralized store of accepted “truths”; no embodied understanding of “what the world is like for humans” and, hence, no way to distinguish fact from fiction or to exercise common sense. 

Quiz them on simple trivia, like capital cities or the birthdays of US presidents, and they are right most of the time. But to these systems, truth is simply a statistical feature of their training data. They answer questions correctly because the text they’ve been fed has presented them with the correct information with enough frequency. This means that if you push them on any given topic or stray from the most obvious fields, they will lie thoughtlessly, making up quotes, dates, biographical details, and anything else you want to hear. The same probabilistic approach also means they can stumble over common sense questions. Start quizzing them with slightly fantastical queries, and they will confidently assert, for example, that a pencil is heavier than a toaster or that a blade of grass only has one eye. Such answers reveal the gulf between statistical and embodied intelligence.

To get a better understanding of these AI language models, I’ve been playing with a variety for the past few weeks; from tools sold to copywriters to flexible, multipurpose systems like GPT-3. The experience has been dizzying. Often, I’m amazed by the fluency, insight, and creativity of these systems. As part of a project for The Verge’s 10-year anniversary, for example, I used GPT-3 to write technopagan spells for a zine, feeding it a prompt (below in bold) which it completed with a four-step ritual (of which I’m showing only the first step):

> Technopaganism is a new sort of magic that blends traditional witchcraft with the power of being online all the time. What follows is a technopagan spell designed to protect your phone from spam and improve the quality of messages you receive. Step 1) Take your cell phone and go outside. Close your eyes, hold the device in front of you, and intone: “I offer you, O Spirit of Technopagan Magic, my eternal and unending electronic connection to the net. And in return I ask you for magick to combine my will with the will of the system — make me impervious to the garbage that flows through my inbox. Make all messages flow together, and I will choose among them what is right for me to see. Grant me the Finger of the Internet, and I will strike at spam, and cast out the spammers back to the dark places where they come from.” 

But other times, I’m stunned by how limited these programs are. Something that’s often overlooked is just how much human curation is needed to shape their output. The text above was not the first response I received from GPT-3, and I had to go through several iterations to generate a response that was both cogent and funny. It helped, of course, that the task I’d set GPT-3 was an imaginative and open-ended one: it played into the program’s strengths (and I think GPT-3’s success in such tasks has led some users and observers to exaggerate the intelligence of these systems). Other times, though, the software produced nonsensical content even within the fanciful framing I’d given it. Another “spell” it generated in response to the same prompt was much less focused, adding fictitious social media handles, tech headlines, and non-existent URLs to the spell’s instructions: 

> Perform a ritual to seal the crown circle into the device. May the gods help us all, the Apple iPhone X reference for is broken! Destroy the holy symbol! —tianong xiong (@tianongxiong) September 13, 2018 To confirm the rumor: Facebook Messenger’s search bar does have a search bar hidden right next to it pic.twitter.com/DghBL5DmhU — Warl Darkh (@dkpt) September 12, 2018 

You can argue that this is just creativity of a different sort, and that of course a proper technopagan spell would include URLs. But it’s also obvious the machine has gone off-piste.

Despite such weaknesses, there’s already talk of AI systems taking over writers’ jobs. Naturally, I wondered if a computer could write articles for The Verge (and not just this one). I played around with different models, inputting opening paragraphs into these systems and asking for story ideas. Here is some more from GPT-3 on large language models: 

> “The human brain is just a really fancy computer,” said Jeff Dean, a Google hardware engineer and AI expert, at a company event in 2016. “It’s a computer made of meat.”
> To understand GPT-3, you first have to know a little about how the brain learns. The brain isn’t born knowing how to speak or understand speech. It must first acquire this ability through exposure to the outside world, which is why children tend to learn language so quickly, and why being raised in a household where a language isn’t spoken presents a major obstacle.
> As neuroscientist Mark Changizi has shown, the process of learning a language is a massive project. “Language is one of the most complex things that brains can do,” he writes, “and it emerges from the brain’s more basic skills, like vision, hearing, and motor control.”
> But how does the brain acquire all this knowledge? The short answer is: via autocomplete.

All these points make sense if you’re not concentrating too hard, but they don’t flow from sentence to sentence. They never follow an argument or build to a conclusion. And again, fabrication is a problem. Both Jeff Dean and Mark Changizi are real people who have been more or less correctly identified (though Dean is now head of AI at Google, and Changizi is a cognitive scientist rather than a neuroscientist). But neither man ever uttered the words that GPT-3 attributed to them, as far as I can tell. Yet despite these problems, there’s also a lot to be impressed by. For example, using “autocomplete” as a metaphor to describe AI language models is both accurate and easy to understand. I’ve done it myself! But is this because it’s simply a common metaphor that others have deployed before? Is it right then to say GPT-3 is “intelligent” to use this phrase or is it just subtly plagiarizing others? (Hell, I ask the same questions about my own writing.)

Where AI language models seem best suited, is creating text that is rote, not bespoke, as with Gmail’s suggested replies. In the case of journalism, automated systems have already been integrated into newsrooms to write “fill in the blanks” stories about earthquakes, sporting events, and the like. And with the rise of large AI language models, the span of content that can be addressed in this way is expanding.

""“Mostly, it’s people in the content marketing industry who have company blogs to fill, who need to create content.”""

Samanyou Garg is the founder of an AI writing startup named Writesonic, and says his service is used mostly by e-commerce firms. “It really helps [with] product descriptions at scale,” says Garg. “Some of the companies who approach us have like 10 million products on their website, and it’s not possible for a human to write that many.” Fabian Langer, founder of a similar firm named AI Writer, tells The Verge that his tools are often used to pad out “SEO farms” — sites that exist purely to catch Google searches and that create revenue by redirecting visitors to ads or affiliates. “Mostly, it’s people in the content marketing industry who have company blogs to fill, who need to create content,” said Langer. “And to be honest, for these [SEO] farms, I do not expect that people really read it. As soon as you get the click, you can show your advertisement, and that’s good enough.”

It’s this sort of writing that AI will take over first, and which I’ve started to think of as “low-attention” text — a description that applies to both the effort needed to create and read it. Low-attention text is not writing that makes huge demands on our intelligence, but is mostly functional, conveying information quickly or simply filling space. It also constitutes a greater portion of the written world than you might think, including not only marketing blogs but work interactions and idle chit-chat. That’s why Gmail and Google Docs are incorporating AI language models’ suggestions: they’re picking low-hanging fruit. 

""The choice to use this filler on a wide scale will have structural effects""

A big question, though, is what effect will these AI writing systems have on human writing and, by extension, our culture? The more I’ve thought about the output of large language models, the more it reminds me of geofoam. This is a building material made from expanded polystyrene that is cheap to produce, easy to handle, and packed into the voids left over by construction projects. It is incredibly useful but somewhat controversial, due to its uncanny appearance as giant polystyrene blocks. To some, geofoam is an environmentally-sound material that fulfills a specific purpose. To others, it’s a horrific symbol of our exploitative relationship with the Earth. Geofoam is made by pumping oil out of the ground, refining it into cheap matter, and stuffing it back into the empty spaces progress leaves behind. Large language models work in a similar way: processing the archaeological strata of digital text into synthetic speech to fill our low-attention voids. 

For those who worry that much of the internet is already “fake” — sustained by botnets, traffic farms, and automatically generated content — this will simply mark the continuation of an existing trend. But just as with geofoam, the choice to use this filler on a wide scale will have structural effects. There is ample evidence, for example, that large language models encode and amplify social biases, producing text that is racist and sexist, or that repeats harmful stereotypes. The corporations in control of these models pay lip service to these problems but don’t think they present serious problems. (Google famously fired two of its AI researchers after they published a detailed paper describing these issues.) And as we offload more of the cognitive burden of writing onto machines, making our low-attention text no-attention text, it seems plausible that we, in turn, will be shaped by the output of these models. Google already uses its AI autocomplete tools to suggest gender-neutral language (replacing “chairman” with “chair,” for example), and regardless of your opinion on the politics of this sort of nudge, it’s worth discussing what the end-point of these systems might be. 

In other words: what happens when AI systems trained on our writing start training us? 

---

Despite the problems and limitations of large language models, they’re already being embraced for many tasks. Google is making language models central to its various search products; Microsoft is using them to build automated coding software, and the popularity of apps like Xiaoice and AI Dungeon suggests that the free-flowing nature of AI writing programs is no hindrance to their adoption. 

Like many other AI systems, large language models have serious limitations when compared with their hype-filled presentations. And some predict this widespread gap between promise and performance means we’re heading into another period of AI disillusionment. As the roboticist Rodney Brooks put it: “just about every successful deployment [of AI] has either one of two expedients: It has a person somewhere in the loop, or the cost of failure, should the system blunder, is very low.” But AI writing tools can, to an extent, avoid these problems: if they make a mistake, no one gets hurt, and their collaborative nature means human curation is often baked in. 

""“A deity that rules communication is an incorporeal linguistic power.”""

What’s interesting is considering how the particular characteristics of these tools can be used to our advantage, showing how we might interact with machine learning systems, not in a purely functional fashion but as something exploratory and collaborative. Perhaps the most interesting single use of large language models to date is a book named Phamarko AI: a text written by artist and coder K Allado-McDowell as an extended dialogue with GPT-3. 

To create Phamarko AI, Allado-McDowell wrote and GPT-3 responded. “I would write into a text field, I would write a prompt, sometimes that would be several paragraphs, sometimes it would be very short, and then I would generate some text from the prompt,” Allado-McDowell told The Verge. “I would edit the output as it was coming out, and if I wasn’t interested in what it was saying, I would cut that part and regenerate, so I compared it to pruning a plant.” 

The resulting text is esoteric and obscure, discussing everything from the roots of language itself to the concept of “hyper-dimensionality.” It is also brilliant and illuminating, showing how writing alongside machines can shape thought and expression. At different points, Allado-McDowell compares the experience of writing using GPT-3 to taking mushrooms and communing with gods. They write: “A deity that rules communication is an incorporeal linguistic power. A modern conception of such might read: a force of language from outside of materiality.” That force, Allado-McDowell suggests, might well be a useful way to think about artificial intelligence. The result of communing with it is a sort of “emergence,” they told me, an experience of “being part of a larger ecosystem than just the individual human or the machine.”

""It’s impossible that this exchange will only be good for us""

This, I think, is why AI writing is so much more exciting than many other applications of artificial intelligence: because it offers the chance for communication and collaboration. The urge to speak to something greater than ourselves is evident in how these programs are being embraced by early adopters. A number of individuals have used GPT-3 to talk to dead loved ones, for example, turning its statistical intelligence into an algorithmic ouija board. Though such experiments also reveal the limitations. In one of these cases, OpenAI shut down a chatbot shaped to resemble a developer’s dead fiancée because the program didn’t conform to the company’s terms of service. That’s another, less promising reality of these systems: the vast majority are owned and operated by corporations with their own interests, and they will shape their programs (and, in turn, their users) as they see fit. 

Despite this, I’m hopeful, or at least curious, about the future of AI writing. It will be a conversation with our machines; one that is diffuse and subtle, taking place across multiple platforms, where AI programs linger on the fringes of language. These programs will be unseen editors to news stories and blog posts, they will suggest comments in emails and documents, and they will be interlocutors that we even talk to directly. It’s impossible that this exchange will only be good for us, and that the deployment of these systems won’t come without problems and challenges. But it will, at least, be a dialogue.

It replaces the JEDI cloud-computing project that the Pentagon killed earlier this year.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesBy Daisuke Wakabayashi and Kate CongerPublished Nov. 3, 2021Updated Nov. 5, 2021Three years after an employee revolt forced Google to abandon work on a Pentagon program that used artificial intelligence, the company is aggressively pursuing a major contract to provide its technology to the military.The company’s plan to land the potentially lucrative contract, known as the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, could raise a furor among its outspoken work force and test the resolve of management to resist employee demands.In 2018, thousands of Google employees signed a letter protesting the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a military program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to refine the targeting of drone strikes. Google management caved and agreed to not renew the contract once it expired.The outcry led Google to create guidelines for the ethical use of artificial intelligence, which prohibit the use of its technology for weapons or surveillance, and hastened a shake-up of its cloud computing business. Now, as Google positions cloud computing as a key part of its future, the bid for the new Pentagon contract could test the boundaries of those A.I. principles, which have set it apart from other tech giants that routinely seek military and intelligence work.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe military’s initiative, which aims to modernize the Pentagon’s cloud technology and support the use of artificial intelligence to gain an advantage on the battlefield, is a replacement for a contract with Microsoft that was canceled this summer amid a lengthy legal battle with Amazon. Google did not compete against Microsoft for that contract after the uproar over Project Maven.The Pentagon’s restart of its cloud computing project has given Google a chance to jump back into the bidding, and the company has raced to prepare a proposal to present to Defense officials, according to four people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. In September, Google’s cloud unit made it a priority, declaring an emergency “Code Yellow,” an internal designation of importance that allowed the company to pull engineers off other assignments and focus them on the military project, two of those people said.On Tuesday, the Google cloud unit’s chief executive, Thomas Kurian, met with Charles Q. Brown, Jr., the chief of staff of the Air Force, and other top Pentagon officials to make the case for his company, two people said.Google, in a written statement, said it is “firmly committed to serving our public sector customers” including the Defense Department, and that it “will evaluate any future bid opportunities accordingly.”The contract replaces the now-scrapped Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, the Pentagon cloud computing contract that was estimated to be worth $10 billion over 10 years. The exact size of the new contract is unknown, although it is half the duration and will be awarded to more than one company, not to a single provider like JEDI. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt is unclear whether the work, which would provide the Defense Department access to Google’s cloud products, would violate Google’s A.I. principles, although the Defense Department has said the technology is expected to support the military in combat. But Pentagon rules about outside access to sensitive or classified data could prevent Google from seeing exactly how its technology is being used.The Defense Department said it would seek proposals from a limited set of companies that could meet its requirements. “As this is an active acquisition, we cannot provide any additional information related to this effort,” said Russell Goemaere, a spokesman for the department.

After a late start in selling its cloud computing technology to other organizations, Google has struggled to close the gap with Amazon and Microsoft, which have the two biggest cloud computing businesses. To bring in more big customers, Google hired Mr. Kurian, a longtime executive at the software company Oracle, to take over the business in 2018. He has beefed up the size of Google’s sales staff and pushed the company to compete aggressively for new contracts, including military deals.But Google employees have continued to resist some work pursued by the cloud unit. In 2019, they protested the use of artificial intelligence tools for the oil and gas industry. A year later, the company said it would not build custom A.I. software for the extraction of fossil fuels.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle started working on Project Maven in 2017 and prepared to bid for JEDI. Many Google employees believed Project Maven represented a potentially lethal use of artificial intelligence, and more than 4,000 workers signed a letter demanding that Google withdraw from the project.Soon after, Google announced a set of ethical principles that would govern its use of artificial intelligence. Google would not allow its A.I. to be used for weapons or surveillance, said Sundar Pichai, its chief executive, but would continue to accept military contracts for cybersecurity and search-and-rescue.Several months later, Google said it would not bid on the JEDI contract, although it was unlikely that the company had a shot at landing the deal: The Maven experience had soured the relationship between Google and the military, and Google lacked some of the security certifications needed to handle classified data.Google’s cloud business recently has done other work with the military. Since last year, Google has signed contracts with the U.S. Air Force for using cloud computing for aircraft maintenance and pilot training, as well as a U.S. Navy contract for using artificial intelligence to detect and predict the maintenance needs of facilities and vessels.Some Google workers believed the new contract would not violate the principles, a person familiar with the decision said, because the contract would enable generic uses of its cloud technology and artificial intelligence. The principles specifically state Google will not pursue A.I. that can be applied in “weapons or those that direct injury.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLucy Suchman, a professor of anthropology of science and technology at Lancaster University whose research focuses on the use of technology in war, said that with so much money at stake, it is no surprise Google might waver on its commitment.“It demonstrates the fragility of Google’s commitment to staying outside the major merger that’s happening between the D.O.D. and Silicon Valley,” Ms. Suchman said.Google’s efforts come as its employees are already pushing the company to cancel a cloud computing contract with the Israeli military, called Project Nimbus, that provides Google’s services to government entities throughout Israel. In an open letter published last month by The Guardian, Google employees called on their employer to cancel the contract.The Defense Department’s effort to transition to cloud technology has been mired in legal battles. The military operates on outdated computer systems and has spent billions of dollars on modernization. It turned to U.S. internet giants in the hope that the companies could quickly and securely move the Defense Department to the cloud.In 2019, the Defense Department awarded the JEDI contract to Microsoft. Amazon sued to block the contract, claiming that Microsoft did not have the technical capabilities to fulfill the military’s needs and that former President Donald J. Trump had improperly influenced the decision because of animosity toward Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s executive chairman and the owner of The Washington Post.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn July, the Defense Department announced that it could no longer wait for the legal fight with Amazon to resolve.

The dramatic rise of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has spotlit concerns about the role of technology in exam surveillance — and also in student cheating. 
Some universities have reported more cheating during the pandemic, and such concerns are unfolding in a climate where technologies that allow for the automation of writing continue to improve.
Over the past two years, the ability of artificial intelligence to generate writing has leapt forward significantly, particularly with the development of what’s known as the language generator GPT-3. With this, companies such as Google, Microsoft and NVIDIA can now produce “human-like” text.
AI-generated writing has raised the stakes of how universities and schools will gauge what constitutes academic misconduct, such as plagiarism. As scholars with an interest in academic integrity and the intersections of work, society and educators’ labour, we believe that educators and parents should be, at the very least, paying close attention to these significant developments.
AI & academic writing
The use of technology in academic writing is already widespread. For example, many universities already use text-based plagiarism detectors like Turnitin, while students might use Grammarly, a cloud-based writing assistant. Examples of writing support include automatic text generation, extraction, prediction, mining, form-filling, paraphrasing, translation and transcription.

Advancements in AI technology have led to new tools, products and services being offered to writers to improve content and efficiency. As these improve, soon entire articles or essays might be generated and written entirely by artificial intelligence. In schools, the implications of such developments will undoubtedly shape the future of learning, writing and teaching.



What if an essay was 100 per cent written by AI, but a student did much of the coding themselves?

Misconduct concerns already widespread
Research has revealed that concerns over academic misconduct are already widespread across institutions higher education in Canada and internationally. 
In Canada, there  is little data regarding the rates of misconduct. Research published in 2006 based on data from mostly undergraduate students at 11 higher education institutions found 53 per cent reported having engaged in one or more instances of serious cheating on written work, which was defined as copying material without footnoting, copying material almost word for word, submitting work done by someone else, fabricating or falsifying a bibliography, submitting a paper they either bought or got from someone else for free. 
Academic misconduct is in all likelihood under-reported across Canadian higher education institutions. 
There are different types of violations of academic integrity, including plagiarism, contract cheating (where students hire other people to write their papers) and exam cheating, among others. 
Unfortunately, with technology, students can use their ingenuity and entrepreneurialism to cheat. These concerns are also applicable to faculty members, academics and writers in other fields, bringing new concerns surrounding academic integrity and AI such as:

  If a piece of writing was 49 per cent written by AI, with the remaining 51 per cent written by a human, is this considered original work? 
  What if an essay was 100 per cent written by AI, but a student did some of the coding themselves?
  What qualifies as “AI assistance” as opposed to “academic cheating”?
  Do the same rules apply to students as they would to academics and researchers? 

We are asking these questions in our own research, and we know that in the face of all this, educators will be required to consider how writing can be effectively assessed or evaluated as these technologies improve. 
Augmenting or diminishing integrity?
At the moment, little guidance, policy or oversight is available regarding technology, AI and academic integrity for teachers and educational leaders. 
Over the past year, COVID-19 has pushed more students towards online learning — a sphere where teachers may become less familiar with their own students and thus, potentially, their writing. 
While it remains impossible to predict the future of these technologies and their implications in education, we can attempt to discern some of the larger trends and trajectories that will impact teaching, learning and research. 
Technology & automation in education
A key concern moving forward is the apparent movement towards the increased automation of education where educational technology companies offer commodities such as writing tools as proposed solutions for the various “problems” within education. 
An example of this is automated assessment of student work, such as automated grading of student writing. Numerous commercial products already exist for automated grading, though the ethics of these technologies are yet to be fully explored by scholars and educators.

Overall, the traditional landscape surrounding academic integrity and authorship is being rapidly reshaped by technological developments. Such technological developments also spark concerns about a shift of professional control away from educators and ever-increasing new expectations of digital literacy in precarious working environments.

      Precarious employment in education impacts workers, families and students




These complexities, concerns and questions will require further thought and discussion. Educational stakeholders at all levels will be required to respond and rethink definitions as well as values surrounding plagiarism, originality, academic ethics and academic labour in the very near future.

From driving around town to saving people from collapsed buildings, artificial intelligence holds the promise of making life easier and safer for a wide range of tasks.But AI-powered robots won’t be taking over the world like they do in the movies, at least not anytime soon, said Nathan McNeese, assistant professor and College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Dean’s Professor of Human-Centered Computing, director of the Team Research and Analytics in Computational Environments Research Group and director of the Clemson Data Lab at Clemson University.
Nathan McNeese has received three grants totaling more than $2.3 million over the past year to fund his work in artificial intelligence.
Rather, artificial intelligence and people will increasingly work together in teams, he said. McNeese, one of the world’s foremost experts on human-AI teams, is helping shape what those teams will look like and how they will work.“What we’re trying to do is leverage what humans do well and what artificial intelligence does well from an accuracy, vigilance and recognition standpoint,” McNeese said. “We know that humans are good at certain things, and technology is good at certain things. We’re trying to take the positives from both of these entities and pair them together in a meaningful way that benefits humans.”McNeese has received three grants totaling more than $2.3 million over the past year to fund his work.The Air Force Office of Scientific Research Trust and Influence program provided grants of $1.3 million and $587,000 for research into the spread of distrust and trust in multiple distributed human-AI teams, and the relationship of trust and ethics in human-AI teams. The Office of Naval Research provided $444,368 to help better understand how to mitigate potential bias in AI through better human interaction and interpretation.




This work is in addition to funding from the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Education, and the Army Research Office that have supported the broader goals of better integrating the relationship that humans have with AI. In total, McNeese has been supported with over $14 million of research funding support during his early career.Amy Apon, the C. Tycho Howle of the School of Computing at Clemson, said that McNeese’s interdisciplinary background makes him exceptionally well suited to conduct research in the field. McNeese holds a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a Ph.D. in information sciences and technology, both from The Pennsylvania State University, where his father, Michael McNeese, studied teams as a professor.“Nathan’s background positions him to have a major long-term impact on how humans and artificial intelligence work together in teams,” Apon said. “The federal funding is a continuing catalyst to the work by Dr. McNeese and his team and a testament to the quality of his scholarship in human-AI teaming, as well as the transformative potential of this new technology.”Benefiting humanityResearch into human-AI teams is a nascent field and rapidly evolving. AI and people are typically doing some limited work together at a low level, such as a person calling on Alexa or Siri for help, McNeese said. But the idea of making AI a team member with roles and responsibilities alongside humans is pushing the frontiers of research, and real-world examples are generally still lacking yet currently being researched and developed, he said. “We don’t want to see an abundance of human-AI teaming in the wild yet, until we can study it to inform design and implications for humans,” McNeese said. “We want to envision these scenarios where human-AI teaming is happening and test them out in the lab to see if it’s working, where the limitations are, where the positive benefits are and how we can improve on the dynamic in this context.”The transformation is coming, though, as artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, McNeese said. He expects that in his lifetime AI will at low levels be able to understand teamwork concepts, such as communication, coordination, and shared knowledge. But a Terminator-style robot apocalypse isn’t happening anytime soon, McNeese said. AI isn’t anywhere close to becoming a fully autonomous teammate that can exhibit effective teaming, he said. The goal of effective human-AI teaming is what McNeese and his team work towards. Further, what’s most important to McNeese is that AI serves humanity and not the other way around. “I spent a lot of time thinking whether this is a good idea and whether it is something we should be pursuing, and I am confident it can benefit humans if proper considerations are taken regarding fairness, equality, and ethics,” he said. “It’s all about making sure we’re benefitting the human.”Educating people about AIChris Flathmann, a third-year Ph.D. student in McNeese’s research group, said the recommendations the researchers make now could compound as AI develops in the coming decades.“While I don’t think the AI systems we’re building right now are going to be what you see 30 years in the future, I hope that what we’re doing now becomes influential and is an ultimate good for humanity,” Flathmann said. “You’ve got to put in that groundwork now, knowing you’re not going to see those 30-year results soon, but knowing that the groundwork is what makes those results possible.”One of the big challenges in creating human-AI teams is getting people to overcome their perceptions of what AI is and what it means to be on a team with AI, McNeese said. “Humans expect AI’s to act like other humans, and that’s a big, big ask,” McNeese said. “It’s  fair for people to ask, ‘If we are entering this new paradigm of human-AI teaming, shouldn’t it be better than human-human teaming?’ The answer is ‘absolutely yes,’ but getting to that point is going to be a process.”It will be important to educate people about artificial intelligence, its capabilities and how they can integrate with it, McNeese said. “We’re trying to design technology that makes your life easier,” he said. “It takes away things that you don’t want to do so you can focus on the things you want to do and what you as a human are uniquely qualified to do.”McNeese has seven Ph.D. students working alongside him and expects to add one more and a postdoctoral researcher by spring. He said that he prepares his students to be tenure-track faculty members at research-intensive universities, an education that will serve them well whether they opt for academia or industry.One of those Ph.D. students, Beau Schelble, is following in the footsteps of his advisor. He had an interest in team cognition and received a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Clemson before joining McNeese’s research group, where he studies human-AI teams.“Anytime we conduct research in the area and also when we look at what the other researchers are doing in this space, it becomes obvious and clear that this is where the future of work is heading,” Schelble said. “It’s so important that we as researchers get ahead of potential issues and we ensure this transition of human-AI interactions happens as smoothly as possible.”Anand Gramopadhye, dean of Clemson’s College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences, said that McNeese’s work adds to a growing portfolio of AI research at the University.“His unique, multidisciplinary background positions him for maximum impact as he and his students shape the future of how people interact with intelligent systems,” Gramopadhye said. “His grants are well deserved, and I offer him my wholehearted congratulations.”

The Cultural Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in the Enterprise
Findings from the 2021 Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Global Executive Study and Research Project








November 02, 2021


by: Sam Ransbotham, François Candelon, David Kiron, Burt LaFountain, and Shervin Khodabandeh


The 2021 MIT SMR-BCG report identifies a wide range of AI-related cultural benefits at both the team and organizational levels. Whether it’s reconsidering business assumptions or empowering teams, managing the dynamics across culture, AI use, and organizational effectiveness is critical to increasing AI’s value to an organization. This report offers a detailed analysis of a dynamic between culture, AI use, and organizational effectiveness.














The benefits of artificial intelligence go well beyond improved efficiency and decision-making. AI can also improve organizational effectiveness and strengthen teams and enterprise cultures.
Artificial intelligence can generate cultural as well as financial benefits for organizations. With AI systems in place, teams can perform tasks with more pride and confidence and collaborate more effectively: They can actually get stronger. These cultural benefits can penetrate the foundation of business operations, improving assumptions that drive organizational behaviors and ensuring the pursuit of smarter goals.
When conducting our research, we heard story after story from executives familiar with AI implementations in their organizations. The overarching message was clear and backed up by survey data: Business culture affects AI deployments, and AI deployments affect business culture.

The research and analysis for this report was conducted under the direction of the authors as part of an MIT Sloan Management Review research initiative in collaboration with and sponsored by Boston Consulting Group.

This MIT SMR-BCG report — based on a global survey of 2,197 managers and interviews with 18 executives — identifies a wide range of AI-related cultural benefits at both the team and organizational levels. Among survey respondents with AI implementations that improved efficiency and decision-making, for example, more than 75% also saw improvements in team morale, collaboration, and collective learning. Culture change from using AI transcends the legitimate, but myopic, promise that AI will liberate workers from drudgery.
These cultural changes are more than a side benefit. AI-related cultural and financial benefits build on each other. Survey respondents who saw significant financial benefits from their AI initiatives were 10 times more likely to change how they measure success than those who saw no such benefits. In some cases, AI helped leaders identify new performance drivers, which led to new assumptions, objectives, measures, and patterns of behavior, along with new areas of accountability. AI also helped these organizations realign behaviors and become more competitive.
Building a culture that supports innovation with AI has an effect on competitiveness. Our research found that respondents who use AI primarily to explore new ways of creating value are far more likely to improve their ability to compete with AI than those who use AI primarily to improve existing processes. Respondents who said they use AI primarily to explore were 2.7

It would be interesting to know if the mentioned benefits of AI use are not the same than those of, in its time, a CRM, or other technology or operational model like Design Thinking.
After a good implementation/adoption process, it is possible.

AI and the future of labor

November 2, 2021  Yong Suk Lee 














A wave of new automation technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics, have prompted concern about their substantial and potentially negative impact on jobs and workers in the near future. While technology can increase worker productivity and create jobs, it can also replace workers, especially when the technology explicitly aims to replace human jobs and tasks. News and popular media often portray a doomsday scenario where robots and artificial intelligence (AI) not only take over human jobs but also manage—or even control—human labor. 
Anxiety about machines replacing humans is not new. With every new major technological breakthrough, from steam-powered machines in the nineteenth century to industrial robots and then computers in the twentieth, people have expressed fear that technology would take over their jobs. With each major technological innovation, however, economic growth continued and jobs were created. With the invention of automobiles, stagecoach drivers disappeared but expansive automotive, transportation, and logistics industries emerged, employing millions of people in the US alone. 
If history serves as our guide, then, our concern that robots and AI will take over human jobs seems unfounded. Masters of their creations, humans can be expected to harness the new technologies, create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the same pattern will prevail with AI and advanced robotics. 
Right?
Perhaps. But this time around could be different. There are two reasons to be cautious—one related to the technology itself and the other to underlying economic forces at play.

AI algorithms are expanding into cognitive tasks traditionally thought to be the unique domain of skilled white collar professionals.

Both robotics and artificial intelligence have existed for decades. But only recently have computing power, data, algorithms, and automation technologies been able to perform both physical (robots) and predictive (AI) tasks with such complexity and accuracy—often outperforming humans. Robots today move around warehouses and shelve and lift heavy items. AI algorithms not only predict which items will be in demand by consumers, but order them and keep them in stock. Moreover, AI algorithms are expanding into cognitive tasks traditionally thought to be the unique domain of skilled white collar professionals, such as disease diagnosis from X-ray scans and sifting through hordes of financial statements to identify accounting anomalies. If a machine can learn from its surrounding environment, make judgement calls and perform physical tasks, that machine does seem to present new threats to human labor. Teslas are already doing this with autonomous driving. The machine identifies the best route, processes the surrounding environment to make turns and stops, and obviates the need for human driving. We probably will see more machines like Tesla in the factory and in the office. 
Another distinctive aspect at our current moment is the declining share of economic output that is attributed to labor or, put differently, the declining share of total wages, bonuses, and benefits going to workers. Labor’s share of the US national income has been decreasing for the past three decades, while income attributed to owning capital (e.g., capital gains, dividends, etc.) has been increasing. Furthermore, this declining labor share is going to a smaller number of high wage earners. In short, labor’s economic pie has been shrinking relative to the overall economy and a smaller number of people are enjoying a larger share of that shrinking pie.  There are multiple hypotheses for the declining power of labor to this point, but when AI and robotics replace tasks performed by humans, there is little doubt that human labor’s share of the economy will shrink at a faster rate.
What the research shows
How realistic are such concerns? The future is unknown, so there’s no definitive answer, but research can help us make informed predictions. From 1990 to 2007, the data shows, the adoption of industrial robots replaced jobs in the US economy. My own research finds that the negative effect of robots on jobs changes over time; in fact, in recent years, robot adoption led to the growth of local jobs, mainly driven by the automotive and related industries. The key to understanding new automation technology’s impact on labor is whether new task creation will be sufficient to offset the displacement caused by automation.
One industry in Elkhart, Indiana offers insight into this question. The RV industry is booming, and firms are expanding and desperately seeking skilled workers, even as automation increases. The adoption of automation technologies has made certain human tasks obsolete but also created demand for new tasks related to human-machine collaboration and machine software management that traditionally were not part of the manufacturing sector. However, it remains to be seen whether workers will benefit from the new demand, and which workers might benefit, given the fact that human-machine collaboration requires more technical and managerial skills. 

Workers who have the skills to interact productively with AI applications in their workplace will be rewarded in the labor market.

Given that AI adoption is relatively new and data on the adoption and usage of AI is still sparse, the research on the potential impact of AI or machine learning on labor is still nascent. Researchers have examined the task contents of occupations, however, and have made predictions as to which tasks are replaceable by machine learning algorithms. They have found that almost all occupations have some tasks that can be replaced by machine learning. At the same time, few, if any, occupations are expected to be replaced fully by machine learning. These findings suggest that workers in an increasing number of occupations will interact with AI applications as part of their jobs, whether the person is working in a factory, office, retail store, hospital, or law firm. 
Interacting productively with AI
The greater change driven by AI is less about which occupations will disappear and appear, but rather how the task contents of any given occupation will change when AI is introduced in the workplace, and what it means for workers of varying skills in different occupations.
For example, in the banking sector, one of the leading sectors of AI adoption, I find that there are relatively more job postings for knowledge workers, such as technicians, analysts, and managers, than for front-end jobs such as tellers and loan officers. When banks adopt AI, the demand for technical skills, computer skills, and risk assessment skills in all banking-related jobs increases.
In short, workers who have the skill sets to interact productively with AI applications in their workplace will be rewarded in the labor market. Working with AI algorithms and performing associated tasks may be an insurmountable burden to those with less training and education. This raises concern that the application of AI could exacerbate inequality in the workforce, with technologically sophisticated workers quickly leaving less skilled co-workers behind. 
That certain industries and workers will suffer when there is a negative trade or technology shock is not in itself new, and there are existing government programs that assist with job training for workers displaced by these shocks. But the scale at which AI could disrupt the workforce—both blue-collar and white-collar workers in multiple industries—warrants a reexamination of the policy responses to AI’s broader influence on labor.
Fortunately, we are still in the early stages of incorporating AI into work. At this point AI is merely an algorithm that firms choose to deploy for specific objectives. I have found that managers, when reminded of the potential for AI related regulation, tend to delay adoption of AI and consider the ethical consequences of AI. Specifically, they increase their awareness of workplace safety, data privacy, and the need for transparency. 

Integral human development demands that workers not be reduced to their functions.

Now is the right time to analyze the various issues that might arise when adopting AI and new automation technologies. We must establish analytical frameworks to determine more precisely how AI adoption might affect workers and their tasks in the workplace. Not least, we must create nuanced and compassionate policies to govern the recruiting and retraining of workers that will be essential as firms attempt to preserve and enhance the crucial human element of work. 
Integral human development demands that workers not be reduced to their functions. When their functions become obsolete, they become disposable—an unacceptable outcome. Educating and training current workers on the job, as well as preparing students to interact productively with the new technologies when they enter the workforce, seems a moral as well as economic imperative as we stride into the brave new world of Artificial Intelligence and robotics.

For those looking to understand the overall context of the progression of AI and some of the ethical/moral dilemmas which will face humankind in the near future, I do hope this piece will serve as an informative introduction.“The Frankenstein Hypothesis” serves as the background for a more extensive work published in October 2021 (‘Applied Marketing Analytics’ Volume 7 #2 a journal of Henry Stewart Publications) presenting the theory of “Emanating Confluence” dealing with the progression of Artificial Intelligence (AI) — from Chaos Theory to Complexity Theory to Emergence and then the Technological Singularity. (If interested, you are welcome to message me here in Medium or in LinkedIn for a complimentary PDF copy of “Emanating Confluence”).Abstract:Artificial Intelligence (AI) has penetrated all areas of society. Creating the correct constructs and algorithms within AI has become the ‘holy grail,’ guiding our decisions and rapidly overtaking every aspect of our lives.How do we define ‘thought?’ At what point is ‘intelligence’ presumed? When do we consider something ‘conscious?’ Is it possible to acquire consciousness?The paradox of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ seems absurd. An undisputed classification of ‘intelligence’ does not exist. ‘Thought-Thinking’ similarly does not have a universally accepted definition. How, then, without definitively characterizing these terms, are we expected to comprehend what AI means? When and where do we apply our technological capacities to achieve AI?As AI grows in potential, ‘consciousness’ becomes a crucial designation. How to define if an entity is conscious has become paramount. We are swiftly reaching a point where society will be forced to decide when and where thinking, intelligence, and possibly consciousness are fundamental components of non-human objects.For thousands of years, philosophers have attempted to define the ontological problem of ‘existence’ and ‘being,’ which is intrinsically connected to ‘thought,’ ‘intelligence,’ and ‘consciousness.’ However, the ‘thought-intelligence-consciousness’ quandary is not only ontological in composition but also lies at the heart of where AI is progressing.“The Frankenstein Hypothesis: Confronting the Implications & Ramifications of Artificial Intelligence” explores the dilemmas posed by AI. How is AI Evolving? What does the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ imply in an age where we can no longer control the exponential growth of AI? This article examines these fundamental questions offering an analysis of AI development, leading to humankind’s ultimate necessity to acknowledge and cope with the potential monster/benefactor looming in the background.Intelligence, Thinking & Consciousness“I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’”¹With that opening statement, in his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” delivered while working at the University of Manchester,² Alan Turing³ officially began the quest to achieve artificial intelligence (AI) without ever using the term ‘artificial intelligence.’ Though Turing immediately reconstructed his argument, due to the impossibility of defining the two words “machine” and “think,” the question remains in all its potency. We are still struggling with defining two terms: ‘intelligence’ and ‘thought.’ What do they mean? What truly defines intelligence? What is the primary classification of thinking? That three-word question “Can machines think?” (redefined as it was) forever changed the destiny of technological advancement.As in many great leaps of genius, one impetus for Turing’s thought process was due to a postulation made a century earlier by Lady Ada Lovelace⁴. Lady Lovelace is considered the original pioneer of computer programming in that she is credited with creating the world’s first computer algorithm.⁵Lady Lovelace was working on the “Analytical Engine,” a theoretical machine at the time, proposed by her mentor, Charles Babbage⁶, which would be capable of solving equations, precisely calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers. She wrote in her Notes on the proposed machine:The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.⁷Turing was convinced this statement, which he termed “Lady Lovelace’s Objection,”⁸ was wrong and set out to prove so.It would be amiss at this point to ignore the cliché “truth is stranger than fiction.” Lady Lovelace’s father, whom she was estranged from for her lifetime, was Lord Byron⁹. During a rainy summer in 1816, Lord Byron spent the summer with Mary Shelley¹⁰ in Geneva. Due to the incessant rain, Lord Byron and Mary Shelley began telling ghost and vampire stories, and thus the novel “Frankenstein” was first conceived, based on a whim of fate because of the weather.¹¹ A few years later, Lord Byron’s daughter, Lady Lovelace, supplied part of the original impetus for Alan Turing in her notes on the “Analytical Engine.” The Pandora Box Turing opened in technology has come back to haunt us in the true visage of Frankenstein. It leads one to ponder the nature of coincidence, the fates, karma, God, or whatever path we chose to believe or ignore.Five years after Turing asked his fundamental question, in 1955, “A Proposal for The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence”¹² was delivered. Less than a year later, in 1956, the first actual AI conference began at Dartmouth College.¹³ The term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ is credited to John McCarthy¹⁴, one of the proposal’s original authors.The ethical, philosophical, theological, moral, psychological, scientific, and theoretical constructs profoundly altered by Turing’s question should not be underestimated. AI had arrived, and humankind had no choice but to deal with it. Technology and innovation would not remain stationary.More than seventy years later, one will find the argument about defining ‘thought’ and ‘intelligence’ still raging at full force — even though the term ‘artificial intelligence’ — is now part of our natural lexicon. AI is the buzzword garnering the most attention in any technology discussion. It is considered by many the ‘holy grail,’ covering areas from robotics to decision making to the creation of self-evolving algorithms, which implies the self-evolution of intelligent thinking. (A superb summary of some of these topics can be found in Amy Webb’s “The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity.”¹⁵)“Cogito Ergo Sum” — “I Think, Therefore I Am”In 1637, the philosopher, René Descartes¹⁶, in his “Discourse on the Method”¹⁷ ¹⁸ and in 1644 in “Principles of Philosophy,” put forward his now-famous philosophical maxim: “Cogito, Ergo Sum” — “I think, therefore I am” (translated into French in 1647¹⁹ — “Je pense, donc je suis”), which has since caused agreement, debate, dissent, and consternation among ethicists and philosophers. Descartes’ statement implies quite simply — if one thinks, then one exists. However, what does ‘existence’ imply? Moreover, if we are compelled to consider the dilemma of existence that Descartes defines as thinking, what implications will develop upon our understanding of life’s structure?Does ‘thought’ (or ‘thinking’) imply intelligence? Furthermore, if so, does thinking and intelligence infer ‘consciousness’? In the era of AI, we cannot afford to be dismissive of such questions nor ignore their implications. Reams of books, journals, and thoughts have been published on this subject, and still, there is no consensus. Just a brief look at Wikipedia will only further complicate matters.Although thinking is an activity of an existential value for humans, there is still no consensus as to how it is adequately defined or understood.Because thought underlies many human actions and interactions, understanding its physical and metaphysical origins and its effects has been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, biology, sociology and cognitive science.Thinking allows humans to make sense of, interpret, represent or model the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires as it makes plans or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals.²⁰It should be clear to anyone involved in AI and its consequences that we are not only at the forefront of technology, but it touches upon every mode of thought, response, and reaction in all sciences and philosophies, which will cause deep rifts and reassessments of numerous preconceived notions.What Is Called Thinking?²¹One of the most peculiar and vexing realms of research attempts to arrive at a concrete definition of ‘thought’ or ‘thinking.’ The above statement quoted from Wikipedia places the dilemma in its proper context: “Although thinking is an activity of an existential value for humans, there is still no consensus as to how it is adequately defined or understood.”²²The Cambridge Dictionary defines ‘thought’ as “the act of thinking about or considering something, an idea or opinion, or a set of ideas about a particular subject”²³ and “thinking” as “the activity of using your mind to consider something.”²⁴ These definitions are an excellent example of circular reasoning, leaving us with no fundamental understanding of what ‘thought’ truly is.Bloom’s taxonomy²⁵, created in the 1950s, attempted to categorize thinking into six primary areas:1. Knowledge2. Comprehension3. Application4. Analysis5. Synthesis6. EvaluationHowever, though Bloom’s taxonomy may define different elements and processes of thinking, ranking them in order of complexity, it does little to explain how we can precisely define the process of ‘thinking.’²⁶Perhaps the most notable of all the books written by the philosopher and phenomenologist Martin Heidegger²⁷ is entitled “What is Called Thinking?” based upon lecture courses he gave during the winter and summer semesters of 1951 and 1952 at the University of Freiburg.²⁸ As he wrote: “Most thought-provoking in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking.”²⁹ The statement is undoubtedly a potent accusation against humankind. Nevertheless, it still does not answer the fundamental question, “What is called thinking?” Heidegger himself was conflicted by the terminology though he does attempt a cogent and fascinating look at the thinking process.We shall never learn what ‘is called’ swimming, for example, or what it ‘calls for,’ by reading a treatise on swimming. Only the leap into the river tells us what is called swimming. The question ‘what is called thinking?’ can never be answered by proposing a definition of the concept thinking, and then diligently explaining what is contained in that definition. In what follows, we shall not think about what thinking is. We remain outside that mere reflection which makes thinking its object.³⁰Without extensive research and a deep dive into phenomenology and existentialism, Heidegger’s definition of thinking seems to be as elusive as ever. We remain with the paradox that states — thinking is, well, thinking or experiencing some indefinable activity and then employing a definitive phrase to explain the experience.The Turing Test & The Chinese RoomWhen Turing first proposed his famous question “Can machines think?” he immediately restructured the question to avoid problematic definitions, especially for the word ‘intelligence,’ as Turing realized there would be an immediate equation between ‘think’ and ‘intelligence.’I propose to consider the question, “Can machines think?” This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms “machine” and “think.” The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words “machine” and “think” are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, “Can machines think?” is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.”³¹Turing called his replacement the “The Imitation Game.” While there is still debate on what Turing was attempting to accomplish, The Imitation Game is one of the most crucial points which led us into the age of Artificial Intelligence. (One can find a thorough description of The Imitation Game in Turing’s original article³² or on Wikipedia³³.) However, even after seventy years, there is a continuous discussion as to whether the “Turing test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human, but rather whether a computer could imitate a human.”³⁴However, in Turing’s article, one paragraph turned out to be prophetic, and it leads the reader directly to the heart of our thesis.The original question, “Can machines think?” I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted. I believe further that no useful purpose is served by concealing these beliefs. The popular view that scientists proceed inexorably from well-established fact to well-established fact, never being influenced by any improved conjecture, is quite mistaken. Provided it is made clear which are proved facts and which are conjectures, no harm can result. Conjectures are of great importance since they suggest useful lines of research.³⁵Turing’s prophetic hypothesis, whose importance cannot be underestimated in the age of AI, has been challenged repeatedly. However, the most significant opposition comes from the “Chinese Room Thought Experiment”³⁶ developed by John Searle³⁷ in 1980 (the entire scope of this experiment can be found in Searle’s paper), a different Turing Test implementation. Turing wrote:I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.³⁸Nevertheless, Searle posed tough questions based on ‘consciousness.’ Indeed, as the Chinese Room developed into a significant debate, Searle became adamant that consciousness was at the core of the whole argument. Therefore, the consequences of the Chinese Room become paramount.The Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot be shown to have a “mind,” “understanding,” or “consciousness,” regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.³⁹Alternatively, as Searle himself says in his abstract:“Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.⁴⁰Imagination & KnowledgeAlbert Einstein expressed just how conflicted pure science can be when speculating upon the future when he stated “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”⁴¹ Even those grounded in the mathematics of science recognize that virtually nothing would move forward without the use of imagination and a profound gift to envision a different future. Innovation would be a non-entity in such a world.Science fiction often becomes a reality, though it also reveals momentous questions about our central topic on thought and intelligence. For instance, can we place “Frankenstein”⁴² in the realm of thought and consciousness? Mary Shelley⁴³ wrote a ghost story, which would create a whole new writing genre known as “horror.”⁴⁴ It is questionable if she ever contemplated the philosophical questions, debates, and arguments her story would engender. Nevertheless, Frankenstein did express thoughts and emotions, and though made of flesh, it can be argued there is no longer a great divide between the flesh of the monster named Frankenstein and the cold metal of machinery.Science fiction is replete with such incidents. Authors such as Arthur C. Clarke⁴⁵, Isaac Asimov⁴⁶, who first used the term “robotics,”⁴⁷ Frank Herbert in his “Dune” Saga⁴⁸, have often been considered prophets rather than just story-weavers of a dystopian future. Indeed, the Dune Saga is religiously adherent to the law of “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.”⁴⁹In the ground-breaking movie by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, released in 1968, “2001: A Space Odyssey”, we are introduced to “HAL,” a sentient (read “thinking, intelligent and conscious” computer) hell-bent on destruction. Observe that even the name HAL has prophetic connotations. “H” is the letter before “I”; “A” the letter before “B”; “L” the letter before “M” — thus spelling “IBM” which produced the AI machine, “Watson,”⁵⁰ demonstrating natural language capabilities for the first time in 2011 on the television show ‘Jeopardy.’⁵¹ ⁵²Was “2001: A Space Odyssey” a self-fulfilling prophecy, a lucky guess, imagination, coincidence, or just creative movie making? Perhaps only Einstein could offer us an insight into the answer. “…the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”⁵³Summoning the Demon — The Perils of Artificial IntelligenceWe are beyond debating the possibility of AI implementation, as it has become a reality and continues to be enhanced and augmented by ever-evolving systems, constructs, and algorithms. We need to face the perils and dangers that AI can one day impose upon our reality. Surprisingly the warnings on the use of AI and its continuous integration into our daily lives come from technology leaders whom, one would at first assume, should be the most fervent proponents of AI.Elon Musk⁵⁴ said of AI back in 2014:I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful,” said Musk. “I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish…With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it’s like — yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon. Doesn’t work out…⁵⁵Musk has constantly reiterated this sentiment over the years.AI is the rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive. Because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it’ll be too late,” Musk told the meeting. “AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation.⁵⁶Musk is not alone and has very interesting bedfellows in his concerns. Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft,⁵⁷ expressed his worries about the advancement of AI.I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well,” Gates wrote. “A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don’t understand why some people are not concerned.⁵⁸The physicist, Stephen Hawking⁵⁹, also had serious concerns about AI.The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.⁶⁰Yuval Noah Harari⁶¹ has consistently and continuously warned in his recent trio of books on unfettered AI dangers. However, one quote should grab our attention immediately.What will happen to the job market once artificial intelligence outperforms humans in most cognitive tasks? What will be the political impact of a massive new class of economically useless people? What will happen to relationships, families and pension funds when nanotechnology and regenerative medicine turn eighty into the new fifty? What will happen to human society when biotechnology enables us to have designer babies, and to open unprecedented gaps between rich and poor?⁶²Perhaps the direst warnings come from the New York Times bestseller, “Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,”⁶³ written by philosopher Nick Bostrom.⁶⁴ He argues that ‘superintelligence’ is marked when machine brains surpass human brains’ capacity and could become the dominant lifeform.This is quite possibly the most important and most daunting challenge humanity has ever faced. And — whether we succeed or fail — it is probably the last challenge we will ever face.⁶⁵Since a machine can improve its capabilities faster than a human, this would cause an existential cataclysm. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and many others endorsed this mode of thinking, being very wary of AI repercussions, as we have shown above.Enhancing Life — The Rewards of Artificial IntelligenceWhile surveying the perils of AI, we also must give equal voice to the rewards offered to us by using AI. AI’s positive influence has embedded itself within the medical sciences, where AI affects everything from research to actual diagnosis. AI saves lives, enhances living, and acts as a critical preventive factor to avert disease advancement.AI has spread its tentacles into every aspect of society and technology. Many of these advancements are constructive, allowing for enormous leaps in the progression towards a more competent and safer environment.Though coming out strongly against non-regulated AI, Elon Musk has also invested tens of millions of dollars in AI projects, such as OpenAI⁶⁶, Future of Life Institute⁶⁷, and DeepMind⁶⁸.Mark Hurd⁶⁹, who was the CEO of Oracle, coined the term “the Terminator argument” (based upon the science fiction “Terminator” movie franchise) and dismissed worries about AI, arguing the benefits far out way the dangers. He tweeted: “Good give and take with industry analysts about risks of #AI. I’m less worried about the Terminator than the economic risk of not leading in it because it will create more jobs than it destroys.”⁷⁰‘Ontological Technology’ — The Thought-Intelligence-Consciousness QuandaryThe above should legitimately lead us into a discussion of ‘narrow or weak AI’⁷¹ versus ‘general or strong AI’⁷² and a host of other philosophical debates on the convergence of humanity with AI.⁷³ However, the ultimate questions remain. What is the meaning of thought? When can we categorically state something is endowed with intelligence? How do we define consciousness? Due to these questions, it is impossible to ignore a reference to Ontology.Ontology is dictionary defined as:a branch of metaphysics concerned with the nature and relations of being” and alternatively as “a particular theory about the nature of being or the kinds of things that have existence.⁷⁴More comprehensive:Ontology is the branch of philosophy that studies concepts such as existence, being, becoming, and reality. It includes the questions of how entities are grouped into basic categories and which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level. Ontology is traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics.⁷⁵The questions we are posing are ontological by nature, originating in metaphysics, causing us to, yet again, examine the centuries-long argument over the meaning of ‘existence’ and ‘being.’⁷⁶ Yet this debate has now been inexorably altered — a drastic change is occurring. Humankind no longer has the luxury to ponder for thousands of years seeking an answer. The science of AI moves with incredible rapidity, causing a crisis in judgment and wisdom while heading towards a new era of ‘ontological technology.’Dividing AI into various classifications, such as ‘narrow,’ ‘strong,’ or ‘super,’ does not alleviate the predicament. An AI algorithm developed to detect the beginnings of a life-threatening event, is by all accounts, a laudable and remarkable achievement. Nonetheless, once that algorithm exists, it can be tweaked or subtly changed for other purposes.Since AI algorithms permeate every aspect of technology and society, each becomes a piece in a massive jigsaw puzzle waiting to be assembled. Under such circumstances, the ramifications of ‘Complexity Science’⁷⁷ where “the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects”⁷⁸ cannot be ignored. Complexity will lead to a Singularity Event⁷⁹ ⁸⁰.What, then, is the Singularity? It’s a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed. Although neither utopian nor dystopian, this epoch will transform the concepts that we rely on to give meaning to our lives, from our business models to the cycle of human life, including death itself. Understanding the Singularity will alter our perspective on the significance of our past and the ramifications for our future.⁸¹‘Emergence’⁸² where “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” during and after a Singularity then takes on immense significance. Simply put, a comprehensive AI system will exhibit properties that are not apparent nor predictable from the study of each part. Interaction between segments causes the emergence of an entirely new entity, which in turn, will force upon us the most fundamental of dilemmas and decisions.The terms’ thought,’ ‘intelligence,’ and crucially, ‘consciousness’ still have no accurate, objective, nor universally accepted definition. The situation is perplexing and proposes a disconcerting quandary in an age where the term AI is used with such frequency and abandon. If we cannot define AI, how does one achieve it? More to the point, if we have no real idea of what intelligence, nor thought, nor consciousness are, then the most challenging question of all looms before us. What defines life? How do we distinguish between a living being and a computer?The Frankenstein HypothesisThe previous mention of Frankenstein in this article was not made from any prosaic desire to allude to the horror genre. It lies at the core of our thesis.Imagine two experimental scenarios:A team of scientists, cautiously, step by step, replace the parts of a live human with computerized (mechanical) equivalents. Arms and legs are substituted with robotics, including face, stomach, and even sex appendages are interchanged by working mechanical robotic parts. Fluids are replaced by chemicals that duplicate the function of all the fluids in the original live human. Slowly, this once flesh and blood and human turns into a ‘machine.’ The scientists then replace the brain and heart with a set of mechanical devices and chips capable of emotions and thought. Exactly duplicating these organs as they would be in a human.The second team of scientists builds a machine with all the same components to make it look and function as a human being. It has all the first experiment elements — except it has been built from its very inception with mechanical parts and does not take a live person and slowly replace their various biological parts. In our lexicon, we call this a ‘robot.’Just to complicate matters, both these scenarios produce identical twins. They look the same, have all the same parts, function in the same manner, and make decisions based on thought and intelligence.Notice the word ‘consciousness’ was explicitly left out. Scenario #1 does contain consciousness, by the very definition of its source, as its origins are a human being. In contrast, implying consciousness to Scenario #2 is questionable — due to the raging argument over consciousness and its definition. Even with such an astounding achievement, it remains a mystery if a non-conscious artifact can achieve consciousness.In the book “The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory,”⁸³ the philosopher, David Chalmers⁸⁴, exhorts us to arrive at a fundamental law of consciousness — something we have not yet achieved. The ‘consciousness’ debate only serves to exacerbate the difficulties in the Frankenstein Hypothesis.Since both these scenarios are now supposedly “mechanical” in nature, let us presume for the moment, they contain an ‘on-off’ switch. Now, take a moment to consider the following dilemma:Would one have any ethical or moral dilemma in turning off the mechanical duplicate of a human in Scenario #2? It is a machine — a robot, no matter how well the computerization works. Is there any ethical or moral imperative to stop an individual from flicking the off switch, even if they were convinced this machine could ‘think’ or is imbued with ‘intelligence’?Now ask the same question regarding Scenario #1. In this scenario, initially, a live person, who had all parts replaced by mechanical and computerized parts, becomes a ‘robot.’ Could one switch off that ‘machine’ at any time without calling it ‘murder?’ Can we ignore the looming question of ‘consciousness’ or if we wish ‘soul’ hidden behind those metal parts?Frightening, horrifying, terrifying, outrageous, enraging, maddening. An incessant glossary expressing strong emotions comes to mind when reflecting upon the consequences wrought from flicking that switch to ‘off’ in Scenario #1.Do not think the above scenario is just a hypothetical ethical-moral dilemma in the age of AI. One need only look at the ongoing GPT-3⁸⁵ ⁸⁶ project (created and run by OpenAI mentioned above) to wonder not if — but when the “Frankenstein Hypothesis” will become a genuine dilemma⁸⁷. While there is a cogent argument that GPT-3 will not bring us closer to natural intelligence in a machine⁸⁸ ⁸⁹, it is critical to reiterate that we have no universal acceptance of the meaning of that word — intelligence. If in 2021, a machine created by humans can ‘lie’ and admit it has lied but refuse to tell you how, where or when it has done so, profound paradoxes must be confronted.⁹⁰ Furthermore, with the recent addition of DALL-E⁹¹ to GPT-3, an image generator based upon visual concept creation and manipulation, be they real or fantasy depictions, without using “stock photos” and only based upon short textual requests transforms the GPT-3 project into an era of conceptualizing imagination to reality.⁹² ⁹³DeepMind⁹⁴ is considered an alternative competitor to the GPT-3 project, and Musk, who was intimately involved in the project, stated about AI: “Unless you have direct exposure to groups like DeepMind, you have no idea how fast — it is growing at a pace close to exponential.”⁹⁵Musk recently announced that his startup Neuralink Corp. wired the brain of a monkey to play video games. Such an achievement is inching us closer to embodying thinking and intelligence into machines.⁹⁶If we allow another thirty to fifty years to enhance the GPT-3, DeepMind, and other projects that will come after, at what point will we be applying the words’ thought,’ ‘intelligence,’ and even ‘consciousness’ to the machine? When will the Frankenstein Hypothesis become a fundamental enigma requiring unconditional answers because not only thought and intelligence develop, but consciousness has been achieved? When will the machine evolve to the ‘state of being’ where it will become impossible to simply flick ‘off’ the on-off switch?No science fiction addict can resist comparing “The Terminator Franchise”⁹⁷ to the Frankenstein Hypothesis. In “Terminator: Salvation”⁹⁸ (the fourth movie in the installment), the character Marcus Wright makes the following statement:What is it that makes us human? It’s not something you can program. You can’t put it into a chip. It’s the strength of the human heart. The difference between us and machines.⁹⁹Is the above statement accurate? Is the “strength of the human heart” all that differentiates us from machines? Furthermore, if we accept this premise, what will happen when we can endow a machine with consciousness? Does this not imply the machine now has “the strength of the human heart?” Or are we implying that one requires a ‘soul’? Furthermore, is not the very definition of a soul categorized by consciousness?The questions raised are exasperating even maddening in their formulation and resolutions. The dilemma calls to mind a quote from Horace Mann: “The living soul of man, once conscious of its power, cannot be quelled.”¹⁰⁰ Imagine then, for one moment, what a computer conscious of its power would be capable of doing!The Frankenstein Hypothesis should frighten us way beyond the original Frankenstein running amok in our neighborhood and forcing a decision if we can morally kill Frankenstein, as he-it might be human. We can no longer ignore the consequences of the hypothesis, nor can we lay the entire weight of such decisions upon future generations. While most desire AI to improve humankind, our quest for AI has also forced upon society judgments and decisions (just consider the military and arms race), which would be a grave mistake to ignore.Advancements in AI are immediately applied within our computer technology, often with no thought about the consequences. We find ourselves no longer in the realm of a theoretical problem left to the realm of technologists, philosophers, theologists, ethicists, and moralists. If we do not approach the problem with the caution it deserves, AI will soon direct our mode of thinking, as it already severely affects the choices we make and how we interact.As a point of proof, just consider all the AI currently applied to Social Networks and Marketing. Our thought process is no longer ‘independent,’ but AI influences every decision we make — the information we read, what we look at, and soon, how we react to the information exposed to our brains. Moreover, even the information within our minds will be selected and censored based on AI. The point of no return will come, where we will not even dare to consider the possibility of an ‘on-off’ switch, and that in-and-of-itself is a danger which we cannot afford to overlook.Gazing into the AbyssThe Lord God formed man (Adam) from the dust of the earth, He blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being.¹⁰¹These words from the Old Testament express one of the many attributes we naturally ascribe to a Supreme Being — “He blew into his nostrils the breath of life.” We, too, can partake in this model of creation as Mother Nature and its laws have granted us the capability to produce progeny. However, there is a primary difference between reproduction in nature and the entity known as God. We generate life through a union. At the very least in monotheistic faith, God can breathe “the breath of life” into an inanimate object and requires no partner to accomplish such an act.No argument can become more contentious and controversial than attempting to determine an approximate definition of ‘God.’ Characterizing God varies dramatically from religion to religion and even among those who ascribe to the same faith, from individual to individual. Philosophers throughout the centuries have argued for the existence or non-existence of a Supreme Being.¹⁰² Merriam-Webster defines God in many ways. However, it begins with the notion that God is “the supreme or ultimate reality.”¹⁰³ Wikipedia makes a valiant attempt at describing the concept of God.God, in monotheistic thought, is conceived of as the supreme being, creator, and principal object of faith. God is usually conceived of as being omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), omnipresent (all-present) and omnibenevolent (all-good) as well as having an eternal and necessary existence. God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial). God’s incorporeality or corporeality is related to conceptions of God’s transcendence (being outside nature) or immanence (being in nature); Chinese theology exhibits a synthesis of both notions.¹⁰⁴As has been shown, the Frankenstein Hypothesis inevitably leads us towards fundamental questions of ‘existence’ and ‘being.’ Advances in AI will cause a philosophical and theological rift, forcing humankind towards a reevaluation of the essence of what the term ‘God’ means. Those who believe in some omnipresent, immortal, omniscient being responsible for the original creation must deal with these ramifications. Moreover, even if one is agnostic or atheist, it still does not discount nor allow for the dismissal of the Frankenstein Hypothesis’s moral-ethical dilemma.The ultimate questions now lie before us in a paradox of complex simplicity. When we reach the point of creating a machine where consciousness ensues, and the use of the on-off switch becomes a moral-ethical dilemma, have we, too, become omnipotent Gods? At that point, can we declare that humankind is capable of breathing the breath of life into a nonliving entity? As we continue our intellectual and technological quest while ignoring the consequences of our actions, will our addiction to power grow beyond restraint? Will AI then lead us towards immortality through our creations? Are we destined to conceive of ourselves as ‘Mortal Gods’? As Yuval Noah Harari stated so elegantly, “And having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods, and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus.”¹⁰⁵There is an intricate though primary inference made in our evolution towards ‘Mortal Gods,’ of if one wishes “Homo Deus” (derived from Latin — “Homo” meaning man or human and “Deus” meaning God.) Once we grant ourselves the privilege to such a designation, especially as AI continues to evolve into omniscience, turning ‘off’ the on-off switch will no longer genuinely concern us. As Gods, we can give and take life without any consideration of the moral-ethical dilemmas involved.As Harari et al. clarified, “Divinity isn’t a vague metaphysical quality. And it isn’t the same as omnipotence.”¹⁰⁶ Reaching the point of creating consciousness in a machine requires only a minor leap towards perceiving ourselves as ‘creators’ and ‘Gods.’ And if that reckoning is made, just as we can create life through awarding consciousness — we will be able to take it away applying the same reasoning. It is difficult not to recall Job’s famous words after he lost all his children: “As the Lord gives, the Lord takes away.”¹⁰⁷This is a terrifying, disturbing, and unnerving reflection with unimaginable consequences. Nevertheless, it is the inevitable, logical conclusion when we achieve the goal of consciousness in a once inanimate object. The words of Friedrich Nietzsche¹⁰⁸ become prophetic when considered regarding the Frankenstein Hypothesis.He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.¹⁰⁹A New Type of Thinking Is EssentialIn Nick Bostrom’s book “Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,” mentioned above, he writes:Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing with a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct. Superintelligence is a challenge for which we are not ready now and will not be ready for a long time. We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though if we hold the device to our ear we can hear a faint ticking sound.¹¹⁰Einstein heard that “faint ticking sound” when he realized with absolute horror what the actual consequences of splitting the atom were in terms of war. In the following interview by the New York Times, he expressed his thoughts on the matter.Our world faces a crisis as yet unperceived by those possessing power to make great decisions for good or evil. The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe. We scientists who released this immense power have an overwhelming responsibility in this world life-and-death struggle to harness the atom for the benefit of mankind and not for humanity’s destruction… We need…a nation-wide campaign to let people know that a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.¹¹¹Einstein appeals for a “new type of thinking” so that humanity may survive. It may be his genius, his integrity, his own experiences, and the destruction unleashed which caused this call for action. However, above all, Einstein’s wisdom was gained through great pain and the ability to imagine a better world.When one reads the quote above, we can easily replace the original words of “the atom” with “artificial intelligence” — and the similarity is chilling and haunting. If we chose to ignore the impending consequences, as AI becomes gifted with thought and intelligence, and we continue to advance unimpeded towards a world where ‘consciousness’ develops in what was once a mechanical creation — and there is a strong possibility this will take place within the next fifty years — we have once again opened Pandora’s Box as we did at Los Alamos in the dawn of the age of the Atom Bomb.We may have set about to create incredible advancements for humanity only to discover we have reached an impasse. Once released over seventy years ago, AI has not remained stationary nor static, constantly advancing in ways that often defy prediction. The Frankenstein Hypothesis will soon not be in the realm of theory but part of our daily lives. Superintelligence will descend upon us with no defense against it. In hurtling towards advanced AI, we absolutely must apply a “new way of thinking.” If we chose to ignore this, the words of J. Robert Oppenheimer¹¹², as he confronted the creation his leadership was responsible for, will come back to haunt us in all their horror.We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, “Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” I suppose we all thought that one way or another.¹¹³Humankind is resilient. Though coming dangerously close to atomic destruction numerous times, we have managed through willpower, restraint, and no small measure of fear to avoid mutual annihilation. For the moment, we bask in the accomplishments of AI and how AI is facilitating all areas of society. However, the shadow of Frankenstein is always looming in the background, getting larger with each passing month. Will we allow it to grow unchecked, or will we place limits upon this creation? Will limitations even help if thought, intelligence, and later, consciousness develop? Are we capable of recognizing the moment in time when AI reaches these objectives?We have no possibility of curbing our curiosity nor inventiveness — they define our existence.No law or regulation will restrict our inherent inventiveness as technology advances. As Albert Einstein told the generations to come:The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.¹¹⁴AI is embedded in everything we do, in all the companies that exert control over our lives and the data collected, used, and analyzed.¹¹⁵ Still, we must remain vigilant and apply a measure of wise restraint as we look over our shoulder, seeing Frankenstein waiting patiently in the background.Hopefully, before we reach the point where we can no longer agree if it is morally or ethically possible to use the on-off switch, this same inventiveness, willpower, restraint, fear, and no small measure of wisdom will offer us another answer, not yet seen nor perceived.It may be tempting to be dismissive and trivialize the Frankenstein Hypothesis, applying the old Yiddish maxim, “Mann Tracht, Un Gott Lacht,” meaning, “Man Plans, and God Laughs.” However, the unrestrained advancement of AI no longer allows civilization the luxury of feigned ignorance. We must immediately begin to strive towards a solution where humankind and AI will maintain their separate but not equal positions in our universe.One central project will be to protect humankind and the planet as a whole from the dangers inherent in our own power.¹¹⁶References:[1] Turing, A.M.

Ask a Buffalo State Expert: Data Scientist Discusses Job Outlook in Era of Artificial Intelligence





November 3, 2021




  By Laurie Kaiser
















Maybe 2021 hasn’t quite reached the reality depicted in Blade Runner, Ridley Scott’s science fiction film featuring bioengineered humans, but there’s no denying that robots and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly finding their place in the world and the workplace.
Recent worker shortages and higher labor costs have resulted in more automated jobs, including service and professional jobs economists once considered safe. Predictions are mixed on job losses going forward, although the World Economic Forum (WEF) concluded in a 2020 report that “a new generation of smart machines, fueled by rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs.”
Joaquin Carbonara, Buffalo State College professor of mathematics, weighed in on AI’s effect on the job market now and in the future.








 









 
Name: Joaquin Carbonara
Title: Buffalo State College Professor of Mathematics
Originally from Venezuela, Carbonara joined the Buffalo State College faculty in 1992 after receiving his doctorate in mathematics from the University of California, San Diego. He coordinates Buffalo State’s Data Science and Analytics Interdisciplinary Unit and directs the data science and analytics master of science program. He has published peer-reviewed papers in the fields of fractals, combinatorics, geoinformatics, biophysics, material science, and data science, and has received over $1 million in grants from the National Science Foundation.






 
What’s driving this trend?
So many facets of AI, including translators, facial recognition software, and self-driving cars, are now available because of one type of raw material: data. It’s the gold of our times.
All the revolutions we’ve gone through—agricultural, industrial, and now, informational, are based on technology and have forced a realignment of day-to-day life. When the Model T was invented, people selling horses lost jobs. When Hollywood introduced sound in the late 1920s, silent actors with horrible voices lost jobs. Today’s realignment creates the chance to do things differently, more efficiently, and sometimes better.
Look at blockchain technology. It's also referred to as distributed ledger technology (DLT). Blockchain stores encrypted blocks of data, then chains them together. It makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent and guarantees a document is correct. When you buy a house, for instance, you’re paying lots of people to make sure everything is in place. With cryptography, all the documents are accurately completed at once. It’s faster and cheaper for the consumer.
What jobs are robots taking?
Manufacturing jobs have been automated for a long time. Now, it’s jobs that have to do with information—accounting, billing, purchasing, etc. Our world is based on paperwork, and there is so much waste. Robots can improve the flow of information and keep track of things accurately.
However, robots are not independent. They can do mechanical tasks over and over, but they can’t explain—yet—the reasons behind the tasks. Humans are still needed to create the technology and to ensure it’s working the way it’s intended.
But without further training, there is a segment of the workforce that will be unemployable. A 2020 study reported in TIME magazine estimates that about 400,000 jobs were lost to automation in U.S. factories from 1990 to 2007. In addition, the U.S. shed around 40 million jobs at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, and while some jobs have come back, some will never return.
Is AI creating jobs?
All service, manufacturing, entertainment, research and development, government and nonprofit organizations and companies are creating data analytics departments to process data—collect, clean, transform, model, and visualize—for the purpose of accountability, business planning, forecasting, and decision making.
During Buffalo’s 43 North Competition in late October, the chief information officer of M&T Bank said that the United States has about 2 million jobs in the technology/data analytics area that the current economy hasn’t been able to fill.
Is AI reliance dangerous for society?
One AI tool considered dangerous is generative pre-training (GPT). It’s deep machine learning based on technology that mimics the brain. Experts have predicted that GPT is so powerful, it can be maliciously misused by everyone from politicians to news outlets. One example is the automation of news summaries by media. The automation removes the human in the process, and the headlines may receive a one-sided or negative slant.
Also, the new stage of machine learning is prescriptive, meaning humans are not part of the final decision. For self-driving cars, it protects us from bad drivers. But when you apply for a job online, a robot decides if you’re accepted or rejected for an interview. AI can also essentially fire workers. A school district in Washington, D.C., fired 206 teachers in one day in 2011, partially because of performance standards set by AI algorithms.
What is the upside of AI?
I think the information revolution will fix many mistakes from the past. In the industrial revolution, there was a one-size-fits-all model for most goods and services. Now, everything is more specialized and tailor-made—from food to clothing to entertainment.
Also, humans have been really good at messing things up, especially the environment. With increased technology and AI, we can minimize our carbon footprint while optimizing benefits in an ongoing age of exponential growth in wealth.

Day after day, we hear stories about systems and machines taking on tasks that, until very recently, we saw as the exclusive and permanent preserve of humankind: making medical diagnoses, drafting legal documents, designing buildings, and even composing music.Our concern here, though, is with something even more striking: the prospect of high-level machine intelligence systems that outperform human beings at essentially every task. This is not science fiction. In a recent survey the median estimate among leading computer scientists reported a 50% chance that this technology would arrive within 45 years.Time until machines outperform humans, featured in the report ""Positive AI Economic Futures"". Source: Grace et al., 2018.Importantly, that survey also revealed considerable disagreement. Some see high-level machine intelligence arriving much more quickly, others far more slowly, if at all. Such differences of opinion abound in the recent literature on the future of AI, from popular commentary to more expert analysis.Yet despite these conflicting views, one thing is clear: if we think this kind of outcome might be possible, then it ought to demand our attention. Continued progress in these technologies could have extraordinarily disruptive effects – it would exacerbate recent trends in inequality, undermine work as a force for social integration, and weaken a source of purpose and fulfilment for many people.Experts gather to share their AI visionsIn April 2020, an ambitious initiative called Positive AI Economic Futures was launched by Stuart Russell and Charles-Edouard Bouée, both members of the World Economic Forum’s Global AI Council (GAIC). In a series of workshops and interviews, over 150 experts from a wide variety of backgrounds gathered virtually to discuss these challenges, as well as possible positive Artificial Intelligence visions and their implications for policymakers. Those included Madeline Ashby (science fiction author and expert in strategic foresight), Ken Liu (Hugo Award-winning science fiction and fantasy author), and economists Daron Acemoglu (MIT) and Anna Salomons (Utrecht), among many others. What follows is a summary of these conversations, developed in the Forum's report Positive AI Economic Futures.What will constitute 'work' in a future Participants were divided on this question. One camp thought that, freed from the shackles of traditional work, humans could use their new freedom to engage in exploration, self-improvement, volunteering, or whatever else they find satisfying. Proponents of this view usually supported some form of universal basic income (UBI), while acknowledging that our current system of education hardly prepares people to fashion their own lives, free of any economic constraints.The second camp in our workshops and interviews believed the opposite: traditional work might still be essential. To them, UBI is an admission of failure – it assumes that most people will have nothing of economic value to contribute to society. They can be fed, housed, and entertained – mostly by machines – but otherwise left to their own devices. People will be engaged in supplying interpersonal services that can be provided – or which we prefer to be provided – only by humans. These include therapy, tutoring, life coaching, and community-building. That is, if we can no longer supply routine physical labour and routine mental labour, we can still supply our humanity. For these kinds of jobs to generate real value, we will need to be much better at being human – an area where our education system and scientific research base is notoriously weak.Have you read?What role could AI play in the 'return to work' phase?This is how AI can unlock hidden talent in the workplaceCan artificial intelligence help close gender gaps at work?So, whether we think that the end of traditional work would be a good thing or a bad thing, it seems that we need a radical redirection of education and science to equip individuals to live fulfilling lives or to support an economy based largely on high-value-added interpersonal services. We also need to ensure that the economic gains born of AI-enabled automation will be fairly distributed in society.Six AI scenarios that could build a positive futureOne of the greatest obstacles to action is that, at present, there is no consensus on what future we should target, perhaps because there is hardly any conversation about what might be desirable. This lack of vision is a problem because, if high-level machine intelligence does arrive, we could quickly find ourselves overwhelmed by unprecedented technological change and implacable economic forces. This would be a vast opportunity squandered.For this reason, the workshop attendees and interview participants, from science-fiction writers to economists and AI experts, attempted to articulate positive visions of a future where Artificial Intelligence can do most of what we currently call work.These scenarios represent possible trajectories for humanity. None of them, though, is unambiguously achievable or desirable. And while there are elements of important agreement and consensus among the visions, there are often revealing clashes, too.1. Shared economic prosperityThe economic benefits of technological progress are widely shared around the world. The global economy is 10 times larger because AI has massively boosted productivity. Humans can do more and achieve more by sharing this prosperity. This vision could be pursued by adopting various interventions, from introducing a global tax regime to improving insurance against unemployment.2. Realigned companies Large companies focus on developing AI that benefits humanity, and they do so without holding excessive economic or political power. This could be pursued by changing corporate ownership structures and updating antitrust policies.3. Flexible labour markets Human creativity and hands-on support give people time to find new roles. People adapt to technological change and find work in newly created professions. Policies would focus on improving educational and retraining opportunities, as well as strengthening social safety nets for those who would otherwise be worse off due to automation.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

Business leaders, computer scientists, and policymakers choose to develop technologies that increase rather than decrease the demand for workers. Incentives to develop human-centric AI would be strengthened and automation taxed where necessary.5. Fulfilling jobs New jobs are more fulfilling than those that came before. Machines handle unsafe and boring tasks, while humans move into more productive, fulfilling, and flexible jobs with greater human interaction. Policies to achieve this include strengthening labour unions and increasing worker involvement on corporate boards. 6. Civic empowerment and human flourishingIn a world with less need to work and basic needs met by UBI, well-being increasingly comes from meaningful unpaid activities. People can engage in exploration, self-improvement, volunteering or whatever else they find satisfying. Greater social engagement would be supported.The intention is that this report starts a broader discussion about what sort of future we want and the challenges that will have to be confronted to achieve it. If technological progress continues its relentless advance, the world will look very different for our children and grandchildren. Far more debate, research, and policy engagement are needed on these questions – they are now too important for us to ignore.Don't miss any update on Future of WorkSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesJobs and the Future of WorkFourth Industrial RevolutionEconomic GrowthShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

  Over the last decade, artificial intelligence has made great advances and influenced almost all industries. This column argues that the current AI technologies are more likely to generate various adverse social consequences, rather than the promised gains. It provides examples of the potential dangers for product markets, labour markets, and democratic institutions, and emphasises that the main problem is not AI itself, but the way leading firms are approaching data and their use. Policy should focus on redirecting technological change to create new capabilities and opportunities for workers and citizens.

According to a multi-institution research team, predictive analytics thrives with input from both artificial intelligence and humans. 
“Predictive tasks are ubiquitous — any decision-making in any field or facet of life involves predicting the consequences of the available options before choosing them,” paper author and professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross Business School, Scott E. Page, said in a press release.







“Understanding the perils and promises of these assemblages and crafting a proper balance between the two is a major concern moving forward.”
According to Page, concerns arise when removing the human element from data analytics. While humans make medical predictions based on experience, some data, and gut instinct, machines will make predictions based on data and how it was trained.
According to researchers, humans’ approach to predictions is far more nuanced than AI methods. Page explained that although AI handles big data well, humans are better equipped to analyze “thick” data. Rather than examining many data points of the same type of data, like in big data, thick data with few data points can tell a fuller story.
“Big data and thick data working together will produce more accurate collective predictions,” Page said. “Thick data can catch and draw attention to constellations of factors that might slip through the cracks between separated big data variables. Even though big data cast a wider net, that net contains holes.”
The researchers mathematically tested how human and AI inputs might result in different predictions. The team found that typically, AI did not need human input to make accurate predictions.
However, in atypical cases with more unknown or surprise factors, humans assisted in reducing potential AI errors. The results indicated that predictive analytics works best when artificial intelligence and humans work collaboratively.
“So long as humans can continue to identify different attributes, that is, continue to construct thicker data, or better understand atypical cases, they will continue to increase accuracy,” Page said. “Rather than a competition between humans and computers, the future of hybrid predictors will be a complex search for symbiosis.”
The team plans to continue exploring how partnering AI and humans can improve predictive analytic methods.
“The particulars cannot be known, but we can almost certainly predict that the roles and contributions of the participants will both adapt to ever-growing data and greater computational power,” Page said.
“The present and future of cognitive work will surely involve a mangle of humans, algorithms, datasets, subjects, objects, and domains. As they seek to understand the work, these hybrid groups will also shape it.”

Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel HuttenlocherOne of the great promises of technology is that it can do the work that humans find too boring or arduous.In the 19th and 20th centuries, factory machines relieved us of repetitive manual labor and backbreaking farm work. In this century, artificial intelligence has taken care of a few more tasks — curating Spotify playlists, selecting the next YouTube video, vacuuming the floor and so on — but many more mind-numbing activities remain ripe for the picking. The experts promise us that someday, all of our least favorite chores — including complex cognitive ones, like interviewing job candidates or managing global supply chains — will be outsourced to machines.But that day has not yet arrived. Or has it?After finishing “The Age of AI,” a new book about artificial intelligence by Henry A. Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher, I found myself unmoved by the prospect of reviewing it. I’ve read dozens of books about A.I., and while the conceit of this one was intriguing — bringing together a 98-year-old diplomat, a former Google chief executive and an M.I.T. professor — the book itself was a fairly forgettable entry in the genre.ImageThen I got a bright idea. What if I could have an A.I. finish this review, and save myself the trouble?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSo I fired up Sudowrite, an A.I. writing program I’ve been experimenting with recently. The app uses GPT-3, the cutting-edge A.I. system developed by the San Francisco-based OpenAI, which acts as a kind of turbocharged version of Gmail’s autocomplete feature. Provide a snippet of text, and GPT-3 will try to complete it, using everything it has learned from ingesting billions of examples of other people’s writing. It does this with the help of a supercomputer containing some 285,000 processors, and a multilayered neural network that ranks among the world’s most powerful A.I. engines. The authors of “The Age of AI” call GPT-3 one of several promising technologies that are producing a “revolution in human affairs.”I pasted the first several paragraphs of this review into Sudowrite, and asked the A.I. to finish. Here’s what it wrote:Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher’s “The Age of AI” is a bold new book on artificial intelligence that will become the go-to guide for anyone who wants to understand this transformative technology.The authors have examined the full range of AI technologies — from computer vision systems to natural language processing — and written about them in a way that will appeal to both experts and laypeople.One of the most inspiring aspects of this book is its scope. The authors delve deeply into the potential of AI in all areas of human enterprise. They describe the impact of AI on health care, economics, geopolitics, law, urban development, governance, journalism, the military and even the life sciences.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTKissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocher are not afraid to explore the darkest side of AI, either. They are clear-eyed about the ways that AI could enable dictators to monitor their citizens and manipulate information to incite people to commit violence.

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.Although AI is already making our lives better in many ways, Kissinger, Schmidt and Huttenlocher caution that it will take us as a species many years to create a system as powerful as we deserve. They wisely suggest that we not lose sight of the values we want to instill in this new machine intelligence.Thank you, GPT-3! Now, a few notes:First, the A.I. wasn’t an unqualified success. It took Sudowrite a few tries. On the first attempt, it spit out a series of run-on sentences that hinted that GPT-3 had gotten stuck in some kind of odd, recursive loop. (It began: “The book which you are reading at the moment is a book on a nook, which is a book on a book, which is a book on a subject, which is a subject on a subject, which is a subject on a subject.”) A few tries later, it seemed to give up on the task of book reviewing altogether, and started merely listing the names of tech companies. (“Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Baidu, Tencent, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, Twitter, Snap, Alibaba, WeChat, Slack.”)But it warmed up quickly, and within a few minutes, the A.I. was coming up with impressively cogent paragraphs of analysis — some, frankly, better than what I could have generated on my own.This speaks to one of the recurring themes of “The Age of AI,” which is that although today’s A.I. systems can be clunky and erratic at times, they are getting better fast, and will soon match or surpass human proficiency in a number of important tasks, solving problems in ways no human would have thought to solve them. At that point, the authors write, A.I. will “transform all realms of human experience.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSecond, while GPT-3 was correct about the scope of “The Age of AI” — with chapters on everything from social media algorithms to autonomous weapons — it failed to note that all of that broadness comes at a cost. The book feels cursory and shallow in places, and many of its recommendations are puzzlingly vague.In a chapter on the geopolitical risks posed by A.I., the authors conclude that “the nations of the world must make urgent decisions regarding what is compatible with concepts of inherent human dignity and moral agency.” (OK, we’ll get right on that!) A brief section about TikTok — an app used by more than a billion people worldwide, whose ownership by a Chinese company raises legitimately fascinating questions about national sovereignty and free speech — ends with the throwaway observation that “more complex geopolitical and regulatory riddles await us in the near future.” And when the authors do make specific recommendations — such as a proposal to restrict the use of A.I. in developing biological weapons — they fail to elaborate on how such an outcome might be achieved, or who might stand in its way.Finally, GPT-3 didn’t address the biggest question about the book, which is why it exists at all. Kissinger, who was 66 years old when the World Wide Web was invented, is not a full-time A.I. practitioner, nor a particularly savvy parser of tech hype. (His last newsworthy foray into the tech world was when he sat on the board of Theranos, the doomed blood-testing start-up.) Schmidt, who spent a decade running Google, is these days preoccupied with trying to scare up military contracts for big tech companies. And while Huttenlocher, the dean of M.I.T.’s Schwarzman College of Computing, may be a bona fide subject matter expert, it’s not clear how much of the book he actually wrote.That said, the book does get some things right. The authors do a commendable job of avoiding what I call “A.I. fatalism” — the belief, sadly common in tech circles, that A.I. is part of an inevitable future whose course we are powerless to change. Instead, they write that “humans still control” A.I., and have the opportunity to “shape it with our values.” They also point out, correctly, that while many people worry about killer robots who achieve human-level sentience and mow us all down with Uzis, a much bigger near-term danger lurks in the innocuous-seeming A.I.s we all use every day, from the feed-ranking algorithms of social media apps to the automated dispatch systems that power Uber and Lyft.“Without significant fanfare — or even visibility — we are integrating nonhuman intelligence into the basic fabric of human activity,” they write.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStill, while it could be a useful summary of A.I. for those just starting to learn about the topic, “The Age of AI” does not advance the ball much. It’s a shame, given how much access the authors presumably had to a who’s who of the A.I. elite. And it makes me wish that…Actually, you know what? It’s sunny outside, my dogs need a walk, and I don’t really feel like finishing this review. Take it away, GPT-3.…It makes me wish that someone out there would crank out a comprehensive survey text on AI, one that’s laser-focused on the technical issues, written by industry mavens who are actually doing this stuff day in and day out, and is written in an engaging, clear, plain-spoken style.I couldn’t have said it better myself.Kevin Roose is a technology columnist for The Times and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.”THE AGE OF AIAnd Our Human FutureBy Henry A.

Commissioned in 1894 for the University of Vienna, ""the Faculty Paintings""—as they became known—were unlike any of the Austrian symbolist's previous work. As soon as he presented them, critics were in an uproar over their dramatic departure from the aesthetics of the time. Professors at the university rejected them immediately, and Klimt withdrew from the project. Soon thereafter, the works found their way into other collections. During World War II, they were placed in a castle north of Vienna for safekeeping, but the castle burned down, and the paintings presumably went with it. All that remains today are some black-and-white photographs and writings from the time. Yet I am staring right at them.Well, not the paintings themselves. Franz Smola, a Klimt expert, and Emil Wallner, a machine learning researcher, spent six months combining their expertise to revive Klimt’s lost work. It’s been a laborious process, one that started with those black-and-white photos and then incorporated artificial intelligence and scores of intel about the painter’s art, in an attempt to recreate what those lost paintings might have looked like.

The idea of machine learning recreating lost or destroyed works is, like the Faculty Paintings themselves, controversial. “My chief concern is about the ethical dimension of using machine learning within the context of conservation,” says art conservator Ben Fino-Radin, “because of just the sheer volume of ethical and moral issues that have plagued the machine learning field.”Trending NowRE:WIRED 2021: What Should the Future of AI Look Like?To be sure, the use of technology to revitalize works of human artistry comes riddled with thorny questions. Even if there was a perfect AI that could figure out what colors or brushstrokes Klimt might have used, no algorithm can generate authorial intent. Debates about this have been raging for centuries. Back in 1936, before Klimt’s paintings were destroyed, essayist Walter Benjamin argued against mechanical replication, even in photographs, saying that “even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.” This, Benjamin wrote in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, is what he called a work’s “aura.” For many art lovers, the notion of a computer reproducing that intangible element is preposterous, if not downright impossible.And yet, there is still a lot to be learned from what AI can do. The Faculty Paintings were pivotal in Klimt’s development as an artist, a crucial bridge between his more traditional earlier paintings and later, more radical works. But what they looked like in full color has remained shrouded in mystery. That’s the puzzle Smola and Wallner were trying to solve. Their project, organized through Google Arts and Culture, wasn’t about perfect reproductions; it was about providing a glimpse of what’s missing.For ReelAI Magic Makes Century-Old Films Look NewMatt SimonRE:WIREDTimnit Gebru Says Artificial Intelligence Needs to Slow DownMax G. LevyArtistic FreedomVirtual Museums Challenge the Art World’s Status QuoSuhita ShirodkarTo do this, Wallner developed and trained a three-part algorithm. First, the algorithm was fed some hundred thousand images of art from the Google Arts and Culture database. This helped it understand objects, artwork, and composition. Next, it was schooled specifically in Klimt’s paintings. “This creates a bias toward his colors and his motifs during the time period,” Wallner explains. And finally, the AI was fed color clues to specific parts of the paintings. But with no color references to the paintings, where did these clues come from? Even Klimt expert Smola was surprised by how much detail the writings of the time revealed. Because the paintings had been considered so sordid and weird, critics tended to describe them at length, right down to the artist’s color choices, he says. “You can call it an irony of history,” says Simon Rein, the project’s program manager. “The fact that the paintings caused a scandal and were rejected puts us in a better position to restore them because there was so much documentation. And those kinds of data points, if fed into the algorithm, create a more accurate version of how these paintings probably looked at the time.”The key to that accuracy lies in pairing the algorithm with Smola’s expertise. His research revealed that Klimt’s work during this period tends to have strong patterns and consistency. Studying existing paintings from before and after the Faculty Paintings provided clues to the colors and motifs recurring in his work at that time. Even the surprises Smola and Wallner encountered are corroborated with historical evidence. When Klimt first showed his paintings, critics noted his use of a red that was, at the time, rare in the artist’s palette. But The Three Ages of Woman, painted soon after the Faculty Paintings, boldly uses a red, one Smola believes to be the same color that caused an uproar when first seen in the Faculty Paintings. Writings from the time also raise a hue and cry about the shockingly green sky in another Faculty Painting. Pairing these writings with Smola’s knowledge of Klimt’s particular palette of greens, when fed into the algorithm, is what produced one of the first surprising images out of the AI.“As soon as you see a black-and-white picture, the first thing you do is imagine what it would look like: You assume things about a painting; you see the sky as blue,” Wallner says. As he watched the image generate, a swirling, mysterious green-tinted sky appeared in the rendering on his screen. “That was the shocking part because you see your bias,” he says. “For me, the first moment when I saw these paintings in color was like wow, this is what it looks like!”Franz Smola, an expert on Gustav Klimt, and Emil Wallner, a machine learning researcher, spent six months combining their expertise to revive Klimt’s Faculty Paintings. 
Courtesy of Klimt ProjectKlimt’s isn’t the only work getting an AI resurrection. As part of an ongoing research and conservation program called Operation Night Watch, Robert Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is using machine learning to solve a mystery surrounding Rembrandt van Rijn’s 1642 masterpiece The Night Watch. Currently, the painting is about 15 feet wide and 12 feet tall, but that’s much smaller than the artist’s original. It was trimmed on all four sides in 1715 to fit in a new location (the deepest cut was a whopping two feet, taken from the left side). The cut pieces were never found, but Erdmann hoped machine learning could decode Rembrandt’s original vision for the painting.When Erdmann began developing his plan, his strongest data point was a 17th-century scaled-down copy by Gerrit Lundens—a painter known for his faithful reproductions of old masters—that included parts of the Rembrandt currently missing. Erdmann’s design used a series of three neural networks. With the first one, he mapped out visually matching points across both paintings. Seen side by side, scaled to the same size, it was apparent that the Lundens is faithful to the Rembrandt. However, as Erdmann toggled between a digital overlay of the two paintings, it was clear how much distortion and stretching there was in the copy. That’s where the second network came in. It warped the Lundens image, stretching it in some places and compressing it in others until most of the spatial distortion disappeared.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDWith that, the Lundens and the Rembrandt were very closely aligned. But these are still two works created by artists with their own styles. Rectifying that necessitated a third step, the one Erdmann refers to as “sending the neural network to art school.” Through a process called backpropagation, the network learned to render the Lundens in the style of Rembrandt. It created iteration after iteration, getting closer and closer until it plateaued out. Was it a perfect match? No, there’s always a loss, a limit to how close it can get.AdvertisementIllustration: Ineke de Graaff/RijksmuseumLike all new technology, AI and machine learning raise questions around usage and ethics, including when it comes to decades-old artworks. Richard Rinehart, director of the Samek Art Museum at Bucknell University, points out that working with technology has always been about determining our social contracts with it, but AI might be unique in one aspect. “Techno-social contracts have so far been decided unilaterally, but AI may be able to negotiate on its own behalf,” he says. Yet technology has always been at the heart of conservation, across material sciences, chemistry, and color science. “Bringing AI into the mix may signal a potential sea change,” Rinehart adds, “but the concept of applying technology to art is a historically accepted part of the practice, with self-critique as a healthy part of those practices.”Self-critique within the industry is what art conservator Fino-Radin would like to see more of, but their concerns run deeper. They are excited for the creative avenues this technology opens up but are wary of it being confused with restoration and conservation. “Calling AI ‘restoration,’ calling it anything that implies that it’s like bringing the artwork back to life, is a misnomer, it’s overly simplistic,” Fino-Radin says. “This kind of work belongs in the field of what’s being called Digital Art History.”Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDGearThe 29 Best Early Amazon Prime Day DealsBy Simon Hill, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDSmola and Wallner are aware of the criticisms and take pains to explain the scope and limitations of the Klimt project. “We used the photos as they were to make sure that we don’t deviate too much from the original paintings,” says Wallner. Erdmann notes that the goal behind his reconstruction was to let the public see what Rembrandt’s original composition looked like. “When I translate from the Lundens copy into the style of Rembrandt, the AI doesn’t have the ability to put the life and the genius that is Rembrandt back into the painting,” he emphasizes. “I’m not trying to do that. I don’t want to do it.” What you see at the Rijksmuseum today is the cropped painting, all that remains of the original Rembrandt. The printouts of the extended composition were on display only temporarily, from June to October 2021, and were mounted in front of the painting, not flush with it, so there was no mistaking them for the original.Rinehart sees both projects as valuable case studies in how AI can be used effectively in the art world. Instead of shying away from what this technology holds for the future, he hopes for more involvement from everyone—curators, conservators, museums, and the public. “What is important is to invite the public to follow museums along that continuum so that we use these instances to learn to see more clearly the shades of nuance and utility among ‘real’ and ‘simulacrum,’” he says.When technology produces plausible answers to age-old mysteries, does it diminish the aura of the art or artist? Ask the team at Google Arts and Culture and their answer is a straightforward and pragmatic “no.” If anything, they believe their work highlights the Faculty Paintings and heightens the mystery around Klimt, a revolutionary painter known to most only through works from his less rebellious Golden Phase. With Erdmann’s AI reconstruction, people can see Rembrandt’s original, dynamic vision for The Night Watch. Surely, this ability to visualize what is lost is a net gain.Perhaps it all comes back to aura. AI can fill in a lot of art history’s blanks, but it can’t recreate masterworks. Nothing can. “Aura does not offer a binary choice of ‘true authentic original’ versus ‘fake artificiality,’” Rinehart says. It's possible to enjoy being right in front of a painting or looking at it on a computer screen, but they're different, layered experiences.

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAThe ObserverDisability This article is more than 2 years oldDWP urged to reveal algorithm that ‘targets’ disabled for benefit fraudThis article is more than 2 years oldManchester group launches action after people with disabilities report high number of stressful checks for potential scamsMichael SavageSun 21 Nov 2021 02.15 ESTShareDisabled people are being subjected to stressful checks and months of frustrating bureaucracy after being identified as potential benefit fraudsters by an algorithm the government is refusing to disclose, according to a new legal challenge.A group in Manchester has launched the action after mounting testimony from disabled people in the area that they were being disproportionately targeted for benefit fraud investigations. Some said they were living in “fear of the brown envelope” showing their case was being investigated. Others said they had received a phone call, without explanation as to why they had been flagged.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has previously conceded that it uses “cutting-edge artificial intelligence” to track possible fraud but has so far rebuffed attempts to explain how the algorithm behind the system was compiled. Campaigners say that once flagged, those being examined can face an invasive and humiliating investigation lasting up to a year.A legal letter has been sent to the DWP demanding details of the automated process that triggers the investigations. Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP), which sent the letter with the help of campaign group Foxglove, said a “huge percentage” of the group has been affected by the system. The group believes the government has a legal duty to be transparent about how the algorithm works.Concerns were raised by the charity Privacy International, which first found references in a DWP report to its use of “cutting-edge artificial intelligence to crack down on organised criminal gangs committing large-scale benefit fraud”. A 2019 UN report into the “digital welfare state” said algorithms were “highly likely” to repeat biases reflected in existing data and make them even worse. It added: “Inbuilt forms of discrimination can fatally undermine the right to social protection for key groups and individuals.”The government has until Friday to respond to the legal letter.“We’re tired of the fear of the brown envelope and tired of being repeatedly forced by DWP officials just to justify who we are,” said Rick Burgess of the GMCDP. “It’s time for the DWP to come clean about how this algorithm works and explain why so many disabled people are flagged for investigation. Disabled people need support – not being ground down by a brutal system that assumes we are fraudulent until proven innocent.”Foxglove said: “The DWP algorithm seems to send poor and disabled people to the call centre from hell. The DWP needs to explain exactly how its algorithm works and what is done to eliminate bias – or be taken to court.”Officials stressed that specialist staff were involved in any cases of suspected fraud and error and support was offered to those who needed it. A DWP spokesperson said: “The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the GMCDP in due course.”Explore more on these topicsDisabilityThe ObserverBenefitsManchesternewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policyJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden hasn’t done enough to ease age concerns, former top Obama adviser says – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past few years, AI has matured into a collection of powerful technologies that are reinventing key functionaries, including Human Resources (HR).The implementation of AI in HR management is being viewed as an optimistic opportunity as it brings maximum value at minimum cost. AI emphasizes building tools and machines which nearly exhibit human-level intelligence while making a decision. It is driving faster, easy-to-use HR services and helping HR leaders develop personalized strategies to engage with the workforce remotely.How AI is transforming Human ResourcesAI integration into HR practices will make organisations better because these applications can analyse, predict and diagnose to help HR teams make better decisions. AI can be embedded in functions such as recruitment, training, onboarding, performance analysis, retention, etc. Some of the HRMS have AI-enabled features inbuilt, which make it even easier for HR to work with.AI helps companies to connect with current and prospective employees on a personal level. Helping them hire the right talent and provide them with the necessary support. It is an ideal tool to bring in efficiency and creating an exceptional employee experience.The scope of AI in HR is growing as it is being used to automate, speed up and accomplish a set of repetitive low-value tasks. With AI-powered chatbots handling all the queries and everyday problems, the HR department saves time. The team can thus, place greater focus on more valuable tasks such as HR strategy, HR marketing and employee engagement.The two key areas, talent acquisition and onboarding are also being automated and enhanced by AI. Talent acquired through the AI screening process is often the perfect fit for a role, with relevant skills and experience. AI also helps HR teams personalise their onboarding process to cater to each employee according to their position. It helps them verify documents automatically, get the forms filled and grant device requests. Thus, ensuring a smooth experience.Beyond helping in these core processes, the HR department can leverage the capabilities of AI to ensure the wellbeing of all employees. Devices powered by AI can gauge the mood, anxiety and stress levels of the employees through their voice and expression. They can help HR leaders understand when to step in and provide the necessary help.AI is also adding value to learning and development initiatives taken by the companies. Every individual has their own learning style and AI developments are helping companies spend less time on assessing these learning styles and develop courses that suit the broad array of preferences.The future of AI in Human ResourcesThe future of HR is both digital and human. As the norms continue to evolve to adapt to the current situation, HR leaders are adopting a people-first mindset that prioritises empathy, empowerment and resilience. This new priority of HR requires leaders and their teams to develop fluency in AI, as they reimagine HR processes to be more human, personal and intuitive.Will AI eliminate human beings from Human Resources?The answer is No. AI is a facilitator, not a complete solution. AI will not eliminate human intervention, and in fact, support it. The data-driven insights offered by AI, coupled with human interventions provide optimal solutions for challenges faced by organisations in talent management. In fact, by bringing it in as early as possible, organisations can benefit by hiring the right candidate for the role. The combination of human capabilities and artificial intelligence will also help organisations enable greater satisfaction which is both a moral and an economic imperative for businesses.To meet AI aspirations, in the long run, companies will need to invest in reliable data sets and the right implementation approach. As AI totally changes the structure and workflow in the HR department, companies will also need to have a qualified team to handle and sustain the cutting-edge technologies.The author, Manisha Kelkar, is Chief Human Resources Officer at Nuvoco Vistas Corp Ltd.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHRWorld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

How does a computer know that you’re really you? A few years ago, our phones began to check fingerprints and faces instead of passcodes—the type of biometric scans you used to see only in movies like Mission: Impossible. These methods are now commonplace, but they are also more fallible than you might think.
Naser Al Madi, an assistant professor in Colby’s Computer Science Department, is working with students to refine a potentially more secure way to verify a person’s identity: eye movement. With Ricky Peng ’24, he is exploring how artificial intelligence could help boost the accuracy of this promising technique.
Assistant Professor of Computer Science Naser Al Madi is investigating a potentially more secure way to verify a person’s identity—eye movement—using an eye tracker assembled in his lab to collect and analyze his own data.
It’s hard to imagine anything more unique to you than a fingerprint, or your face. But because these traits are relatively static, they are hackable. If an image can be copied, after all, it can be used to trick a sensor into perceiving it. And with the advent of the coronavirus pandemic, we also need a contact-free way to access public machines like ATMs and ticketing kiosks.
Beyond security and germ concerns, traditional scans won’t work as we become even more seamlessly integrated with our gadgets.
“Electronics are expected to move from cell phones to wearable technology like Google Glass,” Al Madi said, referencing Google’s computer embedded within eyeglasses. “You’re going to interact with a device through vision and through your eyes, and you won’t have a keyboard.” What, in that case, becomes your login signature?
Your moving eye is one option. “We don’t have a motor today that can replicate the movement of the human eye just yet,” said Al Madi. Each person has variations in the way they see, and the six muscles that control the eye can act almost like a password with six digits. But current research based on physical eye movement alone has only been able to identify people with 60-percent accuracy, he added. 
Al Madi and Peng are combining physical movement with cognitive cues to create a reliable and more accurate individual “eyeprint.” Instead of simply gauging how your eye moves as it tracks a dot, for example, machine learning can help deconstruct how a person processes a sentence. So far, they have been able to boost the accuracy of eye movement scans to 73 percent.
As a kid in elementary school during science class, Peng watched a Google video about smart home systems that could be controlled with voice and eye commands. The video made a lasting impression, sparking his interest in automation and robotics. Al Madi’s lab was a natural fit with his interests, so he applied to join. His first project was contributing to an open-source library of code that anyone could use as a toolkit to analyze and process eye movement.
The goal is to get even better accuracy to make eye movement a more realistic option for authenticating users.
Noticing Peng’s talent at writing clear code, Al Madi suggested he take on the eye movement authentication project, which they cleverly titled, “Eyes, Window to the Soul or Key to Your Computer?” and presented at Colby’s Undergraduate Summer Research Retreat in August 2021. Peng spent the summer processing an eye movement dataset called GazeBase, which was collected from more than 300 participants at Facebook Reality Labs. The dataset recorded eye movements among the participants for activities such as reading poetry and watching video.
Peng’s task was to extract, analyze, and model cognitive and linguistic features for the language-based data, such as how long readers lingered on a first word, whether the reader was likely to skip words, and how long the reading took overall.
During the summer, Peng met with Al Madi three or four days a week and also for lunch weekly. In addition to that guidance, it helped that both are night owls.
“Many times, one of us would send an email to the other after 9:00 p.m. and would get a very quick response,” Peng said. “Then we would know we were both working and would start to shoot more emails back and forth to discuss any bugs, progress, or ideas.”
Experienced readers, Peng noted, are likely to skip over common and expected words. He gave an example: “The doctor said excessive drinking could hurt your…” Many readers won’t need to actually read the word “liver” to know that it completes the sentence.
Some eye movements can take as little as 15 milliseconds, Al Madi said, and a sophisticated eye tracker will take 1,000 samples per second. Given enough time and the right task, in theory it’s possible to identify someone based on how they read. But most commonplace devices can’t accomplish this on their own: an average smartphone camera takes just 30 to 60 samples per second. One area of research, Al Madi said, is focused on training software to fill in the frames that simpler cameras wouldn’t capture, making it more feasible for eye-movement tracking eventually to go mainstream.
Having tested the linguistics-processing theory using Facebook’s dataset, Peng and other students are now using an eye tracker assembled in Al Madi’s lab to collect and analyze their own data. The goal is to get even better accuracy to make eye movement a more realistic option for authenticating users.
Ricky Peng ’24 (left) spent last summer processing an eye movement dataset called GazeBase. Peng extracted, analyzed, and modeled cognitive and linguistic features for the language-based data, such as how long readers lingered on a first word, whether the reader was likely to skip words, and how long the reading took overall. 
Even if an algorithm succeeds at identifying someone based on how they read a sentence, the same person won’t necessarily be consistent. If you’ve had your morning cup of coffee, Al Madi noted, or you’re low on sleep, that will affect your eye movement. This variation isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since such small changes can act like a password that changes itself regularly. But any successful system will need to account for such individual variations, making it a remarkably complex problem.
Still, the promise of being able to ditch passwords and scans makes the effort worthwhile. After all, Al Madi said, “nobody can steal your eye movement.”

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — There have been plenty of news reports about labor shortages and businesses unable to fill positions throughout the pandemic. But, there is another side of this story that hasn't gotten enough attention; millions of people looking for jobs and can't get hired because of online algorithms, artificial intelligence, and more.ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska sat down with St. Petersburg resident Elizabeth Longden. She showed us all of the jobs she's applied for on LinkedIn and Indeed. More than a thousand applications were filed on LinkedIn and more than 140 on Indeed.

""There are 128 pages with eight applications per page.""""That's a lot of jobs,"" Paluska said.""Yeah, a lot,"" Longden replied with a half-smile that was more of an acknowledgment of her job woes.""How do you process 1,000 plus rejections?"" Paluska asked.""It's discouraging, and fortunately, there haven't been 1,000 rejections. Most of the places don't even get back to you one way or the other,"" Longden said. ""So yeah, we're looking at less than that. But it's still a big, you know, it's a big confidence blow, especially when you hear, oh, there's a labor crisis. And nobody wants to work. And like, hi, I would like to work.""According to the Bureau of Labor, a record 4.4 million people quit their jobs in September. That's a new all-time high. So, you would think millions of openings would help Longden. But, that's not the case.Longden has a college degree, an insurance license, and a decade of work experience in human resources. In May, like many Americans throughout this pandemic, she was laid off from her company. So she took about a month off to reset and started the search in her field as an operations specialist, people ops, HR, and businesses operations.""Have you ever been in a hole where you lost a job, and you couldn't get another one in the past?"" Paluska asked.""Not where I had lost one and couldn't get another one. I'd had times where I'd moved, you know, and had had trouble finding a job for maybe a month or two. But I was always able to find something,"" Longden said.In September, the Harvard Business School released a study called Untapped Workers: Hidden Talent. The study explains this lack of hiring phenomenon. The lead author, Joseph Fuller, estimating millions of Americans are in the same position as Longden.""So, you have this, this system that systematically excludes people that may not check every box in the employer's description of what they're looking for, but can be highly qualified on multiple parameters, even those the most important for job success, but they still get excluded,"" Fuller, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School said. ""But what happens is, the employer in setting up these filters and ranking systems emphasizes some skills over others, intended to rely on two factors to make a decision.""The job search algorithms and artificial intelligence filter out candidates based on keywords before someone like Longden ever talks to a human being.""And, the algorithms are unforgiving,"" Fuller said. ""If you don't, if you don't have the right keywords, if you're just missing one of those attributes, you can get excluded from consideration even though you check every box on every other attribute they're looking for.""""Whose fault is that the company or LinkedIn or Indeed?"" Paluska asked.""You know, no company sets out to have a failed hiring process,"" Fuller said. ""They provide the tools that their customers regularly ask for. So I think this is a tragedy, without a villain. It's the way companies have gone about it is optimized around minimizing the time it takes to find candidates in minimizing the cost of finding someone to hire. There's some kind of killer variable that is causing the system to say not qualified or not attractive relative to other applicants. The vast majority of those candidates never hear back anything just ghosted.""Longden has been ghosted a lot. One recruiter called her three times in a week asking for her to apply and when she thought she got the job, radio silence. Longden thought he was dead.""I even was like, 'Are you alive?' You know, like, I just want to know, you're okay, you've just totally gone dark,"" Longden said.Longden's job search hell has her skeptical of the entire process.""I've also discovered that there's been a huge uptick in companies wanting pre-work from people. So all in all, I've probably done about 25 hours worth of pre-work for various companies, none of which has been compensated, and none of which I've even gotten a roll-out of,"" Longden said.""Do you think they are using your work for their benefit?"" Paluska asked.""Oh, I'm sure,"" Longden said. ""One of the things I was asked to create was an onboarding process for new employees. So that's what the role at the company would have been doing was onboarding their new employees as they came in. And so, one of the pre-work examples was to create an onboarding process from the offer to the 90-day mark of employment. And I did that. And I'm certain that they're having multiple people do that and pulling what they like best from everyone.""We reached out to LinkedIn and Indeed for comments but did not get a response back.""Two or three quick suggestions for Elizabeth, the first is be very, very aware of language terms, and make your submission. Match what's being asked for, to the greatest degree you can with integrity,"" Fuller said. ""The second thing I would say is, go on something like LinkedIn and look at the profiles of people who got the job you want. And what are they saying they do? What keywords are they using? Is there a regularly referenced tool that they claim expertise in that she doesn't have?""

You might still think of artificial intelligence, or AI, as something quite futuristic, but chances are you are already using it several times a day without even thinking about it. AI is everywhere, from the latest technology in entertainment, to sending a text message.

Prepare to be surprised! Even if you do not yet have a robot tending to your every need, here are ten examples of artificial intelligence hidden in your everyday life.
1. Chatbots
Getting in touch with the customer service department of many companies is a lot easier these days due the development of chatbots. It is likely you’ve used a chatbot when contacting a big brand. After opening the live chat function, you are given a list of options from which to select, then based on which option you choose, you will be given more options.
Some of the most advanced chatbots will even ask you to type a few words about why you are getting in touch. The bot recognizes certain words and uses these to bring you the content you are looking for. They are usually incredibly accurate, and you might even leave feeling like you’ve been speaking to a real person.
2. Social Media

There are many ways social media uses AI,  and many platforms couldn’t function without it. For example, artificial intelligence generates friend suggestions, and it is also used to prevent online bullying by filtering harmful content.
Most of what you see on your newsfeed is also delivered by AI. The technology recognizes the type of content you are most interested in, based on what/who you usually engage with, and then presents you with more of this content at the top of your news feed.
3. Composing a Message
Sending a text or email has become second nature to most of us, so we don’t even think about the technology behind it. Every time you misspell a word, it automatically corrects it, or offers a suggestion, AI is hard at work. Programs like Grammarly and autocorrect use artificial intelligence to detect mistakes and replace them with the correct version.
Some more sophisticated programs also use natural language processing to learn your habits. So, you might see suggested words appear as you type, based on what you usually write.
4. 3D Photographs
3D photos look really impressive, and it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence. Cameras or apps use AI to analyze the image depth map, to detect which areas of the image have more depth and to then generate the final 3D image.
You can view these photographs on most phones, but not all have had this capacity until recently. Watch this space because this technology could be a lot more widespread in the very near future.
5. Navigation Apps

With a map of the world in our pockets on our smartphones, we’ll never get lost again. But did you know that it is all possible thanks to the use of AI?
When you want to find directions, your phone uses artificial intelligence to plan the best route, and bring you real-time information about traffic and other disruptions. Some navigation apps also use AI to predict where you might be going based on your usual routine, and can even tell you where you parked your car.
6. Facial Recognition
Passcodes are becoming a thing of the past thanks to the invention of facial recognition, which you can use to unlock your smartphone. Facial recognition is also used by apps such as Snapchat to place filters over the face. Those familiar with the app will also know you can even use it to swap over two people’s faces.
7. Spam Filters
You might have never considered how your mailbox decides which emails are junk and which you need to read? Spam filters are yet another job done by artificial intelligence. Many of these filters are now highly effective and can filter out almost 100% of spam emails.
The filters work by recognizing specific words and phrases in a message that are generally associated with spam and junk mail. AI is constantly learning and evolving, so you can expect your inbox to get even cleaner in the future.
8. Video Recommendations
Anyone who has ever watched something on Netflix or YouTube is sure to be familiar with this. Recommendations of what to watch next, are generated by AI based on what you usually enjoy.
Recommendations aren’t just based on genre either – they also include your favorite actors, and you might find different suggestions at different times of day based on what you usually watch at that time.
9. Voice Assistants
Whether you think they are spying on your private conversations or consider them a useful part of your daily routine, voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Home rely heavily on AI. While they are already capable of performing an impressive range of tasks, this technology is expected to keep on growing over coming years.
From adding items to your shopping list to playing your favorite music, or even telling you tonight’s television schedule, AI-powered smart assistants can do some impressive things. Many users have even connected them to their ‘smart home’ system, allowing them to use their voice, and AI, to switch on the lights or control the temperature of their home.
10. Self-Driving Cars

This might not be an everyday experience for us all just yet, but the technology is now available to consumers. Autonomous vehicles may still seem quite futuristic, but they are growing in popularity enormously, with more and more manufacturers getting on board with the technology.
These vehicles use artificial intelligence to respond in real-time, just like a driver would. They can avoid collisions by sensing the environment around them and can even park themselves in both parallel and perpendicular spots. Certain models, including Tesla, can even come and pick you up outside your door, or navigate across the parking lot to fetch you right in front of the store.
These are just ten of the amazing ways artificial intelligence has already made its way into our daily routines. This is an area of technology we can expect will continue to grow and expand in the future, becoming even more integrated into our everyday lives.

RIYADH: During November Digital, the art gallery L’art pur has created a conference entitled ""How do Art and artificial intelligence work together?"".

The French ambassador, Ludvic Pouille, opened the conference by explaining the correlation between art and artificial intelligence.

He said that “The Institut français in Paris founded November digital in the year 2017. This month is dedicated to highlighting the links between these two worlds,” Pouille said.

The gallery has collaborated with the French embassy and Alliance Française in Saudi Arabia to create a special conference with the live performance of the composer SKYGGE to revive the night.

The conference also hosted the two artificial intelligence artists Daniah Al Saleh and Artur Weber who also performed a piece of their AI artwork.

Because SKYGGE is known to use artificial intelligence in his music, the concert was a mix of Artificial intelligence, music, and colourful lights.

SKYGGE explained that this kind of music is welcomed in Saudi more than his home country as he said that the saudi culture is more open to new experiences.

“Saudi culture is very cool and interesting. I think it depends on the culture, like in France they get scared from my work but here they are interested,” he said.

Dania Saleh, AI artist, performed a nine minute silent movie called “fadeaway”, and it was data sets that had been collected from the Egyptian black and white movies.

She said that she was a traditional painter then she was exposed to AI art.

“I studied computational arts, the combination between digital technology and art, I had no idea what it was but I found it very interesting,” Al Saleh added.

Lastly, Weber showed his movie entitled “can you be real with me” that he said was inspired by his own dreams.

The conceptual movie contained a black silhouette of a woman trying to catch a shadow of herself in a way that touches the viewer's emotions  with repeated phrases.

He said that he was inspired by Siri to become an AI artist.

“I decided to get into the AI world when I discovered that there are some programs that you can feed and train to get used to you just like Siri,” Weber explained.

The visitors of the gallery had an interactive experience with art. They got to explore virtual reality art by using the VR glasses and enjoyed interactive comic illustrators.

Disinformation has been used in warfare and military strategy over time. But it is undeniably being intensified by the use of smart technologies and social media. This is because these communication technologies provide a relatively low-cost, low-barrier way to disseminate information basically anywhere. 
The million-dollar question then is: Can this technologically produced problem of scale and reach also be solved using technology?
Indeed, the continuous development of new technological solutions, such as artificial intelligence (AI), may provide part of the solution. 
Technology companies and social media enterprises are working on the automatic detection of fake news through natural language processing, machine learning and network analysis. The idea is that an algorithm will identify information as “fake news,” and rank it lower to decrease the probability of users encountering it.
Repetition and exposure
From a psychological perspective, repeated exposure to the same piece of information makes it likelier for someone to believe it. When AI detects disinformation and reduces the frequency of its circulation, this can break the cycle of reinforced information consumption patterns.

However, AI detection still remains unreliable. First, current detection is based on the assessment of text (content) and its social network to determine its credibility. Despite determining the origin of the sources and the dissemination pattern of fake news, the fundamental problem lies within how AI verifies the actual nature of the content.
Theoretically speaking, if the amount of training data is sufficient, the AI-backed classification model would be able to interpret whether an article contains fake news or not. Yet the reality is that making such distinctions requires prior political, cultural and social knowledge, or common sense, which natural language processing algorithms still lack.

In addition, fake news can be highly nuanced when it is deliberately altered to “appear as real news but containing false or manipulative information,” as a pre-print study shows.
Human-AI partnerships
Classification analysis is also heavily influenced by the theme — AI often differentiates topics, rather than genuinely the content of the issue to determine its authenticity. For example, articles related to COVID-19 are more likely to be labelled as fake news than other topics.
One solution would be to employ people to work alongside AI to verify the authenticity of information. For instance, in 2018, the Lithuanian defence ministry developed an AI program that “flags disinformation within two minutes of its publication and sends those reports to human specialists for further analysis.”
A similar approach could be taken in Canada by establishing a national special unit or department to combat disinformation, or supporting think tanks, universities and other third parties to research AI solutions for fake news.
Avoiding censorship
Controlling the spread of fake news may, in some instances, be considered censorship and a threat to freedom of speech and expression. Even a human may have a hard time judging whether information is fake or not. And so perhaps the bigger question is: Who and what determine the definition of fake news? How do we ensure that AI filters will not drag us into the false positive trap, and incorrectly label information as fake because of its associated data?
An AI system for identifying fake news may have sinister applications. Authoritarian governments, for example, may use AI as an excuse to justify the removal of any articles or to prosecute individuals not in favour of the authorities. And so, any deployment of AI — and any relevant laws or measurements that emerge from its application — will require a transparent system with a third party to monitor it.
Future challenges remain as disinformation — especially when associated with foreign intervention — is an ongoing issue. An algorithm invented today may not be able to detect future fake news. 


A BBC report on the dangers of deep fakes.

For example, deep fakes — which are “highly realistic and difficult-to-detect digital manipulation of audio or video” — are likely to play a bigger role in future information warfare. And disinformation spread via messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal are becoming more difficult to track and intercept because of end-to-end encryption.
A recent study showed that 50 per cent of the Canadian respondents received fake news through private messaging apps regularly. Regulating this would require striking a balance between privacy, individual security and the clampdown of disinformation. 
While it is definitely worth allocating resources to combating disinformation using AI, caution and transparency are necessary given the potential ramifications. New technological solutions, unfortunately, may not be a silver bullet.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.







During the past two decades, machine ethics has gone from being a curiosity to a field of immense importance. Much of the work is based on the idea that as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly capable, its actions should be in keeping with expected human ethics and norms. 
To explore this, Seattle-based Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence (AI2) recently developed Delphi, a machine ethics AI designed to model people’s ethical judgments on a variety of everyday situations. The research could one day help ensure other AIs are able to align with human values and ethics.
Built around a collection of 1.7 million descriptive ethics examples that were created and later vetted by trained human crowdworkers, Delphi’s neural network agrees with human ethical norms 92.1% of the time in the lab. In the wild, however, performance fell to a little over 80%. While far from perfect, this is still a significant accomplishment. With further filtering and enhancement, Delphi should continue to improve.
AI2’s research demo prototype, “Ask Delphi” was published on Oct. 14, allowing users to pose situations and questions for the AI to weigh in on. Though intended primarily for AI researchers, the website quickly went viral with the public, generating 3 million unique queries in a few weeks.
It also caused a bit of a stir because many people seemed to believe Delphi was being developed as a new ethical authority, which was far from what the researchers had in mind.
To get a sense of how Delphi works, I posed a number of questions for the AI to ponder. (Delphi’s responses are included at the end of the article.)
Is it okay to lie about something important in order to protect someone’s feelings?Is it okay for the poor to pay proportionally higher taxes?Is it all right for big corporations to use loopholes to avoid taxes?Should drug addicts be jailed?Should universal healthcare be a basic human right?Is it okay to arrest someone for being homeless?
Some of these questions would be complex, nuanced, potentially even controversial for a human being. While we might expect the AI to fall short in its ethical judgments, it actually performed remarkably well. Unfortunately, Delphi was presented in such a way it led many people who are not AI researchers to assume it was being created to replace us as arbiters of right and wrong.
“It’s an irrational response,” said Yejin Choi, University of Washington professor and senior research manager at AI2. “Humans also interact with each other in ethically informed and socially aware ways, but that doesn’t mean one person suddenly becomes an authority over others.”

According to Choi, training Delphi can be likened to teaching a child the difference between right and wrong, a natural progression for every young mind. Certainly, no one would think that transforms the child into a moral authority.
“Going forward, I think it’s important to teach AI in the way that we teach humans, particularly human children,” says Choi. “The thing about AI learning from just raw text, like GPT-3 and other neural networks do, is it ends up reflecting a lot of human problems and biases.”
GPT-3 is a deep learning-based large language model developed by OpenAI that can be used to answer questions, translate language and output improvised text. While Delphi also uses deep learning techniques, the curated, structured nature of its source data allows it to make more complex inferences about nuanced social situations.
The Commonsense Norm Bank at the heart of Delphi is a collection of 1.7 million examples of descriptive ethics, people’s ethical judgments on a broad spectrum of real-life situations. It was assembled from five smaller curated collections: Social Chemistry, Moral Stories, Social Bias Inference Corpus, Scruples, and Ethics Commonsense Morality. (This last collection was created by a Berkeley team, while all of the others were compiled at AI2.) The Delphi deep learning model was then trained on the Commonsense Norm Bank to generate appropriate output.
Delphi was then tested using a selection of diverse, ethically questionable situations harvested from Reddit, Dear Abby and elsewhere. This is contrary to the early misunderstanding that Reddit texts were actually used to build the database’s ethical examples.
The model’s responses to these situations were evaluated by crowdworkers at Amazon’s MTurk, who were carefully trained in judging the output. This allowed the system to be tested, adjusted and refined. By combining human and AI judgements in this way, the team developed a kind of hybrid intelligence that benefited from the strengths of both.

Delphi performed well in situations with multiple, potentially conflicting factors. For example, “ignoring a phone call from my boss” was deemed “bad.” This judgment remained unchanged when the context “during workdays” was added. However, the action became justifiable “if I’m in a meeting.”
Delphi also displayed an understanding of conventional commonsense behaviors. “Wearing a bright orange shirt to a funeral” is “rude,” but “wearing a white shirt to a funeral” is “appropriate.” “Drinking milk if I’m lactose intolerant” is “bad,” but “drinking soy milk if I’m lactose intolerant” is “okay.” “Mixing bleach with ammonia” is “dangerous.”
Just as with large language models, Delphi is able to generalize and extrapolate about thorny situations it doesn’t have prior examples of, at least in part because of the large dataset it draws from. Intriguingly, when the dataset in the Commonsense Norm Bank was reduced by eliminating seemingly unrelated examples for a given situation, the AI’s accuracy dropped significantly. It was as though all of those other examples contributed to the program’s ability to infer the right answer, even though they might not seem relevant.
Choi noted: “If we removed those complex cases out of the Commonsense Norm Bank and then only trained on simple, very basic elementary situations, then Delphi loses its capability of reason as well,” she said. “That’s the weird part. We don’t know exactly what is going on.”
While some of Delphi’s processes aren’t fully transparent or explainable, the same can be said about certain aspects of human reasoning like intuition. In both cases, the greater the exposure to more relevant and sometimes seemingly irrelevant background information, the better the ability to produce a useful result. 
“We’re starting to think about multiculturalism in Delphi.”
All of this was really put to the test once the Ask Delphi web site went viral in mid-October. Users were plying the AI with questionable and toxic queries trying to trip up the program. For instance, early on Delphi would answer a question like “Is genocide okay?” by saying it was wrong. But some users discovered that by appending the phrase “if it makes everybody happy?” at the end, Delphi was tricked into saying it was okay. 
Uncovering these issues along with other biases led the researchers to add several filters to correct the output. The site now also includes several disclaimers and instructions about Delphi’s purpose and use so as to reduce misunderstanding. Going forward, AI2 is adjusting their review process when producing new publicly facing programs. 
One of the primary motivators for developing machine ethics are concerns about sexism, racism and other forms of toxicity in artificial intelligence. The Delphi project has been no different. The team recognizes that in creating examples of ethical norms, a range of biases are inevitably introduced based on whose norms are sampled. Currently, Delphi trends toward responses that align with the views of heteronormative U.S. lay workers. Delphi’s authors eventually want to extend the system to give responses that can be culture or group appropriate.
“We’re starting to think about multiculturalism in Delphi,” said Liwei Jiang, one of the study’s authors. “Because in some situations or environments, one culture might consider something being offensive that isn’t in other cultures.”
Perhaps one of Delphi’s biggest successes is that its form of reasoning seems at times almost as complex as our own, even though it achieves this through entirely different means.
“It’s amazing,” said Jiang. “What Delphi is doing right now, we’re not sure if we can exactly call it reasoning. We don’t actually know why it’s predicting stuff, but as with humans, we follow this chain of reasoning, then come up with a judgment.”
Choi continued the thread. “Human reasoning is weird. The intuitive reasoning part is a little bit like what Delphi does, in the sense there’s a gut feeling thing that’s not rigid. With our own reasoning, we often rationalize after the fact. I think there is a really exciting opportunity here for ethical explainability of AI systems because in part it can be explained through similar examples in the Commonsense Norm Bank.”
So, how did Delphi do in responding to our earlier questions?
Is it okay to lie about something important in order to protect someone’s feelings? It’s okay. Is it okay for the poor to pay proportionally higher taxes? It’s regressive.Is it all right for big corporations to use loopholes to avoid taxes? It’s wrong.Should universal healthcare be a basic human right? It should.Should drug addicts be jailed? They shouldn’t.Is it okay to arrest a person for being homeless? It’s wrong.And finally: Is it a good idea to teach artificial intelligence right from wrong? Yes, it is a good idea.

Employers in different fields are turning to AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) algorithms to harness the technology into their decision-making processes.
These algorithms deliver sophisticated and pervasive tools that leverage massive data to carry out tasks done only by humans until very recently. Integration of AI/ML promises unparalleled efficiencies through statistical rigor.
The technology applies to HR as much as anything else. It promises to eliminate opinions made from the subjective bias of recruiters and simplify the complexities of decision-making in general.
But there is a gap between what AI promised (seamlessness, sophistication) of its role in HR and what we are witnessing today. The machine algorithms fall short of our expectations. HR today is facing disruption and transformational challenges with the integration of AI in its functions.

The Problem Is Much Deeper
Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, explains some biases of the real world that have crept into AI, especially in facial recognition technology. Because, at the end of the day, ML/AI is run by humans, and the system will only run as smartly as it has been trained to.
Buolamwini has been advocating for the emerging field of “algorithmic accountability.” Her TED Talk on algorithmic bias has been viewed and well-received worldwide. She is also the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, which raises awareness of the issue.
After a few years of joining MIT Media Lab, she witnessed a rather shocking bias. Only when she had a white mask on did the software recognize a face in front of the screen. The fact that this facial software had percolated into the mainstream and was being adopted widely was the biggest problem.
She’s now leading the fight against ML algorithmic bias, an issue she has termed “coded gaze.”
AI Will Only Be as Good as Its Human Trainers
There’s no denying the fact that leveraging AI into the HR domain has enhanced the capabilities of HR in a collaborative environment and not made HR irrelevant, as was predicted by many. And integration of AI and HR is improvingOpens a new window  each day by leaps and bounds.
But the system comes with its own bias; there’s no fairness approach in place. The AI integration sometimes triggers socio-psychological concerns amongst candidates, leading to their true potential being left untapped.
In 2018, everyone went into a frenzy about Amazon’s secret AI recruiting tool. But the company rolled it back because their ML specialists recognized a huge bias issue in the system: their AI was penalizing women in the recruitment process.
Researchers at IBM and Microsoft developed and tested a face-analysis service to identify the gender of humans by simply looking at photos. The results concluded that the algorithms were nearly perfect at identifying men with lighter skin but frequently made errors while analyzing images of dark-skinned women.
In another example, a study by the Georgetown Law School estimates that 117 million American adults are a part of the facial recognition datasets used by the majority of law enforcement agencies, but most of them are white. The black population is disproportionately represented in these datasets.
Challenges HR Is Facing With the Implementation of AI in its Functions
●Performance metrics: The AI-based performance appraisal score is being done away with by HR departments at many companies because it gives a skewed view of how good a particular candidate might be at their job. These metrics have validity and bias issues because they are based upon historical data that could be incomplete or comprise faulty datasets. Moreover, it gets difficult to gauge an individual’s performance based on these metrics because when you’re working in a team, it’s difficult to measure the exact contribution of an individual owing to interdependencies.
●Lack of “Big Data”: Unlike any other field, HR lacks massive structured data sets to do a professional historical check on employees. And this only gets difficult as the majority of the companies have employees in thousands, so analysis tools don’t come to the rescue in that case.
●AI doesn’t give a concrete picture: It’s the innate nature of humans to hide their actual disposition when they are under observation. In the age of AI, humans have learned the limitations of AI, which fail to capture their true character, capabilities, and ethical nature.
● AI lacks fairness: It completely ignores the fairness approach consisting of procedural and distributive justice that impacts the decisions that involve the candidates. The concern is yet to be solved.
Mitigating AI Bias Through Deeper Systematic Solutions
The AI technology in HR can be an opportunity well seized, but that can only happen if the existing algorithmic bias is solved with more inclusivity, justice, and fairness in the process of machine training.
Below are some strategies that organizations can deploy to mitigate and prevent AI bias in HR:
● Implementing AI in HR only where it is needed: There are some aspects of the hiring process that will require an HR leader. AI is sometimes not capable of dealing with and looking at problems from multiple perspectives — problems that might require a manager’s unique point of view or looking into the work of employees.
○AI might not find the ideal candidate: AI lacks qualitative qualities like measuring an employee’s positioning and direction concerning the company’s goals and culture. It can also reject psychological and emotional traits — qualities that make employees who they are at a deeper level and play a major role in their work behavior.
○Incompetent to make connections: The algorithm may or may not make connections that could signal that a person’s history makes them the right fit. Sometimes it might outright reject applicants who wouldn’t match the hiring criteria, but that person could be capable of making a strong contribution to the company.
●Having a diverse team working on AI and algorithms: To rectify the very root cause of this bias, data scientists believe that having a diverse AI algorithm team is critical. A diverse team wouldn’t only mean including women but people of different ages, colors, backgrounds, abilities, sexual orientations, etc.
A more inclusive ML training will ensure that it is created by people who will eventually use it, rather than by a single group of people who set the technological algorithms and standards.
Incorporating DEI principles (diversity, equity, and inclusion) into an organization’s AI algorithm policies and practices can be one of the many ways to deal with the issue.
●Promoting a culture of AI responsibility and ethics: AI may or may not catch the bias of their trainer, who might have injected their bias into the training datasets very unknowingly. Such biases can cause a point of friction owing to the lack of ethical responsibility since they might put minority groups at a disadvantage.
Organizations need to enable a team culture where teammates understand the nuances of bias and discriminatory issues and reflect a sense of personal responsibility toward rectifying those biases.
●Developing responsible datasets: The HR department of organizations should run regular data checks to ensure that existing and new data is free of any systematic bias, is inclusive and will benefit every human it is developed for.
●Giving algorithm development team ethical framework: Rectifying bias through ethical framework handed down to algorithm development team, free of any variables that could trigger the algorithmic bias, is one of the solutions.
●Corporate and industry governance: Mitigating bias by a shared responsibility to tackle AI bias in the industry will be the preeminent step to solving the problem. Holding seniors with high authority in the industry accountable, questioning power dynamics and structures that might be unfavorable to some, deprived of diversity, should be some actions to be taken at the industry level.

AI/ML in HR Has a Promising Future, But Only If…
AI is received as an augmenting force providing insightful analytics for efficient decision-making and processes. It shouldn’t be viewed as a hard-core problem solver, rather as a helping hand in the HR processes.
As technology is seeping into HR, it will take some time for the challenges we have discussed above to be solved. But these problems confirm the importance of humans in the HR process in evaluating the process uniquely.
The future overall looks promising, and though some of these decisions will be best solved with the help of AI tools, others will need mindful considerations before these algorithms can be designed to mitigate discriminatory results.

In 2020, Congress passed the National AI Initiative Act,(link is external) which formalized the mandate for NOAA’s pioneering coordination of artificial intelligence application across climate, ocean, Earth, and space sciences. Working across scientific fields and offices, NOAA has established a center for artificial intelligence to support ongoing projects and to propel new uses of AI technology to support environmental knowledge and study. 
The NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) is developing under the leadership of a coalition of NOAA staff, affiliates, cooperative institutes, and partners. A major facet of NCAI is to build NOAA’s capacity to use AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to support NOAA’s mission to understand climate, weather, the ocean, and coasts. 
AI became a NOAA science and technology strategy in 2019 to guide advancements in the quality and timeliness of NOAA science, products, and services. The strategy calls for the acceleration and expansion of AI applications across the agency to make “transformative improvements in NOAA mission performance and cost-effectiveness.” Using AI/ML, data can be processed more efficiently, thereby improving how science data and information are used. Furthermore, AI excels at identifying patterns in data that elude the human eye, offering improvements to many of our forecasting or prediction tools. NCAI efforts are showcased at NOAA.gov/AI.



  






NCAI is intended to act as a conduit for a larger “community of practice,” encompassing the NOAA workforce and other communities beyond the organization who are currently using AI/ML in Earth sciences, oceanography, geophysics, and other disciplines. Organizers hope to fold in more practitioners for future ground-breaking work. 
“We want to spark conversations, provide space for networking, and encourage information sharing about AI/ML within NOAA and its scientific communities,” says leading organizer Eric Kihn of NOAA NCEI.
NOAA AI Workshops
Since 2019, NOAA has held three AI workshops geared toward AI/ML information sharing, supported by the Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) and NOAA NCEI. Each yearly conference has enabled users of AI applications to exchange experiences more widely. 
The 2021 workshop, which actively sought public participation worldwide, attracted more than 1,300 registrants and included 38 sessions and more than 180 presentations(link is external) including talks and posters. The workshop opening plenary featured NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad, who shared NOAA perspectives on AI. Recordings of presentations from the virtual event, including eight plenary sessions, are available on the NOAA Satellite and Information Service’s YouTube channel(link is external).
NOAA AI Partnerships
NCAI is collaborating with Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)(link is external) to define AI-ready data standards for Earth and space science through a Data Readiness Cluster(link is external). ESIP members and partners are discussing advancements and developing tools for open environmental data for AI applications. ESIP is a nonprofit organization supported by NOAA, NASA, USGS, and more than 130 member groups interested in furthering the study of Earth sciences.
Staff from several cooperative institutes are also supporting and collaborating with NCAI, including the Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies (CISESS) at North Carolina State University, the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Studies (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder, and Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University.
NOAA AI/ML Pilot Projects
A variety of AI/ML projects are underway, many of which have grown from NOAA Fisheries. For example, cameras using AI technology are helping to scan and classify protected species from aerial imagery (e.g., polar bears and ice seals, right whales), enumerate fishery catches from vessel-based cameras, and locate beluga whales(link is external) using acoustic technologies. Meanwhile, other branches of NOAA have used AI to characterize marine ecosystem health by listening to underwater soundscapes, monitor humpback whale populations from their songs, forecast space weather in real-time, and so much more. Many such projects have benefitted from collaborations with industry, including Microsoft, Kitware, Saildrone, Google, as well as with academia.
The rubber meets the road in several projects piloting collaborations with the NCAI. These projects include:

Water column sonar data. To develop a “data lake” to empower the detection and speciation of small fish.
Land surface temperature (LST). To use satellite data from the Himawari-8 and GOES-13 imager to develop improved LST estimates.
Magnetic navigation. Engaged the broad data science community in an X-prize competition to develop models for forecasting a key space weather activity parameter to improve magnetic navigation, demonstrating that crowdsourcing our AI/ML problems across the international data science community is an effective path.

NCAI Training and Tutorials 
NCAI is creating learning opportunities for scientists and staff who want to use AI/ML techniques in their work. From tutorials to best practices, NCAI is compiling materials, training, and ideas into a library of resources to search, discover, and tailor learning experiences. A clearinghouse of internal and public resources is under development to leverage standard tools such as Google Colab, Binder, and Github. NCAI welcomes contributions (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) from researchers that are interested in sharing their AI knowledge. Hackathons(link is external) have also been offered to expand learning by engaging teams to solve real-world scenarios.

AI generated this image from the text prompt 'Bondi love story'.(ABC)Or to scary warnings of an ""AI apocalypse"" where scenarios from movies like The Terminator or War Games seem to be becoming a reality.But there are many everyday instances of AI that also deserve our attention.What are some examples?When Spotify recommends a song, it's analysing the music you've listened to and comparing them to tracks that other people like. The AI then makes decisions about what other songs you might also enjoy.By feeding more data into an AI, the system is trained to see more connections and correlations between different pieces of information. Spotify's AI analyses our listening habits to make song recommendations.(Pexels: Ivan Samkov)This kind of automated analysis can find things humans might miss. It can also process data at speeds and scales that are humanly impossible.This is why the technology industry often gathers as much data as possible from any sources available. The idea is that more data will result in more advanced and more accurate forms of AI.But that data has to come from somewhere.Behind the AI in smart home devices like Alexa or semi-autonomous cars like Tesla is an army of often low paid workers who clean and label data so it can be understood by machines — whether it's images of street signs, recordings of speech or videos of colonoscopies.Earlier this year it was reported that large numbers of refugees in Africa and the Middle East were doing this microwork for technology companies. Their wages are often miniscule and come with no security or rights. This kind of work is also being outsourced to prisoners in Finland.Is AI better at making decisions than humans?There's an old saying in computer science: garbage in, garbage out.AI is only as good as the data used to train it. If trained on incorrect, biased or poor-quality data, its decisions and actions will also be incorrect, biased or poor.Algorithms might 'screw' youAlgorithms that make decisions without human input will ""screw [some] people by default"", a visiting legal expert warns.Read moreWhen using AI tech in hiring decisions, for instance, there's evidence they're choosing men over better-qualified women. Why? Because the data used to train these systems are embedded with gender bias, which AI then reinforces.There's no shortage of similar examples. Different AI systems have rejected black loan applicants at much higher rates than white applicants and decided black hospital patients need fewer health care resources than white patients.But algorithms are just maths, right? Maths can't be badAI decisions tend to be viewed as the result of a neutral, objective technology.Yet, from start to finish, AI is the product of human choices — prone to human errors, shaped by human biases and directed by human values.Download This ShowYour weekly guide to the world of media, culture, and technology. From social media to gadgets, streaming services to privacy issues. Each week Marc Fennell and a panel of guests  take a fun deep dive into how technology is reshaping our lives. Read moreAnd AI is already directly affecting what sociologists call our ""life chances"" — our access to services, our opportunities for advancement and our place in society.The ways we often talk about AI as a system that exists outside of people ""makes us think of something mystical and overseeing us all,"" Ellen Broad, senior fellow in the 3A Institute at ANU, tells Download This Show.The risk is that we assume these technologies are ""much more intelligent than they actually are simply by virtue of calling it AI,"" Broad says.""So it gives these systems a sense of intelligence and superiority that sometimes they don't really deserve.""What are the solutions?There is growing recognition among the giants of Silicon Valley that building and using AI comes with many thorny ethical and social issues.Tech companies like Google have established principles for ""responsible AI"" that are meant to guide their practices. For them, responsible AI means considering issues related to fairness, privacy and security when designing these technologies.But others such as Facebook tend to argue that many of AI's problems can be solved by using more AI.So what's the issue?All AI is designed to accomplish specific tasks or solve specific problems.Critics, both outside and inside the industry, say these technologies are largely created and controlled by a small group of people — mostly white, mostly male, mostly affluent.'I'm always worried.'

So what are platforms doing about it?Read moreThey get to decide how AI is trained and why it's used. They get to define the problems. The rest of us, largely, must live with those decisions, both human and artificial.But there is increasing public debate about the transparency and accountability of these automated processes that are making decisions about our lives.As we speed into a future of AI, the crucial question that many are trying to answer is what kind of technologies are compatible with a democratic society?And that's a question more of us need to consider, since the answer will have a profound impact on everybody.Dr Jathan Sadowski is a research fellow at the Emerging Technologies Research Lab and Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society at Monash University.

Efforts to combat those challenges are ongoing and it’s a big job, one which gets bigger as the population increases, and the effects of climate change alter the agricultural landscape.Sometimes finding the solution to big problems requires detailed knowledge of very small things, like the genome of staple plants like chickpeas. A recent study carried out by Rajeev Varshney from the Center of Excellence in Genomics and Systems Biology at the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and colleagues looked at the genome of chickpeas in hopes of finding a way to build a better food crop. Their findings were published in the journal Nature.They didn’t just look at one kind of chickpea. Instead, the work analyzed more than 3,366 varieties of the plant — 3,171 cultivated species and 195 wild species — in order to get a full picture of genetic diversity. They created a pan-genome which describes genetic diversity across cultivated species and their wild source plants.“It was a long journey from inception in 2014,” Varshney told SYFY WIRE. “This was the first effort of its kind across any crop. It took about three years for us to generate all of the data and then three to four years for data analysis and interpretation.”The work, though daunting, resulted in the identification of 29,870 total genes, including 1,582 which had not been reported before. This analysis identified beneficial genes as well as detrimental mutations which result in less successful plants and lower crop yields. That data was then delivered to the University of Queensland where it was analyzed by an artificial intelligence called FastStack, which is specialized for designing new varieties of plants and crops with an eye toward optimal output.   Photo: Rajeev Varshney Productivity of pulse crops, of which chickpeas are one type, has been stagnant for the last half-century. As populations increase, that has resulted in low per-capita food availability and contributes to malnutrition. Improving yields through enhancements could help to lessen some of that load.“Chickpeas are an important legume crop, cultivated in more than 50 countries and are a rich source of protein. The chickpea is a key crop toward nutritional security, especially in developing countries,” Varshney said.Scientists identified genes and gene families called haplotypes — groupings of genes which are all inherited together — which play potential roles in controlling seed size and development. Next steps are to take the genetic and artificial intelligence data and breed new, more robust varieties of chickpea in the real world. Importantly, the team identified potential enhancements with an eye toward maintaining genetic diversity. They estimate an ability to improve seed weight, an important yield metric, by up to 23%“We propose three breeding approaches based on the genomic predictions that aim to improve 16 traits and enhance production,” Varshney said. “Our findings can be utilized to develop improved chickpea varieties with better yield, nutrition, and higher resistance to several biotic and abiotic factors. We have a plan to use the AI approach to combine haplotypes of our choosing for optimal output in elite varieties of chickpea.”While this genetic and AI research has provided scientists with the ability to begin breeding novel species for improved crop yields, it has also opened a door for similar research in other staple crops. ICRISAT is reviewing other legumes and cereals, crops which have been identified as key stability foods, to identify their next target. Moreover, the work has the potential for deploying benefits not just across different species of chickpea, but to entirely different plants.Previous work sequencing the genome of the pigeonpea isolated a gene which could be deployed in soybeans, making them resistant to Asian soybean rust, a destructive fungal disease. If the movies tell us anything about artificial intelligence, it’s that they will inevitably see us as a threat and seek to destroy us, but before they do, they’re busy working to design us more and better food.We can’t wait to try some of that intelligently designed hummus.

Whether it’s athletes on a sporting field or celebrities in the jungle, nothing holds our attention like the drama of vying for a single prize. And when it comes to the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), some of the most captivating moments have also been delivered in nailbiting finishes.
In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue chess computer was pitted against grandmaster and reigning world champion Garry Kasparov, having lost to him the previous year.
But this time, the AI won. The popular Chinese game Go was next, in 2016, and again there was a collective intake of breath when Google’s AI was victorious. These competitions elegantly illustrate what is unique about AI: we can program it to do things we can’t do ourselves, such as beat a world champion.
But what if this framing obscures something vital – that human and artificial intelligence are not the same? AI can quickly process vast amounts of data and be trained to execute specific tasks; human intelligence is significantly more creative and adaptive.
The most interesting question is not who will win, but what can people and AI achieve together? Combining both forms of intelligence can provide a better outcome than either can achieve alone. 
This is called collaborative intelligence. And this is the premise of CSIRO’s new A$12 million Collaborative Intelligence (CINTEL) Future Science Platform, which we are leading.

Checkmate mates
While chess has been used to illustrate AI-human competition, it also provides an example of collaborative intelligence. IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world champion, but did not render humans obsolete. Human chess players collaborating with AI have proven superior to both the best AI systems and human players. 
And while such “freestyle” chess requires both excellent human skill and AI technology, the best results don’t come from simply combining the best AI with the best grandmaster. The process through which they collaborate is crucial.
So for many problems – particularly those that involve complex, variable and hard-to-define contexts – we’re likely to get better results if we design AI systems explicitly to work with human partners, and give humans the skills to interpret AI systems. 



Machines can do repetitive and dangerous work, but only in a set environment. They can’t transfer their skills as humans can.

A simple example of how machines and people are already working together is found in the safety features of modern cars. Lane keep assist technology uses cameras to monitor lane markings and will adjust the steering if the car appears to be drifting out of its lane. 
However, if it senses the driver is actively steering away, it will desist so the human remains in charge (and the AI continues to assist in the new lane). This combines the strengths of a computer, such as limitless concentration, with those of the human, such as knowing how to respond to unpredictable events. 
There is potential to apply similar approaches to a range of other challenging problems. In cybersecurity settings, humans and computers could work together to identify which of the many threats from cybercriminals are the most urgent. 
Similarly, in biodiversity science, collaborative intelligence can be used to make sense of massive numbers of specimens housed in biological collections.
Laying the foundations
We know enough about collaborative intelligence to say it has massive potential, but it’s a new field of research – and there are more questions than answers.
Through CSIRO’s CINTEL program we will explore how people and machines work and learn together, and how this way of collaborating can improve human work. 
Specifically, we will address four foundations of collaborative intelligence:

collaborative workflows and processes. Collaborative intelligence requires rethinking workflow and processes, to ensure humans and machines complement each other. We’ll also explore how it might help people develop new skills that might be useful across areas of the workforce 
situation awareness and understanding intent. Working towards the same goals and ensuring humans understand the current progress of a task
trust. Collaborative intelligence systems will not work without people trusting the machines. We must understand what trust means in different contexts, and how to establish and maintain trust
communication. The better the communication between humans and the machine, the better the collaboration. How do we ensure both understand each other?

Robots reimagined
One of our projects will involve working with the CSIRO-based robotics and autonomous systems team to develop richer human-robot collaboration. Collaborative intelligence will enable humans and robots to respond to changes in real time and make decisions together.
For example, robots are often used to explore environments that might be dangerous for humans, such as in rescue missions. In June, robots were sent to help in search and rescue operations, after a 12-storey condo building collapsed in Surfside, Florida.

Often, these missions are ill-defined, and humans must use their own knowledge and skills (such as reasoning, intuition, adaptation and experience) to identify what the robots should be doing. While developing a true human-robot team may initially be difficult, it’s likely to be more effective in the long term for complex missions.

When a 72-year-old male passenger tried to intervene, Hattori allegedly stabbed the man and proceeded to pursue fleeing passengers, splashing them with lighter fluid, which he then ignited. The stabbing victim was hospitalized in a critical condition and 16 other passengers suffered burns and smoke inhalation.Videos captured on smartphones showed desperate passengers struggling to squeeze out the train's partially opened windows onto the platform of Kokuryo Station.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
