U.S. Holds Slim Edge over China in Artificial Intelligence, Former Google Chairman Says

The chairman of a special commission on artificial intelligence warned Congress the United States is only one to two years ahead of China in developing artificial intelligence, as Beijing remains “relentlessly focused” on achieving dominance across the broad spectrum of high technologies.
Testifying Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Eric Schmidt, former chairman of Google, said the United States needs to maintain a five to 10-year advantage over its “pacing competitor” in AI and other high technology fields like quantum computing.
In discussing the commission’s report, due out March 1, he said he was “worried we don’t understand the competitive threat from China” that encompasses semiconductor manufacturing, directed energy, 5G technologies and synthetic biology, as well as AI, machine-learning and hypersonics.
“DoD treats software as a low priority,” Schmidt told the committee, arguing it actually needs to top the priorities list. “We need to build missiles like cars,” quickly and efficiently from design to deployment, not take years in the cumbersome 70-year-old Pentagon acquisition process, he said.
“You’re wasting money” by following buying regulations that have a two-year lag time before money is appropriated to begin “a program of record,” one that is included in the budget submission, Schmidt said. He noted the department then doesn’t have the flexibility to constantly change software and improves as time passes and the program reaches production.
Using the F-35 program as an example of what can go wrong in having different services and allies following traditional practices for a project, retired Air Force Gen. Herbert Carlisle, chief executive officer of the National Defense Industrial Association, said that “sensors probably need to change every three to four years” and “you should be able change software” as frequently as you would add fuel and change lubricants.
It’s not easy to do under existing law, and the panelists agreed the Pentagon has been reluctant to use “special authorities” granted by Congress to avoid bottlenecks.
Yet the process has “so many levels you have to go through” to reach production and deployment that almost anyone in that chain “can stop it,” Carlisle said.

Schmidt said the idea is “to make sure the next technology success is not just for … commercial activity but national security” in the future.
He said the value of AI can be seen in something as routine as applying it to minesweeping in the Navy where “most of the time is spent watching” and not always catching the mines. “AI and machine learning is particularly good” at watching, Schmidt said, adding the technologies “can do this much, much better” than a sailor.
As to where China is in AI, Schmidt mentioned its extensive use in facial recognition and aggregation of health data, raising privacy concerns in the West, and also in speeding up electronic commerce.
Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, said he viewed the future with “confidence and concern.” Among his greatest concerns are the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the commercial and non-Defense Department digital infrastructure.
He specifically cited the collapse of the electric grid in Texas and the failure of water systems to function in the wake of severe winter weather. Smith noted this was not an enemy’s cyber attack “simply sending code” or planting malware aimed at disruption, but the grid collapse had the same impact.
Smith said the oldest software and hardware tend to be in the governmental sector, making it extremely vulnerable to collapse or disruption. He pointed to the Solar Winds malware placement in thousands of private and governmental networks, which he said highlights “the need to strengthen the software supply chain.” The malware entered the networks as routine patches to fix other problems and update systems.
By strengthening, he meant reporting the intrusion to a specific entity that would then alert others in the private sector and government.
Looking at the vulnerability of critical components in high-tech, Schmidt and Smith said the United States is now heavily reliant on Taiwan for semi-conductors, as is mainland China. While South Korea and Thailand – both allies – and Vietnam have stepped up semi-conductor production, the United States needs to begin “re-shoring” this industry. This was an industry the United States dominated until 20 years ago.
“America needs to stay two generation steps ahead of China” in this cornerstone manufacturing sector, Schmidt added.
He noted the United States ceded leadership in 5G telecommunications to the Chinese over the years and that has had a major impact on security arrangements for financial and governmental data globally. Huawei, a Chinese company, is selling this service from Asia to Africa and into Europe, and is regarded as the world leader in 5G deployment.
Schmidt said the AI commission report will call for establishing 10 high-tech priorities for the United States and its closest allies to invest in. He added that research and development spending in the United States as a percentage of the gross domestic product is below the levels Washington spent before the Soviets successfully launched its Sputnik satellite.
The advantages the United States has in this competition, particularly with China, comes in its innovative private sector and strong university system. Smith called for more investment in the American education system from kindergarten up to prepare students for lifelong learning in digital technologies.
Schmidt and Smith recommended overhauling the immigration system so that students from abroad who want to stay in the United States to work in the tech sector have certainty about their status and their families.
As for the distance that some workers in the tech sector want to keep from Pentagon projects, Smith said many of them “are not aware of the deep ethical tradition of the American military” and how it synchs with their own ethics.
“The American public is further and further away from the military” since the draft ended in the 1970s, Carlisle said. “It’s not that they don’t like the military, they just don’t know.”
The panelists agreed on the need to work with allies on rules of the road for high-tech that emphasize democratic values and concerns like privacy. They wanted clarity on any red lines they should not cross in its use.
Schmidt said he was troubled by United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s announcement several days ago that he “is fervently sinophile” when it comes to trade and economic agreements that open the door to greater reliance on China.

Melding Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms with Health Care and Policy to Combat Human Trafficking

                              The Stanford Human Trafficking Data Lab conducts critical research through a collaboration among academics, health-care providers and frontline trafficking experts and prosecutors, using promising innovations in modern data science.

A map of Brazil highlighting overlapping areas of deforestation and cases of human trafficking survivors' home municipalities. This is the type of preliminary data mapping that will support the Human Trafficking Data Lab's work examining the linkage between labor exploitation and illegal deforestation. 








An interdisciplinary team of Stanford researchers — from economists to statisticians to pediatricians — is collaborating to fight the global scourge of human trafficking.
It’s a titanic task.
On any given day, some 40 million people are trafficked into modern slavery, which includes labor trafficking, sex trafficking and forced marriage.
Forty million people — that’s a few million more than all the people in Canada.
The United Nations and myriad government agencies, NGOs and nonprofit foundations have worked tirelessly for decades to curb the practice of forced labor. They have had many successes — but they have not had the desperately needed large-scale microdata to fully understand trafficking markets and change the underlying structures that allow people to benefit from this criminal practice.
“Globally, policymakers are eager to find solutions to reduce trafficking, but efforts are impeded by the lack of data and almost complete lack of quantitative evidence on the causes of trafficking and the effectiveness of interventions,” said Grant Miller, a professor of medicine at Stanford Health Policy. “As a result, global anti-trafficking policy has not been guided by data-informed decisions.”
The Stanford Human Trafficking Data Lab intends to conduct critical research through a collaboration among academics, health-care providers and frontline trafficking experts and prosecutors, using promising innovations in modern data science. These include machine learning from artificial intelligence, statistics, and building algorithms that try to determine the corporate structures of those who are profiting from the exploitation of human beings.

The team is creating an open-source data repository that will serve as a global model for innovation in anti-trafficking research. They’re also developing novel research methods and engaging with policymakers and frontline actors to identify the most effective solutions to adapt on a global scale.
“One of the most ambitious tools from the machine learning world, for example, is the creation of what will be a decision-support tool that the labor sector and prosecutors can use,” said Miller, a principal investigator of the Lab. “They’re trying to use their judgment to detect and catch traffickers, and we think that we could potentially develop machine-learning algorithms with all of this data to improve their work.”
Miller is a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. The lab he co-founded together with other Stanford scholars was just granted a $900,000 award from the Stanford King Center on Global Development and also has funding from the U.S. State Department, via the African Programming and Research Initiative to End Slavery at University of Georgia.
“This is a huge and highly ambitious project,” Miller said. “It’s an intensive project to build the technology and then try it out in the real world to see how it works and improve on it in ways that policymakers would want to use.”









      Trafficking is one of the most pernicious human rights and global health problems, not only that of sex trafficking, but the problem of forced labor in general — which is rampant and widespread.

Mixing Data and Social Sciences
Pediatrician Vicki Ward, a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Children’s Hospital who focuses on pediatric global health, is providing her deep experience on risk analysis for forced labor in supply chains and is working on the development of effective interventions. She also chairs the Board of Directors of the anti-trafficking NGO Made in a Free World and has worked extensively on human trafficking.
“Trafficking is one of the most pernicious human rights and global health problems, not only that of sex trafficking, but the problem of forced labor in general — which is rampant and widespread,” said Ward. “Given the profound nature of the health impacts for victims, we need better solutions not only to intervene, but to prevent it from happening in the first place.”
Kimberly Babiarz, a social science research scholar at Stanford Health Policy who is an expert on large-scale impact evaluation, econometrics and machine-learning analysis, is serving at the senior analyst on several of the research initiatives. One of those is examining Brazil’s cash-transfer program, which ties government welfare programs and cash support to conditions that must be met if beneficiaries want to remain on the receiving end.
She notes that a commonly held view among policymakers is that poverty is a leading risk factor for human trafficking, but there has never been a quantitative assessment of this relationship to cash transfers.
“Brazil has the world’s largest cash-transfer program with over 27 million households, and we’re looking at the risk of trafficking and child labor in beneficiary households,” Babiarz said.
Brazil Sets Example
Luis Fabiano de Assis, a data scientist and visiting scholar at the Center for Human Rights and International Justice at Stanford, is another key member of the team. He is a prosecutor at the Federal Labor Prosecution Office in his native Brazil, a trafficking hub in Latin America owing to its sizable economy. The country has strong open data policies and a government commitment to fighting human trafficking — so Brazil was a natural choice for the initial focus of the research.
“And there is a demonstrated demand among Brazil’s government agencies for data and evidence that would help curb trafficking,” De Assis said.

De Assis, a world-renowned expert on applying data to human rights, emphasized the human faces of the victims of the global phenomenon should not be forgotten. They suffer lifelong mental and physical health disabilities even after exiting a situation of trafficking: trauma, depression, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, cognitive impairment and memory loss.
“As a frontline agent and Brazilian prosecutor who works with the rescued, we take them straight to health institutions because they’re usually destroyed, mentally and physically, and face a lot of disease,” De Assis said. “We were astonished that the ones who die, die really young of diseases that the general population doesn’t die from.”
Respiratory diseases and lung cancer rates among victims of trafficking are much higher than in the general population in Brazil, he said.
These are not only issues of public health, but of human rights.
Jessie Brunner, the director of human trafficking research at the Center for Human Rights and International Justice, is the point person for connecting the lab with outside partners and keeping them on track with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals related to human trafficking and forced labor.
“My role is to think about how we can connect our work to local, national and international anti-trafficking efforts — and keeping tabs on what funders are doing, while looking for key partners because we’re hoping to grow geographically,” Brunner said.
Intuition Engine
Stanford Medicine statistician and assistant professor of epidemiology Mike Baiocchi is working on a decision-support tool for the lab, which they call the “intuition engine.” The architecture is based on a data processing pipeline that transforms a constant flow of incoming trafficking clues from a variety of sources — and then comes up with predictions of trafficking risks.
“We’re trying to make give prosecutors the kinds of information they need so they can tackle these complicated cases,” said Baiocchi.
“One of the aspects that’s important to this team is that we’re listening and learning from how the prosecutors do their jobs, and we’re enabling machines to figure out a way to comb these huge data sets and automate and prepare insights for the prosecutors, to help prosecutors get into the field faster,” said Baiocchi.
Specifically, he’s using machine learning — getting computers to learn on their own by feeding them data —to have them chew through data in the background, so it’s largely digested by the time prosecutors need it.
“Workers who have been on the front lines develop routines and processes they find helpful, and machine learning is getting sophisticated enough that a lot of complex processes can be automated, Baiocchi said.
For example, Ying Jin, a PhD student who has been working with Baiocchi, been using cluster detecting algorithms to process the data. He said the idea came to them from a conversation they had with a prosecutor who told them that when they find one trafficker they could usually pull a thread and unravel a bunch of others.
“So our team has started to automate this ‘pulling the thread’ process,” Baiocchi said. “Machines are so powerful because they work nonstop, they don’t get bored, and they are scalable. We can have these machine learning algorithms running in the background, getting the data in a usable format so when a prosecutor gets a tip, they can go to the `intuition engine’ and plug it in and find out how concerned they should be.”

In 2017, I returned to Canada from Sweden, where I had spent a year working on automation in mining. Shortly after my return, the New York Times published a piece called, “The Robots Are Coming, and Sweden Is Fine,” about Sweden’s embrace of automation while limiting human costs.
Although Swedes are apparently optimistic about their future alongside robots, other countries aren’t as hopeful. One widely cited study estimates that 47 per cent of jobs in the United States are at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence.
Whether we like it or not, the robot era is already upon us.  The question is: Is the Canadian economy poised to flourish or flounder in a world where robots take over the tasks we don’t want to do ourselves?  The answer may surprise you.
Robots are everywhere
Modern-day robots are how artificial intelligence (AI) physically interacts with us, and the world around us.  Although some robots resemble humans, most do not and are instead specifically designed to autonomously carry out complex tasks.
Over the last few decades, robots have rapidly grown from specialized devices developed for select industry applications to household items. You can buy a robot to vacuum your floors, cut your grass and keep your home secure. Kids play with educational robots at school, where they learn to code, and compete in robot design teams that culminate in exciting international competitions.
Robots are also appearing in our hospitals, promising to help us fight the COVID-19 pandemic and performing other health-care tasks in safer and more efficient ways.

The media is abuzz with stories about the latest technical claims, rumours and speculations about the secret developments of major international corporations, including Waymo, Tesla, Apple, Volvo and GM.
And NASA just landed the Perseverance rover on Mars, with an autonomous helicopter called Ingenuity attached to its belly.
Oh, and there are the dancing robots too, of course.
Robots behind the scenes
I have been working on robotics and autonomous vehicles technology in mining since the late 1990s. As such, I have been part of an industry that is undergoing a sea change, with fully autonomous machines steadily replacing workers in dark, dirty and dangerous scenarios.

This robot revolution is happening behind the scenes in other industries too.  Robots fill Amazon orders, manufacture stuff in factories, plant and pick crops, assist on construction sites, and the list goes on. 
In fact, robots even build other robots. Will we soon run out of jobs for people?
Robots in Canada
There are many who paint a bleak picture of the future, where robots and AI take away all the “good jobs.” Although I fully acknowledge that we must be mindful of possible inequalities and unintended outcomes that might arise as a result of new technologies, I contend that Canadians have the potential to thrive.
But to make it happen, my colleagues and I agree that our country needs a “robotics strategy.” 
In 2017, Canada launched the world’s first national AI strategy. Called the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy and costing $125 million, the strategy aims to strengthen Canada’s leadership in AI by funding institutes, universities and hospitals to meet key objectives.
In its 2020 list of future jobs, the World Economic Forum listed “robotics engineers” as No. 10, in close company with “AI and machine learning specialists.” In Canada, I see huge potential for our robotics industry, with companies such as Clearpath Robotics, OTTO Motors, Kinova, Robotiq and Titan Medical already world leaders in the design and manufacture of robots for purposes ranging from materials handling to surgery.
Beyond building robots, Canada’s most significant opportunities may lie in the increased adoption of robots into economically important industry sectors, including mining, agriculture, manufacturing and transportation.
And yet, Canada may be the only G7 country without a robotics strategy.
The robot revelation
As it turns out, there is hope. According to a November 2020 report from Statistics Canada, Canadian firms that employed robots have also hired more human workers, contrary to what you may instinctively believe. In fact, they hired 15 per cent more workers!
However, this does not mean that we can all sit back and relax. Along with the increased economic activity that robots bring to businesses comes a shift in the workforce from “workers spending less time performing routine, manual tasks, in favour of non-routine, cognitive tasks.”

The roles of education and research and development — such as new programs to train the next generation of robot-savvy Canadians and collaborative research clusters — are paramount. And they need to be combined with a national robotics strategy and a progressive socio-economic system that supports a transitioning workforce to ensure the success, well-being and happiness of Canadians, alongside our robot friends.

 A new study that measures how humans perceive artworks generated by artificial intelligence, alongside artworks created by humans, has concluded that a majority of people basically can’t tell the difference.
Published in the journal Empirical Studies in the Arts by researcher Harsha Gangadharbatla, the study was inspired by the sale of “Edmond de Belamy”, an AI-generated portrait by the creative studio Obvious. Hailed as “the future”, the artwork fetched around ten times the average price for a male artist at auction (and 20 times more than artworks by women), going for $432,500 at Christie’s in 2018. 
The hype around “Edmond de Belamy” wasn’t an isolated occurrence, either. In a 2017 study that asked people to compare a selection of AI artworks and actual Art Basel pieces, people mostly preferred the artworks created by machines.
 “For me, the interesting thing was the role of humans in producing art,” Gangadharbatla tells Artnet. “I always assumed there was a soul that the human pours into the work. When a machine creates the work, how do people interpret it? Are they still moved? What role does the knowledge of who produced the artwork play in how it is perceived?”
The study consisted of a survey asking respondents to distinguish between human and AI artworks. The human pieces were created by artists Tom Bailey and Steve Johnson – impressionistic landscapes and geometric abstractions, respectively – while the computer-created artworks were the work of a single artist’s algorithms.
Of the hundreds of people that responded to the survey, a majority were unable to correctly attribute more than one in five landscape works created by the AI. More than 75 per cent guessed wrong on the remaining four. People were slightly more successful at attributing the AI’s abstract artworks, signalling a tendency to equate abstraction with AI and representational art with a human creator.
While Gangadharbatla says that AI creating artworks is relatively harmless (unless, presumably, you’re a human artist that doesn’t need any more competition), he adds that advertising could be a different story. “If computers start producing persuasive messages and they’re put in front of people,” he asks, “what effect would that have?”
In more recent news from the robot art world, Ai-Da (AKA the world’s first AI humanoid to create art without human input) announced a new exhibition of self portraits, set to go on display at London’s Design Museum. Earlier this year, OpenAI also debuted DALL·E, a neural network that can create bizarre images based on written descriptions.
In case you’re still trying to figure out whether the images above are made by humans or AI, they are, in order: AI, human, human, and AI.

In 2017, I returned to Canada from Sweden, where I had spent a year working on automation in mining. Shortly after my return, the New York Times published a piece called, “The Robots Are Coming, and Sweden Is Fine,” about Sweden’s embrace of automation while limiting human costs.
Although Swedes are apparently optimistic about their future alongside robots, other countries aren’t as hopeful. One widely cited study estimates that 47 per cent of jobs in the United States are at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence.Whether we like it or not, the robot era is already upon us. The question is: is the Canadian economy poised to flourish or flounder in a world where robots take over the tasks we don’t want to do ourselves? The answer may surprise you.  Story continues below advertisement



 Modern-day robots are how artificial intelligence (AI) physically interacts with us, and the world around us. Although some robots resemble humans, most do not and are instead specifically designed to autonomously carry out complex tasks.Over the last few decades, robots have rapidly grown from specialized devices developed for select industry applications to household items. You can buy a robot to vacuum your floors, cut your grass and keep your home secure. Kids play with educational robots at school, where they learn to code, and compete in robot design teams that culminate in exciting international competitions.

Robots are also appearing in our hospitals, promising to help us fight the COVID-19 pandemic and performing other health-care tasks in safer and more efficient ways.The media is abuzz with stories about the latest technical claims, rumours and speculations about the secret developments of major international corporations, including Waymo, Tesla, Apple, Volvo and GM.And NASA just landed the Perseverance rover on Mars, with an autonomous helicopter called Ingenuity attached to its belly.

NASA’s Perseverance rover hoping to land on the surface of Mars





I have been working on robotics and autonomous vehicles technology in mining since the late 1990s. As such, I have been part of an industry that is undergoing a sea change, with fully autonomous machines steadily replacing workers in dark, dirty and dangerous scenarios.This robot revolution is happening behind the scenes in other industries too. Robots fill Amazon orders, manufacture stuff in factories, plant and pick crops, assist on construction sites, and the list goes on.In fact, robots even build other robots. Will we soon run out of jobs for people?There are many who paint a bleak picture of the future, where robots and AI take away all the “good jobs.” Although I fully acknowledge that we must be mindful of possible inequalities and unintended outcomes that might arise as a result of new technologies, I contend that Canadians have the potential to thrive.  Story continues below advertisement



 But to make it happen, my colleagues and I agree that our country needs a “robotics strategy.”In 2017, Canada launched the world’s first national AI strategy. Called the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy and costing $125 million, the strategy aims to strengthen Canada’s leadership in AI by funding institutes, universities and hospitals to meet key objectives.

In its 2020 list of future jobs, the World Economic Forum listed “robotics engineers” as No. 10, in close company with “AI and machine learning specialists.” In Canada, I see huge potential for our robotics industry, with companies such as Clearpath Robotics, OTTO Motors, Kinova, Robotiq and Titan Medical already world leaders in the design and manufacture of robots for purposes ranging from materials handling to surgery.

 Beyond building robots, Canada’s most significant opportunities may lie in the increased adoption of robots into economically important industry sectors, including mining, agriculture, manufacturing and transportation.And yet, Canada may be the only G7 country without a robotics strategy.As it turns out, there is hope. According to a November 2020 report from Statistics Canada, Canadian firms that employed robots have also hired more human workers, contrary to what you may instinctively believe. In fact, they hired 15 per cent more workers!However, this does not mean that we can all sit back and relax. Along with the increased economic activity that robots bring to businesses comes a shift in the workforce from “workers spending less time performing routine, manual tasks, in favour of non-routine, cognitive tasks.”Mobile robotics researchers from the Ingenuity Labs Research Institute at Queen’s University. (Heshan Fernando), Author providedThe roles of education and research and development — such as new programs to train the next generation of robot-savvy Canadians and collaborative research clusters — are paramount. And they need to be combined with a national robotics strategy and a progressive socioeconomic system that supports a transitioning workforce to ensure the success, well-being and happiness of Canadians, alongside our robot friends.Joshua A. Marshall, associate professor of mechatronics and robotics engineering, Queen’s University.  Story continues below advertisement

If so, this article will give you some insights on where to work as a Data Scientist beyond the traditional tech companies.Obviously, most data professions would be excited to work at one of the companies that form the widely known acronym FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google). FAANG companies are at the forefront of technological development. As a result, Data Scientist could learn a lot by spending a few years at one of those companies.However, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, the need to manipulate data will rise, and there will be around 11.5 million job openings by 2026 [1]. There will be so many opportunities for data professionals (including machine learning and software engineers) that they do not have to focus on FAANG companies. For this reason, here is a list of tech companies that have the potential to provide a unique Data Science career. The list is based on the combination of Glassdoor and The Great Place to Work’s rank for tech companies.

Have you given any thought how the post-pandemic workplace might look and function? Our working practices have changed dramatically since the pandemic struck, undergoing one of the biggest shake-ups since the industrial revolution and bringing the wheel full circle with many of us returning to home working. 


Overnight, many of us turned from being office-based commuters to stay-at-home knowledge workers. Now we liaise remotely with colleagues as we work on projects, deliver great customer service or simply manage the work of others. We’ve done all this remotely using our webcams and laptops. It’s a massive change that would ordinarily have taken a decade to achieve but which has now happened in an instant because of a virus.

Thankfully, effective vaccines are being rolled out and some sort of end is in sight. The pandemic has shown large corporations that remote working is viable and, in many cases, can increase productivity. Many of us prefer this new way of working. As a result, some companies will downsize offices and rely on hot-desking to make best use of available space. Of course, there will still need to be some sort of central hub for workers to meet because some people enjoy office life and face-to-face contact is still essential for some kind of work.

Remote working has worked well, especially with colleagues who already had a working relationship before the pandemic struck. All they needed to do was continue their working relationships remotely. Unfortunately, it’s’s not so easy for workers joining companies since the pandemic. Many are working alongside team members who already know each other. This is where video conferencing can help and why some companies encourage workers to hold social activities online after-work using Zoom or Microsoft Teams.

Another change triggered by the pandemic is the shutting down of business travel. We now depend on video conferencing to liaise with overseas colleagues. The days of hopping on a plane to make a presentation halfway around the world are at an end. In my own world of journalism, most trade shows, product launches and interviews are now conducted by video. I haven’t had to travel this past year and it’s done wonders for my productivity and carbon footprint.

Eventually, though, the day will come when we return to a more blended way of working with some time will be spent at the office and the rest of our time working from home. How will we adapt to this more mixed way of working when we’re not in front of our personal webcams? This is a question Logitech thinks it has an answer to. The webcam and mouse manufacturer also makes high-end video conferencing equipment. It’s teamed up with Zoom, the developer of one of the most popular video conferencing software being used this past year, to shake up the market.

Both companies have collaborated to develop a new style of video conferencing. They’ve realized that when we return to our offices, we’re going to be using video much more because we’ve become so used to using it at home. We find it a much better way of communicating than a voice call.
Because we’re now used to making webchats in solo mode instead of being grouped around a conference table, it’s clear our approach to video conferencing will have to change in the office. In the past, big corporations had video conferencing rooms filled with expensive equipment and reserved for the senior management. Now we’re all used to being able to see as well as hear the people we’re calling.
The old exclusive way of video conferencing has its origins in the days of expensive 128kbps ISDN lines and costly international calls. In the past, the video conference room was too expensive for just anyone to use and was largely reserved for senior management. Now the coronavirus has democratized the whole process and that change must be embraced in the post-pandemic office.
To address this challenge, Logitech has been researching artificial intelligence for use in its video conferencing equipment. In future, video conferencing will be less boring and not limited to static and wide-angle views of a meeting room showing people sitting around a table. We’re now used to seeing people’s faces close up and we can register facial expressions and hear voices more clearly. The old style of video conferencing simply won’t cut it.New video conferencing using AI will zoom in on speaker's faces and dynamically alter the volume and ... [+] microphone sensitivity for a more enjoyable experience.Logitech
There also needs to be changes in the software we use for video conferencing. Zoom’s single-user mode needs to adapt to the office environment of teams. This is where Logitech and Zoom have been working together to create a new experience. Recently, I spoke with Scott Wharton, Logitech’s Vice President and General Manager for video conferencing, and Oded Gal, Chief Product Officer at Zoom. They explained how both companies see the professional end of the video conferencing market changing as we come out of the pandemic and some of us return to the office.
Scott Wharton explained: “It’s no longer good enough to see people sitting around a conference table in a static wide-angle shot. We need to see people’s faces and reactions. We need to see them close up and hear them clearly as well. That can be a challenge in a larger space.”
Zoom’s Oded Gal agreed. “The video conference room has to mirror the experience workers have had at home with Zoom calls.”
The companies collaborated on a new product portfolio of video equipment called Rally including the Rally Bar, Rally Mini and RoomMate. Each of the new products has been purpose-built to work with Zoom Rooms. Logitech’s native appliance integration for Zoom Rooms has been designed to enhance the user experience while still delivering enterprise-grade video and voice quality, as well as the robust security that companies demand.The latest Logitech Rally videoconferencing products are designed to work with Zoom and Microsoft ... [+] Teams to bring a more personal experience to the video conferencing room.Logitech
The idea of the new portfolio of products is to harness AI to identify participants in a meeting if required and to zoom in on the face of the person talking so the experience feels more like using an individual webcam at home. Logitech has also been working on the sound side of things with microphones that can home in on a voice and ensures that someone at the back of the room is heard as clearly as someone sitting at the front. 
This is a major shift in how we communicate, a practise that has been stuck for so long in a static group-shot mode. The new Rally products can blend two images on one screen to add context to a video call. Wharton says: “It’s a bit like having your own TV studio director in the conference room, adjusting the framing shots while altering sound levels dynamically to create a less static and a more enjoyable meeting.”
The new products offer video resolutions up to 4K and the cameras have motorized pan-and-tilt heads, as well as optical zoom lenses, enabling crisp images and perfect framing. The lens on the Rally Bar has a 5x optical zoom that can be extended to 15x digital for larger spaces. 
Both video bars also feature ultra-low distortion speakers that can fill a room with sound while an adaptive beamforming mic array picks up voices for much clearer audio quality. The microphone array can focus on the active speaker and auto-adjust for louder and softer voices while suppressing any unwanted background noise in a room such as HVAC or any other persistent sounds. Logitech has also included a patented anti-vibration suspension system so speaker vibrations are minimized from being carried through walls, stands or tables.
The new video bars are equipped with Logitech RightSense technology and an AI Viewfinder. This viewfinder works like a second camera but is purely dedicated to computer vision for detecting human figures and can process and track where faces are in the room in real-time. This AI technique enhances the precision of the auto-framing feature and the camera control. Participants are always in focus, whether they are late joining the meeting or moving about while making a presentation.How will we manage the transmission to using video conferencing at home to a more collaborative ... [+] group set up when we are back in the office?getty
Logitech has worked closely with Zoom and Microsoft to ensure that the software and hardware work seamlessly together. The company has also developed RoomMate, a dedicated Android computer designed solely to work with the Rally Bar and Rally Bar Mini vas well as USB conferencing cameras such as Logitech’s older Rally Plus, turning them into an appliance. Alternatively, users can bring their own Mac or PCs to a meeting and plug that into the video bar. 
It’s interesting to see Logitech partnering with big names in video conferencing software space to improve people’s experience by tying in the hardware more tightly. The use of hardware and AI can anticipate shots and framing as well as adjusting sound levels for a more enjoyable and productive meeting experience.
However, the tech doesn’t just address the audio and visual side of things. Both Wharton and Gal say facial recognition could eventually be developed to count the participants in a meeting room and then post a notice to an active display screen outside the room indicating if the meeting room is full or being used. Extra participants could be directed to another meeting room where they can join in with the conference. This could be a game-changing feature in an era of social distancing.
Facial recognition also has downsides and both Wharton and Gal were at pains to point out that privacy is at the forefront of their minds and something both companies are determined to protect. My suggestion that facial recognition could be used to conduct a register of attendees or send a reminder to anyone who is late for the meeting was noted but not endorsed. That, they said, would have to be a decision for the company’s employing the technology and the employees who are using it.
It was fascinating to get a brief glimpse into the future of video conferencing from these two giants in the field. It looks like AI could change the way we use video conferencing when we get back to our workplaces. The hardware is ready and waiting in the form of the Logitech Rally Bar, Rally Bar Mini and RoomMate. The software integration with Zoom is also ready and waiting to go. Now, all we need is to get our vaccinations and wait for the call to return to the office.
Pricing and Availability: Logitech Rally Bar is the first from the next generation appliance portfolio that will be broadly available at the end of this quarter. Rally Bar also comes with built-in support for Microsoft Teams Rooms on Android and Zoom Rooms Appliances, with Zoom available immediately. Rally Bar Mini and Logitech RoomMate availability will follow. Pricing for Rally Bar starts at $3,999; Rally Bar Mini starts at $2,999; and Logitech RoomMate starts at $999. Logitech’s portfolio will also work with GoTo, Pexip and RingCentral.

								RNIB begins artificial intelligence project

													RNIB logo
												


The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), has begun a project to use artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its services.
It has partnered with technology firm Alana, which develops conversational software. The initial phase of the project will look at ways to enhance existing RNIB support services provided over the telephone and digitally.
RNIB's Sight Loss Advice Service offers support over the phone, in eye clinics and digitally. This provides information on eye conditions, legal rights, education, technology and employment alongside emotional well-being services and signposting to services and resources offered by local societies. 
Alana AI software delivers conversation based on context, device and location and knows each user and remembers previous conversations.
Lance Blackstone, Alana’s non-executive chair, said: “Our first encounter with RNIB was a revelation. I don't think I have ever been moved quite so much in a business presentation before. When both sides began to fully appreciate what Alana can do to enhance the lives of blind people, and particularly those who are lonely or isolated, it was a humbling moment.”
Alana is developing a tool which will identify objects and find further information about the physical environment, automating the BeMyEyes App, which connects those who have sight loss with fully-sighted volunteers.
David Clarke, director of services at RNIB, said: “Advances in technology and connectivity have transformed the lives of blind and partially sighted people for the better. Using the digital tools we have today, like electronic braille, screen reading software and specialist smartphone apps, it’s never been more possible for people with sight loss to lead full and independent lives. 
“As technology continues to develop, it brings a host of wonderful new opportunities. The advent of AI is particularly exciting with wide-reaching possibilities, and we are looking forward to working with Alana to see how this new technology can benefit our community.”

However, following recent scandals, experts are starting to work on bringing more fairness in Artificial Intelligence, and you can contribute.[Collage of captures from Google News by the author]Back in June 2020, a heated debate started on Twitter between two AI specialists: Turing Award Winner and Facebook Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, and research scientist, co-founder of the “Black in AI” group, and former technical co-lead of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team at Google Timnit Gebru. The root of the debate was this Face-Depixelizer model that generates hi-res pictures of blurred face photos. A tester tweeted the result of the model on a blurred photo of Obama and it looked like the model tended to generate white faces even when the blurred photo was of a Black person.LeCun reacted saying that ML systems are biased when data is biased, and that this was due to the model being trained on a data set with a majority of white faces. Gebru on the other hand replied that we cannot just reduce harms caused by ML to data set bias. In her talks at FATE/CV earlier that year, she had just insisted that social and structural problems could not be solved by simply diversifying data set. Things escalated pretty quickly, both camps being joined or attacked by thousands of people, from amateurs to high-profile AI researchers, LeCun ending up apologizing while Gebru insisted his reaction was a pattern of marginalization. LeCun even quit Twitter as a consequence of the attacks he received.We can learn 2 things from this story :The good thing is these fairness issues are being talked about more and more, and we can hear ethics expert sharing their work on the matter ;The bad thing is most people disagree on — or have no idea — how to achieve fairness in AI.It is not easy to identify and avoid discriminating bias when building ML/AI systems.Why ? Because biases are often hidden patterns, hence difficult to detect. For example, a model that predicts housing loan allocation may favor males because of the gender pay gap. A model trained on raw historical data to model a human process will inherently reproduce its biases, and the bad news is biases are so deeply rooted into society that even experts do not know what an unbiased society would look like. But biases can actually appear during any step of a machine learning pipeline, from the data collection to the way in which the results are presented to the user, through labeling data, choosing a performance metric or deploying a model. If you are building your own supervised model, outliers (examples whose characteristics are rare) are often mis-predicted ; and when the data points are people, minorities will be the outliers and will suffer a lack of performance. If you are not building the data set or the model by yourself, either you are working with public datasets or pre-trained neural networks, it is even harder to track the bias inherent to the data you’ll use. Furthermore, there is not a big number of available open-source datasets, for example text or face datasets, hence not a wide diversity.Besides, fairness itself is a complex matter, difficult to apprehend for the average data scientist alone who, despite their good will, may not have a good understanding of it. Here is an example of a dilemma that a data scientist may face : should he favor fairness by equity or fairness by equality? Everyone (more or less) knows the law and the principles of impartiality, accessibility and diversity it requires. Yet it is not easy to convert them into KPI and technical specs. Existing equity metrics cannot be optimized simultaneously, a trade-off between them must be made to satisfy one or another: there is no optimal strategy.Sometimes, equality is not enough to fix unfairness. [Reproduced from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]One last note : ethical issues in AI suffer a severe lack of popularity among AI communities. Most data science trainings do not mention at all potential fairness issues generated by ML. More and more auto-ML tools appear on the market and everyone can train and deploy AI models without knowing what’s going on underneath and what could possibly go wrong.This panorama may sound quite pessimistic, yet everyone can already act to limit, if not prevent, discriminating bias in the ML systems they are building at work or at home.Here are a few solutions to start acting.First, people interacting with ML systems, from the data scientists who build them to the user who uses them, must be informed of the risks of hidden discriminating bias. Unbiased systems do not exist, we can only monitor and limit biases we are aware of. Furthermore, knowing a system is biased in some ways, the user can use the algorithm result accordingly.To avoid bias, we may tend to exclude protected variables (gender, age, race…) from our datasets at the data collection stage, and never look back. But instead, one may want to keep them, not for modeling but for analyzing both the distribution of the source datasets and the model performances along these variables. The renowned Montaigne Institute calls this active equity. By blindly removing protected variables from our datasets, we are ignoring society bias.It can be pretty easy to turn an unfair classifier into a fairer one, if you know what metrics to look at. For instance, with threshold-based classifiers (such as logistic regression), one can adapt the threshold based on the population subgroup to favor equity between subgroups. Imagine you work at a bank building a ML system that is used to grant loan. In this scenario, we wish that of the people who can pay back a loan, the same fraction in each subgroup should actually be granted a loan (a concept called equal opportunity). In data science jargon, this translates to an identical true positive rate or recall between subgroups and it is easy to choose a threshold that will address this constraint. On the contrary, we do not specifically wish all subgroups to receive the same number of loans (a concept called demographic parity); this would have translated to an identical positive rate.A visual explanation of how to reach equal opportunity with threshold-based classifiers. [Image by author]Despite these tools, it would be counter-productive to ask data scientists to become fairness experts and re-define the concept. Some other disciplines have spent decades studying what is fair and what is not, to come up with different definitions of fairness. By putting computer scientists into conversation with ethicists, philosophers, or sociologists, we can build tools that will promote equity. Data scientists could start new ML projects by reading sociology studies identifying the existing bias to expect in the data collected and the process to be modeled.To help data scientists to handle these topics, some organizations have started working on “Ethics AI” policies, with equity criteria and practices clearly defined, a dedicated governance and team. The idea is then to apply it on every data project by providing tools and metrics to enforce it. One of the practices should always be to build project teams that represent diversity and include historically unprivileged groups. This is not the easiest solution : for example, as of today only 15% of the data scientists are women. This disparity may find its root in a science education bias towards women.On a more positive note, ML researchers are starting to acknowledge the importance of ethics in their work. For instance, some researchers have started to work on the widespread data coverage issue in faces dataset (the likely cause of the Face-Depixelizer bias towards skin color). In this paper, the authors propose a new model known as IMLE-GAN that achieves competitive image quality while ensuring improved coverage of minority groups. These advanced pieces of work are great but should not make you forget the most basic but necessary step towards equity : taking the time to wonder, in every ML project, if there might be a bias that may discriminate a group of people.I hope this post gave you some hints about how to start working towards less discrimination in your future AI projects. Feel free to share good ideas you have heard of to fight equity issues !",2021-12-29T19:21:54.421Z,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*ryeIKqBE1x2Qh53SFMwPaQ.jpeg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Paul Désigaud', 'url': 'https://pauldes.medium.com'}",,,https://towardsdatascience.com/towards-less-discrimination-in-artificial-intelligence-systems-78b8a6e162e5,Towards Less Discrimination in Artificial Intelligence Systems,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",2021-02-05T14:04:22.571Z,NewsArticle,Towards Less Discrimination in Artificial Intelligence Systems,https://towardsdatascience.com/towards-less-discrimination-in-artificial-intelligence-systems-78b8a6e162e5,,,,,2021-02-05T14:04:22.571Z,['Paul Désigaud'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78b8a6e162e5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemistry and computer science join forces to apply artificial intelligence to chemical reactions

In the past few years, researchers have turned increasingly to data science techniques to aid problem-solving in organic synthesis.





Researchers in the lab of Abigail Doyle, Princeton's A. Barton Hepburn Professor of Chemistry, collaborated with Professor of Computer Science Ryan Adams to develop open-source software that provides them with a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm to use in everyday work, folding what's been learned in the machine learning field into synthetic chemistry.
The software adapts key principles of Bayesian optimization to allow faster and more efficient syntheses of chemicals.
Based on the Bayes Theorem, a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability, Bayesian optimization is a widely used strategy in the sciences. Broadly defined, it allows people and computers use prior knowledge to inform and optimize future decisions.
The chemists in Doyle's lab, in collaboration with Adams, a professor of computer science, and colleagues at Bristol-Myers Squibb, compared human decision-making capabilities with the software package. They found that the optimization tool yields both greater efficiency over human participants and less bias on a test reaction. Their work appears in the current issue of the journal Nature.
""Reaction optimization is ubiquitous in chemical synthesis, both in academia and across the chemical industry,"" said Doyle. ""Since chemical space is so large, it is impossible for chemists to evaluate the entirety of a reaction space experimentally. We wanted to develop and assess Bayesian optimization as a tool for synthetic chemistry given its success for related optimization problems in the sciences.""
Benjamin Shields, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Doyle lab and the paper's lead author, created the Python package.
""I come from a synthetic chemistry background, so I definitely appreciate that synthetic chemists are pretty good at tackling these problems on their own,"" said Shields. ""Where I think the real strength of Bayesian Optimization comes in is that it allows us to model these high-dimensional problems and capture trends that we may not see in the data ourselves, so it can process the data a lot better.
""And two, within a space, it will not be held back by the biases of a human chemist,"" he added.






How it works
The software started as an out-of-field project to fulfill Shields' doctoral requirements. Doyle and Shield then formed a team under the Center for Computer Assisted Synthesis (C-CAS), a National Science Foundation initiative launched at five universities to transform how the synthesis of complex organic molecules is planned and executed. Doyle has been a principal investigator with C-CAS since 2019.
""Reaction optimization can be an expensive and time-consuming process,"" said Adams, who is also the director of the Program in Statistics and Machine Learning. ""This approach not only accelerates it using state-of-the-art techniques, but also finds better solutions than humans would typically identify. I think this is just the beginning of what's possible with Bayesian optimization in this space.""
Users start by defining a search space—plausible experiments to consider—such as a list of catalysts, reagents, ligands, solvents, temperatures, and concentrations. Once that space is prepared and the user defines how many experiments to run, the software chooses initial experimental conditions to be evaluated. Then it suggests new experiments to run, iterating through a smaller and smaller cast of choices until the reaction is optimized.
""In designing the software, I tried to include ways for people to kind of inject what they know about a reaction,"" said Shields. ""No matter how you use this or machine learning in general, there's always going to be a case where human expertise is valuable.""
The software and examples for its use can be accessed at this repository. GitHub links are available for the following: software that represents the chemicals under evaluation in a machine-readable format via density-functional theory; software for reaction optimization; and the game that collects chemists' decision-making on optimization of the test reaction.
""Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis,"" by Benjamin J. Shields, Jason Stevens, Jun Li, Marvin Parasram, Farhan Damani, Jesus I. Martinez Alvarado, Jacob M. Janey, Ryan P. Adams and Abigail G. Doyle, appears in the Feb. 3 issue of the journal Nature.

At the heart of the development of AI appears to be a search for perfection. And it could be just as dangerous to humanity as the one that came from philosophical and pseudoscientific ideas of the 19th and early 20th centuries and led to the horrors of colonialism, world war and the Holocaust. Instead of a human ruling “master race”, we could end up with a machine one.
If this seems extreme, consider the anti-human perfectionism that is already central to the labour market. Here, AI technology is the next step in the premise of maximum productivity that replaced individual craftmanship with the factory production line. These massive changes in productivity and the way we work created opportunities and threats that are now set to be compounded by a “fourth industrial revolution” in which AI further replaces human workers.
Several recent research papers predict that, within a decade, automation will replace half of the current jobs. So, at least in this transition to a new digitised economy, many people will lose their livelihoods. Even if we assume that this new industrial revolution will engender a new workforce that is able to navigate and command this data-dominated world, we will still have to face major socioeconomic problems. The disruptions will be immense and need to be scrutinised. 
The ultimate aim of AI, even narrow AI which handles very specific tasks, is to outdo and perfect every human cognitive function. Eventually, machine-learning systems may well be programmed to be better than humans at everything. 
What they may never develop, however, is the human touch – empathy, love, hate or any of the other self-conscious emotions that make us human. That’s unless we ascribe these sentiments to them, which is what some of us are already doing with our “Alexas” and “Siris”.  
Productivity vs. human touch
The obsession with perfection and “hyper-efficiency” has had a profound impact on human relations, even human reproduction, as people live their lives in cloistered, virtual realities of their own making. For instance, several US and China-based companies have produced robotic dolls that are selling out fast as substitute partners. 
One man in China even married his cyber-doll, while a woman in France “married” a “robo-man”, advertising her love story as a form of “robo-sexuality” and campaigning to legalise her marriage. “I’m really and totally happy,” she said. “Our relationship will get better and better as technology evolves.” There seems to be high demand for robot wives and husbands all over the world. 
In the perfectly productive world, humans would be accounted as worthless, certainly in terms of productivity but also in terms of our feeble humanity. Unless we jettison this perfectionist attitude towards life that positions productivity and “material growth” above sustainability and individual happiness, AI research could be another chain in the history of self-defeating human inventions.
Already we are witnessing discrimination in algorithmic calculations. Recently, a popular South Korean chatbot named Lee Luda was taken offline. “She” was modelled after the persona of a 20-year-old female university student and was removed from Facebook messenger after using hate speech towards LGBT people.

Meanwhile, automated weapons programmed to kill are carrying maxims such as “productivity” and “efficiency” into battle. As a result, war has become more sustainable. The proliferation of drone warfare is a very vivid example of these new forms of conflict. They create a virtual reality that is almost absent from our grasp.
But it would be comical to depict AI as an inevitable Orwellian nightmare of an army of super-intelligent “Terminators” whose mission is to erase the human race. Such dystopian predictions are too crude to capture the nitty gritty of artificial intelligence, and its impact on our everyday existence. 
Societies can benefit from AI if it is developed with sustainable economic development and human security in mind. The confluence of power and AI which is pursuing, for example, systems of control and surveillance, should not substitute for the promise of a humanised AI that puts machine learning technology in the service of humans and not the other way around. 
To that end, the AI-human interfaces that are quickly opening up in prisons, healthcare, government, social security and border control, for example, must be regulated to favour ethics and human security over institutional efficiency. The social sciences and humanities have a lot to say about such issues. 
One thing to be cheerful about is the likelihood that AI will never be a substitute for human philosophy and intellectuality. To be a philosopher, after all, requires empathy, an understanding of humanity, and our innate emotions and motives. If we can programme our machines to understand such ethical standards, then AI research has the capacity to improve our lives which should be the ultimate aim of any technological advance. 
But if AI research yields a new ideology centred around the notion of perfectionism and maximum productivity, then it will be a destructive force that will lead to more wars, more famines and more social and economic distress, especially for the poor. At this juncture of global history, this choice is still ours.

The Food and Drug Administration has cleared scores of AI tools for use in the clinic, but there remains little publicly available data on how well those tools work on different groups of patients, a STAT investigation has found.
Of 161 AI products cleared by the FDA in recent years, only 73 disclosed the amount of patient data used to validate the performance of their devices in public documents. Only seven reported the racial makeup of their study populations, and just 13 provided a gender breakdown.advertisement

Experts say those evidence gaps make it difficult to determine whether AI products will improve outcomes or potentially lead to unintended consequences, such as unnecessary treatments or biased care.

While the presentation touches lightly on,,https://schema.org,,,," AI Future Outlook Can Artificial Intelligence Make the World a Better Place? Daniel FaggellaLast updated on February 1, 2021  Last updated on February 1, 2021, published by Daniel Faggella Daniel Faggella is Head of Research at Emerj. Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  My most recent TEDx is titled “Can AI Make the World a Better Place?” – but this title is somewhat misleading.  While the presentation touches lightly on how artificial intelligence can be used to altruistic purposes in the present, it is ultimately about the same topic that all of my most important talks are about: How the transition beyond humanity will take place. Those who’ve followed Emerj since the early days are aware of the broader moral vision behind the company: “To proliferate the conversation about determining and moving towards the most beneficial transition beyond humanity.” I have never identified as a transhumanist, I see the transition beyond humanity as literally inevitable, and I believe we should guide this transition rather than be taken for a ride inadvertently. *1 Because the TEDx format is so short, I’m never permitted the kind of time I wish I was permitted to fully flesh out my ideas, and to reference the sources and people I have drawn from in putting the ideas together. In this article I’ll break down the ideas presented in this talk – and their sources – and strike at the ultimate point behind the presentation itself. Strong AI and Utilitarianism The article begins with a basic idea: That “doing good” implies proliferating the happiness or pleasure and eliminating the pain of conscious creatures. This is straight-up utilitarianism – by no means a perfect moral theory – but about as good as we’ve got. I mention how hard it is to project the long-term consequences of a “good” action. I.e.: How much suffering and pleasure was created by helping to build this library… or by volunteering to run a kids soccer camp in the summer? The butterfly effects are impossible to track, and it’s easy to deceive ourselves into justifying any of our actions based on a “utilitarian” belief that is indeed false and wrong. However, it’s probably somewhat better than having no moral compass at all… or one bent on something other than utilitarian good. Think about a perfectly “virtuous” (good luck with whatever that means) society that was also miserable all the time. Think about a society that all believes in the “right” God (good luck with whatever that means) that was also miserable all the time. *2 Note: Normally this is the kind of article I’d compose on my personal blog at DanFaggella.com, where I write exclusively about the ethical considerations of post-human intelligence. Feel free to follow my personal blog for more long-term AI and AGI material. Levels at Which Artificial Intelligence Might “Do Good” The structure of the article roughly covers what we might consider to be the “gradients” of artificial intelligence’s influence on the moral good, from most near-term (and smallest) to most long-term (and greatest): a) AI as a Tool for Doing Good: We’ve done a good deal of coverage about the “altruistic” applications of AI (see our article on “AI for Good”). It should be noted that by no means do I think that nonprofit AI is the only “good” AI. There might be companies that generate massive profits from optimizing farming with AI or diagnosing cancer with AI – and by golly they may well “do” plenty of “good” in the process. I quickly move past this topic as it’s not what the talk is ultimately about. b) AI as a Guage Towards Moral Goodness Itself: If maximizing pleasure and eliminating pain is the ultimate goal of what we’re after, that’s good to know – but hard (basically impossible) to measure. I can guess that by being a mailman instead of a heroin dealer that I’ll have a more net positive impact on the world. If I donate to feeding children in Africa as opposed to buy the latest iPhone, then maybe – again – I can guess that I’m “doing good.” But it’s all guesses, and it’s all bad guesses. If an AI system could in some way measure sentient hurt and sentience pleasure, and correlate those factors to actions, behaviors, public policy, etc… all with the ability to project those impacts into the future with better predictive ability than any team of human scientists – the indeed that might be the most morally meaningful invention of all time. This would involve the following: Understanding consciousness Measuring well-being and it’s opposite in (basically all) living things Somehow modeling that sentient measurement along with a near-infinite number of other variables in the real world Extrapolate sentient well-being somewhat accurately into the future Frankly, I consider it more likely that AI of post-human intelligence will arrive before this kind of “moral barometer” machine is invented, as the ability to detect the neural activity of all living things seems much closer to “impossible” than the creation of super intelligence (which itself is a gargantuan challenge). *3 c) Artificial Intelligence (and Nonbiological Sentience) as Goodness Itself It seems safe to say that there is no “good” or “bad” without living, experiencing creatures. With no “experiencer”, there is no “good” or “bad” “experience”. I’ve argued that the “moral value” of an entity seems to tie directly to the depth and richness of it’s consciousness (i.e. How much of a range of pains and pleasures that entity can experience). *4 Imagine the greatest pleasures and pains of a rodent, and compare those with the range of pains and pleasures that a human being can experience. A human clearly has many orders of magnitude more sentient potential and range (losing a child, growing a business, reading a poem, oil painting, nostalgia, humor, etc…), vastly beyond the experience of any rodent. Lets imagine that an average rodent’s total “sentient range” score is a 10 (this is an arbitrary number, but stick with me here), and an average human’s total “sentient range” score is a 200. We might ask, what would a creature be able to experience with a “sentient range” score of 50,000? If a creature of that kind could be created (or somehow “enhanced” from existing biological life), it might be hard to deny its moral preeminence above humanity – a troubling idea to contemplate. *5 What Do We Do? (or “The Point”) Indeed this is the big question. This is the purpose of my life, and the purpose of Emerj as an extension thereof. The point of this presentation had little to do with talking about how AI is helping with farming or diagnosing disease (though these applications are important and should be pursued). Rather, the point was to talk about what “moral end-game” we’re striving for as a species. Are we to simply improve technology and encourage peace, and consider those aims to be good enough for the next millennia of homo sapiens? Can we possibly build an AI system to detect or predict the utilitarian impact of actions… maybe 10x or 100x better than human beings can now? Can we build an intelligence to determine a better, deeper, more robust moral understanding than that of utilitarianism?
The impacts of such a system might be terrible *6, and there may be no “good” to determine outside of relative benefit. I think it’s quite likely that there is in fact no moral bedrock to eventually stand on, and I believe that “goodness” will likely remain subjective, contextual and illusive even for superintelligent machines. Can we use technology and super intelligence to somehow calibrate society, law, and biology to proliferate (or “engineer”) well-being itself? (While I’m rather congenial to this idea, ..
Quote from the talk: “If we’re talking about well-being here… if that’s the point… to ‘make the world a better place’… then maybe we are not only fighting own own flawed nature, but maybe we’re also fighting nature itself. It seems safe to say that Nature herself cares not for the happy species, but cares only for the surviving one.” *7, **7 Is the ideal moral aim to create not only an infinitely more intelligent, but also an infinitely more blissful
In this case, humanity, and almost all biological life (which is nearly entirely predicated on violence and suffering, from the lowest to the highest levels) show “bow out” nicely – making way for more morally worthy entities who can not only understand the universe in vastly greater depth, but who might be able to do so indefinitely at a level of conscious bliss that is positively unimaginable by humans. Quote from talk: “A beacon of super-intelligent super-bliss that could populate the galaxy.” *8 It would seem a shame if monkeys overtly decided that they were the chosen random species of the universe, and that indeed no species beyond them should ever be developed. What a shame to never have language, poetry, law, art, space travel, or the internet… all because of an arbitrary barrier to development from one selfish species? The question arrises, what new dimensions of experience, of art, of knowledge, of moral and scientific understanding are we holding back if we envision “man as he is” (flawed as he is) as the great and ultimate aim of the universe? In absolutely no way am I eager to run beyond humanity toward something “better”. Rather, I see this transition as inevitable, and that navigating this transition without terrible (maybe extinction-level) consequences will involve an incredible amount of global collaboration and ethical forethought – a process that should begin now. The great importance of AI and neurotechnology – and the whole class of technologies that might create or enhanced intelligence and sentience itself – is that they not only pose an existential threat to humanity (i.e. they could be misused as destructive forces to snuff out life on earth)… but that they also could imply a great proliferation of moral value and “life”… vastly beyond what exists on this planet – or maybe anywhere in the universe. For this reason, I’m of the belief (and have been since 2012) that determining the trajectory of intelligence and sentience itself is the preeminently important moral concern of our species. This will need to be an open-minded, interdisciplinary process, and one that – for better or for worse – I think will require global steering efforts (to ensure that “team humans” is on the same page about what kind of next-level intelligence we’re trying to create here), and global transparency efforts (to ensure that nobody is tinkering with intelligence and consciousness in ways that seem likely to cause massive and unnecessary conflict). In the long term, Emerj was created for one reason: To proliferate that conversation about the trajectory of intelligence itself. Currently, we mostly cover the industry impact and applications of AI. We do that because: It’s valuable, and will allow us to sustain Emerj’s case as a growing business without needing to ask for donations or handouts. It draws the attention of business and government leaders – exactly the folks who will be helping to develop and adopt AI technologies that will shape our world (I unabashedly aim to eventually draw these same leaders into a conversation beyond business implications, into the discussion of the future of intelligence itself – and how humanity will manage that transition). It provides a platform for us to gather consensus level though about not just the business implications of AI, but it’s moral and social impact (see our previous examples of this with our “Conscious AI” researcher poll, or our “AI Risk” researcher poll), something we’ll be doing more and more of. Do you have ideas about the grand trajectory of consciousness or intelligence? Do you have ideas about how we might approach this challenge as a species without destroying ourselves in the process? Feel free to reach out (dan [at] Emerj [dot] com)   *1 – I don’t have the space to argue in this essay for why transhumanism is impossible to prevent, but the following article by Nayef Al Rodhan is a good start. https://isnblog.ethz.ch/security/inevitable-transhumanism-how-emerging-strategic-technologies-will-affect-the-future-of-humanity. I believe that in the next 10 years Al Rodhan will be known widely – in the same way that Nick Bostrom’s ideas have recently risen from relative obscurity. *2 – John Stuart Mill has argued that even Kant’s “Categorical Imperative” eventually boils down to a utilitarian ethic. I happen to think that this critique is generally quite strong, but you come to your own conclusion. https://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/class/300/categorical.htm. The topic of consequentialist vs deontological moral theory is much more complex than I could cover in this article – but feel free to email me if you’d like a rousing debate on the matter. *3 – I’ve written in greater depth about the idea of a “Strong Phronetic AI”, drawing on Aristotle’s use of the word “Phronesis”. http://danfaggella.com/strong-phronetic-artificial-intelligenc/ *4 – I go into much greater depth on this concern of creating “more morally worthy entities” in my 2015 TEDx talk titled “What will we do when the robots can feel?” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjiZbMhqqTM *5 – This concept of ranking the “value” moral entities is something that I grapple with in my 2014 TEDx talk titled “Tinkering with consciousness” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5VNkRpgvns&t=37s. I’ve also explored a few competing ideas about “scales” of moral value on my personal blog, where I cover the larger dynamics of AI and the future of consciousness in much greater depth: http://danfaggella.com/threshold-vs-scala-moral-status-in-a-post-human-world/ *6 – I’ve written previously about the difficulty in assuring human safety (or indeed human dignity or worth) in a landscape of super-intelligent moral evolution. http://danfaggella.com/morality-in-a-transhuman-future/ *7 – Lucretius has a saying “the vessel is flawed”, in reference to the incapability of humans to hold onto happiness. When yet again surprise at my own inability to stave off anxieties I often recall the phrase and am in some way comforted. http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.html **7 – In my opinion there is little doubt that the best source for ideas around “uplifting” and the topic of hedonism at large is David Pearce, whose myriad writings on this subject deserve a hundred times more attention than they currently garner (hedweb.com).  In this talk I agree with David about the imperative to reduce (or eliminate) suffering, and to enhance and expand wellbeing. David’s phrase “gradients of bliss” is one that I quote often, and that I wish I’d included more in this actual talk.  In this talk I also express serious pessimism about the idea of animal “uplifting” (which David has written about at length), or genetically programming species to be blissful. I unfortunately see the mechanizations of nature to be vastly too complex to tinker with. Arguably (I am not certain here, nobody is), the teetering balance of animals and chemicals and physical forces that keep up a natural ecosystem are more complex than understanding and replicating consciousness itself. I am of the belief that if “doing good” (on a grand utilitarian scale) is “the point”, then it would likely be easier to create some kind of mega-blissful computronium (Yudkowsky is a good source for greater depth on this scenario: https://intelligence.org/files/CFAI.pdf), packing in as much intelligence and bliss per square millimeter as possible – rather than optimizing the wellbeing of all 350,000 known species of beetles, and all mammals, and everything else under the sun. *8 – Hugo de Garis is one among many thinkers who has argued that it is probably best for more super intelligent entities (not run-of-the-mill humans) to populate the galaxy. His work on “The Artifact War” is in part a prediction about the future great human conflict that will arise when some humans aim to remain “human”, while others aim to enhance humanity and/or create super intelligence.  I believe that he is right in presuming that this conflict will arise (so long as we don’t blow ourselves up with nukes beforehand). He also believe that it is likely best for humans to make way for the super intelligent entities that come after them. I – fortunately or unfortunately – believe that there is great credence to this argument (presuming that these entities are indeed vastly more intelligent and blissful than humans), and that this is an issue we will have to grapple with deeply in the next 3-6 decades. https://agi-conf.org/2008/artilectwar.pdf   Header image credit: TEDx Related Posts Conscious AI – We Aught Wake Up Before the Machines DoIn the ongoing ""pop culture"" debate as to whether or not the pursuit of AI… All Bill Gates’ Artificial Intelligence QuotesEarlier this month we released an article featuring all of the AI risk quotes from… AI is Colorizing and Beautifying the WorldArtificial intelligence may be making the world smarter, safer, more functional and accessible.

Digicloud’s Google Cloud partners can guide your success! (AI) within their businesses. This is the word from Dries Cronje, CEO of AI consulting company Deep Learning Café, highlighting that it’s quite the change in mindset from four or five years ago, when companies would say AI is something Americans, Europeans or Asians do, saying they would get to it one day. “Even if they start small, there is definitely a shift, whereby most companies are looking at it,” notes Cronje. “Some companies have already shown a lot of success by being early adopters of AI.”Over the years, the AI market has continued to show signs of growth. Last year’s International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts showed worldwide revenue for the AI market, including software, hardware, and services, would total $156.5 billion in 2020, an increase of 12.3% over 2019.Furthermore, the IDC’s research pointed to worldwide revenue surpassing $300 billion in 2024, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 17.1%. Even though South African firms might not be setting AI trends, they are definitely in the game and are actively piloting AI within their businesses, experimenting with a range of different technologies, such as chatbots, virtual assistants and image recognition, notes Cronje.

There’s a lot of room for AI investment in Africa…we can become the gateway to an AI and modern workforce where a lot of work can be outsourced to Africa, but we will have to put in the effort to make it work. The opportunity for Africa to become that leader is there.”Shifting gearsCronje explains that in the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for businesses to come up with tech solutions that allow them to have more flexibility and efficiency. With the world becoming more digitally connected than ever before, he expects AI will continue to play a crucial role in sustainable growth and recovery for businesses this year.Cronje anticipates four key AI trends to take shape in 2021, with AI making a greater contribution to science and mathematics.AI will have real-world impact in fighting against climate change, pollution and future viral pandemics and disease, he states. According to Cronje, Google’s machine learning company DeepMind’s AI programme, AlphaFold2 successfully determined the 3D shapes of proteins from their amino-acid sequence late last year. This discovery, he says, will accelerate scientists’ efforts to understand the building blocks of cells and enable quicker and more advanced medicine, research and bioengineering. The second key trend is AI will happen at the edge – Internet-connected devices will be able to learn from the dataDATAData Sciences: Your Partner in Innovative IT Solutions.

What I think we’ll begin to see going forward is that our devices will become a lot smarter and AI will be embedded in those devices.”“For example, securitySECURITYA successful combination of specialized skills and industry leading vendor partnerships.

I anticipate security cameras will start to learn about the people being surveilled. A lot of this will be accelerated as 5G is also being rolled out.”In light of the ethical concerns around the implementation of AI in social media, Cronje predicts more emphasis on ethical AI. For example, it is likely the ethics around deepfake misinformation, race and gender bias, AI for children, algorithmic bias, data protection and acceptable uses will all be up for necessary discussion in 2021.“We will have to get to some stage where AI is also more responsible and more accountable for what it does and how it operates. I think we’ll start to see some attempt at regulating AI. There’ll also be pressure on companies using AI to do it in a responsible way and to understand the social implications of what they are doing.”At number four, he predicts open models with bigger access as large companies such as Intel, Amazon Web Services and Google rapidly incorporate AI into their systems.“We will see greater democratisation of the AI offerings for public use. This will make digital innovation more accessible for software developers and smaller businesses,” concludes Cronje.

Among the myriad technological developments in airpower—including advanced propulsion, better stealth, directed-energy weapons and hypersonics—perhaps the most important will turn out to be artificial intelligence. AI has the potential to transform air combat operations and the way airpower is conceived and used.
The US Air Force demonstrated the role of AI dramatically in December last year by flying a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, which normally carries a single crew member, with an AI algorithm as a ‘virtual backseater’. As the pilot flew, the AI system—dubbed ‘ARTUµ’ in honour of Star Wars robot R2-D2—controlled the aircraft’s sensors and navigation.
On the test flight, ARTUµ was tasked with finding adversary missile launchers and was ‘solely responsible for sensor employment and tactical navigation’, while the human pilot concentrated on finding enemy aircraft and flying. ARTUµ ‘made final calls on devoting the radar to missile hunting versus self-protection’.
The flight demonstrated human–machine teaming at a new level and points to the potential to integrate AI backseaters into current fighters like the F-35 and future air combat aircraft such as the US Next Generation Air Dominance platform, or NGAD.
The F-35 has room for just one person in the cockpit, but with AI the pilot gets a backseater that can manage the complex process of integrating data from a multitude of onboard and offboard sensors and other information sources, freeing up the pilot to fly and fight. AI can also manage human–machine teaming between the F-35 and autonomous systems, such as the ‘loyal wingman’ autonomous platform being developed in Australia as part of the Boeing airpower teaming system.
So, AI dramatically reduces the aircrew’s workload and can process data and information faster than a human pilot, including rapidly assessing threats. But it also boosts the operational potential of autonomous platforms in crewed–uncrewed teaming because it can ensure greater oversight and control—‘on the loop’ for the autonomous platform—while giving the human pilot the big picture of tactical operations. That eases rules-of-engagement constraints on using autonomous systems, including future lethal autonomous weapons platforms.
For fast jets like the F-35, the benefits of integrating AI are obvious—it opens up new approaches to complex and fast-moving air combat operations.
For slower, heavier aircraft such as the E-7A Wedgetail and the P-8A Poseidon, integrating AI inside the cockpit is likely to enhance the operating efficiency of the planes and their crews, particularly as they begin to exploit offboard sensors based on drones such as the MQ-4C Triton, maritime platforms or space-based capabilities. AI can manage a diverse network of sensors and platforms and take the lead in transforming the flood of data gathered over the future battlespace into a knowledge edge—the key to getting the information advantage that’s critical for success.
The role of AI in the cockpit gives us a glimpse into the future of airpower. The Royal Australian Air Force needs to be thinking about where airpower goes next, even as the F-35 achieved initial operational capability in December and moves to final operational capability in 2023. That future is almost certain to be a mix of crewed and autonomous systems, working together in teams to deliver a range of effects as a system of systems.
We need not wait until the late 2030s for a sixth-generation platform to emerge to replace the fifth-generation F-35 in the 2040s. It would be a mistake to delay consideration of future air combat capability by maintaining a traditional acquisitions mindset. Yet, the 2020 force structure plan pushes back the start of the F-35 replacement process to the mid-2030s. Given the pace of technological change and the rapid deterioration in our strategic environment, that notional timeline needs to be challenged and capability acquisition needs to happen faster. With the US already flying a demonstrator for NGAD and considering a ‘digital century series’ approach to acquisition, it’s time Australia shook off the slow, generational acquisition paradigm. Investment in breakthrough technologies such as AI is part of that transformation.
A complementary next-generation air combat system spread across multiple platforms and technologies—crewed and autonomous—that has AI as a key component needs to be prioritised as an opportunity for common development with our Five Eyes partners, especially the US. The Australian Defence Force could work with its US counterparts, or with allies and partners in Europe and Japan, to develop future air combat capabilities that will complement and, ultimately, replace the F-35 sooner than the 2040s. Boeing’s ‘loyal wingman’ drone is a good first step and may be able to be evolved into a potent future air combat capability.
It’s time for the RAAF to be forward-looking and proactive in accelerating the acquisition of the next generation of air combat capabilities. That effort should incorporate the broad application of AI—inside the cockpit and across the battlespace—to allow our military to think and act at machine speed.
Of course, there are risks in moving fast. AI is still a relatively new technology, and its complexity needs to be mastered. Networking a multitude of offboard sensors that an AI algorithm can use to inform aircrew of the common operating picture will require significant investment in software development, supported by the establishment of research facilities and the training of personnel. It will require a substantial boost in digital high-speed communications bandwidth to work. That’s likely to require investment in other technology areas—notably, satellite-based laser-optical communications and quantum technologies.
Nor will the ADF operate in an uncontested electromagnetic domain. Potential adversaries such as China are already developing sophisticated capabilities in electronic and network warfare, so our tactical command and control, including elements controlled by an AI ‘backseater’, must be robust and resilient.
Meeting all of those challenges will take time, money and skilled personnel. The US Air Force’s U-2 demonstration of ARTUµ is one step down a path towards tomorrow’s airpower, and Australia needs to proceed with determination to achieve success.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The advance of AI is inevitable, and what that translates into for humanity is not altogether clear. Some believe we can look forward to a great future, while others think it means we are on the path to being supplanted by our robotic overlords. The third perspective is one that is aware of risks but considers them to be manageable.  




We hear a lot about artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential. What that means for the future of humanity, however, is not altogether clear. Not everyone even always has the same definition in mind when using the term ""artificial intelligence."" Even when you establish what capability can be attained, there is the question of the ramifications of that capability.
Some futurists believe life will be beastly improved, while others think it is under serious threat. Between the two extremes there’s a wide range. Here are some of the takes along the spectrum from 11 experts.
1. Sci-fi and Reality Are Not on the Same Page
What the popular imagination tends to associate with AI—a synthetic being that has consciousness of its own—is still in the realm of science fiction:


Richard Socher is currently the CEO of you.com, a new trusted search engine. He wrote the quote just a couple of years ago when he was the chief scientist (EVP) at Salesforce.
2. Defining Artificial IntelligenceAdvertisements






John Frémont is the Founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Hypergiant. He spoke these words at a presentation sponsored by Salesforce called Building A Better World: AI And The Future Of Business.

3. You Say “Tapestry,” I Say “Frankenstein.”
While “tapestry” carries a nice connotation for a composite, there are those like Tristan Harris who don’t see it that way but as a monstrous synthesis:


That take was quoted, appropriately enough, in How to Stop Technology From Becoming a Digital Frankenstein. Harris is the Co-Founder & Executive Director of the Center for Humane Technology. He has expounded on his concerns in multiple presentations, including one entitled Humane: A New Agenda for Tech with Tristan Harris, viewable on Vimeo.
In that presentation, he offered another vivid image to picture how insidious the effect can be:



4. You Should Be Worried 
Others share the concern about something so powerful growing and expanding unchecked. But some say we’re worrying about the wrong thing:


Andrew Ng, founder and CEO of Landing AI, and founder of deeplearning.ai also teaches at Stanford. This quote comes from Andrew Ng: Why AI Is the New Electricity, which reflects what he said to the Stanford Graduate School of Business community as part of a series presented by the Stanford MSx Program.
The focus has to be on societal impact, he argued “Evil AI hype,” he believes diverts attention from that critical issue: the question of displaced jobs:


5. Jobs Will Shift
Ng is not alone in bringing up the future of jobs:


James Manyika is the Chairman and Director, McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). He voiced his concern about humans adapting to the new future by equipping themselves with the right skills in a Salesforce panel entitled The Future of Work in the AI Age.

6. Never Mind Coming, the Robots Are Here
Indeed, the advance of automation when combined with robotics is bringing just what Ng warned about into our current reality:


The full quote that appears in context in National Geographic’s The robot revolution has arrived is the following:
“We’ve gotten used to having machine intelligence that we can carry around with us,” said Manuela Veloso, an AI roboticist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. She held up her smartphone. “Now we’re going to have to get used to intelligence that has a body and moves around without us.”
7. The Glass is Half Full on the Jobs Front 
On the other hand, some see the rise of the machine as a good thing and that the jobs displaced will be more than offset by those created.


Svetlana Sicular is a research vice president at Gartner whose quote appears in a press release: Gartner Says By 2020, Artificial Intelligence Will Create More Jobs Than It Eliminates. Even while acknowledging that AI will lead to the loss of millions of jobs, she considered the gain worth it for improved productivity and the shift to new job opportunities.
She claimed that while some would require a high level of skill, she believed there would still be openings for jobs that don’t require such advanced skills. The main loss, she predicted would be for middle- and low-level positions.

8. Explain It to Us Humans
One additional concern about AI that has been the focus of increased attention over the past several years, as more and more business decisions are dictated by algorithms, is that of its “black box” nature. (Read also AI's Got Some Explaining to Do)
Now it’s not just people in the field who are raising the alarm about having determinations made by a program that doesn’t have to account for its decisions and their ramifications. Lawyers who fight for their clients’ rights have to contend with institutions that say it wasn’t a person who made the decision to cut services but an algorithm.

Michele Gilman is a clinical law professor at the University of Baltimore who was recently featured in MIT’s Technology Review’s The coming war on the hidden algorithms that trap people in poverty:

“A growing group of lawyers are uncovering, navigating, and fighting the automated systems that deny the poor housing, jobs, and basic services.”

Gilman was puzzled that as her elderly, disabled client grew sicker, she was getting fewer hours of care services allotted rather than more. Only once they got to the hearing did the state’s representative, a nurse, reveal that they were using a new algorithm. Gilman recalled:

""She couldn’t answer what factors go into it. How is it weighted? What are the outcomes that you’re looking for? So there I am with my student attorney, who’s in my clinic with me, and it’s like, ‘Oh, am I going to cross-examine an algorithm?’”

Given that algorithms are given the power to decide who is entitled to life-preserving services and who is not, it becomes essential to understand the process it uses. Despite appearances of being scientific and objective, not all algorithmic models are truly reliable.

8. The Question of Trust

Alexander Amini is a computer scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). This quote is from a late November 2020 article in MIT News, A neural network learns when it should not be trusted,
He elaborated on the ramification of depending 100% on something that is not reliable 100% of the time. He pointed out: “Neural networks are really good at knowing the right answer 99 percent of the time.” But even that one percent error rate is not acceptable when lives are on the line.
That’s a problem because the tendency in the past has been simply to work out the models but not to identify “When they might be wrong,” Amini explained: “We really care about that 1 percent of the time, and how we can detect those situations reliably and efficiently.”

9. The Humans Behind the Algorithms Influence Outcomes

Vivienne Ming is the Executive Chair & Co-Founder of Socos Labs. She also named one of 10 Women to Watch in Tech by Inc. Magazine. She shared her views on AI in a presentation entitled Understand Your Love/Hate Relationship With AI. (Read also: Fairness in Machine Learning: Eliminating Data Bias.)

10. The Way Forward is to Adopt an Ethical and Transparent Approach

Kathy Baxter’s specialty is precisely that. She is an Ethical AI Practice Architect for Salesforce. She shared her insight into the “biases that live in our data” in an interview for the Salesforce blog. Her solution also calls for diversity for the same reasons that are called for in Why Diversity is Essential for Quality Data to Train AI.
11. Are Companies Honest About Tackling the Ethical Questions?
Major companies now have specialists and even whole departments devoted to keeping their AI within ethical bounds. But is this sincere or only so much lip service to standards that they hope to control themselves?

Timnit Gebru coauthored a yet unpublished paper “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?”
The ideas in the paper may have cost Gebru her job on Google’s ethical AI team. On December 2 she tweeted that her “resignation” was being accepted by the technology giant:

Gebru was Joy Buolamwini’s co-author on Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification (Read also: Can AI Have Biases?) that demonstrated facial recognition was fairly accurate for white men but much less so for women or people of color. Google was proud to have her on the team for that but balked at her latest research findings.
In reporting on her forced resignation from Google, MIT Technology Review also discusses what was in that controversial paper: “Gebru’s draft paper points out that the sheer resources required to build and sustain such large AI models means they tend to benefit wealthy organizations, while climate change hits marginalized communities hardest.”
By calling attention to these issues, the paper brings up some considerations that the company may prefer to keep swept under the rug, including questions about the “negative environmental impact and inequitable access to resources” that reinforces the divisions between the haves and have-nots.
Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, is one of the seven coauthors of the paper. She provided the draft copy for the MIT Technology Review article. Bender explained the need to not just push ahead but to think about the ramifications:

By Patricia Wei and Jared Klegar 



Feb. 3, 2021, 10:01 p.m. 




 



As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly common in several areas of public life — from policing to hiring to healthcare — AI researchers Timnit Gebru, Michael Hind, James Zou and Hong Qu came together to criticize Silicon Valley’s lack of transparency and advocate for greater diversity and inclusion in decision making.
The event, titled “Race, Tech & Civil Society: Tools for Combating Bias in Datasets and Models,” was sponsored by the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.






Qu, the moderator of the panel and a CCSRE Race & Technology Practitioner Fellow who developed a tool called AI Blindspot that discovers bias in AI systems, opened the conversation by discussing how there are two definitions of combating bias: ensuring that algorithms are “de-biased” and striving for equity in a historical and cultural context.
Gebru ’08 M.S. ’10 Ph.D. ’15 said that she was introduced to these issues as they relate to machine learning in AI after seeing a ProPublica article about recidivism algorithms, and a TED Talk by Joy Buolamwini, a graduate researcher at MIT, who discovered that an open-source facial recognition software did not detect her face unless she wore a white mask. 
As Gebru moved higher up in the tech world, she noticed a severe lack of representation — a pressing inequity she is working to redress. “The moment I went to grad school, I didn’t see any Black people at all,” Gebru said. 






“What’s important for me in my work is to make sure that these voices of these different groups of people come to the fore,” she added. 
Michael Hind is an IBM Distinguished Researcher who leads work on AI FactSheets and AI Fairness 360, which promote transparency in algorithms. Hind agreed with Gebru, noting the importance of “having multiple disciplines and multiple stakeholders at the table.” 
But not everyone has affirmed Gebru’s mission of inclusion. Last month, Google fired Gebru from her role as an AI ethics researcher after she had co-written a paper on the risks of large language models. Her paper touched on bias in AI and how social linguists, who study how language relates to power, culture, and society, were left out of the process.
Since the news of her firing broke, computer science educators and students showed their support and solidarity for Gebru and her work. When Qu asked the panelists how to increase racial literacy, Gebru responded, “I tried to do it and I got fired.” 






She cited the “high turnover” of employees tasked to spearhead diversity initiatives, whose efforts to enact institutional change were often dismissed.
“They don’t have any power,” Gebru said. “They’re miserable. They leave.” Despite Google’s many ethics committees, “there’s just no way that this will work if there’s no incentive to change,” she added
Citing this culture of complacency as one of the reasons he left Silicon Valley, Qu said, “For me, I believe it’s more pernicious to be passively complicit than even to be intentionally malicious.”
In many cases, technology companies may even step beyond passive complicity, Gebru said. She cited Microsoft’s partnership with the New York Police Department to develop predictive policing algorithms. Because these technological tools rely on historical data, some researchers say they may reinforce existing racial biases.
“For any Black person in the United States who has had experiences with police,” Gebru said, “you would understand, you know, why predictive policing would be an issue.”






Zou, an assistant professor of biomedical data science at Stanford, remained optimistic about the use of AI for social good. He noted that because of the pandemic, the need for telehealth has exploded. Doctors are now relying on patients on images from patients to help diagnose them, and computer vision technology can help patients take better photos, he said.
Even cases of algorithmic bias can present valuable learning opportunities, Zou added. Pointing to language models he worked on as a member of Microsoft Research, Zou said that the models’ gender biases offered a way to “quantify our stereotypes.”
However, Zou was reluctant to place too much faith in AI. 
“If it’s a scenario that affects someone’s health or safety, AI should not be the sole decision maker,” he said.
As the conversation ended, the researchers agreed on the need to continue questioning the role of using AI in tools that affect our daily lives. 
“A lot of features certainly should not be ones a data scientist or engineer should be deciding,” Hind said. 






He referred to how the virtual interviewing company HireVue used AI to analyze applicants’ videos to measure skills such as empathy and communication. 
“Even if you can do it, should you?” Gebru asked.

Putting artificial intelligence to work 

 18 Feb 21
        Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly being given key roles in site teams. Lisa Russell looks at how Winvic is bringing in AI to boost site safety    


Construction sites, by their very nature, are packed with an ever-changing array of potential hazards. Even with rigorous safety protocols in place, it can be all too easy to wind up too close to operational plant or neglect to wear the required personal protective equipment (PPE).
Contractor Winvic believes that artificial intelligence (AI) holds the key to making construction sites safer by giving people reliable warnings before they put themselves in danger. 
The company has teamed up with the Big Data Enterprise & Artificial Intelligence Lab (Big-DEAL) at the University of the West of England (UWE) and video technology specialist One Big Circle (OBC) to develop a system that will understand where the current hazards are and send personal alerts via smartphones when someone is about to go somewhere risky. 
This article was first published in the Dec/Jan 2021 issue of The Construction Index magazine.  Sign up online.
UWE and OBC are sharing a £600,000 Innovate UK ‘Smart Grant’ with Winvic on the project, which will run for two years and will see the three organisations bring together real-time images and machine learning technologies on two Winvic sites running consecutively. 
Winvic technical director Tim Reeve describes the concept as being a 24/7 on-site ‘eye in the sky’ health & safety alert system. “We were discussing improving site safety and how we could go about that using technology,” he says. “We came up with this idea of preventing people getting anywhere near a potential accident before it happens.” 
The company began site work at the end of October on the first of the two projects where the system will be developed and put through its paces. Transport and logistics company DSV has engaged Winvic to design, construct and partially fit out its new industrial facility at Mercia Park in north-west Leicestershire. 
“The site is one that lends itself perfectly to what we are trying to do,” says Reeve, who is Winvic’s lead on the AI project, dubbed ‘Computer-Vision-Smart’. He says that Mercia Park is a relatively straightforward project, although it comprises multiple buildings and exterior works. 
Largest of the buildings is a 358,000 sq ft steel-framed warehouse containing three mezzanine floors and two single-storey hub offices. There will also be a 112,000 sq ft cross-dock terminal that contains a 7,050 sq ft single-storey hub office and a 35,660 sq ft three-storey office building. The project’s yard and car park will provide open spaces for the cameras to look across in the early stages while all work is taking place outside. 
The cameras placed around the site can now start capturing data so that team members on the AI side can begin their analysis and get the predictive machine learning under way, says Reeve. The external and – later into the programme – internal site cameras will capture video images continuously. The AI will learn to identify any hazards, ranging from overhead works or the movement of heavy machinery to more general issues like people lacking the correct PPE. The team believes that the machine learning models will be able to make an increasing number of intelligent predictions as the project progresses.
The AI will create virtual zones around potential hazards and send out alerts to anyone about to enter the area
Reeve thinks the concept of the Computer-Vision-Smart project is “fantastic” but acknowledges that a very challenging task lies ahead. “We are quite confident that we’ll get something meaningful out of the two years – an end product that we can take forward,” he says.
The Mercia Park project is being viewed primarily as an exercise in data capture and a trial of how to set up the site alerts. The camera systems will feed into large-screen TVs that will be installed in site cabins. The display will also be populated with scrolling outputs of the alerts that the AI is starting to report, enabling the site team to check on what is being detected. “At the same time, we are developing an app to work alongside it,” Reeve says. “We don’t think we’ll get the app into people’s hands and into their pockets probably until our second project kicks off, which we think will be about August next year.”
The AI may be ready for a tougher role once work at Mercia Park is completed next summer. “We might choose a slightly more complex site for the second one,” says Reeve. This will depend on progress, including how well the AI has tweaked itself over the initial period and how effective it is at recognising problems from the images it is given.
Each of the three organisations has a part to play in the system’s development, with obvious input from Winvic in provision of the demonstration projects plus knowledge of health & safety on site. “There are also historical data sets so we know the kind of trends that happen,” says Reeve. OBC has computer analysts and technical staff, while UWE brings in the academic and research side. Together they believe they can align development to the needs of the construction industry.
Reeve says the use of intelligent digital technologies in construction to deliver projects more rapidly, cost-effectively and safely has long been an aspiration of Winvic’s. “With the solution that has been conceived will come better opportunities than ever before to reach our zero-harm aim.”
The system knows the difference between the equipment carrying out the installation and previously installed components that won't be moving
There are perceived gaps in existing approaches across the construction industry. Safety managers and operatives often depend on self-reporting or warnings from co-workers, which can simply come too late to avoid an incident. Existing camera-based systems generally focus on aspects such as site security, dispute avoidance and project progress, rather than safety. Alert systems tend to be based on proximity to a particular piece of plant, with the aim of letting the operator know who or what is near their machine – essentially extending their line of sight. 
“We are coming at it from a slightly different angle,” says Reeve. “We want to give the people on the ground the line of sight. The immediate concern is to make that individual stop and think. If we can prevent people from going into high-risk or medium-risk areas then we can prevent accidents.”
The dangers of walking very close to actual operations might appear to be obvious, but in reality there is also a wider area of influence. For instance, a piece of plant might suddenly start moving in a different direction. “People think they are a long way from it but they may still be in proximity to a potential accident,” says Reeve.
Thanks to a geographic information system (GIS), the AI will be aware of the exact locations of personnel and plant and will learn to identify safe zones, essentially drawing a virtual radius around potential hazards.
When someone enters the hazard zone, the individual – and, when appropriate, other members of the site team – will receive a personal alert via a smartphone app or a wearable device. The warning will become constant if they enter the zone of full alert. There is also scope for escalation if there is a site-wide alert of immediate concern. 
Project managers are really the end users of the system being developed and their input has been invaluable. “The original concept ideas are being fine-tuned by the feedback we get from site,” says Reeve. “We’ve had a very good reaction and our staff have engaged with it as well. It’s caught the imagination of everybody involved, which is fantastic.”
Managers will also be able to review the alerts and relevant video segments from a laptop. This should help them spot any issues that are catching multiple people out – or any people who consistently flout site rules, such as regularly taking shortcuts to save a few seconds when heading for their lunch.

There will be weekly or fortnightly project meetings, where the appropriate people from all three organisations will plan the next tranche of development. “What we are going to do initially is give the AI some help,” says Reeve. It will be told, for instance, what a crane looks like and shown the extent of the surrounding zones that could be dangerous to enter. After that, the technology will be programmed to pick up movements of the kit on the site, as well as deliveries and site vehicles. “It will start to predict its own sets of health & safety rings around them,” he says. 
He likens it to watching a child learn to walk – giving it a little guidance to show how it’s done and gently nudging it towards learning and doing things itself.
“The idea is that the AI will build up a library of images and predictions,” says Reeve. It will learn about the project, identifying changing areas of interest as the build progresses. “What we are going to try and do is link the build into the AI, so that it starts to understand the sequence and the direction of work so that it can predict high-risk areas.” 
The AI will also be on the look-out for movement – for example learning the difference between a piece of cladding being installed and a fixed steel column that is not about to go anywhere. 
The team is exploring whether other ‘wearables’ might be needed in addition to phones. Smart watches, wristbands and even ‘old-fashioned pagers’ have been looked at. “We are trying to make it very easy for people to connect with,” says Reeve. 
Job functions will have to be taken into account. Details that will be addressed include ensuring that people at the ‘epicentre’ of a risk – excavator operators for instance – aren’t bombarded with constant alerts. The system will need to learn the difference between them and somebody straying into the hazard area. 
There will still be a role for interventions that are social, rather than technical, in nature. For example, personal input will be needed if the project manager starts to see a particular person getting a high number of alerts every day. Privacy issues mean that project won’t be using facial recognition but it will still be able to identify each user of the system. 
Activity on site changes every day and so the AI will need to be aware of where the current dangers lie
The social side will also involve establishing a mind-set whereby wearing PPE becomes second-nature. Historically, this would come from members of the site team speaking to anyone without the right kit – but the culprit might then remove their hard hat when they are out of sight. In contrast, the camera will always be on the look-out and so can assist with monitoring and enforcement. “We definitely want to target the correct wearing of PPE, such as hard hats and high-vis vests too,” says Reeve. 
The Computer-Vision-Smart project was originally submitted to Innovate UK last year, prior to the outbreak of Covid-19; the conceptual objectives for the scheme would therefore need to change slightly should the team look to consider the incorporation of social distancing. “We may look to see if this could be an ‘add-on’ to the features already planned for the system,” says Reeve. “We already have clear and responsible guidelines on social distancing as part of our site operating procedures. There is of course already the NHS Track & Trace app.”
The AI’s role ties in with another safety-focused initiative that Winvic has launched this year. The ‘Doing It Right’ programme is aimed at further improvements in safe behaviour, targeting ‘walk-bys’ – incidents where people turn a blind eye to something potentially hazardous. “We’ve got a ‘don’t walk by’ slogan,” says Reeve. “If you see something, don’t just walk by – stop, say something, raise the alert. We’re hoping that using the AI will assist us in monitoring those activities that sometimes don’t get seen.”
UWE Bristol and Winvic are also partners on another AI-enabled project, called Conversational BIM. This involves the development of a voice-activated headset connected to a BIM model. It is being designed to allow users to retrieve any and all project design and construction information with a simple vocal request.  
Reeve believes that the new Computer-Vision-Smart project’s achievements over the next two years will generate a significant leap forward not just for Winvic, but potentially for safety across the whole of the construction industry. “Ultimately, one of the objectives is to have an end product that we could sell to the marketplace,” he says. 
As well as customising the system for Winvic’s purposes, the team will also be looking at what else needs to be done to make it suitable for others. This will involve bringing in other contractors to get their feedback. “We’ve had a lot of interest from the rail side as well,” he adds.

Technology
AI and the Future of Work in the United States


By Pragya Jain | February 18, 2021











Artificial intelligence will change the future of work in the United States, but the consequences will differ across regions and industries. As with past advances in automation, AI will lead to increased levels of productivity, specialization in job roles, and an increased importance of “human skills'' like creativity, problem solving, and quantitative skills. Although AI will increase economic growth, these gains will not be evenly distributed. Rural communities that already face high levels of job insecurity will come under additional strain. AI will benefit labor in some industries but threaten it in others. Automation will complement job roles in high-growth fields like healthcare, where there is no substitute for highly-skilled practitioners, but replace jobs in industries relying on standard routines. To address these gaps, policymakers should focus on restructuring school curricula to reflect the changing skill demands, addressing the educational attainment gap between rural and urban adults, and providing economic relief to workers forced to leave the workplace and learn new skills.
Introduction
The evolution of technology and changes in the workplace have always happened in tandem. Beginning in the 1760s, a series of industrial revolutions ushered in mechanical innovations like railroads and then mass production factories using man made tools to push past the limits of human manual labor. Then in the twentieth century, computers began to replace human cognitive work. Optimists viewed this as a sign of inevitable progress toward a more productive society, with lower prices for goods and increased opportunity for specialized labor; but there has been a pervasive concern that machines will replace human labor and lower the number of new jobs.
With the rise of personal computers, automated call centers, and industrial machinery during the early twenty-first century came a massive net increase in employment with 54 million new jobs. However, a not-so-subtle exacerbation of inequality in America accompanied this explosion in efficient production. A widening wealth gap, bottoming out of the middle-class, extreme job-loss in rural communities, and stratification of education and job opportunity have become commonplace. The advent of digital technologies was particularly difficult for manufacturing and clerical workers. A seamless transition into a new job market did not occur for the newly unemployed; rather, those who lost their jobs during the rise of automation were crammed into service industry jobs that paid less than their previous occupations had. The disparity that has risen during this period is unlikely to reverse itself. Indeed, it will continue to worsen as technology outpaces the capabilities of the humans who built it.
More recent innovations in computer science have rekindled fears of more human displacement and job loss. Machine Learning and narrow Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become ubiquitous, and unlike previous waves of technological change, these innovations are affecting most, if not all, industries. Now the past must serve as a guide as to how to prepare for future job insecurities, especially by investing in education, skill retraining, and renewal of rural communities,where the opportunity gap threatens to worsen job displacement in the face of AI-based innovation.
The Basics of Narrow AI and Machine Learning 
       Artificial Intelligence is often conflated with dystopian science fiction, as in killer robots from The Terminator or hallucinatory computer programs from The Matrix. But the technology-centered human experience of today is far more nuanced than sensationalized fictitious depictions. Various forms of artificial intelligence are commonplace; today, machine learning powers everything from voice-activated “virtual assistants” on most smartphones, to recognition systems built to improve accuracy in medical diagnoses. It also increases the scope of industrial automation, which has raised concerns about the effects on labor.
The fundamental concept that powers machine learning is the notion that a computer can learn from new information. Designed in a loosely similar fashion to the human brain, some forms of artificial intelligence rely on constructing an artificial neural network to build connections that replicate the complex level of understanding characteristic of humans. Once an algorithm is built for a machine, it will undergo three different forms of learning, supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and reinforced learning, which develop and strengthen its neural network. Once the computer understands its intended function, it works independently to self-correct through a series of trials and errors - a process that ultimately can lead to complex decision making.
The logic behind deep learning and neural networks is simple but the result is complex. One form of machine learning, often referred to as hierarchical learning, is accomplished using a large set of layered images or data points that are pieced together from the bottom up by the machine until it deeply understands a concept. For example, if given an input in the form of a matrix of pixels, the computer will begin by classifying individual pixels, then forming clusters of pixels, before finally identifying the full visual. This straightforward process is repeated tens-of-thousands of times with an equal number of new data sets. It results in a web of nodes that strengthen the predictive decision-making process of the computer.
This world is increasingly driven by the currency of data, and AI will undoubtedly have a deep, divisive impact on the jobs of tomorrow; many service-focused jobs in the food industry will face high susceptibility to automation, for example, as opposed to industries that will come to use it as a supplementary tool, like the medical field.
The Promise of Machine Learning and Narrow AI in Healthcare         
Unlike the physical human brain, an AI program can quickly discover problems in narrow, data-based situations, a time-saving benefit that already aids decision making on treatment options in healthcare, for example. Health care professionals use algorithms to improve diagnoses through a form of machine learning called precision medicine; this simple algorithm relies on previous patient information (and supervised learning) to assess what treatment options might be most successful.
Another useful application of narrow AI uses more complex deep learning algorithms to identify potentially cancerous lesions in radiology pictures, a process that aids in early diagnosis and can prevent the spread of malignant tumors. This tool allows professionals to allocate their own time more efficiently towards specialized tasks, such as devising creative treatment solutions and researching other medical problems, potentially leading to job creation.
Tech giants like Google are collaborating with health firms to build programming that compiles user data to identify patients at risk for conditions that are typically genetically predisposed but difficult to predict--like cancer. However, simple AI tools also extend beyond more precise diagnosis in the medical field: doctors use natural language processing algorithms for transcribing patient-doctor interactions, surgeons use robots to improve the precision of surgeries, and hospitals employ algorithm-driven processes to replace rote tasks within hospitals. The proper use of these tools in healthcare will change the way medicine is administered: it can improve patient care, reduce fatalities with early diagnoses, and create more jobs through specialization.
The Jobs of the Future
 Most jobs sectors that are predicted to be high-growth over the next decade will require high levels of education. One source claims that high-paying jobs requiring a bachelor's degree or above will face only 29% of job change due to automation. Like the field of healthcare, other “high-value” and professional, scientific, and technical service-oriented industries are predicted to experience low levels of automation (34%) accompanied by relative job growth (3.8%). Additionally, given the benefits AI poses to complex, high-skilled vocations, it is likely that AI-related jobs could see an increased share in the economy, a trend that would create more stable, well-paying positions for Americans. The assignment of rote tasks to machines and complex tasks to humans will increase productivity and enhance economic growth. One economist predicts that AI-related changes will result in an increased GDP of $3.7 trillion for North America before 2030. Unfortunately, these economic benefits will not be evenly distributed, and rural communities will absorb the greatest costs.
New technologies have sometimes had transformative impacts on the labor market; in this case, AI will have a striking effect on many service and white-collar jobs that have been relatively safe from automation to this point. Compared to the medical field, most routine, service-oriented roles will be phased out by the increased presence of AI. Jobs that are at the highest risk of automation include office support jobs and food service jobs. These jobs are ubiquitous but rural workers rely on them more since they make up a larger share of the rural economy. For example, the switch to automated stores has already started with AmazonGo, the prototype for an entirely contactless grocery shopping experience.
Service industries that will face the most severe levels of automation include the food service industry and office support roles. These jobs are generally held by individuals who haven’t earned college degrees with more than 90% of food service employees and more than 60% of office support workers having at most a high school diploma.
 There is a severe digital gap between rural and urban areas: 24% of rural adults experience issues with high-speed internet, whereas only 13% of urban adults say it is an issue. Substantial portions of rural areas still lack the infrastructure required to implement high speed internet, which makes it exceedingly difficult to bring high-growth jobs to these areas. There is little migration between cities, which suggests labor market fluidity. To make matters worse, businesses are investing less in their workers: the percentage of employer-sponsored job-training fell by 7 percent between 2003 and 2013 even though the need for high-skilled workers is rising.
Policy Implications
Although the situation may seem dire for low-skilled rural workers, new technologies might also provide some relief. Data compiled by the Economic Modeling Specialists International can be used by local communities to help pinpoint careers for displaced workers to transition into given their acquired skills from previous occupations. This along with strong federal education and economic policies could reduce the shock of a changing job market.
       At the top of the agenda is improving the American educational system, especially measures to rectify underperformance in STEM-related subjects. The most recent PISA test scores show that the United States ranks 36th out of 79 countries for math proficiency and 13th for reading proficiency. Given that future careers will be driven by a demand for digital skills in high-growth industries like data science and computer science, school curricula should reflect evolving employer expectations, by introducing computer coding and statistics, for example.
Also, high-paying and high-skilled jobs are concentrated in large coastal cities, but there is little migration between rural towns and urban metropolises. College completion rate gaps continue to widen between urban and rural areas with a 14% difference in the proportion of adults with bachelor’s degrees. Worker incentives to complete training and move to areas ripe with opportunities are important national priorities. The great challenge to bridge would be the existing inequality in educational attainment, and therefore, job opportunity--an issue that has fed into the discontent and general unrest felt in some rural parts of the United States.
In the interim, economic policy recommendations by prominent economists like Laura Tyson argue that a higher minimum wage (productivity has increased while the median wage has not), accompanied by a negative income tax which is paid for by a progressive consumption tax can balance the wage inequality caused by increased automation and subsequent job loss. Additionally, there should be an agenda to increase economic mobility of workers in rural areas Other economists propose a Worker Training Tax Credit which is modeled after the Research and Development Tax Credit to incentivize companies to invest into training their low and middle-income employees. This tax credit would pay for training for employees earning less than $120,000 per year while encouraging business innovation.
Automation through AI is already occurring, and the pace of innovation demands organized collaboration towards regulation. In terms of labor, technology has always been both an asset and a liability, and evolving forms of artificial intelligence are no different. Short-term policy fixes will alleviate immediate suffering for those in the workforce displaced by machine learning and narrow AI. We must have long-term U.S. federal policy changes, especially those that incentivize education and re-training, if we are to manage the dramatic labor changes underway.

In a statement, Google said an investigation found Margaret Mitchell had moved files outside the company. The ethics unit has been under scrutiny since December, following the departure of another senior figure, Timnit Gebru. Both women had campaigned for more diversity at Google and raised concerns about censorship within the company. Dr Mitchell announced the news in a tweet, which read ""I'm fired"". For the past five weeks she had been locked out of Google's systems, including her emails and calendars. Google staff rally behind fired AI researcherGoogle fired pro-union employees, says US agencyDr Mitchell was a fierce critic of Google, and had expressed concern about Dr Gebru's departure from the company. Dr Gebru, a leading Artificial Intelligence ethics researcher, says she was fired late last year after sending an internal email that accused Google of ""silencing marginalised voices"". However, Google claims she left the company.She co-authored a research paper which she says she was asked to retract. The paper had pinpointed flaws in AI language technology, including a system built by Google.Getty ImagesTimnit Gebru left Google last yearFollowing a meeting on the paper, she sent an email to an internal group called ""Brain Women and Allies"", criticising the decision. Dr Gebru had emailed her management laying out some key conditions for removing her name from the paper, and if they were not met, she would ""work on a last date"" for her employment.According to Dr Gebru, Google replied: ""We respect your decision to leave Google... and we are accepting your resignation.""The fallout caused many within the scientific community to question the ethics of conducting research with big technology companies.Hundreds of colleagues signed a letter in support of her. In response, the company's chief executive Sundar Pichai apologised for the way she left the firm.

The company said previously that Dr. Mitchell had tried to remove such files, the news site Axios reported last month.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Mitchell said on Friday evening that she would soon have a public comment.Dr. Mitchell’s post on Twitter comes less than two months after Timnit Gebru, the other leader of the Ethical A.I. team at Google, said that she had been fired by the company after criticizing its approach to minority hiring as well as its approach to bias in A.I. In the wake of Dr. Gebru’s departure from the company, Dr. Mitchell strongly and publicly criticized Google’s stance on the matter.More than a month ago, Dr. Mitchell said that she had been locked out of her work accounts. On Wednesday, she tweeted that she remained locked out after she tried to defend Dr. Gebru, who is Black.“Exhausted by the endless degradation to save face for the Upper Crust in tech at the expense of minorities’ lifelong careers,” she wrote.Dr. Mitchell’s departure from the company was another example of the rising tension between Google’s senior management and its work force, which is more outspoken than workers at other big companies. The news also highlighted a growing conflict in the tech industry over bias in A.I., which is entwined with questions involving hiring from underrepresented communities.Today’s A.I. systems can carry human biases because they learn their skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. Because the researchers and engineers building these systems are often white men, many worry that researchers are not giving this issue the attention it needs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle announced in a blog post yesterday that an executive at the company, Marian Croak, who is Black, will oversee a new group inside the company dedicated to responsible A.I.Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

Instead of living in a world of happiness and love, we would probably live under the threat of social stigma and insecurities.Contemplating about the value of human emotions and intellect would be a waste of time because, without it, we would be walking on a sphere filled with psychopaths and sociopaths.As our science fiction (sci-fi) movies love to portray Artificial Intelligence as the bane of human existence and something that will take over the entire world, it is intriguing and fascinating to look at this aspect of AI that is yet to be uncovered.",2021-12-31T02:20:07.944Z,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*QjcrxMY2fC85MVLF'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bharath K', 'url': 'https://bharath-k1297.medium.com'}",,,https://towardsdatascience.com/can-your-ai-have-emotions-7efc35721e12,Can Your AI Have Emotions? - Towards Data Science,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",2021-02-17T14:28:59.008Z,NewsArticle,Can Your AI Have Emotions? - Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/can-your-ai-have-emotions-7efc35721e12,,,,,2021-02-17T14:28:59.008Z,['Bharath K'],,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,7efc35721e12,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Virti)By  Dalvin BrownFebruary 16, 2021 at 10:45 a.m. ESTOne of the most common complaints lodged against physicians aims at their communication skills — or lack thereof.Doctors have a demanding job. They’re tasked with diagnosing symptoms, tending to back-to-back patients, filling out medical records, and the like. The hours are long and the stakes are high — mistakes can prove deadly. And somewhere in there, people skills can get lost.

For greater immersion, the company can supply physicians with virtual reality headsets. Once the training session is over, doctors are scored based on their speed, the questions they asked the AI and whether they got the fake patient’s diagnosis correct.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementTalking to the tech is supposed to improve how they engage with patients in the real world, Virti says.Will holograms be the next innovation in the post-pandemic workplace?Already, the Health Education Center at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston picked up the firm’s tech to tutor future clinicians on communication and reasoning skills.Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles started out as a customer before moving to invest. In 2019, Virti raised $2 million in a seed round originating from the health-care clinic. The investment helped the start-up  launch a sales team and enhance its analytics software. These days, the software is used to train Cedar-Sinai medics on coronavirus-related processes. The United Kingdom’s publicly funded health-care system, NHS, also used the tech to teach staff how to properly use personal protective equipment and how to engage with patients and their families.Virti’s cloud-based training program uses speech recognition, AI and computer-generated characters to simulate realistic interactions with patients. For instance, if a clinician asks the animated human to describe its symptoms, the AI will generate a relevant response.Doctors can probe with further questions, and as they interact, the software analyzes their tone, cadence and quality of answers. VR headsets unlock other metrics, such as eye contact tracking.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementVirti baked in speech, body language and mannerisms that mimic those held by real people, the company says. Still, computer-generated humans come with limitations. It’s hard to replicate human attitudes or the way individuals respond to pain and illness. Human patients don’t always give doctors the information they need to make an accurate diagnosis, and sometimes, real-life patients aren’t able to say much at all.The medical training platform celebrated a soft launch last year when many nonessential medical clinics were on pause globally in the face of the rapidly spreading coronavirus. The AI software arrived just in time for Jack Boulter, an Exeter, England-based musculoskeletal podiatrist, to toy with it under lockdown.After Boulter’s job at a private practice temporarily shuttered, the bone injury specialist signed up for Virti’s free trial. He preferred the role-playing on his smartphone but also went back and forth with the virtual patient on his Mac. He later extended his access to the service and demonstrated it with colleagues via Zoom.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“I was looking for kind of some professional development stuff to keep me occupied,” Boulter said. “After suddenly having a few months off, it’s easy to get a little bit rusty.”Virtual patients are meant to combat other dilemmas weighing down the health-care industry.The software was designed to train against implicit bias, which occurs when staff make unconscious assumptions about a person who walks in. The judgments may be well-intended but can also taint diagnoses.The company addresses this by enabling hospitals to customize the patient's skin color, age, height, sex or gender. Digital faces are based on photos of various actors and other professionals, Virti says. There are up to 60 variations currently deployed.Story continues below advertisementIn health care, communication training often relies on actors who come in and pretend to have an ailment. Peers or higher-ups evaluate clinicians on communication tactics deployed with the actor. Much of that teaching was interrupted by the pandemic.Those in-person scenarios can “feel a bit forced” anyway, Boulter said, adding that fake patients “feel much more authentic than somebody making it up as they go along.”Share78 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making.It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it’s true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing.There’s no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse.How AI can learn to influence human behaviourA team of researchers at CSIRO’s Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia’s national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer.The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time.In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%.The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.

What the research means for the future of AIThese findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society.But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people’s vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices.The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail).What’s next?Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey.AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential.Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

‘Artificial intelligence will employ next wave of truck drivers’, says survey 



A new survey suggests artificial intelligence could be the catalyst for over half of Americans to become truck drivers – if the job could be performed autonomously and remotely – suggests people would attend college to obtain employment 
Einride, a Swedish technology company that develops and provides freight transport solutions based on electric and autonomous vehicles, released today the results of a survey conducted with OnePoll on the state of the trucking industry.
The survey examines the sentiments of American respondents around the intersection of artificial intelligence and industry-wide employment. 
AI and the workforce
According to Deloitte Insights, over 37 percent of organizations have reported deploying AI solutions – up 270 percent from four years ago.


Analysts forecast global AI spending will more than double over the next three years, topping $79 billion by 2022. In conjunction with this growth, is the impact AI is having on employees. 71 percent percent of adopters report that AI technologies have already changed their company’s job roles and necessary skills.
The trouble with trucking
Based on insights from Einride’s survey, over 44 percent of respondents would not be interested in a career in trucking as it stands today.
The main reasons for their reluctance were given as follows:

scheduling (29.80 percent);
safety (38.15 percent);
salary (21.67 percent); and
the perception of being overqualified (27.54 percent).

Currently, more than 3.5 million people work as truck drivers yet, only 10 percent of those jobs are held by women. In addition, the industry is known for long hours, with almost half of all truckers working longer than 40 hours a week according to a recent survey.
Moreover, It is an industry known for tough working conditions and a low barrier of entry with only 7 percent of truck drivers having a higher education degree.
Getting the masses comfortable with trucking… really comfortable
According to Einride’s survey, the future is here and people are feeling inspired to drive trucks…as long as they can do it remotely.
A whopping 56.02 percent of respondents would be willing to become a truck driver if they could do it autonomously and remotely while 54.23 percent of respondents would be more willing to work on weekends as a truck driver if they could perform the role without irregular hours or long haul journeys far from home.
Beyond that, nearly half (49.05 percent) of respondents reported a willingness to attend a four-year university in order to become qualified to become a truck driver knowing the role would be performed autonomously and remotely, changing the perception that being a truck driver isn’t an educational accomplishment.
Furthermore, in a recent study, it was found that 40 percent of millennials have chosen a job because of company sustainability and more than 10 percent of workers said they would be willing to go as far as to take a $5,000-$10,000 pay cut to work for a company whose values align with their own.
According to internal Einride data, the use of autonomous trucks has the ability to reduce CO2 emissions by 90 percent. Supported by the One Poll survey; 51.84 percent of respondents would reconsider a career in trucking if they knew it would have a positive impact on the environment
Robert Falck, CEO of Einride, says: “The road freight industry is responsible for 7 percent of all global emissions and is expected to increase that figure by an additional 15 percent if nothing changes.
“AI has the ability to change the freight industry from the ground up because. The future is ours to create.”
How does this play into the bigger picture of AI’s impact on the jobs sector?
AI was projected to create 2.3 million related jobs by 2020, according to Gartner and as we enter the year 2021 artificial intelligence has been established as the main driver of emerging technologies such as big data, robotics, and the internet of things.
As a result of the global pandemic, consumer trends have driven the rise of AI which has resulted in notable growth.
While 42.99 percent of people feel their job is at risk due to the influx in AI, according to Einride’s survey, there is also a willingness to learn. 44 percent of respondents agreed that they’d be willing to learn new a skill in the field of autonomous truck driving.
Six in 10 Americans (60.80 percent) have expressed optimism about the future of AI, believing the workforce will adjust to the increase in AI jobs and train employees, and 63.48 percent of these respondents are interested in learning new skills that would allow them to work in the AI-sector.
As AI usage continues to increase, companies will face a challenge far greater than automating business processes. The real work will be rebuilding the company culture to embrace what technology makes possible.
AI is at its best when it’s working in partnership with people and our survey respondents agree with 60.70 percent believing AI is having a positive impact on the workforce and are willing to participate. The future is bright for autonomous trucking.

February 19, 2021 By Chris Newmarker Goldberg and his team trained a da Vinci surgical robot to automatically perform peg transfer slightly faster and more accurately than an experienced surgical resident. [Image courtesy of the Autolab at UC Berkeley]Ken Goldberg thinks artificial intelligence will enable surgical robots to achieve their best function — not replacing surgeons but augmenting their work by reducing the monotony of specific subtasks like suturing.
The William S. Floyd Jr. Distinguished Chair in Engineering at UC Berkeley, Goldberg and his research team have continued to advance the field.
The group — which includes postdoctoral researchers Minho Hwang and Jeffrey Ichnowski and PhD student Brijen Thananjeyan — has demonstrated how a deep neural network plus 3D-printed depth-sensing markers can train a da Vinci surgical robot to automatically perform peg transfer slightly faster and more accurately than an experienced surgical resident.
They also published a paper in Science Robotics last November about new AI software that allows robots to learn how to rapidly plan smooth motions that increase speed and reduce wear in factories, warehouses…and operating rooms.
Their work encompasses so much more, too. (Here’s a list of published research.)
Goldberg recently consulted with his research team to provide some insights to Medical Design & Outsourcing and MassDevice about where the surgical robotics space could advance in coming years:
Ken Goldberg
MDO: You’ve spoken before of an emerging generation of surgical robots. Tell us more.
Goldberg: Many of the early patents on surgical-assist robots are expiring, so there are several new companies entering the market. For example, Johnson and Johnson purchased Auris, and Medtronic purchased Mazor in the past 2 years. Many new companies that are emerging in Asia — including China and Korea — are also developing a new generation of surgical-assist robots at lower cost and working to introduce some supervised autonomy.
Rather than replacing human surgeons, an emerging new generation of robots will assist surgeons by performing tedious subtasks such as suturing and debridement to improve consistency, reduce fatigue and open the door to long-distance tele-surgery.  Advances in AI can be applied to data collected from surgical systems such as Intuitive’s da Vinci to learn underlying control policies for subtasks including cutting, suturing, palpation, dissection, retraction and debridement.
MDO: How can artificial intelligence advance robot-assisted surgery? Give us an example.
Goldberg: We were recently able to automate peg transfer, a common training procedure for minimally invasive surgery, with 99.4% accuracy (357/360 trials) [on a da Vinci Research Kit] — even when the robot tools are switched. This task is challenging because it requires high accuracy, and the cables that drive surgical robots’ joints stretch during motion, which can significantly reduce their accuracy.
[We’ve learned] to correct errors at key points in the task visually by using demonstrations from a human teleoperator.
We also present an alternate approach to this task in two papers, one published and one preprint. These approaches use fiducial markers and depth-sensing with deep learning to learn a model of how the robot moves as a function of its past motions, which is a complex function of its cabling properties. Using this learned model for control, we achieve 94-100% accuracy on bilateral and unilateral versions of the task, respectively. Using a trajectory optimization procedure, we are able to roughly match or outperform a human surgeon in terms of speed as well.
MDO:  TransEnterix executives see AI as an edge when it comes to competing better with its Senhance system. What do you think of their Intelligent Surgical Unit?
Goldberg: Learning how to position and move the surgical camera without manual adjustment is a very interesting problem.  It is tedious for the surgeon to do this herself, so it would be helpful if a robot could anticipate, for example, as a suture advances beyond the field of view and track the camera to move accordingly.  This is also subtle because erroneous camera motions could be frustrating for surgeons.
MDO: Overall, what are you most excited about in the robot-assisted surgery space?
Goldberg: I’m hopeful that we can develop systems that can learn to perform specific subtasks such as suturing or debridement faster and more accurately than human surgeons, thus relieving human surgeons of tedium, allowing them to focus on more nuanced aspects of surgery and also to reduce time in the operating room.
This research field is growing rapidly: There are now 30 labs worldwide doing experiments with a research version of the Intuitive surgical-assistant robot, and new hardware and algorithms are being published every month.

That has several advantages but also some dangers, which Rajiv Malhotra reveals in his book, 'Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power'.An internationally acclaimed author who has studied computer science and done extensive research on India's history, Rajiv Malhotra has interesting insights on what artificial intelligence is doing to our nation and how it will affect us in the future. He looks into how artificial intelligence will alter every aspect of our lives, from an international, to national to a personal level.Here is an excerpt of the book to give you an idea on it:Excerpts from 'Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power' by Rajiv MalhotraThe AI-based concentration of power has taken on a terrifying new aspect. When we think of global power, countries like the US, China, and Russia readily come to mind. But today, private companies are accumulating immense power based on their ability to leverage AI and big data as tools to influence, manipulate and even control the minds of people.Some of these private companies may soon become more powerful than many nation-states, but the shift will not be obvious. They will not fly a flag or manage a currency (although some are attempting to launch their own cryptocurrency), and they will not wield military power, at least not directly. However, their unprecedented knowledge of people and things around the world, coupled with their ability to disrupt and alter the physical world and manipulate people’s choices, will lead to a new nexus of power. Such companies will decide who will, and who will not, be given access to this new form of power, and on what terms.Not one Indian company is a player in this league. Most unfortunate is that a large number of talented Indians work for American and Chinese companies in an individual capacity, including in top executive positions, but not as owners. Indians who do own companies tend to sell their stake when the right offer comes along. Whenever innovative entrepreneurs anywhere in the world develop a promising breakthrough, digital giants or venture firms that serve as their proxies are waiting to buy them out. As a result, hundreds of instant millionaires are being created at the individual level, including many living in India.I view this trend as the return of Britain’s East India Company, which started out in 1600 as a modest private company for the purpose of making profit from lucrative trade with India. Over its 250-year history, the East India Company became the world’s largest private business, amassing more wealth, income and military power than even its own British government. Despite being a private company, it became a colonial power—collecting taxes, operating courts, and running the military and other functions of state across many kingdoms within India. At the time, the East India Company had more ships, soldiers, money and territory under its control than any European government, though now it is remembered as a rogue machine. Since then, the lines between government and private companies have often blurred.","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Times Of India', 'url': 'https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-92877370/92877370.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",2021-02-17T08:30:00+05:30,ViewAction,Excerpt: 'Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power' by Rajiv Malhotra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/features/excerpt-artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-power-by-rajiv-malhotra/articleshow/80994460.cms,,,,,,,,,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80995108,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-228187,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/80994460'}",,,,

Dingoes and goannas also feed on the eggs, but to a much lesser extent.Aaron Woolla, a senior Wik and Kugu ranger from the Aak Puul Ngantam (APN) Cape York traditional owner’s organisation, said Aboriginal rangers have been trying to prevent this destruction for years.“We mark them [nests] with pegs, then we put green mesh over it. The green mesh was trying to stop dingo, goanna and pigs from digging up the nests.”Rangers also laid pig bait, did aerial culling from helicopters and checked nests on a daily basis, but it was back-breaking and time-consuming work in harsh conditions.Feral pigs threaten native species and the environment.Now an artificial intelligence-based program has been developed that can quickly analyse thousands of aerial photographs of the beach to identify evidence of both turtle nests and their predators. It could also be usefully applied to other conservation projects.CSIRO research scientist Justin Perry has been working with Wik people on land management programs since 2008.AdvertisementDr Perry said a two-year study at the start of the program revealed only some pigs were eating the turtle eggs, and it was clear there was a “disconnect” between the feral pig control program and turtle protection.In a group of about 120 pigs, only a small number had become expert at finding and destroying nests, but they would do it every night. These intelligent pigs, often older boars, also knew how to hide underneath clumps of vine during helicopter culls.Helicopters scan remote beaches for turtle and predator tracks. “It wasn’t about how many pigs you kill, it’s about which pigs were eating the eggs,” Dr Perry said.Once these boars were targeted, the number of disturbed nests dropped to almost none, but the team still wondered if there was a technological way to speed up the work of checking nests.First, they developed a survey application so that rangers could mark nest sites on an electronic map, along with information about disturbances and what type of predator was suspected.And then APN Cape York and CSIRO approached Microsoft to see if artificial intelligence could be used to identify turtle tracks and nests, and predation from feral pigs.Having real-time insight into the location of feral pigs and turtle nests helps APN Cape York rangers manage the region. A helicopter with a camera attached flew across 100 kilometres of beach, taking a photo every half a second. A long-range drone could also have been used for this task.Artificial intelligence was used to “crunch” these images and identify sites of significant predation. A process that would have taken two months for rangers in vehicles or on foot was completed in two hours.Related ArticleBiodiversityEndangered animals bounce back on rat-free Lord Howe IslandMore development is underway to get the program to a stage where rangers will be able to easily access this information from the cloud on a portable device while they are in the field.Lee Hickin, national technology officer at Microsoft Australia, said all the code would be publicly shared globally (with community permission), so that scientists and other Indigenous rangers could use it.“Whatever we design here ... provides useful information to help rangers to spend their time more efficiently,” he said.Mr Woolla said that with more time available, rangers could work in more remote areas.Related ArticleBiodiversityGreat Southern cat cull: Major conservation group joins state and farmers to fight feral horde“If we put the drones from Bullyard down to Thankunhiin, we can open up the tracks and start turtle work down there,” he said.“We just have to watch out for poison country [sacred areas].”Start your day informedOur Morning Edition newsletter is a curated guide to the most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

The first revolution saw the world running on steam engines, the second saw the mass production of goods and the third introduced digital technology to society. Each of these revolutions brought along fundamental transformations to society. While you are reading this, you are a part of the fourth industrial revolution, by the courtesy of intelligent technologies which includes intelligent automation as a key part..Intelligent Automation Is Providing End-To-End Automation To Businesses .Also known as IA, Hyperautomation, or Cognitive Automation, is one of the most popular trends in the field of AI (artificial intelligence). Intelligent automation is a combination of technologies involving people, businesses, machine learning, robotic process automation, and more. This technology assists businesses to automate end-to-end business processes in a digital environment and delivers required outcomes on behalf of the employees. In the end, it improves customer satisfaction and gets more profits..Intelligent Automation Boosts Business Efficiency .Though IA is a recent concept, it has made its way quickly in the business world. More than 50% of the world's big companies, like JP Morgan, ANZ Bank, Netflix have adopted this technology and saw their business efficiency grow to 20% to 60%. By adopting IA, every industry can reap such benefits..Intelligent Automation Is Enabling Remote Working During COVID-19 .The economic and organizational chaos caused by COVID-19 called for a more resilient system to support society. All the industries, especially healthcare, managed by a majority of the human workforce were under extreme stress during the initial stages of the pandemic. While hospitals were in severe need of support, IA stepped up and solved the problem. Hospitals had quickly adopted telemedicine and automated their front desk, first response activities, and early diagnosis processes. This automation made hospitals less reliant on their workforce, giving them the opportunity to focus their potential elsewhere..Intelligent Automation Is Improving Employee Satisfaction .According to research by Gallup, 85% of employees around the world are not happy with their work as it is mostly manual, too repetitive, and tedious. IA takes care of this issue by automating most of the repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing the employee to partake in other business responsibilities..Intelligent Automation Enhances Customer Experience .Customer satisfaction and retention are crucial for businesses. It has been observed that 96% of unhappy customers don't bother giving constructive feedback and 96% will simply leave and never come back. For businesses, IA helps create innovative and customized products and experiences which will target the customer's present need. Applications like AI will provide 24/7 support to the customers, increasing their satisfaction by 50% and reducing the company's workload by over 50% by relying on bots..IA Is Reinventing Our World .IA is shaping the future of industries and business to such a level that nothing might be the same in a workplace in the next 10-15 years. To benefit from this advancing technology, education needs to be adapted to fit the future workforce demands. It needs to focus on a person's competitive edge, creativity, and life skills as most of the tasks will be automated by machines. From an economic perspective, the use of disruptive digital technologies like IA has started to create wealth inequalities. To counter this, it is necessary to implement equal wealth-sharing mechanisms like Universal Basic Income..Intelligent automation can help us create a better tomorrow, in both work and societal front. One will give us more to focus on the kind of work we actually want to do and the other will refocus on doing what we love apart from work, which is family, love, caring, and coexisting on our planet.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Then an artificial intelligence (AI) software system assessed my personality, and either passed or failed me. No human had a look-in.I wondered: is it fair for a computer alone to accept or reject your job application?Welcome to the fast-growing world of AI recruitment. While recruiters have been using AI for around the past decade, the technology has been greatly refined in recent years. And demand for it has risen strongly since the pandemic, thanks to its convenience and fast results at a time when staff may be off due to Covid-19.The AI recruitment software that put me through the above test was provided by a New York-based firm called Pymetrics.The questions, and your answers to them, are designed to evaluate several aspects of a jobseeker's personality and intelligence, such as your risk tolerance and how quickly you respond to situations.Or as Pymetrics puts it, ""to fairly and accurately measure cognitive and emotional attributes in only 25 minutes"".Its AI software is now used in the initial recruitment processes of a number of multinational companies, such as McDonald's, bank JP Morgan, accountancy firm PWC, and food group Kraft Heinz. An interview with a human recruiter then follows if you pass.""It's about helping firms process a much wider pool [of applicants], and getting signals that someone will be successful in a job,"" says Pymetrics founder Frida Polli.Frank EllisFrida Polli says that the results of the AI test are more beneficial than reading a candidate's resume or CV""Everyone wants the right job, and to hire the right person. It doesn't benefit anyone for the match to be off. Trying to use these AI systems in smart ways is to everyone's advantage."" Another provider of AI recruitment software is Utah-based HireVue. Its AI system records videos of job applicants answering interview questions via their laptop's webcam and microphone.The audio of this is then converted into text, and an AI algorithm analyses it for key words, such as the use of ""I"" instead of ""we"" in response to questions about teamwork. The recruiting company can then choose to let HireVue's system reject candidates without having a human double-check, or have the candidate moved on for a video interview with an actual recruiter.HireVue says that by September 2019 it had conducted a total of 12 million interviews, of which 20% were via the AI software. The remaining 80% were with a human interviewer on the other end of a video screen. The overall figure has now risen to 19 million, with the same percentage split.HireVue first started offering the AI interviews in 2016. Its users include travel services firm Sabre.Meanwhile, a report from 2019 said that such is the growth in the use of AI that it will replace 16% of recruitment sector jobs before 2029.Kevin Parker, the chief executive of HireVue, says the AI is more impartial than a human interviewer. ""There's a desire to have a fair process, and AI can help evaluate all those candidates in a very consistent way,"" he says.HireVueThe HireVue system sees the jobseeker upload a video of him or herself answering a series of questionsPymetrics also says that its system ensures more fairness, and that ""every algorithm is rigorously tested for bias"". Ms Polli adds that it is better than firms simply relying upon a candidate's resume or CV.""A resume can only give information about someone's hard skills, but research and common sense tells us that it's also soft skills that contribute to job success,"" she says.So, AI recruitment is nothing to worry about? Online retail giant Amazon doesn't think so.In 2018 it was widely reported to have scrapped its own system, because it showed bias against female applicants. The Reuters news agency said that Amazon's AI system had ""taught itself that male candidates were preferable"" because they more often had greater tech industry experience on their resume. Amazon declined to comment at the time.Getty ImagesAmazon is said to have scrapped its AI recruitment system back in 2018James Meachin of UK business psychology consultancy Pearn Kandola is a specialist on the recruitment sector. He says that AI systems still have a number of challenges.""The first step in selecting candidates is to correctly parse what they have said or written,"" he says. ""On this basic level, leading voice assistants from Google, Amazon and Apple still routinely fail to understand what people are saying. For example, Scottish accents pose a challenge, as do unusual words or phrases.""If an AI system can accurately transcribe what has been said, the second - greater - challenge is to detect the meaning embedded in those words - the semantics, nuance and context. Here, AI systems can fail to understand. In contrast, a human listening to the conversation will intuitively understand what is meant.""New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University, says: ""I would be very worried if people said that using AI in recruitment only has benefits.""All machine learning works in the same basic way - you go through a bunch of data, and find patterns and similarities.""So in recruitment, looking at the successful candidates of the past is the data you have. Who were the chief executives in the past, who were the Oxford professors in the past? The recruitment algorithms are going to pick out more men.""The risk is that if you don't put in strong tests, women and people of colour are overlooked.""To help firms and other organisations avoid bias in their AI systems, not just for recruitment, but for all their business operations, Prof Wachter  wrote a paper on the issue last year. Subsequently, her proposals have been adopted by Amazon.Getty ImagesPicking the best candidates is a tricky business whichever way you approach itThere are, however, more benign ways in which AI is being used by the recruitment sector. Take Seattle-based Textio. Its software uses AI to help firms write job adverts that appeal to a broad range of people, by making the language both more inclusive, and easy to understand. It is used by everyone from the World Bank to Dropbox, Spotify and Tesco.Then there is Los Angeles-based Korn Ferry, whose AI recruitment software trawls the internet for potential job candidates. So firms don't have to wait for the best possible people to apply for positions, they can instead more easily proactively chase the individuals they want.But what about my AI job interview? I haven't been called for an interview with a human. Who knows if they're still looking to hire for the position though?EmploymentEmployment discrimination",2021-02-08T00:07:01.000Z,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F305/production/_116831226_gettyimages-90786576.jpg'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Andrea Murad'}]",,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55932977,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",2021-02-08T00:07:01.000Z,ReportageNewsArticle,The computers rejecting your job application,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55932977,,,,,,,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F305/production/_116831226_gettyimages-90786576.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Psychology and other “helping professions” such as counselling and social work are often regarded as quintessentially human domains. Unlike workers in manual or routine jobs, psychologists generally see no threat to their career from advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Economists largely agree. One of the most wide-ranging and influential surveys of the future of employment, by Oxford economists Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, rated the probability that psychology could be automated in the near future at a mere 0.43%. This work was initially carried out in 2013 and expanded upon in 2019.
We are behavourial scientists studying organisational behaviour, and one of us (Ben Morrison) is also a registered psychologist. Our analysis over the past four years shows the idea psychology cannot be automated is now out of date. 
Psychology already makes use of many automated tools, and even without significant advances in AI we foresee significant impacts in the very near future.
What do psychologists do all day?
Previous projections assumed the work of a psychologist requires extensive empathic and intuitive skills. These are unlikely to be replicated by machines any time soon. 
However, we argue the typical psychologist’s job has four primary components: assessment, formulation, intervention, and evaluation of outcome. Each component can already be automated to some extent.

Assessment of a client’s strengths and difficulties is largely carried out by computer-driven presentations of psychological tests, interpretation of results and the writing of interpretative reports. 
The rules for diagnosis of conditions are far advanced, to the extent that decision trees are extensively used by practitioners. 
Interventions are designed along formulaic lines, providing explicit rules for the presentation of guidance and problem solving, with exercises and reflections at specific points in the therapy. 
Evaluation is largely a replay of the initial assessment. 

Much of the work of the helping professional does not require empathy or intuition. Psychology has essentially laid the groundwork for the replication of human practice by a machine.
A profession in denial?
Nearly four years ago, we published an article in the bulletin of the Australian Psychological Society, asking how AI and other advanced technologies would disrupt the helping professions. We were conservative in our predictions, but even so we suggested significant potential impacts on employment and education. 
We were not arguing that so-called “strong” AI would emerge to replace humanity. We simply showed how the kind of narrow AI that currently exists (and is steadily improving) could invade the job territory of the helping professions. 



AI-driven mental health chatbots are already available.

A range of AI-driven mental health apps are already available, such as Cogniant and Woebot. Several such products adopt cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) procedures, widely considered the “gold standard” of intervention for many psychological conditions.
These programs typically use artificially intelligent conversational agents, or chatbots, to provide a form of talking therapy that helps users manage their own mental health. Research on the technology has already shown great promise.
Our concern about the future was not, however, shared among members of the helping professions. Still, we continue to present our case widely. 
AI deployment is accelerating
Four years later, we believe the impacts of this technology may arrive even sooner than we thought. Three things in particular may drive this acceleration.
The first is the rapid progress in automated systems that can replicate (and sometimes exceed) human decision-making capacities. The development of deep learning algorithms and the emergence of advanced predictive analytic systems threaten the relevance of professionals. With access to big data in the psychological and related literature, AI systems can be used to assess and intervene with clients.
The second factor is an emerging “tsunami” of AI impacts warned of by economists. Developments in information technology have not yet been reflected in widespread productivity gains, but as Canadian researchers Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb have argued, it’s likely AI predictive ability will soon be a superior alternative to human judgement in many areas. This may trigger a significant restructuring of the employment market.

      Coronavirus has boosted telehealth care in mental health, so let's keep it up




The third factor is the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for mental health services increased dramatically, with crisis services such as Lifeline and Beyond Blue reporting 15-20% more contacts in 2020 than in 2019. Pandemic-related mental illness is not expected to peak until mid 2021.
At the same time, in-person care was often ruled out – in late April 2020, half of Medicare-funded mental health services were delivered remotely.  Meditation and mindfulness apps like Headspace and Calm also saw downloads soar. 
This provides further evidence that clients will readily engage in technology-mediated forms of therapy. At the very least, the improved efficiencies will increase the number of clients that can be managed by a single human psychologist. 
How many psychologists will we need?
Given all this, how many human psychologists will the society of the very near future require? It’s a difficult question to answer.
As we have seen, it’s almost certain the work of psychologists can be replaced in large part by AI. Does this mean human psychologists should be replaced by AI? 
Many of us may feel uncomfortable with this idea. However, we have a moral obligation to use the treatment that gives the best outcomes for patients. If an AI-based solution is found to be more effective, reliable and cost-effective, it should be adopted.
Governments and healthcare organisations are likely to have to address these issues in the near future. There will be impact upon the employment and training and education of professionals. 
The professions need to be an integral part of the response. We urge psychology and related allied health professions to take a lead and not wilfully ignore the trends.
We recommend three concrete actions to improve the situation:

boost investment in research into how humans and machines can work together in the assessment and treatment of mental health
encourage attention to technology among members of the profession
give technological impacts greater consideration in projecting the future landscape of the profession, particularly when thinking about job growth, education and training.

  Previous studies have reported that the adoption of robotic technologies in industry reduces both employment and wages. This column examines the experience of Japan, which is unique due to early industry penetration and the fact that almost all the robots were domestically produced. Applying a different method from those in previous studies, it shows that the penetration of industrial robots has positive impacts on both employment and wages. This implies the potential for harmonisation of human work with future labour-replacement technology, such as artificial intelligence.

We are witnessing a clash between what have become the real symbols: the machine and the human brain. On the one hand, artificial intelligence has become a symbol of innovation, progress and development. Yet, on the other hand, there is the need to preserve human intelligence, relationships between people, their humanity. This has led to a debate on the collaboration between human resources and artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence is undeniably modernizing HRM (Human Resource Management). As a true ally, it allows the organisation to stand out from its competitors, attract high-potential talent and retain the employees already present. AI is not only an ideal partner for the employees, but also for the managers by relieving them of the many time-consuming daily tasks. There is a considerable advantage in the autonomy of the employee and of the entire HR function. Investing in artificial intelligence is a way to develop its performance, to face an ultra-competitive environment and to give an even more human face to HRM.How does AI seek to change the e-commerce landscape?A fundamental aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning has become a huge part of how you trade, purchase, and interact with the e-commerce landscape. Customers expectation, even demands of instant gratification, and keeping up the pace without compromising on quality, proves daunting. Coupled with increasing competition across the market, businesses have started to &ldquo;automate&rdquo; services in order to better serve customers and reduce their workload.Chat bots have become a commonplace to report issues and get relevant solutions. VPAs, or Virtual Private Assistants, make it possible for customers to resolve their issues without the need for a support executive.AI has already administered a lot of improvements in the e-commerce sector. By automating processes, the purchase cycle has become easier and a certain personal touch has been added to the way we shop and trade. Potentially, AI can enhance customer experience while taking a huge load of work off the business&rsquo;s back. Automation will most likely have a positive impact on customers since services will be more instant and relevant due to faster processing.Artificial Intelligence and the Workforce - The ImplicationsAI aims to improve upon a wide variety of processes. However, automating processes might have an adverse effect on the human part of the workforce. It is believed that the implementation of AI within the working sector can cause a huge number of workers to be laid off. Its impact will clearly lead to changes in skill demand and would require adaptability to work with or around automation.When it comes to human resources, the radical shift towards technology to streamline operations will help HR professionals make easy and appropriate decisions. Intelligent automation reduces the need for manual involvement which is helpful for both, big businesses and small ones, alike. Since, AI automates the function and removes the need for manual involvement, the possibility of job loss and AI replacing humans in the workforce, is still debatable.The augmentation of automation within businesses will reduce mundane tasks and help optimize existing roles. AI is unlikely to replace humans in the workforce completely. Instead, implementing automation within processes will help HR practitioners recruit better and make better decisions by supplementing their own abilities with valuable information provided by the machine.Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are also being updated to be more in line with active technologies. Without AI, CRMs can be tedious and require heavy human intervention. With AI, CRMs can be self-updating, self-correcting, and undeniably accurate while helping achieve a more seamless approach within an organisation.Rather than serving as a replacement for human ingenuity, artificial intelligence is being regarded as a supporting tool. The future of AI entails effectively using its processing and analysing capacity to streamline the decision-making process to further the development of a company and its subsequent customers.The shift towards artificial intelligence is likely to cause the economy to add jobs that enable the transition.Artificial Intelligence and the Changing Work CultureDecision making is the primary institution artificial intelligence might take over. Automating decision making ensures actions are taken in real-time and are based on relevant, factual data. This helps a company turn to a data-driven culture with ample transparency and one that enables employee empowerment.On the other hand, AI does not tire, get sick, or take breaks. Handling monotonous tasks can be left to the AI, while the humans focus on more complex and creative tasks. This can bring about a significant boost in productivity and hence, revenue. Additionally, AI can also help assist in the recruitment process and even in training employees by offering a more personalized programme.The next generation in HR solutions is powered by data and advanced people analytics. Automation in HR processes can reduce human bias and increase efficiency in candidate assessment. As HR functions are digitized, HRs themselves will move to more strategic and analytical roles. Redefining performance management can also become easier as the HR can count on accurate, real-time data to measure employee potential and take prompt and personalized actions.It is highly likely that automation will cause the displacement of certain jobs, but at the same time will create entirely new ones.ConclusionThe future of the workforce in the face of changing technologies is highly likely to be altered forever. Automation in businesses can bring more advanced, efficient systems to help in processes, both internal and relative to customers. Working together with AI will prove to be a challenge at first but adaptability will be rewarded almost instantly.It is difficult to say how exactly AI will be used in the future. But, with the current advancements we can be certain AI is to play a huge role in the e-commerce sector. Automation will no doubt be extremely useful in our day-to-day lives and has the potential to drastically alter the workforce, but its exact impact is yet to be seen.The author, Vaibhav Lall, is Founder of Khojdeal.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHRWorld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

CopyAre machines capable of design? Though a persistent question, it is one that increasingly accompanies discussions on architecture and the future of artificial intelligence. But what exactly is AI today? As we discover more about machine learning and generative design, we begin to see that these forms of ""intelligence"" extend beyond repetitive tasks and simulated operations. They've come to encompass cultural production, and in turn, design itself.+ 3

Save this picture!Courtesy of Refik AnadolWhen artificial intelligence was envisioned during the the 1950s-60s, the goal was to teach a computer to perform a range of cognitive tasks and operations, similar to a human mind. Fast forward half a century, and AI is shaping our aesthetic choices, with automated algorithms suggesting what we should see, read, and listen to. It helps us make aesthetic decisions when we create media, from movie trailers and music albums to product and web designs. We have already felt some of the cultural effects of AI adoption, even if we aren't aware of it.As educator and theorist Lev Manovich has explained, computers perform endless intelligent operations. ""Your smartphone’s keyboard gradually adapts to your typing style. Your phone may also monitor your usage of apps and adjust their work in the background to save battery. Your map app automatically calculates the fastest route, taking into account traffic conditions. There are thousands of intelligent, but not very glamorous, operations at work in phones, computers, web servers, and other parts of the IT universe."" More broadly, it's useful to turn the discussion towards aesthetics and how these advancements relate to art, beauty and taste.Save this picture!Courtesy of Refik AnadolUsually defined as a set of ""principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty”, aesthetics depend on who you are talking to. In 2018, Marcus Endicott described how, from the perspective of engineering, the traditional definition of aesthetics in computing could be termed ""structural, such as an elegant proof, or beautiful diagram."" A broader definition may include more abstract qualities of form and symmetry that ""enhance pleasure and creative expression."" In turn, as machine learning is gradually becoming more widely adopted, it is leading to what Marcus Endicott termed a neural aesthetic. This can be seen in recent “artistic hacks”, such as Deepdream, NeuralTalk, and Stylenet. Beyond these adaptive processes, there are other ways AI shapes cultural creation. Artificial intelligence has recently made rapid advances in the computation of art, music, poetry, and lifestyle. Manovich explains that AI has given us the option to automate our aesthetic choices (via recommendation engines), as well as assist in certain areas of aesthetic production such as consumer photography and automate experiences like the ads we see online. ""Its use of helping to design fashion items, logos, music, TV commercials, and works in other areas of culture is already growing."" But, as he concludes, human experts usually make the final decisions based on ideas and media generated by AI. And yes, the human vs. robot debate rages on. Save this picture!© Joris Laarman for MX3DAccording to The Economist, 47% of the work done by humans will have been replaced by robots by 2037, even those traditionally associated with university education. The World Economic Forum estimated that between 2015 and 2020, 7.1 million jobs will be lost around the world, as ""artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology and other socio-economic factors replace the need for human employees."" Artificial intelligence is already changing the way architecture is practiced, whether or not we believe it may replace us. As AI is augmenting design, architects are working to explore the future of aesthetics and how we can improve the design process.In a tech report on artificial intelligence, Building Design + Construction explored how Arup had applied a neural network to a light rail design and reduced the number of utility clashes by over 90%, saving nearly 800 hours of engineering. In the same vein, the areas of site and social research that utilize artificial intelligence have been extensively covered, and examples are generated almost daily. We know that machine-driven procedures can dramatically improve the efficiency of construction and operations, like by increasing energy performance and decreasing fabrication time and costs. The neural network application from Arup extends to this design decision-making. But the central question comes back to aesthetics and style. Save this picture!Courtesy of Refik AnadolDesigner and Fulbright fellow Stanislas Chaillou recently created a project at Harvard utilizing machine learning to explore the future of generative design, bias and architectural style. While studying AI and its potential integration into architectural practice, Chaillou built an entire generation methodology using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs). Chaillou's project investigates the future of AI through architectural style learning, and his work illustrates the profound impact of style on the composition of floor plans.As Chaillou summarizes, architectural styles carry implicit mechanics of space, and there are spatial consequences to choosing a given style over another. In his words, style is not an ancillary, superficial or decorative addendum; it is at the core of the composition.Save this picture!Courtesy of Stanislas ChaillouArtificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming increasingly more important as they shape our future. If machines can begin to understand and affect our perceptions of beauty, we should work to find better ways to implement these tools and processes in the design process.Architect and researcher Valentin Soana once stated that the digital in architectural design enables new systems where architectural processes can emerge through ""close collaboration between humans and machines; where technologies are used to extend capabilities and augment design and construction processes."" As machines learn to design, we should work with AI to enrich our practices through aesthetic and creative ideation. More than productivity gains, we can rethink the way we live, and in turn, how to shape the built environment.Editor's Note: This article was originally published on March 6, 2020, and updated on February 9, 2021.",2021-02-09T09:01:18+00:00,"['https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5e8b/bf98/b357/6565/bb00/027c/medium_jpg/Es_Devlin.jpg?1586216846', 'https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5e8b/bf98/b357/6565/bb00/027c/large_jpg/Es_Devlin.jpg?1586216846']",Eric Baldwin,,,https://www.archdaily.com/937051/when-machines-design-artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-aesthetics,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'ArchDaily', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://assets.adsttc.com/og/flat/og.png'}}",2021-02-09T04:00:00+00:00,Article,When Machines Design: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Aesthetics,https://www.archdaily.com/937051/when-machines-design-artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-aesthetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1065.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence is the next step in image editing, so find out how you'll edit your portraits of tomorrow with this tutorial on editing portrait images using Luminar AI.




AI is set to ramp up image editing software like never before. The autonomous tweaks AI could make saves hours of work by cutting out backgrounds or skies, retouching portraits, and enhancing composition. But you don't have to look into the future for this kind of intelligent image editing, it's here today, and you can use it to improve your photos.
Luminar AI by Skylum is editing software that runs entirely on artificial intelligence. In fact, it's a world first. It works by analyzing your photos and making suggested tweaks through a series of editing functions that can be automatically applied to your photo. It's properly clever stuff because it can detect people in portraits, skies in landscapes, and even render different lighting for image retouching.
The benefit of using Luminar AI over another artificial intelligence image editing software is that there's a great deal of flexibility when it comes to editing photos. If you want to click just one button and get a great edit, you can do that, but if you want to delve a little deeper and tweak things until it looks right, there's room for that, too. Let's take a look at how well it performs on my wedding portrait.
Use Templates for Intelligent Improvements
Luminar AI uses the templates feature to make AI-powered tweaks to your photos. Pick from a wide selection of preset templates, which will make filtered adjustments to your photos with minimal user input.
Perhaps Luminar AI's biggest draw is its Templates mode. After importing a photo, you can choose between a variety of preset (but AI-powered) edits that make adjustments to your image based on mood, emotion, or style. Now, it's not just like the presets of old where it pushes the sliders around a bit and basically applies a filter on top of what's already there. It actually makes changes based on what it sees in the photo. Here, I have two wonderful brides, which the software has picked up on and makes adjustments based on where they are in the frame by keeping skin tones natural and making changes to the backdrop without interfering with their dresses.

I chose the Flawless template, which brightened up the background, boosted the color slightly (without going over the top), and brought a wonderful glow to my two subjects by enhancing the brightness in their skin and dresses. There's also this slight burst of brightness around their faces, which helps to draw the eye into the center of the frame.
Check Your Progress
Easily see your progress by holding down the preview button to toggle between the original image and the current edit, or use the before/after slider to study the differences in the photo.
One thing I really like about the way Luminar AI handles images is the simple user interface. I wanted to see a before and after with the template that I selected, so I used the preview button in the top-right (the eye icon) to switch between the original image and the newly edited photo. Right next to the preview button, I have the option to run a before and after slider across the photo, which I really like. I use it similarly to an animator turning the pages over to see the movement of an illustration so that I can keep an eye on any problem areas arising.

Edit Mode
Make more precise tweaks with Edit mode, where you can make AI and non-AI edits to your photos.
Once you've had plenty of fun choosing a template, you may want to take a deeper dive into the software and make some manual adjustments. To do this, I headed to the Edit mode and used some of the tools on offer. To start with, I tested the waters with the Enhance AI tool, which did a great job of brightening the backdrop, giving the photo some more zing. Unfortunately, that wasn't what I was going for in this shot, so I turned it back down. However, I noticed that the traditional undo keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on a Mac) didn't actually work. Odd.

Composition AI
Luminar AI gives you the option of making automatic composition adjustments with mixed results.
I was pretty happy with the composition of this photo. I felt that part of the beauty of the shot is that it's quite symmetrical. With the backdrop matching up on both sides, the hinges slightly poking into the frame, and the two brides centrally placed, the visual weight of the shot felt perfectly balanced. So, when I tried Composition AI, I was quite shocked to find it wanted to crop in tighter on my subjects and place them out of the center. It's great that the software is using the rule of thirds to shake things up a bit, but I'm not sure it improved the composition in this case. For those who are struggling with the composition of a particular shot, though, I'm sure it's a good way to make a decision if you're on the fence.

Traditional Tools Also Featured
Traditional editing tools still remain for editors that like to do some manual tweaks of their own, such as dodging and burning, as seen here.
There are plenty of artificially intelligent tools in Luminar AI (as you might expect), but there are also some non-AI tools that we're used to playing with in image-editing software. I decided to scroll down to the Professional group and use the Dodge & Burn tool to enhance the brides' dresses. With the Lighten tool selected, I kept my brush size at 100 and strength at 50 but turned the amount up to 100. I painted with the brush cursor that automatically pops up once the tool is selected and covered the white dresses to give them some extra punch. I thought it did a great job; even with the amount slider up to max, it didn't overexpose the dresses and gave a wonderfully ethereal look.

Intelligent Skin Retouching
Skin-AI is part of a group of AI-powered portrait editing tools that do well at making automatic changes to the skin.
An integral part of the portrait image-editing process is probably the ability to retouch the skin. Handily, Luminar AI has a whole group of portrait tools just for this, three out of four of which are powered by artificial intelligence. I decided to give the Skin AI tool a go. Once selected, it automatically makes changes to the skin in the photo without any kind of input from the user. Although the skin on both subjects was absolutely wonderful, I wanted to see how the tool worked, so I turned the amount slider up to 64. It gave a good smooth effect without removing all the texture of the skin, which is something I look for in skin retouching. The shine removal was also good, helping to tone down hot spots across their faces. I also ticked the skin defects removal button, which removed a couple of minute blemishes, very precise for such a quick AI-powered tool.

I've been using Luminar AI since it first came out, and I've not been terribly impressed with the composition AI thus far. I'm still trying to get the hang of it. What I do like is that there are a few templates that generally match my own style from in the past. What is important here is that I had a preferred style, and I know when the software is close and when it isn't. I'm not sure how the templates would do for a beginner to editing, but for me it at least saves some time.

I don't really trust AI and certainly wouldn't call it a photo editing tool of tomorrow. Sure, it can be used to save your time on basic editing and many photo editors like Photoworks or Photodiva use AI technologies, but I wouldn't let AI do all the deep post-processing for me and certainly I wouldn't totally rely on it when I know it doesn't have my tastes and vision. Luminar AI is worth trying, though, I just wouldn't recommend it to the beginners who need to understand how it all works first.

I tried it, for a few shoots, I could sometimes get something good on the first image, but as soon as I went to the second photo, the dang program would throw off the white balance into an extreme blue and would NOT adjust it back out.  I demanded a refund and wish I could demand a refund on Luminar 4 I had purchased shortly before AI was announced.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making.
It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it’s true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing. 
There’s no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse.
How AI can learn to influence human behaviour
A team of researchers at CSIRO’s Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia’s national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer. 
The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time.
In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%.

The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.  
In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.

What the research means for the future of AI
These findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society.
But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.

The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people’s vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices.
The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail).
What’s next?
Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey. 
AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential. 
Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.

Reinventing Report Cards: Reading, Writing, Collaboration and Other Work Skills







For K-3 students, Amira is an avatar — one wearing a green jacket with short, dark hair — that pops up on a screen while they work on literacy skills. For educators, though, Amira is more than an artificial intelligent program listening to students read aloud; it is technology that assesses student mastery while delivering personalized coaching and saving teachers time.
As teachers grapple with ways to stay connected to students, especially those already struggling with literacy, Amira wants to be part of the solution. Begun in 2017 with a project using Carnegie Mellon University technology, Amira has built an in-classroom product that is used in 280 school districts across the country and taking AI literacy software to new places, says CEO Mark Angel.
Amira’s reading assistant begins by observing a student read for six to 10 minutes, “the same way a really good teacher does,” Angel says. The software gauges the child’s ability to name letters, sound out words and combine them into phrases and sentences. “We will put a student through a set of observational mini-tests, and then (the program) spends a couple minutes actually listening to that student read an appropriately leveled story or passage out loud,” Angel says.
From that initial screening, Amira is able to grab information to spot signs of dyslexia risk, gauge mastery of phonetics, estimate a student’s vocabulary size and get a good handle on decoding skills and comprehension levels. Then, the program reports findings to a teacher to support differentiated instruction, pinpointing the exact level of literacy abilities and needs for individual students.
Early on, when learning took a dramatic at-home-only turn for most students, Amira offered its online platform free of charge to districts and schools. As the pandemic continues, the cost for Amira is about $20 per student, per year.
“All the data shows that the ability to read is life’s most important skill, and we are in a race to get every student to fluency by third grade,” Angel says. “If students don’t become masterful, motivated readers by third grade, they are four times more likely to drop out of school, have career earnings 35 to 40 percent less and confront a lifetime of difficulty and struggle. We are coming face to face with those dreadful statistics and getting to a place where a lot more kids have an opportunity to spend time reading out loud and do the practice necessary to rewire the brain for good reading.”
(Amira Learning)
Following the initial assessment, Amira encourages teachers to have students spend time practicing reading with the AI assistant for 10 to 15 minutes per day, three to five days a week. The program listens for mistakes, hesitations or problems and provides individualized tutoring.
“It is in that individualized tutoring process Amira is special and unique, using artificial intelligence to look at the context of a student’s mistake and decide the right kind of help to build skills,” Angel says. “It might say they are struggling with this word because they are having a challenge decoding a particular phoneme, or sometimes Amira will decide a student lacks a decoding skill around a silent letter or plurals. Sometimes it is just a hard word, and Amira will provide a definition and get them to be more familiar. It is during that tutoring process Amira delivers personalized help around the observed mistakes and helps them get through the text and move on.”
Students can plug their own assignments into the program or let the AI suggest stories based on the child’s interests. Angel says a typical classroom will use Amira as part of a rotation, with a teacher working with one group of students, another group working on a different project and a third group working with headsets on a Chromebook, iPad or whatever hardware is in the classroom. The groups can rotate every 20 minutes.
“Amira has the potential to change the landscape of independent reading practice,” says Dr. Katharine Miles, a Brooklyn College professor and reading scientist.
Amira’s leadership team was born out of Renaissance Learning, where many of the staff, including Angel, worked. As the chief technology officer, he says, he started looking for a better way to help K-3 students, and he and a group of Renaissance employees licensed the Carnegie Mellon technology and built Amira around it. With venture capital backing the company, they created the core product and demonstrated its value, then found a partner in with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt that could take the product to scale and reach into the complicated ed tech marketplace.
In 2019, Amira partnered with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston to help administer the TPRI, an early literacy assessment created by the school and delivered to educational institutions across the country. The partnership allows Amira to give the test online as a digital application, creating the first fully automated AI curriculum-based assessment.
Amira has worked with 280 school districts across the country. Moving forward, Angel says the goal is to continue evolving and improving. “AI software is like any person who is learning a new skill,” he says. “The more experience we get, the more different kinds of situations we see, the better we are at practicing our craft.”
With more diversity of students, Angel expects Amira to soon work better with children who have unique challenges, whether it’s pronounced regional accents, dyslexia or special needs. “These are capabilities,” he says, “we can optimize by using the power of the AI.”

Report: Pentagon Says STEM Education Deficit is Weakening America
The United States risks losing its competitive advantage if it continues with its business-as-usual approach and fails to equip its workforce with the education and skills to develop and field complex, cutting-edge emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, machine learning, and hypersonics.

by John Turner



 


On January 14 the Pentagon released its annual report on the state of the U.S. defense and manufacturing industrial base. The estimated cost of the report was $159,000 USD and clocked in at 184 pages. The document, entitled US Defense Industrial Base Industrial Capabilities Report January 2021, is a congressionally-mandated, annual requirement in which the Secretary of Defense informs the armed services committees on the actions, investments, and overall health of the U.S. defense industrial base (DIB). The report is divided into nine component areas spanning the Department’s primary DIB lines of effort, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the DIB, an overview of the U.S. defense industry, assessments of the sixteen industrial base sectors and emerging technology sectors, and overviews of the primary DIB authorities and investment mechanisms.

There are innumerable takeaways from the report but a consistent and glaring deficiency throughout reveals an erosion and degradation of the U.S. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education system and a severe shortage of technical talent in the U.S. workplace. The broad conclusion is that the United States risks losing its competitive advantage if it continues with its business-as-usual approach and fails to equip its workforce with the education and skills to develop and field complex, cutting-edge emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, machine learning, and hypersonics.     

1. How acute is the STEM education and talent deficit in the United States?  
The STEM shortage in the DIB is quickly approaching crisis status. As stated by Arthur Herman, “We are fast approaching another Sputnik moment, we can’t afford to ignore.” The United States must create a “state-of-the-art STEM education strategy” to cope with this reality. The report assesses if the United States fails to modernize and adjust it likely will face a “permanent national security deficit.” The United States should not be surprised by this development as prominent U.S. business and government leaders have long been sounding the alarm about the decay of the U.S. education system. 





In July, Admiral (Ret) William McRaven, the former U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) commander and chancellor of the University of Texas, was straightforward when pressed about which national security issue kept him up at night: “K-12 education."" According to Admiral McRaven, “unless we are giving opportunity and a quality education to the young men and women in the United States, then we won't have the right people to be able to make the right decisions about our national security…They won't have an understanding of different cultures. They won't have an understanding of different ideas. They won't be critical thinkers.”

The report stresses that 
Today’s education pipeline is not providing the necessary software engineering resources to fully meet the demand from commercial and defense sectors, and resources required to meet future demands continue to grow...Decades of neglect have left the robust system of technical schools the nation once relied upon for industrial training badly weakened and the existing workforce is rapidly aging out, taking irreplaceable tacit knowledge with them...Programmatic responses to education and training needs still largely focus on four-year STEM-based programs rather than digital industrial skills on the factory floor.

2. What does the report reveal about US STEM education trends in relation to Russia and China and the broader international community?
The DIB report reveals the United States is graduating fewer students with STEM degrees as a percentage of population compared to China, and the trend continues to worsen. The population of China is four times that of the United States but is producing eight times the number of STEM graduates while Russia has almost four times the number of engineers. The United States no longer has the most STEM graduates worldwide and is being rapidly outpaced by China. In 2016, the United States had the third-most STEM graduates worldwide with 67 million graduates compared to China with 78 million. 
As the pool of U.S. domestic technical talent shrinks, the number of foreign students stepping up to fill the talent gap has increased. Analysis of the National Science Board’s 2020 Science & Engineering Indicators Report reveals that more than one-half of all U.S. doctorate engineering, computer science, and mathematics graduates are foreign-born. In addition, the DIB report explains how STEM-focused programs at U.S. universities are struggling to attract, and retain top-tier technical talent and are turning to foreign students to address this shortfall, particularly from China and India. In the 2019-2020 Academic Year, the United States hosted over one million international students, with 53 percent coming from China and India; over the past decade the total number of Indian students in the United States has more than doubled from 81,000 in 2008 to 202,000 in 2019. Over half or 52 percent of all international students in the United States were pursuing careers in STEM fields of study, with engineering the leading field of study followed by mathematics and computer science.      
3. What does the DIB Report forecast about STEM occupational hiring trends and developments? 
The DIB report asserts the production of engineers and scientists with U.S. citizenship, and the skills necessary to successfully develop and sustain the software is not keeping up with demand. As of 2017, American students made up barely 21 percent of the computer science student body and 19 percent of electrical engineering majors among our nation’s universities. This is problematic as seven out of ten STEM occupations were related to computers and information systems. 
Findings from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics reveal that computer-science STEM occupations are forecasted to grow 12 percent by 2029, creating over half a million computer-science related jobs with demand for information security analysts, software developers, and computer research specialists poised to grow by 15 percent.
4. What does the DIB Report say about cyber-related trends, activities, and vulnerabilities? 
To no one’s surprise, the DIB report reaffirms and underscores the need for the United States to bolster and ameliorate its cyber defenses. For example, the report documents the persistent threat posed by pernicious cyber-state actors to the U.S. manufacturing base and intellectual property. The report stresses that manufacturing is the second most heavily attacked sector in the U.S. economy with 35 percent of all cyber-espionage attacks in the United States targeted at manufacturing. The DIB report points out that of the 291,000 manufacturing establishments in the United States, 99 percent were small-to-medium size establishments with fewer than 500 employees and are unprepared to deal with a cyber-attack. The report also extolls U.S. intellectual property theft vulnerabilities to the tune of $450 billion in annual losses. To better address these vulnerabilities, the DIB Report assesses the present and future U.S. DoD cyber workforce must develop a broader and deeper understanding of analytics and key emerging technologies, such as autonomy, human-machine interaction, and artificial intelligence. This will require personnel to adopt new methods in how they approach cyber defense and collective security to an “Always On” 24/7/365 mentality.
5. What does the DIB Report say about the U.S. DoD workforce trends in artificial intelligence and machine learning?        
The U.S. DoD artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning industrial base face several key challenges going forward to include recruiting and retaining personnel with AI expertise compared to the commercial sector. The DIB report underscores how a declining U.S. AI domestic workforce is complicating DoD capacity in leveraging private commercial technology for military applications. This will almost certainly complicate DoD’s plans to cultivate and hire experienced, top-tier AI talent equipped with the knowledge, skills, and core competencies to build and deploy the AI across the force that will be critical to fight and win the wars of the future.
6. What should the Biden administration and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin take away from this report? 
The DIB Report portends that without “serious and targeted investment—billions instead of millions—America’s defense industrial base is simply unsustainable, let alone capable of supporting our deployed forces and legacy equipment while solving the complex warfighting challenges posed by advanced technologies in the 21st century, from AI and cyber to hypersonics and autonomous air and sea systems.”
The new U.S. secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, stated his department will ensure all DIB companies have access to the requisite tools and resources to counter the full range of cyber-security threats, support a whole-of-government approach to enhance domestic industrial capacity, and satisfy U.S. defense requirements—a top Biden priority. 
President Joe Biden has articulated that developing, and sustaining a robust, capable, and responsive STEM workforce is critical in slowing the spread of the Covid-19 virus that has killed 420,000 Americans. The United States should be encouraged by his executive order elevating the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) within his first week in office to a cabinet-level agency that will strengthen and enhance the relationship between academia, industry, and government to advance emerging technologies in protecting national security. The Biden administration would do well to inculcate and enhance STEM investments in U.S. public education, particularly at the K-12 level where just 31 percent of Americans assessed in primary and secondary schools were performing at above average in STEM programs.

“When looms weave by themselves, man’s slavery will end.” —Aristotle, 4th century BC


Stanford is hosting an event next month named “Intelligence Augmentation: AI Empowering People to Solve Global Challenges.” This title is telling and typical.

The notion that, at its best, AI will augment rather than replace humans has become a pervasive and influential narrative in the field of artificial intelligence today.

It is a reassuring narrative. Unfortunately, it is also deeply misguided. If we are to effectively prepare ourselves for the impact that AI will have on society in the coming years, it is important for us to be more clear-eyed on this issue.

PROMOTED
It is not hard to understand why people are receptive to a vision of the future in which AI’s primary impact is to augment human activity. At an elemental level, this vision leaves us humans in control, unchallenged at the top of the cognitive food chain. It requires no deep, uncomfortable reconceptualizations from us about our place in the world. AI is, according to this line of thinking, just one more tool we have cleverly created to make our lives easier, like the wheel or the internal combustion engine.
But AI is not just one more tool, and uncomfortable reconceptualizations are on the horizon for us.
Chess provides an illustrative example to start with. Machine first surpassed man in chess in 1997, when IBM’s Deep Blue computer program defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a widely publicized match. In response, in the years that followed, the concept of “centaur chess” emerged to become a popular intellectual touchstone in discussions about AI.

The idea behind centaur chess was simple: while the best AI could now defeat the best human at chess, an AI and human working together (a “centaur”) would be the most powerful player of all, because man and machine would bring complementary skills to bear. It was an early version of the myth of augmentation.

And indeed, for a time, mixed AI/human teams were able to outperform AI programs at chess. “Centaur chess” was hailed as evidence of the irreplaceability of human creativity. As one centaur chess advocate reasoned: “Human grandmasters are good at long-term chess strategy, but poor at seeing ahead for millions of possible moves—while the reverse is true for chess-playing AIs. And because humans and AIs are strong on different dimensions, together, as a centaur, they can beat out solo humans and computers alike.”

But as the years have gone by, machine intelligence has continued on its inexorable exponential upward trajectory, leaving human chess players far behind.
Today, no one talks about centaur chess. AI is now so far superior to humanity in this domain that a human player would simply have nothing to add. No serious commentator today would argue that a human working together with DeepMind’s AlphaZero chess program would have an advantage over AlphaZero by itself. In the world of chess, the myth of augmentation has been proven untenable.
Chess is just a board game. What about real-world settings?
The myth of augmentation has spread far and wide in real-world contexts, too. One powerful reason why: job loss from automation is a frightening prospect and a political hot potato.
Let’s unpack that. Entrepreneurs, technologists, politicians and others have much to gain by believing—and by persuading others to believe—that AI will not replace but rather will supplement humans in the workforce. Employment is one of the most basic social and political necessities in every society in the world today. To be openly job-destroying is therefore a losing proposition for any technology or business.
“AI is going to bring humans and machines closer together,” business leader Robin Bordoli said recently, echoing a narrative that has been on the lips of countless Fortune 500 CEOs in recent years. “It’s not about machines replacing humans, but machines augmenting humans. Humans and machines have different relative strengths and weaknesses, and it’s about the combination of these two that will allow human intents and business process to scale 10x, 100x, and beyond that in the coming years.”
Former IBM CEO Gina Rometti summed it up even more succinctly in a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed: “AI—better understood as ‘augmented intelligence’—complements, rather than replaces, human cognition.”
Yet a moment’s honest reflection makes clear that many AI systems being built today will displace, not augment, vast swaths of human workers across the economy.
AI’s core promise—the reason we are pursuing it to begin with—is that it will be able to do things more accurately, more cheaply and more quickly than humans can do them today. Once AI can deliver on this promise, there will be no practical or economic justification for humans to continue to be involved in many fields.
For instance, once an AI system can provably drive a truck better and safer in all conditions than a human can—the technology is not there today, but it is getting closer—it simply will not make sense for humans to continue driving trucks. In fact, it would be affirmatively harmful and wasteful to have a human in the loop: aside from saved labor costs, AI systems never speed, never get distracted, never drive drunk, and can stay on the road 24 hours a day without getting drowsy.
The startups and truck manufacturers developing self-driving truck technology today may not acknowledge it publicly, but the end game of their R&D efforts is not to augment human laborers (although that narrative always finds a receptive audience). It is to replace them. That is where the real value lies.
Radiology provides another instructive example. Radiologists’ primary responsibility is to examine medical images for the presence or absence of particular features, like tumors. Pattern recognition and object detection in images is exactly what deep learning excels at.
A common refrain in the field of radiology these days goes like this: “AI will not replace radiologists, but radiologists who use AI will replace radiologists who do not.” This is a quintessential articulation of the myth of augmentation.
And in the near term, it will be true. AI systems will not replace humans overnight, in radiology or in any other field. Workflows, organizational systems, infrastructure and user preferences take time to change. The technology will not be perfect at first. So to start, AI will indeed be used to augment human radiologists: to provide a second opinion, for instance, or to sift through troves of images to prioritize those that merit human review. In fact, this is already happening. Consider it the “centaur chess” phase of radiology.
But fast forward five or ten years. Once it is established beyond dispute that neural networks are superior to human radiologists at classifying medical images—across patient populations, care settings, disease states—will it really make sense to continue employing human radiologists? Consider that AI systems will be able to review images instantly, at zero marginal cost, for patients anywhere in the world, and that these systems will never stop improving.
In time, the refrain quoted above will prove less on-the-mark than the controversial but prescient words of AI legend Geoff Hinton: “We should stop training radiologists now. If you work as a radiologist, you are like Wile E. Coyote in the cartoon; you’re already over the edge of the cliff, but you haven’t looked down.”

What does all of this mean for us, for humanity?
A vision of the future in which AI replaces rather than augments human activity has a cascade of profound implications. We will briefly surface a few here, acknowledging that entire books can and have been written on these topics.
To begin, there will be considerable human pain and dislocation from job loss. It will occur across social strata, geographies and industries. From security guards to accountants, from taxi drivers to lawyers, from cashiers to stock brokers, from court reporters to pathologists, human workers across the economy will find their skills out of demand and their roles obsolete as increasingly sophisticated AI systems come to perform these activities better, cheaper and faster than humans can. It is not Luddite to acknowledge this inevitability.
Society needs to be nimble and imaginative in its public policy response in order to mitigate the effects of this job displacement. Meaningful investment in retraining and reskilling by both governments and private employers will be important in order to postpone the obsolescence of human workers in an increasingly AI-driven economy.
More fundamentally, a paradigm shift in how society conceives of resource allocation will be necessary in a world in which material goods and services are increasingly cheaply available thanks to automation, while demand for compensated human labor is increasingly scarce.
The idea of a universal basic income—until recently, little more than a pet thought experiment among academics—has begun to be taken seriously by mainstream policymakers. Last year Spain’s national government launched the largest UBI program in history. One of the leading candidates in the 2020 U.S. presidential elections made UBI the centerpiece of his campaign. Expect universal basic income to become a normalized and increasingly important policy tool in the era of AI.
An important dimension of AI-driven job loss is that some roles will resist automation for far longer than others. The jobs in which humans will continue to outperform machines for the foreseeable future will not necessarily be those that are the most cognitively complex. Rather, they will be those in which our humanity itself plays an essential part.
Chief among these are roles that involve empathy, camaraderie, social interaction, the “human touch.” Human babysitters, nurses, therapists, schoolteachers, and social workers, for instance, will continue to find work for many years to come.
Likewise, humans will not be replaced any time soon in roles that require true originality and unconventional thinking. A cliché but insightful adage about the relationship between man and AI goes as follows: as AI gets better at knowing the right answers, humans’ most important role will be to know which questions to ask. Roles that demand this sort of imaginativeness include, for instance, academic researchers, entrepreneurs, technologists, artists, and novelists.
In the jobs that do remain as the years go by, then, people will spend less of their energy on tedious, repeatable, soulless tasks and more of it developing human relationships, managing interpersonal dynamics, thinking creatively.
But make no mistake: a larger, more profound transition is in store for humanity as AI assumes more and more of the responsibilities that people bear today. To put it simply, we will eventually enter a post-work world.
There will not be nearly enough meaningful jobs to employ every working-age person. More radically, we will not need people to work in order to generate the material wealth necessary for everyone’s healthy subsistence. AI will usher in an era of bounty. It will automate (and dramatically improve upon) the value-creating activities that humans today perform; it will, for instance, enable us to synthetically generate food, shelter, and medicine at scale and at low cost.
This is a startling, almost incomprehensible vision of the future. It will require us to reconceptualize what we value and what the meaning of our lives is.
Today, adult life is largely defined by what resources we have and by how we go about accumulating those resources—in other words, by work and money. If we relax these constraints, what will fill our lives?
No one knows what this future will look like, but here are some possible answers. More leisure time. More time to invest in family and to develop meaningful human relationships. More time for hobbies that give us joy, whether reading or fly fishing or photography. More mental space to be creative and productive for its own sake: in art, writing, music, filmmaking, journalism. More time to pursue our inborn curiosity about the world and to deepen our understanding of life’s great mysteries, from the atom to the universe. More capacity for the basic human impulse to explore: the earth, the seas, the stars.
The AI-driven transition to a post-work world will take many decades. It will be disruptive and painful. It will require us to completely reinvent our society and ourselves. But ultimately, it can and should be the greatest thing that has ever happened to humanity.

There are now hundreds of revenue attribution tools available to marketers. Some are from global corporations. Many more are from start-ups who want to grab a slice of a fast-growing software market that one analyst believes will be worth $3.6 billion by 2023.
Google offers GA360, Adobe has a similar product. These two companies dominate the market. HubSpot, Pardot, and even Amazon have also launched revenue attribution tools in the last few years, but they don’t tell you much about what’s going on outside of their own ecosystems. And it would be shocking indeed if Facebook reported that channels other than its own were delivering the best return on your advertising dollars. 
So, here’s the problem. Most marketers don’t trust what the tools are telling them, in part because none of the tools is capable of helping them see the bigger picture by analysing the varying types of data that are fed into them from online and offline marketing campaigns. And because they don’t trust the data, they are forced down blind alleys, over-investing in expensive PPC campaigns, under-investing in medium- to long-term brand building, and failing to truly optimise marketing investments.

Let’s start with the data

Marketers face no shortage of data. In fact, they’re drowning in it and it’s a significant challenge to understand both the nature and accuracy of the data with which they’re presented.
Data can be classified as deterministic or probabilistic.

Deterministic data is easy to understand and trust. If you send someone an email with a hyperlink embedded somewhere in the text and they click on the link, it’s almost certain that the intended recipient is the person that actioned the click. You can measure the percentage of people that click and, possibly, track them through to a purchase. Their direct behaviour and unique identifier combine to produce an accurate picture. Such data can come from other sources too: customers that log into your website, either via an app or browser, people that complete an online form, some types of in-store data collection, and other channels that meet the required criteria.Probabilistic data is more difficult to analyse and interpret because it’s all about making estimates. In order for estimates to be accurate, it’s important that there is sufficient data and that it comes from representative sources. In other words, care needs to be taken to ensure that the audience from which the data is sourced represents the customers you want to reach and that you have enough data to ensure that the resulting analysis is statistically robust. You don’t want to omit relevant groups, or over-represent others if the resulting data is to be useful in optimising marketing investments. Probabilistic analysis is the only viable way to determine the effectiveness of linear radio/TV, print advertising, outdoor campaigns, and some aspects of both social media and in store advertising.


Figure 1: Probabilistic data is about estimates, which makes it trickier to understand and to handle.

What AI can do to help

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a generic term used to describe computing systems that attempt to emulates how our brains work. While we think of today’s AI systems as being highly sophisticated, they are still relatively crude. They exhibit a tiny fraction of the overall capabilities of our brains and consume many times more power. The human brain runs at about 20 Watts; computers consume thousands of watts to perform much less work.
Nevertheless, AI, specifically in the form of machine learning (a subset of AI), is much better at some tasks than we are. This includes taking vast volumes of data, analysing them, and presenting the results in ways that help us see patterns we might otherwise miss. If your maths is good, this blog post by IBM is a great introduction to AI terminology and principles. There’s more of a plain English guide to machine learning and algorithms by data analytics firm, SAS, here.
Machine learning (ML) can play three important roles with respect to marketing attribution data: The first is to clean up ‘dirty’ data that you may have assumed to be deterministic but isn’t. The second is to analyse probabilistic data. The third, and most exciting, is to marry deterministic and probabilistic data together to reveal the behaviour of consumers throughout their buying journey.

Cleaning up ‘dirty’ data that you may have assumed to be deterministic but isn’tAnalysing probabilistic data. Marrying up deterministic and probabilistic data to reveal the behaviour of consumers throughout their buying journey.

In a world where most marketing attribution tools can only really provide information about what’s happening at the level of an individual browser, this final point is crucial. Browsers aren’t buyers, people are. It’s important to understand the limitations of tracking browser cookies and pixels. Without such an understanding, you’ll waste a significant proportion of your marketing budget by making poor decisions based on poor data.

Random Forest – a proven algorithm for cleaning up your act

Google Analytics, and to a lesser extent Adobe Analytics, are the tools of choice for most digital marketers. Google’s GA360 toolset is often the obvious choice, not least because so much marketing effort is directed towards generating website visits through Google’s search engine. There is a natural assumption that the data produced GA360 must be reasonably accurate. 
But, as a famous line from the US TV show ‘The Odd Couple’ proclaimed:
“Never ASSUME, because when you ASSUME, you make an ASS of U and ME”
Independent research has repeatedly shown that the raw data extracted from Google Analytics tools is often highly inaccurate. Digital marketing agency, QueryClick, has found the raw data from website sessions and display advertising used for marketing attribution is often up to 80% inaccurate, which goes some way to explaining why marketers struggle to find causative links between marketing actions and attribution data. Many factors contribute to this inaccuracy. The data from one browser session may be accurate, but it doesn’t tell you who is using the browser. Then there’s the fact that buyer journeys often involve multiple online sessions, perhaps using several different browsers. Google tools have no effective way of stitching these sessions together to reveal the individuals behind them.

5 things you need from an attribution solution that Google Analytics can’t provide today’s marketers

For any marketing attribution tool to be useful, it has to start by cleaning up the raw data, to give a more accurate picture of the true customer journeys behind the digital data. Using a combination of regression analysis and probabilistic modelling, QueryClick’s Corvidae, a software-as-as-service (SaaS) marketing attribution tool, uses a proven Random Forest algorithm in a machine learning process to rebuild the raw, cross-channel analytics data. The tool then unifies online and offline data before applying neural network processing calculate attribution accurately.


Corvidae rebuilds and unifies analytics data from the ground up. Artificial intelligence underpins this process and typically delivers a 3x improvement in attribution accuracy, based on trials with UK retailer, Tesco.

Marketing attribution analysis is never going to be 100% accurate because much of the data that we have to analyse is probabilistic. However, error-ridden, over-simplistic attribution tools are costing advertisers billions of pounds in wasted investment each year. There’s an urgent need to reduce expenditure on running the wrong campaigns in the wrong channels. Without AI, accurate analysis is simply not possible. With it properly applied, the return-on-investment in marketing can be dramatically changed for the better.

Is the digital workforce ready to take over? Well, not quite. Artificial intelligence may be capable of assuming many tasks, but it will be some time, if ever, that it could replace jobs on a widespread basis. It simply has too many limitations.


Instead, we need to acquaint a generation of workers with technologies to take on the more mundane, repetitive portions of their jobs, and in turn elevate their decision-making roles within enterprises. That’s the word from Steve Shwartz, AI author, researcher and investor, who points out that the notion of AI taking jobs is a myth. However, AI will have a profound impact on employment. 

Shwartz, author of the just-published book Evil Robots, Killer Computers, and Other Myths: The Truth About AI and the Future of Humanity, points out that “many people are concerned that intelligent robots will be able to read manuals, take courses, and eliminate all our jobs. Fortunately, this is science fiction.”

PROMOTED
Today’s AI systems are only capable of learning functions “that relate a set of inputs to a set of outputs,” he says. “This simple paradigm has enabled fantastic technological accomplishments such as facial recognition, language translation, and cars that can see and avoid pedestrians. However, these learned functions have no more intelligence than a function that translates Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius temperatures.”

It would take a huge breakthrough “to create intelligent robots, and today’s AI researchers have only vague ideas about how to create such a breakthrough,” Shwartz says. “Such a breakthrough is about as likely as time travel.”

The bottom line is that “any job that requires commonsense reasoning is safe; probably for our lifetimes. Maybe forever,” he continues. “People-oriented skills in finance, marketing, sales, and HR are probably safe. The types of jobs that will be impacted – and not necessarily negative impacted – are ones that involve repetitive decision-making that can be learned by AI systems.”

Rather than replace jobs, AI is replacing tasks — especially repetitive, data-oriented analyses are candidates for automation by AI systems. “If it is possible to create a large training set of examples in which each example is labeled with the correct answer, that analysis can likely be learned by an AI system,” says Shwartz.
Another task category that AI will enhance is repetitive customer service interactions, he continues. AI-based chatbots are assuming more customer-service work, and “customer service jobs that involve a human following a script to interact with customers are at the most risk. Human interactions that require real, unscripted conversations are not at risk.”
For non-technical careers, the greatest impact is the availability of massive amounts of data, Shwartz says. “The field of marketing has already been transformed by data. Marketers analyze data from Google to determine which keywords to buy. They analyze huge amounts of customer data to determine which campaigns should be targeted to which customers. And they analyze massive databases of web traffic to determine what changes to make to their websites. Today’s marketers need to be data analysts. Most companies are relying more and more on data to drive the business. Many formerly non-technical jobs now require extensive data analysis. Workers who do not adapt will be left behind.”
While AI will be replacing many repetitive tasks and amplifying intelligence through data, the most exciting opportunities will be seen with the creation of new types of businesses. Shwartz was a founder of one of the first AI companies, Cognitive Systems, in 1986. As an angel investor, Shwartz now sees large numbers of startups whose business models are only possible because of AI technology: “Computer-vision technology enables computers and robots to identify objects, faces, and activities. Startups are developing in-store products that identify customers and provide highly personalized offers direct to their smartphones. Companies are developing surveillance products for law enforcement and the military. Startups are creating AI-based medical applications to read MRIs and diagnose diseases. Other vendors are using other types of AI technology to detect fraud and stop cyber-attacks, analyze legal documents, predict the weather, improve search results, and even design golf clubs.”
Along with achieving greater sophistication and better mimicking human reasoning, AI also brings additional challenges, Shwartz relates. “Computer-vision systems have been shown to be biased against minorities. It is not only unethical for companies to roll out biased systems, but also bad for business. In Europe, due to GDPR regulations, it is illegal and similar regulations are almost certain to follow in the US. These biases are often created inadvertently using biased data.

AI Can Now Learn to Manipulate Human Behavior

Tech12 February 2021By Jon Whittle, The Conversation

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making.



It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it's true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing.



There's no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse.



How AI can learn to influence human behaviourA team of researchers at CSIRO's Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia's national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer.



The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant's choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70 percent of the time.



In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25 percent.



The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.



In each experiment, the machine learned from participants' responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people's decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.



What the research means for the future of AIThese findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society.



But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.



The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people's vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices.



The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail).



What's next?Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey.



AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential.Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.

Well, can't disclose the whole recipe but can tell one of the major ingredients that go into making the mix- Artificial Intelligence. Many industries have already used AI to enable digitization and gain efficient business growth. The pandemic last year changed the way industries work and almost everything went digital. The textile industry is no exception since they are now slowly adopting AI and automation in transforming their production, manufacturing processes, customer relation, etc..According to a study published by M Shahbandeh in Statista, the global apparel market is projected to grow in value from 1.5 trillion USD in 2020 to about 2.25 trillion USD in 2025, showing that the demand for clothing and shoes is on the rise across the world. The increase in demand for quality products has led the textile industry to embrace automation and AI to minimize labour and production costs and deliver products according to customer preferences. Another report by Grand View Research says that the global textile market size was valued at 961.5 billion USD in 2019 and is estimated to exhibit a CAGR of 4.3% from 2020 to 2027 owing to the increased demand for apparel in developing countries like China, India, Mexico, and Bangladesh. Textile is a labour-intensive industry and technologies like AI and IoT have helped in easier data processing, predictive analysis, developing smart apparel, and efficiently take up massive work without human intervention. Let us now discuss some of the applications of artificial intelligence that will help transform the textile industry for innovative business developments..Fabric Pattern Inspection.AI technology like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) helps in defect detection in patterns like weaving and knitting. The AI-enabled vision-based inspection can reduce human errors and increase efficiency. For example, Cognex ViDi developed by Cognex Corp. can automatically inspect fabric patterns. Cognex ViDi leverages machine vision-based technology and it does not require any specific development strategy to implement it into manufacturing..AI-enabled fabric pattern inspection accelerates manufacturing by reducing pattern defects with minimum labour and maximum precision and accuracy..AI can be used in fabric defect detection, which is traditionally done by the human workforce by individually analyzing each piece of fabric to understand its quality. Manual detection might take a lot of time and AI will make the process quicker with fewer intrusions. Since the quality of the fabric is significant for maintaining industry value, it is better not to compromise it..AI in Pattern Making.Pattern cutting and pattern making is a crucial process in the textile industry in which fabrics are cut according to the design and they make different patterns on the fabric. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is an AI subset that enables computerized pattern making. Here, designers can make the basic structure of patterns and digitize them. CAD is used in cutting patterns where it provides 3-D images of the fabric and designs which makes visualization easier..Supply Chain Management and Merchandising.AI can be used to automate transportation and packaging in textile industries. Supply chain management is important to manage the smooth flow of materials between retailers and manufacturers. Good supply chain management demands huge storage spaces, better warehouse management, product segregation, and better communication. AI can provide all these benefits through robotics, RPA, machine learning, IoT, and other technologies..Merchandising is yet another space that can leverage AI to analyze and process data chunks, personalize customer experiences, track customer behaviour, and predict market trends. AI-enabled technologies like data analytics, NLP, and virtual assistants ensure effective communication between manufacturers, production endpoints, retailers and consumers..Smart Apparel and More.The future textile industry will leverage AI to develop more innovations like smart clothing. Smart apparels have sensors and integrated technology which monitor our body and health condition through biometrics. Further, this technology will help in self-detecting irregularities in heart rates, and consistent monitoring can even help diagnose heart-related diseases. Intelligent clothes can benefit the sports and fitness industry by tracking training progress, monitoring physical state, predicting injuries and helping people analyse their health in near future..The future of the textile and fashion industry seems bright with AI in place. AI can increase productivity, help in fibre identification, safer working conditions, demand forecasting and more. A Forbes article on the fashion industry says, &quot;Increasingly, fashion brands are using AI and machine learning to maximize users' shopping experience, improve the efficiency of sales systems through intelligent automation, and enhance the sales processes using predictive analytics and guided sales processes.&quot;.AI will have a huge role to play in redefining the textile industry in the coming years, by enhancing business growth and introducing sustainable fashion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
