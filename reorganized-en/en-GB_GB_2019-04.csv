But that’s not the only way they use AI technology to enhance the buying and selling experience on their site. Devin Wenig, eBay President and CEO wrote in 2016, “I believe that commerce, in particular, will be the focus of some of the most immediate and exciting applications of AI.” If recent developments are any indication, eBay is jockeying to be the industry leader for AI implementations in online e-commerce. 








The Amazing Ways eBay Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Boost Business Success

20+ Years of Data 
With an estimated 179 million active buyers, 1.2 billion live listings and tens of millions of sellers across 190 markets, eBay is where the world goes shopping. The company was founded in 1995 and since then has played an important role in creating “an inclusive and accessible commerce platform.” With numerous acquisitions and technology advances over the years, eBay is one of the world’s top 10 e-commerce companies and hired Jan Pedersen, formerly of Twitter and Microsoft, as vice president and chief scientist, artificial intelligence in 2018. The company used two decades of data and customer behavior insights to train its AI algorithms. These algorithms continue to get smarter every time a buyer and seller interact on the platform.  
How eBay Uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
eBay uses artificial intelligence in personalization, search, insights, discovery and its recommendation systems along with computer vision, translation, natural language processing and more. They take a four-pronged approach with artificial intelligence: “improve the customer experience, build and deploy the right infrastructure for the unique needs of eBay, apply core AI and domain AI science to all that we do, and ensure everything is done in service of the customer experience.” 
PROMOTED
Here are a few specific examples of how they use artificial intelligence. 
Improve the buyer experience: AI-powered tools anticipate the needs of buyers, recommends items and inspires shoppers. With fine-tuned personalization abilities, the site tries to make the shopping experience customized to the needs of every shopper. A part of this was introducing Interests, the ability for shoppers to personalize their shopping experience based on their passions and styles. 
Enhance search: eBay uses AI to understand the context of a search and then provide a full spectrum of relevant products. With computer vision, the company was able to add image search to its capabilities and made camera phones e-commerce devices to allow buyers to use images as a search query. As part of the app, artificial intelligence will help shoppers find items similar to the one they were looking at. 
Platform as a service: eBay provides the cutting-edge AI-powered tools for sellers so they don’t have to and to level the playing field for sellers who would never be able to compete with others who had this technology. Data, metrics and analytics information is managed on the platform and can be used by the seller. 
Optimize pricing and selling: Machine learning can help sellers identify the best prices, when they should list a specific product and when to market themselves to better attract buyers. 
Machine translation: Languages are no barrier between buyer and seller on eBay thanks to the company’s machine translation capabilities. It’s so good that the time to process orders for international clients has reduced significantly. 
Advertisement engine: Promoted listings on eBay and advertisements off the site are all powered by AI algorithms to improve the purchase journey and help buyers discover more of eBay’s inventory. 
Leverage deep learning: While eBay has used AI for the past decade, there were still complex problems they were unable to solve. With the advances in deep learning, the company has been able to scale to larger and more complex data sets which ultimately allows them to process billions of data points and make their services even better. 
Augmented reality to simplify shipping: Finding the optimal box for shipping your item just became easier with eBay’s augmented reality technology on their app. This feature allows you to place a real-world item into a virtual shipping box. 
All of this investment in artificial intelligence is good for eBay’s business as well. AI is driving incremental sales “north of $1 billion per quarter” according to Tom Pinckney, VP of applied research at eBay. That helped the company record a net income of $763 million for the fourth quarter of 2018.  Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",The Amazing Ways eBay Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Boost Business Success,Enterprise & Cloud,The Amazing Ways eBay Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Boost Business Success,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionOver the course of several decades, the use of computational approaches for medical applications has increased steadily. In specialities which focus on image analysis for medical diagnostics such as radiology and pathology, considerable effort has been put towards the development of algorithms that can assist the clinician in image interpretation for diagnosis, prognostication, and production of clinical reports.1 Advances in machine learning approaches have given rise to powerful learning algorithms, collectively termed artificial intelligence (AI). A subset of AI platforms using deep learning approaches have developed powerful capabilities in specific domains as demonstrated by achievements in the games of chess, shogi, and Go, amongst other.2,3 The success of deep learning in these domains has stimulated intense interest in the development and application of intelligent systems for real-world applications in many fields, including health care. In recent years, various groups have published reports of deep learning applications for fields such as medicine,4 radiology,5,6,7,8 dermatology9,10 ophthalmology,11 and pathology.12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 In diagnostic fields such as radiology and pathology, AI carries the potential to transform the clinical practice of physicians. In pathology specifically, AI-based diagnostic platforms may perform image analysis for tissue histology, analyse molecular outputs from diagnostic tests such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), and integrate these with clinical and/or radiological characteristics to improve the predictive and prognostic power of traditional pathology approaches.24,25The perspectives of practising clinicians and diagnosticians on the integration of AI into medical practice are poorly understood. This is especially true in pathology, where only recently has a whole slide imaging system produced by Philips been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).26 Given the possibility that AI systems will become integrated into diagnostic pathology, we felt it was timely and important to begin evaluating and understanding the attitudes, opinions, and feelings of practising pathologists and trainees around this technology. Differences in physician perspectives across specialties and other demographic parameters could directly impact the rate and effectiveness of implementation, and better clarifying these will help to ensure the priorities of all stakeholders are considered. Specifically, pathologists’ concerns about impacts on job security, ability to adapt to novel technologies, and impact on clinical and research careers can be more effectively addressed by hospitals and pathology departments if they are well understood. To this end, we performed an online survey of pathologist colleagues on topics regarding incorporation of AI into clinical practice, its impact on research, and pathologists’ projections for the future of pathology training and teaching.ResultsRespondent demographicsSurvey responses were collected from a total of 487 respondents in 59 countries (Fig. 1a). The majority of respondents practiced in Canada (119, 24.9%), USA (106, 22.2%), and the UK (50, 10.5%). Respondent age was spread over a wide range of age groups, with most frequent age group being 30–35 (97, 20.0%), and relatively smaller numbers below the age of 30 (45, 9.30%) and over the age of 66 (25, 5.2%) (Fig. 1b). We received a slightly increased number of male respondents (260, 53.7%) compared to female respondents (223, 46.1%). 23.7% of respondents reported having practiced less than 5 years, 19.3% between 6 and 10 years, and relatively fewer respondents had practiced for longer periods of time (Fig. 1d). Most respondents were practicing pathologists (241, 49.6%) or residents/fellows (124, 25.5%). While a minority of respondents answered “Other” (31, 6.4%), some of the responses included positions that could be grouped with “practicing pathologist”. Most respondent specialties were reported as general pathology, anatomic pathology, neuropathology, or multiple sites/other. Most were academic pathologists (342, 70.5%), relatively fewer were community pathologists (103, 21.2%), and the remaining practiced within other settings including government, military, or industry. Respondents were overall more likely to come from larger practices, with most coming from groups with >25 members (148, 30.5%), and relatively fewer from smaller practices with only 29 (6.0%) from groups of 21–25, 52 (10.7%) from groups of 16–20, 83 (17.1%) from groups of 11–15, 100 (20.6%) from groups of 5–10, and 67 (13.8%) from groups of less than 5. Respondent results are summarized below, and select graphical depictions can be found in Fig. 2.Fig. 1Demographic data of survey respondents. a City of pathology practice/training of all survey respondents (473 responses, 14 skipped), (Maps data ©2018 Google). b Age distribution of survey respondents (484 responses, 3 skipped). c Gender demographic of respondents (484 responses, 3 skipped). d Years of pathology practice (including training) of survey respondents (481 responses, 6 skipped). e Reported positions held by survey respondents.

Overall, concerns about displacement and negative career impacts were limited; many felt AI would not impact employability (184, 38.0%) or would create new positions and increase employment prospects (205, 42.4%). A smaller number reported being concerned (85, 17.6%) or extremely concerned (10, 2.1%) that AI-tools would displace human jobs. Most respondents did not feel AI-tools would impact compensation (317, 65.6%), though a minority felt compensation would be negatively impacted (80, 16.6%). Overall, many respondents predicted integration of AI into diagnostic workflow within the next five years (191, 39.8%) or ten years (196, 40.8%), with the remaining predicting implementation within 15 years (51, 10.6%) or greater than 20 years (23, 4.8%). Regarding impacts of AI-tool implementation on relationships with colleagues, most respondents either felt that use of AI-tools would not impact the way they were viewed by colleagues (210, 43.6%), or that their adoption of new technology would be welcomed (197, 40.9%). A minority felt that implementation would have a negative impact on the way they were viewed by colleagues (75, 15.6%). Regarding feelings about patient perspectives, most believed patients would have no opinion (246, 51.0%) or would be excited about its use (140, 29.1%).Perspectives on clinical implications of AI-tool useMany respondents felt that with appropriate training, AI tools could increase (280, 58.0%) or even dramatically increase (66, 13.7%) diagnostic efficiency. A relatively smaller cohort felt efficiency would not be impacted (30, 6.2%), would be negatively impacted (4, 0.8%), or were unsure of impact on efficiency (103, 21.3%). Despite these positive attitudes towards AI tools, most respondents still felt that diagnostic decision making should remain a predominantly human task (231, 48.3%), or shared equally with an AI algorithm (121, 25.3%), while a smaller percentage felt that AI-tools should take a dominant role (97, 20.3%). Similarly, regarding the possibility of machine error, many respondents acknowledged concerns about the possibility of unpredictable results or artefact-related errors. Relatively few respondents did not feel concerned about AI-tool errors (119, 24.8%), or believed AI error rates would be lower compared to humans (48, 10.0%). Overall, a majority of pathologists felt that the use of AI-tools combined with human inputs for generation of diagnostic reports would help to decrease the rates of reporting errors (256, 53.0%). When asked about the role of AI-tools in quality assurance (QA) initiatives at their institutions, many felt AI would provide an additional level of QA (330, 68.6%), while relatively fewer felt AI-tools would have no impact on QA (120, 25.0%). Finally, in terms of medico-legal responsibility for diagnostic errors made by a human/AI combination, opinions ranged considerably, with 209 (43.7%) believing the platform vendor and pathologist should be held equally liable, 240 (50.2%) believing responsibility remained primarily that of the human, and finally 29 (6.1%) agreeing that the platform vendor should primarily be liable. These relatively split opinions suggest this still needs to be authoritatively resolved before the introduction of these tools into clinical practice.Perspectives on impacts of AI-tools on research and trainee developmentA large percentage of respondents were supportive of implementation of AI into their practices if it resulted in an increase in time spent on academic or research pursuits (448, 93.3%), compared to a minority who were not (11, 2.3%), or were unsure/other response (21, 4.4%). Nearly half of respondents anticipate that the implementation of AI will permit increased research productivity and allow pathologists to answer questions that were previously not possible (259, 53.6%), while a smaller number felt there would be no impact (99, 20.5%) or a negative impact (6, 1.24%). With respect to impacts on trainee education, many respondents felt training duration would decrease (30, 6.24%), while many others felt training duration would increase (49, 10.2%), or with the addition of training in informatics during residency/fellowship (344, 71.5%). A significant number felt that they would need to dedicate more time to training residents given an expanded tool set (119, 24.7%), with a smaller number agreeing that teaching responsibilities would decrease due to improved teaching efficiency (47, 9.8%). Interestingly, with regards to impact on clinical skills or trainees and practitioners, responses were mixed, with some respondents expressing concern that AI tools would erode pathologists’ skill (126, 26.1%), while others felt AI tools would enhance development of ‘traditional skills’ (101, 21.0%), or would not affect clinical skills (164, 34.0%).Perspectives on implementation of AI-toolsViews on the setting in which AI-tools will be used varied, with some believing AI will be used primarily in academic settings (199, 41.3%), while the remaining majority believing usage would be similar in community and academic practices (174, 36.1%). With regards to ease of uptake and implementation, many respondents felt that AI tools will be relatively intuitive with little need for training (109, 22.7%), while others felt training from a platform representative would be of help (202, 41.1%), or a dedicated course/workshop would be necessary (139, 29.0%). This is a relatively important finding among the overwhelmingly positive respondents and signals a need for more educational resources and conferences for physician education. Relatively few believed lack of knowledge regarding AI would a pose significant difficulty (25, 5.2%), or would be an absolute barrier to implementation (5, 1.0%). In terms of preparation, many respondents had exposure to some research in the area, with 123 (25.6%) having attended/read 1-2 talks/papers on the subject, 3–5 (101, 21.0%), 5–10 (73, 15.2%), or rarely greater than 25 (45, 9.4%).Statistically significant associationsApplication of Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) testing revealed a number of statistically significant associations between respondent demographic characteristics and perspectives on application of AI tools in pathology. Our testing demonstrated that compared to females, male respondents carry a more optimistic outlook on integration of AI into practice (D = 0.26, n = 259, p < 0.001), and are more likely to adopt before formal validation/support attained (D = 0.27, n = 221, p < 0.001). This interest amongst male respondents could be correlated with their reported expectation that AI could improve cost-effectiveness (D = 0.12, n = 221, p < 0.01), personal efficiency (D = 0.11, n = 221, p < 0.01), and quality assurance (D = 0.17, n = 164, p < 0.001). Males also reported subjectively feeling more comfortable with adopting the technology (D = 0.15, n = 219, p < 0.001); and believed patients could become excited about AI-diagnostics with educational sessions (D = 0.15, n = 220, p < 0.001). Men were additionally more inclined to shift balance of slide interpretation towards AI-tools (D = 0.11, n = 219, p < 0.02), were more optimistic errors would become less frequent with implementation of a highly skilled independent AI tool (D = 0.19, n = 166, p < 0.001), and more likely to feel using AI tools would garner respect from colleagues (D = 0.15, n = 221, p < 0.001). Compared to community pathologists, academic pathologists were more optimistic about AI-tool integration (D = 0.14, n = 100, p < 0.001), more likely to adopt before formal validation/support attained (D = 0.25, n = 98, p < 0.001), and more likely to anticipate cost-effectiveness (D = 0.14, n = 101, p < 0.05), and quality assurance (D = 0.19, n = 83, p < 0.01). We did not find a significant difference between the distribution of male and female respondents in this later analysis to account for these differences (χ2 test, p = 0.33). When respondents were grouped into age over and under 40 years of age, respondents over 40 years old were more optimistic errors would become less frequent with implementation of a highly skilled independent (D = 0.12, n = 150, p < 0.05) or assistant AI tool (D = 0.13, n = 159, p < 0.01). Respondents over 40 predicted earlier integration of AI tools into their personal practice (D = 0.16, n = 196, p < 0.001), and pathology practice more broadly (D = 0.13, n = 197, p < 0.01). This result was somewhat unexpected and we believe it is confounded by the increased number of older respondents being male (66% (male) vs 49% (female) χ2 test, P < 0.001). Finally, given strong representation from British, American, and Canadian pathologists, we performed subgroup comparisons between these three countries. The only significant finding was that of slightly increased interest in AI technologies amongst US respondents compared to Canadian (D = 0.19, n = 114, p < 0.001), and somewhat reduced concern about potential job displacement from US respondents compared to Canadian (D = 0.16, n = 114, p < 0.01). Comparison of trainee responses (resident, fellow) to practicing respondents (staff pathologists, site directors, and department heads) failed to find significant differences. Similarly, subgroup comparisons between generalists (general pathology, anatomic pathology) and subspecialty pathologists (neuropathology, cardiovascular pathology, etc.) did not find significant associations or differences.DiscussionThis survey was developed to begin gauging the pathology community’s perceptions, level of understanding, concerns, and opinions on the emerging use of AI in pathology practice, research, and training. To our knowledge, this is the largest published survey of the international pathology community of its kind. We do however acknowledge the shortcomings of the survey approach used in this study. In distributing this voluntary and anonymous survey by the methods described, it is not possible to calculate a survey response rate, or quantify non-response bias in our data. Certainly, the possibility that respondents are more likely than non-respondents to hold strong opinions or emotions on this issue is a real one, and should be considered. As a further limitation, respondents to our survey almost universally practice in North America and Europe, and so the perspectives of South American, African, and Australasian pathologists are significantly under-represented. Additionally, we appreciate that specific wording of some our survey questions have the potential to bias or polarize results to some degree. Several questions attempted to gauge respondents’ levels of excitement or concern, rather than dispassionately quantifying respondent’s predictions or perceptions of the likelihood of various scenarios (e.g., question 23: “Are you concerned that AI will eventually replace pathologists”). We used questions of this nature because we were interested in clearly identifying the emotional reactions and outlook of pathologists on AI, given extensive conversations in both media and academic literature about impacts of this technology on diagnostic specialties. However, we recognize that quantification of emotional reactions or outlook are not surrogate objective measures of pathologist’s predictions about implementation scenarios for AI in pathology. Our inability to definitively confirm the authenticity of respondents to our survey is an additional limitation (common to many large-scale surveys of this kind), and is acknowledged. Finally, while we did utilize KS analysis to evaluate differences in perspectives amongst our respondent demographic subgroups, we appreciate that these differences are likely to be fluid, and to change considerably as technologies evolve.The common prediction of a relatively short interval to implementation of these tools suggests that early and pre-emptive measures to facilitate smooth implementation may be of significant value for forward-thinking pathology departments. For example, many respondents believe AI-tools will become useful for improvement of QA initiatives, suggesting a need to delineate how these technologies should be formally validated and adopted. Respondents frequently agreed that some education and training, either from an industry representative (41.1%) or through a dedicated course/workshop (29.0%) would help to facilitate safe and efficient adoption. Early efforts to implement educational presentations and formalized workshops may help to ease anxiety, increase awareness, and hopefully permit valuable pathologist-input into design and integration approaches. From a marketing perspective, these data suggest that platform developers will need to focus on demonstrating efficacy and safety of their technology, with little need to persuade pathologists that AI is a useful tool for their practices.Several important concerns were raised by respondents in the comment sections (see Supplementary File 2). One important point raised by several respondents is that of limited utilization of digital pathology workflows in many institutions around the world. Digitized image data forms the basic informational input for AI-histology tools, and is a requisite for their use. Commonly cited barriers to integration of digital pathology include prohibitive cost analyses, perceived lack of impact on patient outcome, regulatory barriers, and reticence of pathologists due to concerns surrounding comfort, speed, and efficacy of digital systems.27 Even for institutions with digital pathology platforms, technical limitations such as lack of 3D whole slide scanners (many rely on 2D planar scanners), image variability between scanning devices, and technical artefacts may present additional hurdles.28 Interestingly, if AI diagnostic platforms can be shown to robustly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency for patients and hospitals, the elimination of these technical barriers (ie. implementation of a digital pathology platform) may become an expectation for any hospital committed to delivering world-class health care to its patients.The legal implications of AI platforms in medicine, both from a regulatory and malpractice standpoint were a frequent theme amongst respondents. Considerable regulatory legislation can be expected to arise if a non-experimental AI-histology tool were brought to market, which may have implications for tool development and implementation. Additional concerns about attribution of medico-legal responsibility for errors occurring in AI-assisted workflows were raised, with some respondents concerned that platform vendors would not be held appropriately responsible for errors caused by their technology. Historically, a significant number of pathology errors precipitating malpractice suits have been those made in the analytic phase (i.e., false positive and false negative diagnoses), which conceivably could be both intercepted, and caused by AI-tool contributions.29 Regarding this issue, nearly half of respondents believed that pathology errors made in cases with AI-platform contributions, both pathologist and vendor should be held equally liable and a small minority even believed that the vendor alone should be responsible. The remaining half felt that responsibility should remain solely with the pathologist. Approaches to both regulatory and medicolegal aspects of AI-tool implementation remain unclear. Perhaps the most instructive legal precedents for these issues will be found in the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles, where lawmakers, industry representatives, and the public are working through the legal implications of self-driving technologies.30Examining our data in retrospect, there are a number of important questions which should be considered by future investigators performing surveys of a similar nature. Understanding the perspectives of pathologists on how reimbursement schemas should adapt to the implementation of AI-based tools is of considerable importance to all stakeholders in the field. Designing questions to achieve insight into which individuals or demographic groups would be most likely to be early adaptors of these tools could focus attention on these groups, and ensure that ‘early experiences’ are captured and evaluated for broader benefit of the community. Surveying pathologists more specifically on how AI-tools could be integrated into their personal clinical practice would highlight areas of focus for developers and hospitals. Finally, the evolution of the relationship between histopathology and AI tools may be informed heavily by the availability of pathologists in a particular region or institution. For example, a 2017–2018 workforce census in the UK has identified staff shortages as a critical concern,31 and thoroughly investigating perspectives of providers in these practice settings on how AI tools relate to these challenges would be valuable. Of note, subgroup differences were not identified between UK pathologists and their North American counterparts in our survey data.In conclusion, we present a survey of pathology colleagues around the world from a variety of demographic and practice backgrounds. While we identified some differences in perspectives depending on age, gender, and practice type, there appears to be general enthusiasm amongst respondents for the use of AI as a diagnostic tool in pathology practice, and concern about impacts on job security is relatively low. Most respondents envision the eventual implementation of AI-tools as decision support tools used by human diagnosticians, not in place of. Several concerns about technological barriers, especially limited current day usage of digital pathology platforms in many centres, and concerns about AI tool errors and medico-legal responsibility were raised, suggesting that these will require further attention before effective implementation can be achieved.MethodsAnalytical methodsAn anonymized survey consisting of 43 questions was created using the online SurveyMonkey tool (https://www.surveymonkey.com) (Supplementary File 1). Pathologists listed as faculty members on Canadian university websites were invited by email to complete the survey. Given limited response using this approach, we created a generic link and requested it be shared amongst pathologists at pathology departments throughout Canada. We additionally shared the survey on the Twitter platform, at meeting presentations, and on the popular neuropathology blog (http://neuropathologyblog.blogspot.com/). Further, we contacted 95 pathology associations worldwide to request distribution of our survey to their membership, of which the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), Association for Pathology Informatics (API), and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) agreed to distribute the survey. These efforts to achieve maximal distribution resulted in a final survey respondent count of 487 individuals. All responses were obtained voluntarily (i.e., not institutionally enforced) from professional colleagues and anonymized (de-identified, aggregated, and tabulated) prior to analysis. This study, therefore, met the exclusion criteria of the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement for research necessitating a review by an institutional research ethics board. Survey results were tallied for each question and described as an aggregate percentage result for reporting and discussion. Two sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov testing was performed to estimate statistically significant associations between demographic parameters (age, gender, practice type, and career stage) and patterns of responses.32

",,,,,,"{'headline': 'Physician perspectives on integration of artificial intelligence into diagnostic pathology', 'description': 'Advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) carry the potential to make significant contributions to health care, particularly in diagnostic specialties such as radiology and pathology. The impact of these technologies on physician stakeholders is the subject of significant speculation. There is however a dearth of information regarding the opinions, enthusiasm, and concerns of the pathology community at large. Here, we report results from a survey of 487 pathologist-respondents practicing in 54 countries, conducted to examine perspectives on AI implementation in clinical practice. Despite limitations, including difficulty with quantifying response bias and verifying identity of respondents to this anonymous and voluntary survey, several interesting findings were uncovered. Overall, respondents carried generally positive attitudes towards AI, with nearly 75% reporting interest or excitement in AI as a diagnostic tool to facilitate improvements in workflow efficiency and quality assurance in pathology. Importantly, even within the more optimistic cohort, a significant number of respondents endorsed concerns about AI, including the potential for job displacement and replacement. Overall, around 80% of respondents predicted the introduction of AI technology in the pathology laboratory within the coming decade. Attempts to identify statistically significant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, type/place of practice) predictive of attitudes towards AI using Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) testing revealed several associations. Important themes which were commented on by respondents included the need for increasing efforts towards physician training and resolving medical-legal implications prior to the generalized implementation of AI in pathology.', 'datePublished': '2019-04-26T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2019-04-26T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '7', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0106-0', 'keywords': ['Health care', 'Health occupations', 'Medicine/Public Health', 'general', 'Biomedicine', 'Biotechnology'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-019-0106-0/MediaObjects/41746_2019_106_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-019-0106-0/MediaObjects/41746_2019_106_Fig2_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'npj Digital Medicine', 'issn': ['2398-6352'], 'volumeNumber': '2', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Nature Publishing Group UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Shihab Sarwar', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Anglin Dent', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Kevin Faust', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Maxime Richer', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Ugljesa Djuric', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Randy Van Ommeren', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7948-7530', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'randy.vanommeren@mail.utoronto.ca', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Phedias Diamandis', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5291-9068', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'University Health Network', 'address': {'name': 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Department of Pathology, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'p.diamandis@mail.utoronto.ca', '@type': 'Person'}], 'isAccessibleForFree': True, '@type': 'ScholarlyArticle'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Logistics in the military encompasses more functions than most people realize. In modern warfare, that means large quantities of data to sift through in order to make decisions regarding supply, transport, communications, and so on. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in one or more areas in logistics could help speed up that process and make it more agile. Although AI and ML could have great benefits for military logistics, the military has focused on AI and ML applications in other areas. The military has been slow on the uptake, and it often accepts an amber status for its logistics in active war zones. However, integrating AI for logistics in the military comes with its attendant concerns, although they are not the same as those when using AI for surveillance, intelligence, or weapons. The issues with AI for logistics have to do with inherent unpredictability and vulnerability to exploitation. Data scientists and engineers are making great progress in AI and ML with impressive results, but it is far from foolproof. This lack of certainty has until recently prevented more enthusiastic employment of available AI and ML solutions. A directive requiring all AI-based systems to have a human overseer or operator at all times should mitigate, but not eliminate, the specter of compromised and dangerous technology.   That said, the fact that the biggest adversaries of the US are aggressively pursuing the use of AI and ML in their own defense systems, and that these same systems face the same risks and vulnerabilities, might present unique opportunities for the Department of Defense (DoD) to level the playing field, so to speak. Be that as it may, the DoD is addressing the issue of using AI for logistics in the US military, spearheaded by the newly formed Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). The authors of the “Summary Of The 2018 Department Of Defense Artificial Intelligence Strategy” point out that “Other nations, particularly China and Russia, are making significant investments in AI for military purposes…The  United States, together with its allies and partners, must adopt AI to maintain its  strategic position, prevail on future battlefields, and safeguard this order.” This article will run through some of the areas in logistics where AI is either in pilot mode or in active operation. The areas for discussion will include: Preventive maintenance Cloud services Supply chain management Medical aid Driverless resupply We begin our analysis with a discussion of preventative maintenance. Preventive Maintenance JAIC director Air Force Lt. Gen. John N.T. “Jack” Shanahan stated, “we want to identify some smart automation initiatives that could provide near-term dividends in terms of increased efficiencies and effectiveness for back-office functions.” One important AI logistic initiative under JAIC is preventive maintenance, particularly for fighter jets. An early version of automated preventive maintenance for the military was the F-35 fighter jet test performed byLockheed Martin back in 2015. Below is a 2:50-minute video showing the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) at work:  There is no mention of AI or ML, but Air Force Chief Scientist Gregory Zachariasconfirmed AI is the driving force behind the “smart” system. The system will probably get a lot “smarter,” probably with supportive AI software from defense contractor C3.ai. The AI company currently has nine projects with the DoD. The military uses ALIS and, potentially, the C3 AI Suite for aircraft. However, if the pilot programs prove successful in the long term, the military might easily customize these and similar technologies to accrue the same benefits for other types of vehicles and equipment. We recently posted a more in-depth article on predictive analytics in the military for these other uses. Cloud Services A central repository of information might sound like a bad idea for the military, but in the world of logistics, it is necessary. It means savings in time, effort, and money if logisticians have all the information they need to make informed decisions when moving supplies and equipment to support troops. In line with this, the Army contracted IBM to provide cloud services as well as access to Watson to store and process logistics data coming from various sources. Logistics Support Activity, or LOGSA, (now Logistics Data Analysis Center or LDCA) Commander John Kuenzli stated in 2017: Capabilities like Watson make it a very exciting time for us. This can be a way to free up our analysts from some of the more technical work, to let the machine do some of that and to leverage the analysts’ professional expertise to look up and look further toward where the Army is going. The idea is to use the cloud to upload sensor data from vehicles and equipment and perform “conditioned-based maintenance (CBM),” which is a repair-when-needed approach, made possible with AI-driven data analysis. Below is a 4-minute proof of concept video on 360 Stryker combat vehicles from IBM:  While the idea of CBM falls under preventive maintenance, the bigger picture in this particular use of AI is in the move of military data into the cloud. According to DoD Chief Information officer Dana Deasy, data access is the key to effective warfare today. He explained: One of the things traditional computing has always had a problem with is the warfighter sitting out on the tactical edge, [with the] cloud sitting [elsewhere]. Now imagine a world where we can take that compute power with new applications on top of it, and put the cloud right into the hands of the tactical fighter on the edge. That’s why the cloud is so important to us. In 2019, that early initiative has bloomed into a multi-billion single-provider contract for secure cloud storage and software under the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) with several commercial companies vying for it. Unfortunately, legal problems are keeping the DoD from going forward with it. Supply Chain Management The government can also become a victim of fraud as much as any civilian, and perhaps more so because of the sheer volume of its acquisitions worth about $350 billion a year. For the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), this is a big problem, as it provides what the military needs, such as weapons, repair parts, and fuel, as well as disposes of surplus equipment. As the DLA receives an average of a million bids a day, it can be fatally easy for some questionable transactions to get through. To address this issue, the DLA turned to AI and ML software to sort through the mountain of private and public data to identify and flag suspicious or anomalous suppliers. DLA Logistics Operations Vice Director Michael Scott claimed its Business Decision Analytics (BDA) tool has made a big difference. In 5 months of operations: It has identified more than 350 high-risk CAGE codes or supplier entities. It’s probably one of our top concerns right now from a process perspective is the rise in the number of fraudulent or bad actor companies who are trying to get into our business. This new tool has been very helpful in identifying that from the onset and allowing us to put controls in our systems to not allow them to get business from DLA. It is unclear if the DLA developed the BDA tool in-house or contracted it out to one of several infotech and AI companies awarded contracts under the J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) program. Medical Aid Immediate medical aid is not always available on the battlefield. It may be a lack of actual medics in the area, injuries beyond the skills of a medic, or a matter of triage, where medical personnel prioritize the most badly injured. AI might possibly provide some answers in that area of logistics. AI in medicine is a well-established field in the commercial sector, but not so much in the military. Efforts are underway to correct this imbalance, with the Army’s Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) heading the charge. The TATRC recently awarded Charles River Analytics with a contract to develop an AI system that would monitor, diagnose, and treat victims of traumatic injury in the battlefield. Dubbed the Automated Ruggedized Combat Casualty Care (ARC3) system, it will not be a fully automated medical AI, but rather software that can help medics in diagnosing injuries, monitoring patients, and providing treatment when immediate evacuation of the patient is not possible. The system is currently under development. Charles River also snagged a contract to develop the Ensemble Prediction for Combat Casualty Care (EPIC3) mobile app. The idea is to provide the medic with some decision support when it comes to handling traumatic injury. In its award, Charles River stated it “uses an ensemble of classifiers, frequently tuned via machine learning to predict life-threatening and difficult-to-detect injuries. EPIC3 purportedly presents the steps to treat those injuries through a simple, easy-to-use interface that tailors itself to the needs and skill level of the user.” This software is under development as well. AthenaGTX claimed it is in its final stages of based development for its Automated Critical Care System (ACCS). The company described it as a “system of systems” that “integrate patient physiological monitoring with interventions controlled by software algorithms to provide automatic medical care of critically injured warfighters.” Below is a 49-second video of what it will look like:  The company also has a wearable device it claimed could help in battlefield triage. Called the Wireless Vital Signs Monitor (WVSM), it records the vitals of a patient and transmits it to compatible devices. There is no record that either of these products were developed under funding from the military, however. Driverless Resupply Drones are making a lot of noise in the AI space, but mostly for surveillance. What most people probably do not realize is that the military is looking seriously at self-driving vehicles to resupply outposts and bases under the Autonomous Ground Resupply program. This would spare human drivers from the hardships and risks of a supply convoy. The army already awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to Robotic Research LLC to develop autonomous kits. Below are two short videos showing what a driverless supply would look like:   However, sometimes it is better to go as the crow flies, and the Army Research Laboratory is also looking into using aerial drones instead of land vehicles under the Joint Tactical Aerial Resupply Vehicle (JTARV). Of course, the loads would have to be much less, but it could get to places quicker than a ground vehicle could. To this end, the military is working with Malloy Aeronautics to use its quadcopter (“hoverbike”) as the first JTARV. The ideal JTARV would be able to carry up to 800 pounds, go as fast as 60 mph, and for up to 125 miles. Below is a 4:25-minute video showing the capabilities of the US Military Hoverbike Prototype 2017.  As researchers acquire a better understanding of how AI and ML work, the use case of AI for logistics may become more robust. Until then, the military could still reap the benefits of AI and ML if it ensures the security and safety of its software and data.   Header Image Credit: Department of Defense Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Artificial Intelligence in the Chinese Military - Current InitiativesThe Chinese military, or People's Liberation Army, is focusing heavily on artificial intelligence.

A recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco showed that the U.S. labor market is ""at or beyond its full potential."" While that might be good news for the economy, it's not for the tech companies still out there, searching desperately for qualified talent.Related: 4 Ways Artificial Intelligence Boosts Workforce ProductivityResearch firm Korn Ferry predicted that companies in technology, media and telecom will face a talent shortage of 1.1 million by 2020. By 2030, that number will grow to 4.3 million, the report said; and the result will be intense competition for a dwindling pool of tech professionals. The same survey showed that insufficient staff is already holding back digital transformation at 54 percent of companies surveyed.



Skilled coders, of course, won't materialize out of thin air. So, instead of hoping that traditional recruiting tactics will solve their mounting talent shortage, companies should consider a new approach -- one that looks for alternatives to the human talent companies will always need but may have to struggle mightily to find. That approach: artificial intelligence.When AI is a human equivalentI've seen the effects of talent shortages firsthand during my career in app development. It's something my own company has struggled with, in fact. Unfortunately, I think the outlook is even worse than the numbers imply.


The university pipeline is not graduating nearly enough knowledge workers to fill even the present demand. Last year, there were more than a half million unfilled computer-related jobs, and relying on foreign-born workers has not been the best option due to tougher immigration restrictions.What if instead of trying to recruit a recent graduate who commands a six-figure salary, you could rely on technology to do the job? Artificial intelligence has advanced to the point that it can emulate the output of knowledge workers, not just perform repetitive manual labor.Related: A VC Perspective - How Valid Is the Threat of Artificial Intelligence on the Job Market?Already, we are seeing AI that can handle coding on its own. You identify an objective, and the program then autonomously develops a framework, generates code and finds the ideal mixture of APIs and SDKs. AI might not be able to replace a human coder entirely, but it can already increase his or her productivity.


As the talent pool dwindles, AI can pick up the slack and replace the talent that could not otherwise be replaced. It's not a panacea for all staffing problems, but it just may help you boost your efficiency and productivity, cut time to market and improve product quality -- all without your having to make new hires.AI and the future of workTech is not the only industry figuring out how to use AI to remain relevant and productive moving forward. Self-driving trucks, for example, promise to eliminate hazards from the road, delays from delivery schedules and the challenges companies experience in finding qualified drivers. That said, even industries that were not formerly considered technology-based are becoming just that.Fast food is such an example of industries now adopting new technology. Turnover in that food industry is high, but robots in the kitchen will never choose to leave. For example, I work with a company that is developing a robotic arm and sensor system that can cook the perfect burger with complete consistency. Robotic cooks mean smaller kitchens, lower labor costs and more affordable food prices for everyone. Because of this, these robotic cooks can support human ones without eliminating them.While we shouldn't expect to see robots walking through the office any time soon, we should embrace AI in all of its forms throughout the workforce. Remember, technology isn't displacing workers -- it's stepping in where labor is needed.


Are you ready to employ AI?Employers should be cautiously optimistic about AI. It may well have a big impact in many places, but that doesn't mean every workflow is ready to be automated. Use these strategies to employ AI where it's most effective in your company:1. Identify your biggest pain points. Know your most persistent problems and how they might be exacerbated by talent shortages. Each department is led by someone who can give insight into what that department needs and where it's hurting. Talk to these employees. Their knowledge and these conversations can serve as the basis for organizational charts, to help your company identify its greatest deficiencies and see how AI systems might cover your biggest unmet needs.An example? Illustrating the possibilities that come from identifying areas in which a company has room to grow, the Associated Press began automating its reporting on earnings rather than having people do that task manually.The result: The press service was able to write 12 times more stories.


2. Analyze job postings to see where you could fill the void. Look at your company's open job postings to see where AI might be able to fill roles for which you can't find qualified candidates.There are more than seven million unfilled positions in the United States right now, which means that a growing company -- or even a stable one -- will naturally need to replace employees who are bouncing to different jobs or those who retire. That said, growing companies are in dire need of more human capital in their offices to stay on a steady path to growth.AI can assist in areas where candidates aren't available. For example, the App Association's 2018 State of the App Economy report revealed that there is just one computer science graduate for every eight available computing jobs. Yikes: Don't suffer shortages like that where you don't have to.By analyzing which roles you have open and which you're struggling to fill, you'll find areas for AI to step in and fill your need.


3. Let AI consultants help you see how automated solutions can fill the gaps. In our case, we went to academics who were actually writing algorithms, white papers and dissertations on this subject. In academia, people have more time to drill down on research and development for their theories and aren't constrained by the need to please stockholders or attain commercial success. They can therefore be key players as you acquire knowledge and eventually adopt AI for your workplace.For example, around 50 people from Carnegie Mellon's robotics lab joined Uber to help that company build self-driving cars. Some of the university's top talent made the move to be a part of the project, providing expertise and insights to the ride-hailing company as it embarked on a new journey with AI.Overall, there will likely be two types of companies in the future: those that adopt AI and use it to become more efficient, and those that choose not to use it, leaving the real possibility they will be left behind. My money is on the prior group, whose people will also have to be adaptive and willing to integrate technology into their workflows.Related: These 5 Companies Have Added Robots to Their Workforce 


In other words, AI solves talent shortages, but that's just the start. This technology is poised to disrupt entrenched industries, redefine consumer expectations and optimize everything you do. It's more than your solution for the future -- AI has already begun ushering in a completely new paradigm.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Human resources has been slower to come to the table with machine learning and artificial intelligence than other fields—marketing, communications, even health care. But the value of machine learning in human resources can now be measured, thanks to advances in algorithms that can predict employee attrition, for example, or deep learning neural networks that are edging toward more transparent reasoning in showing why a particular result or conclusion was made. The value beyond numbers for CEOs and managers is the power in understanding what’s actually happening within a company i.e. with their people. As Glint’s Justin Black articulated in a webinar for the Human Capital Institute (HCI), executives and leaders need information that helps them point people in the right direction; information—sales data, KPIs, etc.—change over time, and machine learning can react faster than people in helping draw out the insights and inferences that might otherwise take reams of manpower or not be uncovered at all. Though not an exhaustive list, below is an outline of solid examples of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications at work in human resources today, along with developing and near-future applications. Current Machine Learning Human Resources Applications Applicant Tracking & Assessment Applicant tracking and assessment has topped the list in early machine learning applications, especially for companies and roles that receive high volumes of applicants. Glint is not an AI company, but they use AI tools to help companies save money and provide a better work experience. Machine learning tools help HR and management personnel hire new team members by tracking a candidate’s journey throughout the interview process and helping speed up the process of getting streamlined feedback to applicants. Peoplise is another solution for helping companies calculate fit score for new talent, combining tools like digital screening and online interview results  to help hiring managers arrive at decisions. While competition for the best people has driven many HR departments to use algorithmic-based assessments, a CEB article on using machine learning to eliminate bias cautions that human oversight is still of paramount importance. It’s not enough to act directly on data insights, but to use this information in tandem with driving question such as:  1) how I can link applicant traits to business outcomes; 2) which outcomes should be our focus when hiring; and 3) can predictions (hiring and otherwise) be made in an unbiased way. Attracting Talent Attracting talent before hiring has also seen an upswing in machine-learning based applications in the past few years. Black, who is Glint’s senior director of Organizational Development, named LinkedIn as an example of a company using one of the most common versions of basic machine learning—recommending jobs. Other job-finding sites, including Indeed, Glassdoor, and Seek use similar algorithms to build interaction maps based on users’ data from previous searches, connections, posts, and clicks. PhenomPeople is one example of a suite of machine learning-based tools that helps lead potential talent to a company’s career site through multiple social media and job search channels. Black notes that this is really just one step past a keyword search, albeit a big step computationally, as there’s a lot more to do. Attrition Detection Understanding people and why they decide to stay at or leave a job is arguably one of the most important questions for HR to answer. Identifying attrition risk calls for advanced pattern recognition in surveying an array of variables. In the earlier mentioned HCI webinar, Black describes a hypothetical situation of identifying specific risk factors based on scores to an employee survey. If a human were to try and detect attrition risk among female engineers in Palo Alto with less than 2 years of tenure, the variance analyses to reach that conclusion are innumerable, like finding a needle in haystack, but machine learning allows us to connect these dots in seconds, freeing HR representatives to spend time supporting teams instead of analyzing data.  Glint’s employee engagement platform Advances in NLP have included the ability to process large amounts of unstructured data, and algorithms can also do things like identify emotional activity in comments and tease out prescriptive comments, or actionable suggestions. Black describes “prototypicality” algorithms that can pull out individual comments that represent the sum of what everyone’s saying, allowing companies to get a broadly inclusive but digestible pulse on company processes and specific issues. JPMorgan is apparently one of several financial institutions that has also put into place algorithms that can survey employee behavior and identify “rogue employees” before any criminal activity takes place, an obviously more insidious form of attrition with dire consequences—watch the interview with Bloomberg Reporter Hugh Son as he discusses these new safeguards with Bloomberg Technology.    Individual Skills Management/Performance Development Machine learning is showing its potential in boosting individual skill management and development. While there is definitely room for growth in this arena, platforms that can give calibrated guidance without human coaches save time and provide the opportunity for more people to grow in their careers and stay engaged. Workday is just one example of a company building personalized training recommendations for employees based on a company’s needs, market trends, and employee specifics. Black elaborates that these types of performance development assessments are useful when actually read, which is why this type of machine-based feedback has been successful for individuals. But this becomes more difficult at the level of the organization, where it’s almost impossible to make sense of enormous amounts of varying data; this is an area where machine learning is evolving, with an increased focus on the overall performance of the corporate lattice. Future Machine Learning Human Resources Applications Enterprise Management As alluded to in the last example, enterprise management and engagement based on machine learning insights is already here in early forms but has yet to be taken to scale.  KPMG promotes its customized “Intelligent Enterprise Approach”, leveraging predictive analytics and big data management to help companies make business decisions that optimize key KPIs and other metrics. re:Work, which provides best workplace practices and ideas from Google and other leading organizations (including KPMG), is an excellent resource for staying up-to-date on new tools and case studies in this space. Google’s People Analytics department has been a pioneer in building performance-management engines at the enterprise level. From an early stage, the team (led by Prasad Setty) posed existing questions—for example, what’s the ideal size for a given team or department—but focused on finding new ways to use data in order to help answer these questions. In turn, People Analytics has helped pave the way for solving fundamental business problems related to the employee life cycle, with a focus on improving “Googlers'” production and overall wellness. As outline by Chris Derose for The Atlantic, over the last half of a decade, the team has produced insights that have led to improvements in company-wide actions, such as: Limiting the number of interviews required for an applicant (more than four didn’t lead to higher quality) Revealing optimal organizational size and department size Better managing of maternity leave (Google saw a 50 percent decrease in defections) Creating on-boarding agenda for an employee’s first four days of work, with increased productivity levels of up to 15 percent Post-Hire Outcome Algorithms CEB notes that the ideal hiring algorithm would predict a post-hire outcome (for example, reducing time taking customer service calls while keeping customer satisfaction high) rather than just matching job requirements with items on an employee’s resume or pre-hire assessment results. The article goes on to note that it’s sometimes the counterintuitive aspects that predict job performance, information that a machine is better at finding through analysis than human inference. For example, CEB describes a model created for a call center representative role that linked call center experience to resulting poor performance. While a link to the source or actual model would be helpful, the idea is interesting and reflects machine learning’s strengths in “invisible” pattern recognition Internal Management When Talent Analytics Chief Scientist Pasha Roberts discussed the role of predictive analytics in human resource management with Emerj in 2016, he brought up the internal movement of employees within a company as an issue unique to HR and analytics. “You can use agent-based modeling to simulate and look at how people can move within a company…and be better able to hire a person at the entry-level that will be likely to move through corporate ladder,” said Roberts. While there are early systems in place, more data over time should lead to a more robust and  scalable model for internal management over the next five years. Increased Behavior Tracking and Data-Based Decision Making  Ben Waber, president and CEO of Humanyze and also a past guest on Emerj, talked about the increasing use of IoT wearable data in the workplace. These types of gadgets are more common at the enterprise level—bluetooth headphones and smart ID badges, for example—and companies are continuing to add sensor technology to the workplace in order to collect data. This is an area that Waber researched while serving as a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab, using data collected from smart badges to look at things like employee dialogue, interaction, networks within a company, where people spent their time, etc. It would seem that privacy might be a concern, but technologies like smart badges are starting to proliferate quickly (with vendors like Atmel, in the below video, introducing new and updated apps for Android phones). This type of data, says Waber, allows us to pose and answer crucial business-driving questions that we couldn’t ask before, such as ‘how much does my sales team talk to my engineering team?’    Things to Keep in Mind: Machine Learning in Human Resources Google People Analytics Lead, Ian O’Keefe,  told a story at the People Analytics & Future of Work conference in January 2016 about his team’s efforts to quantify things like efficiency, effectiveness and employee experience by looking at hiring decisions, team climate, and personal development. In the end, his team found that people armed with better data make better decisions than algorithms alone can do. Well-designed AI applications, says Black, have three main cross functions: main expertise, data science expertise, and design/user experience expertise. At present, very few providers do all three of these well. The best solutions today and in the near future don’t replace humans, but emphasize scaling better decision making with the use of machines as a tool and collaborator. Our survey of machine learning in human resources illuminates the development of a more people-centric approach, paving the way for more more valuable programs and less wasted time; reduced bias in programs; less administration and more individual development; and the ability to act proactively rather than reactively, moving seamlessly from the level of the individual to the organization and back again.   Image credit: Corporate IT Related Posts Machine Learning in Surgical Robotics - 4 Applications That MatterThe application of robotics in surgery has steadily grown since it began in the 1980s.… Machine Learning in the Asian Pharmaceutical Sector - Current ApplicationsMcKinsey estimated that embarking on digital transformation to restructure value chains and drive R&D innovation… Machine Learning in Orthopedics - Current ApplicationsThere are few companies claiming to offer artificial intelligence solutions to orthopedics companies.

Atul Jalan, Founder of Manthan, believes artificial intelligence will change the world like nothing else has so far. In this video interview with YourStory Business Editor Vishal Krishna, he reveals how technology will change the way we look at the normal and why machines will soon dominate man. Vishal Krishna1847 StoriesFriday April 26, 2019 , 4 min ReadSerial entrepreneur Atul Jalan has made a big business out of understanding the problems businesses face and offering specific solutions. The Founder of Manthan, which offers artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics as a service, has authored the book Where Will Man Take Us? The Bold Story of the Man Technology is Creating. He strongly believes that common and fundamental knowledge will forever be challenged by AI. Launched in 2003, Manthan designs prescriptive analytics applications powered by AI on cloud for customer-facing businesses. Aiming to be the 'Chief Analytics Officer' for consumer industries worldwide, its advanced analytics platforms and solutions help businesses traverse the data-to-result path. With over 170 customers across 21 countries, the company has managed to convert 'analytics as a service' into a 'platform play'.Atul Jalan, MD, ManthanAlso read: Here’s how India is working towards the future of AI and machine learningIn this candid video interview with YourStory, Atul outlines that humans invent stories and technologies, and - in the process - our way of living changes very rapidly.Early technologies like the fire, wheel, plough, saddle, printing press, steam engines, and gasoline engines changed the world around us. Now, with the combination of new technologies like genomics, AI, and quantum computing, man and machine are coming together to script a new chapter in the history of man.“People will feel disconnected to the changes around them. A new ethical mode of morality will be required over the next 10 years. Look at connected cars; they will require new laws. Is the algorithm responsible for the accident? It changes the whole dynamic of who is responsible,"" Atul says.Sign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsHe adds that capitalism, socialism, and communism were born out of the industrial revolution that began in the 17th century. With AI and genomics, there are possibilities of a completely new ideology giving shape to human narratives.Today, AI is narrow; it recognises patterns and makes recommendations. But, for real AI to exist it has to pass the Turing Test, a test of a machine’s ability to “exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human”. This essentially means the machine can fool man into believing that the decision is really being made by him/her. Sounds just like Blade Runner, doesn't it? These are some of the tough questions Atul Jalan places before everybody.“Algorithms today are going to mislead humans even more because they are forming their own groups that cater to their biases on social media,” Atul says. For example, when one searches the internet with the question “Is Trump bad?”, the algorithm only shows posts that suggest he is “bad”. Similarly, if one searches for “Is Trump good?”, the search engine only throws up posts or content relevant to the context of “good”. Biases are a formation of the preconceived questions we have about the person; the algorithms heighten these feelings.Atul speaks about the progress of man, thanks to technology, and has high praise for people like Alan Turing for being among the first to say that machines would dream one day. Quoting Isaac Asimov, he says science fiction has created the chance for humans to dream of a future that will change mankind through technology.He is categorical that technology will change the way we look at the normal. Be it work, life, marriage, sex or our relationship to the government, everything will change. He adds that the union of man and machine will happen sooner, and that machine will soon dominate. What does that hold for our future? Atul leaves us pondering about the imminent dawn of a new, strange epoch.Watch the interview with Atul here:

In this candid video interview with YourStory, Atul outlines that humans invent stories and technologies, and - in the process - our way of living changes very rapidly.

Early technologies like the fire, wheel, plough, saddle, printing press, steam engines, and gasoline engines changed the world around us. Now, with the combination of new technologies like genomics, AI, and quantum computing, man and machine are coming together to script a new chapter in the history of man.

“People will feel disconnected to the changes around them. A new ethical mode of morality will be required over the next 10 years. Look at connected cars; they will require new laws. Is the algorithm responsible for the accident? It changes the whole dynamic of who is responsible,"" Atul says.

He adds that capitalism, socialism, and communism were born out of the industrial revolution that began in the 17th century. With AI and genomics, there are possibilities of a completely new ideology giving shape to human narratives.

Today, AI is narrow; it recognises patterns and makes recommendations. But, for real AI to exist it has to pass the Turing Test, a test of a machine’s ability to “exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human”. This essentially means the machine can fool man into believing that the decision is really being made by him/her. Sounds just like Blade Runner, doesn't it? These are some of the tough questions Atul Jalan places before everybody.

“Algorithms today are going to mislead humans even more because they are forming their own groups that cater to their biases on social media,” Atul says. For example, when one searches the internet with the question “Is Trump bad?”, the algorithm only shows posts that suggest he is “bad”. Similarly, if one searches for “Is Trump good?”, the search engine only throws up posts or content relevant to the context of “good”. 

Biases are a formation of the preconceived questions we have about the person; the algorithms heighten these feelings.

Atul speaks about the progress of man, thanks to technology, and has high praise for people like Alan Turing for being among the first to say that machines would dream one day. Quoting Isaac Asimov, he says science fiction has created the chance for humans to dream of a future that will change mankind through technology.

He is categorical that technology will change the way we look at the normal. Be it work, life, marriage, sex or our relationship to the government, everything will change. He adds that the union of man and machine will happen sooner, and that machine will soon dominate. What does that hold for our future? Atul leaves us pondering about the imminent dawn of a new, strange epoch.

She has performed research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is an honors graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a Master’s candidate in Biotechnology at Johns Hopkins University. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The K-12 online tutoring market is a growing sector and is projected by market research firm Technavio to reach $120.67 billion by 2021. Growing numbers of students are taking college entrance exams such as the SAT and tutoring industry giants such as Khan Academy are helping students meet their test prep goals. However, personalization of the online tutoring experience has not been fully adopted across platforms. Today, artificial intelligence is beginning to help shape this approach. In this article we explore examples of tutoring platforms which integrate AI. We cover three major categories of tutoring applications that should be of interest to business leaders in the education space: Chatbots as Tutors and Teachers Machine Learning for Educational Data Analytics and Quality Monitoring Machine Learning for Matching Tutors with Students For each application we provide a company overview, explanation of how the platform functions and outcome data and/or results where available. Each example is organized under a sub-heading which serves as a quick reference when navigating through the article. (This article will focus exclusively on AI applied to virtual learning and tutoring. Readers interested in a general exploration of AI in Education may find our more broad article “Examples of Artificial Intelligence in Education” to be an informative read.) Chatbots Duolingo – Chatbot for Learning Foreign Languages In October 2016, Duolingo officially announced the release of three iPhone compatible chatbots designed to help foreign language learners gain fluency and confidence in speaking in French, Spanish and Italian.  Consistent with traditional bots, users interact with the app though prompts using natural language. However, the company claims its chatbot is more unique due to its ability to “accept and react to thousands of unique responses” instead of a more limited range of prompts. A screen shot of DuoLingo’s conversational prompts on iPhone Features include a “help me reply” option that provides users with suggested responses if he or she is ever unsure how to respond during a language chat. Unfamiliar words can also be clicked on for realtime translations or pronunciations during chats. The company claims it has always used machine learning to help personalize each lesson delivered through its platform. Specific examples include: Determining which sentences will help a user best improve his or her weakest language skills Recommending immersion practice documents (translations) based on a user’s progress Estimating the quality of a translation-in-progress  To date, the company reports that it services over 150 million users. An independent research study conducted by Roumen Vesselinov, PhD and John Grego, PhD on the effectiveness of Duolingo for learning Spanish suggests that the platform is an effective tool.  The same research team has conducted a series of effectiveness studies on competing language software programs including Babbel and Rosetta Stone. The impact of Duolingo’s chatbots (on engagement, revenue, learning outcomes, etc) has yet to be reported. EdTech Foundry – Chatbot Acts As Teaching Assistant EdTech Foundry, a Norway-based tech company has recently released Differ, a chatbot designed to assist students in higher education. The system is designed to provide quick answers to student questions that tend to recur each semester.  According to the company’s website, questions range from general administrative questions to more detailed questions about syllabi and course work expectations. In addition to answering questions, the chatbot occasionally suggests academic articles and further reading to students that pertain to their coursework. The chatbot also suggests direct ways that a student can contribute to their class such as posting in forums.  In the short video below, Kristian Collin Berge, EdTech Foundry CEO, discusses how he used the Differ chatbot to as a teaching assistant in his classroom to increase student engagement:  To function, the chatbot uses algorithms and must accumulate and process student questions and student-teacher activity over time to improve its ability to make useful recommendations. The company claims that its pilot program results demonstrated five times higher student engagement on messages posted by a bot as compared to a human teacher.  Contrary to some concerns about how technology can affect a student’s experience with course work Bill Gates is among proponents of the technology. He suggests chatbots have great potential for achieving increased student engagement because of how they are designed to communicate with their users. While we’ve covered the chatbot efforts of Google and Facebook in relative depth, education is – admittedly – a rather new use-case without the budget or the conversational volume of the world’s big tech giants. We hope that the use-cases and open source technologies from leading tech companies will increasingly make their way into education and other less funded domains. Time will tell. Machine Learning for Data Analytics and Quality Monitoring Thirdspace Learning – AI Used for Feedback on Math Tutoring Instruction Founded in 2012, Thirdspace Learning is self-described as the largest one-on-one online math tutoring platform in the U.K. As of 2016, the company is reportedly integrating artificial intelligence into its operations. The purpose is to better track student progress and to optimize its services. While a specific timeline has not been reported, the company aims to provide its online tutors with feedback on their tutoring performance in real-time using artificial intelligence.   For example, if a student misunderstands a concept or if a tutor skips an important step, Thirdspace wants AI to identify the gaps and alert the tutor before the issue progresses.  On the data collection front, company founder Tom Hopper has stated that the ThirdSpace Learning records every tutoring session amounting to thousands of hours every week. To provide additional context, according to the company’s website, over 400 math specialists have been recruited and trained and over 100,000 hours of math tutoring has been delivered to date. Robust data collection improves the ability of an algorithm to “learn” the parameters of a data set and enables it to make better recommendations. It is plausible that Thirdspace is aiming to increase its data to lay a solid foundation for its AI implementation efforts. This would be particularly applicable to understanding student learning styles and tailoring math tutoring in an increasingly personalized way.  Thinkster Math – AI Used for Feedback on Math Tutoring Instruction Thinkster is a math tutoring platform that integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning to help math coaches track student performance. According to its website, Thinkster uses AI to help visualize a student’s thought process as he or she works on a math problem.  The tutoring platform records student work and tracks the steps a student chose to solve a math problem. As a result, math coaches can identify problem areas and inform strategies for improving student performance. The objective is to personalize each student’s learning experience based on performance data.  For example, consider a word problem involving 3 apples, 4 oranges and 5 carrots and a student is asked to calculate the total amount of fruit. Thinkster’s curriculum is designed to include “conceptually unrelated numbers (or distractors).” In this example the 5 carrots would be the distractor. The platform would track the student’s ability to solve similar problems which include distractors to achieve overall skill mastery in this area. The 3 minute video below provides a succinct overview of the Thinkster platform featuring a simulated walk-through of a student using the platform and how Thinkster records and analyzes the student’s performance:  The details of how AI and machine learning are specifically impacting the business model are not clearly discernible from the company’s website or Linkedin page.  iTalk2Learn: Machine Learning Used for Fraction Solutions iTalk2Learn is an online math tutorial system designed for elementary students. A collaborative project developed in Europe, the system developers claim machine learning is used to structure personalized lesson plans.  The program focuses extensively on fractions, which according to the developers, remain a barrier to progression in the study of mathematics for a disproportionate number of students. The program’s Fractions Lab reportedly emphasizes visual representations of fractions and real-world application of fraction concepts. Through the use of its seven modalities, the program claims to  balance structured activities with interactive, practice-based work. iTalk2Learn explains the software requirements and basic components to it’s program on their platform page. Much of the company’s software is available on GitHub The program model incorporates features such as speech recognition. The machine learning technology is currently calibrated for English users only. Currently in a trial phase, students were recorded while solving problems involving fractions. The developers are analyzing transcripts from these recordings to “teach” the system to recognize common questions and speech patterns. The company claims that a German speech recognition iTalk2Learn is in the works.  As a machine learning based program, the developers of iTalk2Learn emphasize real-time analysis of their users’ experiences and results. For example, this would be achieved by monitoring how a student solves a problem involving fractions and providing feedback specific to that student’s approach. Mostly through anecdotal reports from some teachers, the company claims instances of higher student engagement and confidence in fraction work in “certain classrooms.” Matching Tutors with Students Brainly – Machine Learning Used to Match Student Problems with Content Experts Brainly is a global online learning community where students can post academic questions and community members can offer solutions. The platform is reportedly using machine learning algorithms to match problems with content experts. Human moderators are content specialists who provide oversight and monitor the quality of solutions provided by community members.  This 1 minute video below provides an overview of how the Brainly online learning community works:   Brainly aims to personalize each user experience and minimize low quality content. This is an important feature of the learning community’s brand but also an ambitious task. According to its website, Brainly receives 80 million unique visitors each month across over 35 countries. “The whole point of Brainly is to use data and technology to focus the attention on a very precise and specific problem. So Amazon, for instance, wants you to look at more and more stuff and to do things in quantity. But Brainly wants to do the opposite. We want to use machine learning to create a fully personalized learning path, to identify precisely where a student is stuck or confused or unclear, then hone in on that one specific problem and find a solution.” -Professor Chirag Shah of Rutgers University, (March 2017) The company has partnered with professionals with experience in AI and machine learning such as Chirag Shah, Ph.D. of Rutgers University to help achieve its goals.  MyTutor – Algorithm Used to Match Students With an Ideal Tutor In collaboration with University College London’s (UCL) Institute of Education, the online tutoring site MyTutor, has reportedly developed an AI-powered system to streamline the process of connecting students to their ideal tutor. After signing up, a prospective student is prompted with a series of questions pertaining to his or her personality type. The collected responses are processed using an algorithm that matches students to tutors based on compatibility. Examples of compatibility parameters include creativity, logical thinking and confidence. The system can then use these descriptors to automate the interview process and complete a match. CEO James Grant has stated that the program is founded on the idea that a complementary dynamic between students and their teacher is integral to academic success.  The short 1:11 minute video below demonstrates MyTutor in action:  One professor suggests that a limited understanding of the technology behind MyTutor’s platform may lead some parents to become concerned about providing details about their child’s personality online. Despite these challenges MyTutor claims that it has achieved a 93 percent success rate with users and boasts an average of five stars from its 43,000 user ratings. Concluding Thoughts AI is steadily being introduced into the online tutoring experience and is providing methods personalization and improving the quality of services delivered through data analytics. Despite the deluge of chatbots entering the market across industries, tutoring bots may have a promising future in the coming years (though we’re far from achieving human level sophistication in chatbots any time soon). Bots in the smart virtual learning sphere are subject to a greater degree of consistent utilization and learning opportunities compared to other industries which may receive occasional traffic. Personalization of the learning experience is a general theme across applications. Another important theme to highlight is integration of AI and human interaction. Smart virtual learning  platforms do not appear to be aiming for AI to replace human instruction but rather to supplement and enhance the human-to-human experience. A 2016 report published by Pearson on AI in education complements our observations and advocates for wider adoption of AI at scale:  “Drawing on the power of both human and artificial intelligence, we will lessen achievement gaps, address teacher retention and development, and equip parents to better support their children’s (and their own) learning. Importantly, doing this will require much more than borrowing the language of AI – we need to go deep, harnessing the power of genuine AIEd, and then working to apply it in real-life contexts at scale.” – Intelligence Unleashed: An Argument for AI in Education Similarly, a 2016 report on education published by the World Economic Forum suggests that machine learning is among the technological advances which have strong potential for personalizing instruction and improving social and emotional learning. The National Education Association is among advocates of developing social and emotional skills for improving student outcomes: “Social and emotional skills are critical to being a good student, citizen, and worker. Workforce demands aside, many call for the 21st century classroom to be student-centered and to support individual learning needs. Moreover, students’ ability to learn well depends not just on instruction, but also on factors such as the school climate, a sense of belonging with peers, positive relationships with educators, and the feedback they receive.” – The National Education Association As more students access smart virtual learning tools, machine learning has the potential to become increasingly useful to handle the large amount of data and to provide tutors with constructive feedback. Quality monitoring is always critical when providing academic support and this will become more apparent as the market becomes increasingly competitive.   Header image credit: PKHS Schools Related Posts Examples of Artificial Intelligence in EducationThough yet to become a standard in schools, artificial intelligence in education has been taught… Smart City Artificial Intelligence Applications and TrendsThanks to the relative ease with which local governments can now gather real time data,… Artificial Intelligence Plus the Internet of Things (IoT) - 3 Examples Worth Learning FromThe Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to fall into the general pit of… Everyday Examples of Artificial Intelligence and Machine LearningWith all the excitement and hype about AI that’s “just around the corner”—self-driving cars, instant… Artificial Intelligence at Wells Fargo - A Brief OverviewWells Fargo has begun a number of AI initiatives, some they've created in-house and some… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Lessons learned from recent academic progress and industry adoption of AI


Introduction

A few years ago, it was hard to find anyone to have a serious discussion about Artificial Intelligence (AI) outside academic institutions. Today, nearly everyone talks about AI. Like any new major technology trend, the new wave of making AI and intelligent systems a reality is creating curiosity and enthusiasm. People are jumping on its bandwagon adding not only great ideas but also in many cases a lot of false promises and sometimes misleading opinions.
PROMOTED
Built by giant thinkers and academic researchers, AI adoption by industries and further development in academia around the globe is progressing at a faster rate than anyone had excepted. Accelerated by the strong belief that our biological limitations are increasingly becoming a major obstacle towards creating smart systems and machines that work with us to better use our biological cognitive capabilities to achieve higher goals. This is driving an overwhelming wave of demands and investments across industries to apply AI technologies to solve real-world problems and create smarter machines and new businesses.
AI overcame many obstacles over the last decades mainly on the academic side. However, it is facing now one of its major challenges so far, that is the adoption in real-world industry scenarios and the myths and misunderstanding surrounding it. Unfortunately, with confusing and conflicting messages about what AI can and can’t do, it is challenging for industry leaders to distinguish between facts and fiction in the rapidly crowded and noisy ecosystem of enthusiasts, platform vendors, and service providers. However, once the dust settles down and things get clear, the truth of AI will endure, eventually losers and winners will be declared.
The challenge is how industry leaders would have a realistic opinion about what AI can and can’t do for their business and continuously update it so that they can lead their organizations to apply AI in the right way in solving real-world problems and transform their businesses. Also, academics and AI practitioners have the responsibility to get out of their bubble and engage with industry experts to be able to further develop the academic foundations of AI in a way that would make its real-world adoption faster, more rewarding and responsible.

The current “messy” state of AI adoption in industries

Over the last few years, business leaders from nearly every industry have been trying to understand the new magical technology called Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how their businesses can benefit from it. Unfortunately, until now most of the implementations of AI-powered solutions haven’t gone beyond Proof of Concepts (PoCs) in the form of scattered Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with a limited scope. While this level and approach of AI adoption is wasting many opportunities and resources for companies, it has helped to convince business and IT leaders that Artificial Intelligence can drive transformative and relevant innovation.
Many PoC projects today are using basically simple statistical methods to add some simple prediction or classification capabilities to their analytics solutions and call it AI solutions. This is still defined as analytics or possibly advanced analytics which still needs extensive human intervention in understanding the outcome and make a decision or take an action.
As the business processes and operational conditions continuously change, the newly generated data and the continual changes in different business factors are reducing the level of precision and the value such algorithms can offer rendering them over time to be useless or even lead to dangerous decisions.
Such an approach and its outcome are just another part of the frustrating reality that is confusing business leaders and hindering the right adoption of sophisticated AI technologies in the appropriate way to gain valuable results.
The current approach of trying to squeeze in few Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in some business areas for quick gains is alone a risk and might cause a setback to AI adoption across industries triggering another “AI winter” this time on the industry side not on the academic side. Applying even mature AI technologies in such a way might add some values but could add new dangerous “artificial stupidity” to the organization with catastrophic consequences.

Over the next years, companies can’t afford to continue accepting a status of confusion and hesitation around what AI can and can't do, how it can be integrated with other technologies to create intelligent solutions or machines and where to apply it appropriately.

Over the next few sections, I’ll highlight some of the current myths and misunderstanding overshadowing the reality of AI and hindering its right adoption. I’ll also share some ideas on how to overcome them to accelerate the real-world adoption of AI and reduce the risks to business and societies.

The curse of scattered ML algorithms

Over the last few years, some motivated business leaders started AI initiatives on their own and within their business areas using open source ML libraries focusing on a few key decisions to optimize. Those efforts were usually not part of an organized company-wide plan. While such efforts added some values and helped different teams to have the first experience in using AI capabilities to solve some business problems, it resulted in scattered ML algorithms on the loose across organizations. Unfortunately, such scattered ML algorithms don’t fully unlock the values hidden in the data nor tap into valuable business knowledge organizations have. Furthermore, they add potential risks to companies.
Some of the main risks that scattered ML algorithms bring are:

Algorithms might be trained using a limited set of features and data resulting in the wrong or sometimes dangerous business decisions either inside or outside the business area.
While optimizing local operational decisions, such algorithms might unintentionally negatively affect other business areas or even global operations.
Such individual algorithms can be easily manipulated and mislead in making wrong decisions by internal or external actors adding a major new category of cybersecurity risks.
Training some machine learning algorithms might require expensive computing power adding high costs to small business units. In many cases this caused business units to abandon AI completely based on the false impression of high costs of adoption.

Usually, most if not all business functional and operational units are directly connected. The data they generate, the knowledge they create and the roles they adhere to are shared and are interdependent. AI can see some interdependencies and relationships in huge amounts of data and features which humans usually can't see. This could be used to create a strong data and knowledge platform enabling cross-organization distributed AI systems converting the scattered nature of data, knowledge, and decision making from weakness to a major strength.

Organizations must act quickly to consolidate all AI initiatives and the ML algorithms on the loose and move them to a standard enterprise-grade secure AI platform within an overall AI adoption strategy.

This would enable distributed yet interconnected AI solutions offering intelligence where the decision needs to be made with maximum benefits and transformational power to the business. This move would also accelerate the successful adoption of AI, reduce costs of adoption, increase the ROI as well as reduce the internal and external risks to the company.

Artificial Intelligence adoption or Intelligent Enterprise creation?

Until AI systems can take such decisions for us, companies must decide whether they want to just adopt AI or ultimately create an intelligent enterprise which will take more than AI adoption to achieve. The current discussions around Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and whether they’re part of AI are taking the discussions about AI adoption off track. Yes, RPA is not part of AI at least based on the academic definition of AI and can’t be despite all the misleading loud marketing voices. The current RPA technology is nothing but simple scripts that unfortunately in many cases just automate the current business processes accumulated over the years and was designed mainly with only the human in mind.

If done right, RPA and Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) would be an opportunity to redesign and automate the underlying processes for the new workforce where humans and machines collaborating intelligently and closer together.

Business leaders should have plans to create the intelligent enterprise that offers intelligent products and services wrapped with intelligent processes designed to leverage biological intelligence of humans and artificial intelligence capabilities of machines together not just to automate repetitive processes to reduce costs and affirm some decisions which they could do alone without new technologies.

Some of the basic capabilities of intelligent enterprise would be that, it’s products, solutions and services can to intelligently use the collective knowledge they and humans created, be able to continuously learn to do things better and do new things as well as to intelligently react to ever-changing environments and demands.

Given the artifacts of an intelligent enterprise and the fast-growing complexity of the internal and external business environment, having too much of the traditional human intervention would be increasingly a major bottleneck in achieving the goal of an intelligent enterprise. This is due to our limited biological capabilities such as even simple tasks like finger and eyes movement.
Therefore, organizations need to stop wasting time discussing RPA and have a strategy and roadmap towards the intelligent enterprise which should include among others:

The overall vision, and a definition and roadmap for their intelligent enterprise including products, solutions, and services that in a dynamic way address the why, what, how and when.
A roadmap for new Intelligent Processes designed for Man + Machines working closer together.
A strategy that goes beyond AI and ML algorithms to identify other technologies which are essential to have an end to end intelligent solutions and products such as new sensing technologies, intelligent IoT gateways, edge computing hardware as well as HPC including quantum computing.
A plan to create the required culture and organizational operational shift in the way we build, use, operate and maintain such intelligent systems and solutions.
A plan to create an innovation ecosystem which should be an integral part of the new business to envision and deliver new intelligent services to the new businesses and the joint clients.
A new definition of Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) given the new UI/UX enabled by AI technologies such as Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU) and advanced computer vision accelerated by Augmented Reality/Extended Reality technologies.


AI technologies are not yet ready for industrial adoption. Is it a Myth?

The current AI benefited from decades of serious high-quality academic research. However, it’s clear that one of the major weaknesses of current AI systems is the lack of real-life experience, which is needed to make it reliably useful for all of us. When AI systems fail to give the right answer at the beginning of using it, this doesn’t usually mean that the underlying AI algorithms or mathematical models are not mature enough.

Like humans, AI algorithms need more real-world experience that might include more data created through algorithms’ own trials and errors in the real world.

Therefore, it would be unfair and technically wrong to judge AI solutions in the early stages while they still have no or little experience. This is one of the most common mistakes done today and usually lead to frustration and misunderstanding around the maturity of AI underlying models. We’ve to give AI-powered solutions time to learn and be carefully evaluated before deploying them in the enterprise.
For instance, machine learning capabilities which gained enough real-world experience such as computer vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the most mature and widely adopted parts of AI today. They’re the cognitive engines behind many industrial and consumer applications and products with the most positive impact on business and our personal life so far.
This is a key difference between traditional analytics and AI solutions. In analytics, software vendors build software solutions without having the actual data. On the contrary, in AI solutions, we use the problem description, actual data, domain knowledge and a set of specific goals to be able to create, train and verify ML algorithms. No Data, No Algorithms! in AI, there is no turnkey solution. This is a key mindset shift which must happen immediately to avoid this misunderstanding.
Such shift in mindset combined with new principles of designing distributed intelligent systems such as multi-agent distributed and interconnected cognitive systems would play a major role in deciding whether the organization’s efforts to leverage AI capabilities would succeed or just add more frustration, wasted opportunities and new risks.
Additionally, one of the key capabilities AI systems must have per design is that it should have the ability to continuously learn as well as dynamically leverage effective learning approach(es) over time. Selecting the right initial architecture as well as continuous learning approaches such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning or a mix of them is very important in a successful AI adoption. Lifelong Continues Learning (LLCL) is one of the main and most promising AI research areas today. However, it continues to be a challenge for the current machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of new information from non-stationary data sources generally lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge or abrupt decrease in the precision.
While there is a lot to be done to enable AI systems to continuously learn and evolve with their environments, most of the current AI platforms from startups and established vendors provide powerful tools to make this happen.

What makes or breaks AI adoption in business is not the AI academic methods and algorithms or the technology platforms built around them but the way we adopt, architect and integrate them in business solutions and industrial products.


The overhyped promise of Data

As of today, it is a challenge to train, test and verify the current machine learning algorithms, especially deep machine learning, as they require a lot of good data. Moreover, the last few years have shown that in many cases businesses don’t have enough historical data in the required quality and quantity needed for current ML approaches. Also, the data we have today was generated and collected with humans and their biological strengths and weaknesses in mind.
Even in cases where we have enough data, we must invest a massive amount of effort in different areas such as data engineering, data analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, predictive modeling, model selection, and verification before having the initial algorithms. Additionally, manually adapting the design and continuous refining of the internal architecture of the first-generation algorithms takes a lot of tedious and repetitive work and requires massive computing power especially if we want to solve serious problems with constant or increasing precision.
The current “predictive analytics” solutions use simple statistical models to predict something based on the available historical data. It assumes that the future will follow the past in a simple and straightforward way. An assumption which in many cases has been proven to be wrong. For example, the failure history of industrial equipment in terms of causes, nature, and consequences is varying as workers are better trained, have access to more information and even have better tools to test, repair and maintain the same. This makes parts of “expensive” historical data misleading.

Our limited or occasional biased understanding and interpretations of the past events and the context in which those events have happened reduce the precision of AI solutions to accurately predict complex events which usually happen in a reality that we can't fully understand.

Additionally, there is increased warning among scientists against the statistical inference and misuse of statistical significance and “P values - probability value” which in some cases might lead to catastrophic consequences. Some scientists even call for the concept of statistical significance to be abandoned especially in the case where high precision prediction is required. In the end, as seen in many cases, we find the outcome is not more than the reaffirmation of predetermined decisions.

The human brain was initially trained with less data but extended, verified and continuously taught with large amounts of data gathered over years of life experience.

Today, ML algorithms are trained with large amounts of data and tested with less data (~70 % to 30%). Therefore, instead of just collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data, AI systems should start with simple tasks and be able to continuously learn, add more capabilities, expand its knowledge, increase its reasoning capability and adapt to its new environment through data they collected or synthetically generated.
One of the key lessons from using AI to solve complex problems over the last years is that we need new AI systems architecture which relies on fewer data and less supervision by humans. Therefore, AI practitioners as well as academic researchers, are going beyond traditional machine learning architectures and trying to create new ML algorithms which can create and comprehend its self-created or acquired data.
We see a lot of progress in some AI/ML areas such as new biologically inspired mathematical approaches, more efficient neural networks architectures, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) and genetic & evolutionary algorithms. One common goal is to reduce AI dependency on massive amounts of data and knowledge created by humans. Also, the tremendous advances in developing AI specialized hardware such as GPU, TPU and FPGA are making such new approaches possible.
Also, incorporating more efficient knowledge representation techniques such as evolutionary and co-evolutionary modular multi-tasking knowledge representation techniques even with the current ML algorithms will help organizations uncover more knowledge from the same or fewer data. Human brain-inspired new reasoning approaches are emerging fast to enable us to build systems that over time can reason like humans but without our biological limitations enhancing the precision and speed of decisions taken by machines and avoiding catastrophic decisions which with the absence of machine reasoning is highly possible.
While human-generated data will continue to be important especially in this early stage of adopting AI in industries, using the right mix of AI techniques and architectures would, over time, require fewer data and leverage more of the collective knowledge of companies to save time and efforts while creating safer and more efficient AI-powered business systems.

AI solutions are secure by design, really?

We all hoped that intelligent solutions would be able to defend themselves in different ways other than traditional software solutions. Technically it is possible that AI-powered systems can detect hostile behavior and, in some cases, proactively take preemptive measures to defend themselves. Today, AI is being used effectively to enhance the traditional cybersecurity solutions enabling them to be able to early identify or predict attacks and recommend primitive strikes on adversarial systems.

Given the strong reliance on human-generated data, ML algorithms with even deep neural networks architecture also can be easily misled to take wrong or even dangerous decisions.

Usually, hackers access traditional software systems to steal data. They hack industrial control systems and misguide them to do the wrong action(s). However, the core of AI systems has mainly algorithms and not much data. This created the illusion of absolute security by nature among some people, as nothing inside to steal. However, instead of stealing data, cyber attackers can feed AI systems with wrong data to manipulate their ability to take the right decisions. For example, attackers could access Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to add or remove medical conditions in MRI scans which will lead to the wrong diagnosis by ML algorithms. Same could happen to financial data or the operational data of critical equipment in a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) or a smart grid.
One of the most advanced and promising features of some AI-powered solutions is the ability of continuous learning from their own behavior, the way we use them to solve problems or make decisions as well as the external data sources we grant them access to. Even this unique feature makes AI solutions more vulnerable to new types of cyber-attacks such as influencing their behavior that they generate the wrong learning data (experience) which will lead to wrong or biased decisions in the future. This is like exposing humans to specific experience with the goal to misguide their behavior in a certain direction.
The so-called “adversarial examples” are sets of data given to AI systems with the intention to mislead them and cause misclassification and wrong decisions. Such a new type of hacking of intelligent digital systems is creating a major security vulnerability of even state-of-the-art deep learning systems. It is all about misleading the brain or disabling the backbone of an organization’s collective intelligence and even its critical physical assets. This can be more catastrophic and might cause irreparable damage and threaten even the existence of companies in some cases.

Organizations should be aware of this new cyber threat and consider new approaches and tools for designing, implementing and securing AI-powered digital and physical systems as well as the systems they interact with internally and externally.


AI systems can’t be biased. A huge misunderstanding!

One of the most frequently discussed topics nowadays is AI ethics and biases. As we use data generated by humans based on rules we created to train the machine learning algorithms today, this data will directly reflect the way we think and approach things. This data will decide the behavior of each algorithm.
In many cases such as diagnosing medical images, predicting failure of equipment or optimizing production throughput, ethics and social bias might not be a part of the problem to be solved. This creates another misunderstanding that the problem of AI bias is irrelevant in such cases leaving many to believe wrongly that the algorithms are not biased. In such cases, many companies are not aware that ML algorithms might represent a high risk and even legal burden on organizations.

While it is very important to eliminate social bias from the data we use to train ML algorithms and verify their behavior, companies must understand that there’re different types of AI biases and be aware of them.

For instance, we usually use technical data of specific equipment combined with other operational and environmental data to train ML algorithms that can proactively predict equipment failure or guide us on how to increase its performance. In some situations, because of many known and unknown variables, algorithms are biased toward predicting more failures or fewer failures causing major disruption to the business.

AI bias should be defined and identified based on the problems we’re trying to solve or decisions we’re trying to make.

We should develop new methods and tools that will enable us to expose biases using adequate humans and machines reasoning based on relevant business and technical knowledge. Ethics, accountability, and governance of AI systems are one of the most important roles of leadership in the era of AI and they’ve to proactively engage to inform themselves, provide guidance and increase awareness across the organization.
Until we’ve AI regulations or government appointed regulatory bodies, companies must ensure their AI systems operate at least using the same standards and regulations they use to run their business every day. This is especially crucial in serious AI applications which span digital and physical systems.

Conclusion

Companies must carefully create a comprehensive and dynamic AI strategy and immediately start adequate execution initiatives to get ready for the new era of many intelligent things powered by AI. This strategy towards intelligent enterprise will help in creating the new Man + Machine workforce of the future and reimagine their overall business. This is urgently required before new intelligent products, solutions or services from far smaller new disruptors will become a real threat to not only their businesses but also to their very existence.
This will require the business and IT leadership to have a realistic and accurate view about what AI can and can’t do now and in the near future. Also, having someone with robust academic and practical experience in AI leading such initiatives would help organizations cut through the hype and avoid costly misunderstandings and misleading myths.
Intelligence can’t be centralized, it should be distributed and not limited to a few functional areas. A hybrid and balanced approach of embedded, edge and centralized intelligence should be considered upfront to guarantee a well-orchestrated growth of the collective intelligence of the organization across all teams, functional areas, products, and services.
Most importantly, the adoption of AI and other related technologies towards the intelligent enterprise will bring the more productive and augmented Human and intelligent Machines closer creating a powerful workforce of the future. Companies should understand that humans and machines will continue to be the two pillars of the new workforce and wisely plan to leverage their combined strengths and understand their limitations of biological and artificial nature.

A commercial artificial intelligence (AI) system matched the accuracy of over 28,000 interpretations of breast cancer screening mammograms by 101 radiologists. Although the most accurate mammographers outperformed the AI system, it achieved a higher performance than the majority of radiologists (JNCI: J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 10.1093/jnci/djy222).
With the addition of deep-learning convolutional neural networks, new AI systems for breast cancer screening improve upon the computer-aided detection (CAD) systems that radiologists have used since the 1990s. The AI system evaluated in this study — conducted by radiologists and medical physicists at Radboud University Medical Centre — has a feature classifier and image analysis algorithms to detect soft-tissue lesions and calcifications, and generates a “cancer suspicion” ranking of 1 to 10.
The researchers examined unrelated datasets of images from nine previous clinical studies. The images were acquired from women living in seven countries using four different vendors’ digital mammography systems. Every dataset included diagnostic images, radiologists’ scores of each exam and the actual patient diagnosis.
The 2652 cases, of which 653 were malignant, incorporated a total of 28,296 individual single reading interpretations by 101 radiologists participating in previous multi-reader, multi-case observer studies. The readers included 53 radiologists from the United States, who represented an equal mix of breast imagers and general radiologists, plus 48 European radiologists who were all breast specialists.
Principal investigator Ioannis Sechopoulos and colleagues reported that the performance of the AI tool (ScreenPoint Medical’s Transpara) was statistically non-inferior to that of the radiologists, with an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.840, compared with 0.814 for the radiologists. The AI system had a higher AUC than 62 of the radiologists and higher sensitivity than 55 radiologists.


The performance of the AI system was, however, consistently lower than the best performing radiologists in all datasets. The authors suggested that this may be because the radiologists had more information available for assessment, such as prior mammograms, for the majority of cases. However, the team did not have access to the experience levels of the 101 radiologists, and therefore could not determine whether the radiologists who outperformed the AI system also were the most experienced.
The researchers suggest that there may be several ways that an AI system designed to detect breast cancer could be used. One possibility is its use as an independent first or second reader in regions with a shortage of radiologists to interpret screening mammograms. It also could be employed in the same manner as CAD systems, as a clinical decision support tool to aid an interpreting radiologist.
Sechopoulos also thinks that AI will be useful for identifying normal mammograms that do not need to be read by a screening radiologist. “With the right developments, it could also be used to identify cases that can be read by only one radiologist to confirm that recalling the patient is necessary,” he tells Physics World. “These strategies could give radiologists more time to focus on more complex cases, and eventually could be part of the solution needed to implement digital tomosynthesis in screening programs. This is important because tomosynthesis takes considerably longer to read than mammography.”
When asked about future research, Sechopoulos suggests that a really interesting next step will be to compare the performance of AI against human performance in real screening conditions with the actual prevalence, or percentage of cases that are positive. “We need to gather that data first, and then do the comparison overall and also broken down by case characteristics, including lesion type, lesion location, and tumour characteristics,” he says.

Google, as one of the biggest corporations on Earth, is very interested in the use of AI and health care. Sundry Photography / Shutterstock Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly seen as a tool in biopharma and life sciences to improve drug development. There is a bit of a resource lag because AI is expensive. For example, Google/Alphabet owns an AI laboratory called DeepMind. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for a reported $650 million. Google, as one of the biggest corporations on Earth, is very interested in the use of AI and health care. “The fundamental underlying technologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence are applicable to all manner of tasks,” Greg Corrado, a neuroscientist at Google, told NPR. And that’s true, “whether those are tasks in your daily life, like getting directions or sorting through emailing, or the kinds of tasks that doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients face every day.” It's probably not altruism that has brought Google and other tech companies to look at the life sciences and health care. John Moore, an industry analyst at Chilmark Research, told NPR, “It’s pretty hard to ignore a market that represents about 20 percent of [U.S.] GDP. So whether it’s Google or it’s Microsoft or it’s IBM or it’s Apple, everyone is taking a look at what they can do in the health care space.” Alphabet’s Verily focuses on health. One project the company is working on is software that can diagnose diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness. It is being used in India. It is also working to develop contact lenses that can monitor blood sugar in diabetes patients. Verily’s chief medical and scientific officer, cardiologist Jessica Mega, told NPR, “In each of these cases, you can use new technologies and new tools to solve a problem that’s right in front of you. In the case of surgical robotics, this idea of learning from one surgery to another becomes really important, because we should be constantly getting better.” Earlier this year, Google’s DeepMind won a worldwide contest called the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP), which is hosted by the Protein Structure Prediction Center, which is sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIH/NIGMS). It’s a global contest or experiment that has taken place every two years since 1994. Create-a-profile.jpg Proteins have three-dimensional structures and those structures are an important element in how they function. For example, it’s common for a mutation in the gene for a protein to result in the protein having a different shape, causing it to behave abnormally or not at all. Proteins shapes are also dynamic, transitioning between different states. In CASP, the participants attempt to predict the 3-D shape of a specific human protein. Researched who do this type of work use a variety of methods to solve the problem. DeepMind didn’t just beat out the other scientists in the competition but gave a prediction that was almost twice as accurate as experts expected. Derek Lowe, who writes the In The Pipeline blog for Science Translational Medicine, told The New York Times, “It is not that machines are going to replace chemists. It’s that the chemists who use machines will replace those that don’t.” Other companies than Google are focused on AI and machine learning. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a clinical-stage biotech that combines AI, experimental biology and automation to discover and develop drugs at scale. In January, Recursion announced progress in its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical on identifying novel preclinical candidates for rare diseases. In 18 months, the partnership led to the evaluation of Takeda preclinical and clinical compounds in more than 60 unique indications. New therapeutic candidates were identified in more than six diseases. San Francisco-based Atomwise uses AI based on convolutional neural networks, the same tech used in facial recognition and self-driving cars, to search for drugs. In January Atomwise signed a strategic alliance with contract research organization (CRO) Charles River Laboratories International, to support CRL’s hit discovery, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization efforts. And those are just two examples out of many. But Google, as probably the biggest data company in the world and certainly the best known, brings a huge amount of resources to the space. At least part of its focus is directly on patient diagnoses. NPR notes that hospitals have enormous amounts of patient data in electronic health records, scans, test results. “That’s fodder for algorithms to ingest and crunch. And Mega says there’s a potential to wring a lot more useful information out of it.” Verily partnered with Duke University and Stanford University in what is called Project Baseline. Baseline is looking to recruit 10,000 volunteers to provide additional data to the company. In addition to taking a variety of heart scans, blood tests, stress tests, and skin swabs, participants fill out quarterly questionnaires, a device under the mattress tracks sleep patterns, and they wear heart and exercise monitors. If this seems to violate your privacy—after all, this is a company that has access to everything you search for and probably buy online, as well as other data—that’s one aspect of the project that might raise concerns. But so far, computer users have been willing to give up a certain amount of privacy for the convenience of what Google offers. That may apply to their health as well.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Artificial intelligence can work wonders, but often it works in mysterious ways.
Machine learning is based on the principle that a software program can analyze a huge set of data and fine-tune its algorithms to detect patterns and come up with solutions that humans may miss. That’s how Google DeepMind’s Alpha Go AI agent learned to play the ancient game of Go (and other games) well enough to beat expert players.
But if programmers and users can’t figure out how AI algorithms came up with their results, that black-box behavior can be a cause for concern. It may become impossible to judge whether AI agents have picked up unjustified biases or racial profiling from their data sets.
That’s why terms such as transparency, explainability and interpretability are playing an increasing role in the AI ethics debate.
The European Commission includes transparency and traceability among its requirements for AI systems, in line with the “right to explanation” laid out in data-protection laws. The French government already has committed to publishing the code that powers the algorithms it uses. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission’s Office of Technology Research and Investigation has been charged with providing guidance on algorithmic transparency.
Transparency figures in Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s “10 Laws of AI” as well — and Erez Barak, senior director of product for Microsoft’s AI Division, addressed the issue head-on today at the Global Artificial Intelligence Conference in Seattle.
“We believe that transparency is a key,” he said. “How many features did we consider? Did we consider just these five? Or did we consider 5,000 and choose these five?”

Barak noted that a software developer’s kit for explainability and interpretability is built right into Microsoft’s Azure Machine Learning service. “What it does is that it takes the model as an input and starts breaking it down,” he said.
The model explanation can show which factors went into the computer model, and how they were weighted by the AI system’s algorithms. As a result, customers can better understand why, for instance, they were turned down for a mortgage, passed over for a job opening, or denied parole.
AI developers can also use the model explanations to make their algorithms more “human.” For instance, it may be preferable to go with an algorithm that doesn’t fit a training set of data quite as well, but is more likely to promote fairness and avoid gender or racial bias.
As AI applications become more pervasive, calls for transparency — perhaps enforced through government regulation — could well become stronger. And that runs the risk of exposing trade secrets hidden within a company’s intricately formulated algorithms, said Elvira Castillo, a partner at Seattle’s Perkins Coie law firm who specializes in trade regulations.
“Algorithms tend to be things that are closely guarded. … That’s not something that you necessarily want to be transparent with the public or with your competitors about, so there is that fundamental tension,” Castillo said. “That’s more at issue in Europe than in the U.S., which has much, much, much stronger and aggressive enforcement.”
Microsoft has already taken a strong stance on responsible AI — to the point that the company has turned down prospective customers who sought to use AI applications such as facial recognition in ethically problematic ways.
After his talk, Barak told GeekWire that Azure Machine Learning’s explainability feature could be used as an open-source tool to look inside the black box and verify that an AI algorithm doesn’t perpetuate all-too-human injustices.
Over time, will the software industry or other stakeholders develop a set of standards or a “seal of approval” for AI algorithms?
“We’ve seen that in things like security. Those are the kinds of thresholds that have been set. I’m pretty sure we’re heading in that direction as well,” Barak said. “The idea is to give everyone the visibility and capability to do that, and those standards will develop, absolutely.”

Nils J. Nilsson, the Kumagai Professor of Engineering, Emeritus, in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, died April 23 at his home in Medford, Oregon, after a brief stay in hospice. He was 86.

Nilsson is best known for his foundational work in robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning dating to the earliest days of the fields.Nilsson earned his PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford in 1958 and immediately began serving in the U.S. Air Force. After his discharge in 1961, he took a position at Stanford Research Institute, which was then still affiliated with the university. Nilsson was employed for the next 23 years at SRI, working on neural networks and statistical approaches to robotic problem-solving. He would eventually rise to lead SRI from 1980 to 1984.In 1985, Nilsson joined the Stanford faculty as chair of the Department of Computer Science, a role in which he served until 1990. It was unusual that an outsider would be brought in as chair of a department, but Nilsson was well known as a lecturer and intellectual force in artificial intelligence.The year he joined the Computer Science Department, Nilsson was charged with overseeing its historic transition from the School of Humanities and Sciences to the School of Engineering. His time at Stanford was marked by his continued leadership in the field and a burgeoning international profile. He also mentored many top names in the field during his time on the faculty.“In the mid-70s, Nils invited me to SRI to work on my PhD,” said Professor Emeritus Jean-Claude Latombe, former department chair and head of the Artificial Intelligence group at Stanford. “He became my de facto adviser and traveled to Grenoble just to sit on my defense committee. No one had such a great impact on my professional life.”Robotics leaderBetween 1966 and 1972, Nilsson co-directed the creation of an autonomous robot known affectionately as SHAKEY, after the way the top-heavy robot would shudder as made its way about in stops and starts.

Directed by a human operator typing in instructions, SHAKEY could negotiate its way around a room filled with large objects using various electrical sensors, a sonar range-finder and an integrated video camera, all the while communicating wirelessly with a state-of-the-art mainframe computer. In 1969-70, SHAKEY garnered a certain media celebrity after profiles appeared in the New York Times, National Geographic and Life, which referred to SHAKEY as the “first electronic person.”Nilsson was noted for helping to design and write the algorithms that helped SHAKEY make decisions and plan the most efficient course, Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS) and A*. The intellectual progeny of those algorithms are still in use today.Nilsson authored or co-authored at least nine books, including The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements (Cambridge University Press, 2010) and Principles of Artificial Intelligence from Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, a publishing house he co-founded. Nilsson also contributed chapters to numerous other books and published frequently in the scientific press.He served on the editorial boards of the journal Artificial Intelligence and of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research and as an editor of the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was also a president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Nilsson was also elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences.He was honored with a number of industry awards, including a Neural-Network Pioneer Award from the IEEE, the Research Excellence Award from the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Distinguished Service Award for lifetime achievement from the AAAI.Colleague and mentorAs respected as he was as an engineer, Nilsson was equally beloved as a colleague and mentor to many. As news spread across campus of his death, notes of remembrance flowed in.“Nils was a kind, thoughtful, inspiring person who helped shape the department in a formative era,” remembers John Mitchell, a fellow professor of computer science and current department chair. “He was unusually supportive of young faculty and always put our collective success ahead of any personal recognition or reward. All of us who knew him will sorely miss him.”Nils John Nilsson, the oldest of five sons to Walter and Pauline Nilsson, was born Feb. 6, 1933, in Saginaw, Michigan, where he lived until age 11 when his family relocated to Southern California. He attended high school in Glendale, where he was valedictorian. He then entered Stanford University, where he earned his master’s degree in 1956 and doctorate in 1958. A program at the time allowed him to forgo his bachelor’s degree to work directly to his master’s. He retired in 1995.He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Grace Abbott, of Medford, Oregon; daughter Kristen Farley of Pasadena, California; son Lars Nilsson of Piedmont, California; Grace’s four sons from a previous marriage and their spouses; as well as 12 grandchildren. He was predeceased by first wife, Karen (Braucht) Nilsson, in 1991.Memorial donations are requested in his name to Stanford School of Engineering.

By Michelle Froese | April 25, 2019Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to wind-turbine data is becoming more prevalent and there is a growing number of use cases for the technology. Many of these cases involve wind-turbine O&M practices and can result in increased efficiency, better spare-parts forecasting, reduced downtime, and lower unplanned maintenance costs.
Ensemble Energy’s Energy.ML platform uses advanced machine learning algorithms to predict and prevent failures. Learn more here.
“The best definition of artificial intelligence is that it is set of methods or algorithms that use a large amount of data to learn rules or patterns, and continuously improves with additional data,” shares Rob Budny, Chief Reliability Officer at Ensemble Energy. He says most AI solutions are cloud-based, directing notifications to a dashboard or email, and many can work with a work-flow management system.
The sources from which AI can pull information may include:

SCADA data (mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviations),
Maintenance data (component replacement dates, lubrication events, etc.),
Failure histories
Firmware updates
CMS data (if available)

These data sources are then used to create models of normal turbine behavior, which serve to quickly identify abnormalities and notify the wind-farm operator.
“The models monitor a turbine 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and relieve human operators of the tedious task of sifting through extremely large data sets in search of relevant insights,” explains Budny.
He says one of the best examples of AI use cases is automated detection of yaw misalignment, which, if left undetected leads to lost energy production and increased loads on the turbine. Other examples include pitch-bearing, generator stator insulation, and transformer failure prediction, as well as detection of poor bearing lubrication conditions.
“Our AI platform continually monitors wind-turbine operation in the background, so it needs no operator input,” he says. “Be sure to look for a system that is supported by wind industry domain experts, as the combination of data science expertise and wind industry expertise leads to the best outcomes.”
Forecasting is another feature of certain AI systems, adds Budny. “Many types of forecasts are possible, including power production, availability, component over-temperature events, spare parts needs, and other such use cases. Having such increased visibility provides tremendous benefits to wind-turbine operators.”

Hemphill: Artificial intelligence and automation - a manufacturing challengeStaff WriterThe Daily TelegramA January 2019 report, “Automation and Artificial Intelligence: How Machines are Affecting People and Places” written by Mark Murro, Robert Maxim and Jacob Whiton of the Brookings Institution, offers insights into how automation and artificial intelligence will be affecting job prospects in the United States through 2030.Utilizing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor market analysis firm Emsi and theMcKinsey Global Institute, this study reports that 25% of U.S. employment, or 36 million jobs in 2016, will be susceptible to high exposure — that is, greater than 70% of current task content at risk of substitution — to automation and artificial intelligence in the coming decade.Among the most vulnerable occupations are those in office administration, production, transportation and food preparation. Specifically, the automation and AI potential for production occupations is at 79%, second only to food preparation and serving related occupations (at 81%).In November 2018, Deloitte LLP and The Manufacturing Institute, the social impact arm of the National Association of Manufacturers, released the 2018 Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute Skills Gap and Future of Work Study. This study found that the widening manufacturing skills gap is expected to grow in the United States from 488,000 jobs left open in late 2018 to as many as 2.4 million manufacturing jobs going unfilled between 2018 and 2028.“With nearly 2 million vacant new jobs expected in 2028, compounded by 2.69 million vacancies from retiring workers, the number of open positions could be greater than ever and might pose not only a major challenge for manufacturers but may threaten the vitality of the industry and our economy,” said Paul Wellener, vice chairman at Deloitte.According to Deloitte, the manufacturing sector has been consistently contributing to more than 10 percent of total U.S. gross domestic product, and the National Association of Manufacturers calculates that every dollar in output from manufacturing generates an additional $1.89 of value and every direct job creates 2.5 additional jobs.In the U.S. manufacturing sector, there are “production-focused” positions that are low skilled and “skilled production” positions that require specific training to develop complex skill-sets. As to the future of production-focused positions, the manufacturing sector is choosing to eliminate them through increased automation.However, for skilled production positions, more than half of manufacturing executives in the skills gap study cite technology/computer skills, digital skills, programming skills for robots/automation, working with tools and technology, and critical-thinking skills to be in demand over the next three years. This survey result echoes findings from a recent World Economic Forum study (“The Future of Jobs Report 2018”), which identified critical thinking, creativity and originality, attention to detail, problem solving and people management — all uniquely human skills — of increasing importance as automation in the form of robots and cobots is added to manufacturers’ production lines.So what is the U.S. manufacturing sector doing beyond turning more to automation and AI to address the skills shortage and reduce this troubling employment gap?“To address the skills shortage, companies are trying new ways to fill the gap and appeal to candidates,” said Chad Moutray, director at the Center for Manufacturing Research, The Manufacturing Institute and chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.To this end, 39 percent of manufacturers report that they are implementing new learning and development programs internally and externally. Moreover, 77 percent of manufacturers are prioritizing competencies and potential in job candidates over strict adherence to factors such as years of experience, and 65 percent acknowledge they are willing to train employees on the job. In addition, many manufacturers are developing knowledge transfer programs and short-term project opportunities for retirees, and 83 percent of manufacturers are reportedly prepared to pay more to attract and retain skilled talent, with 8 percent offering signing bonuses.U.S. manufacturers are now responding to labor market conditions with flexible employment policies while incorporating new technologies designed to enhance employee productivity. However, the need for expensive labor to fill monotonous, routine jobs will become an artifact of the 20th-century factory floor.Thomas A.

For example, if we were working on a purple dress, we would scan through all possible dresses in purple showcased earlier so that ours doesn't have any similarity to them,” the pair explain on an email.Trending VideoOff Duty with Isha Ambani Piramal | Vogue India“Apart from that, if we had a concept or a sketch and added it on the software, Watson found relevant themes and sketches that helped us correct and improvise our work. It aided in keeping our work unique and authentic,” they add. In today's times where designers and brands constantly toe the line of plagiarism, a tool like IBM's Watson can not only prevent sartorial copies, but also bring about transparency in the design process.How brands are using AI to improve a consumer's shopping experienceFor a brand, one of the main areas of focus is always going to be improving a consumer's shopping experience, offline or online. It is directly proportional to improvement in retail productivity. Take luxury brands like Burberry and Tommy Hilfiger for example—they have chatbots to help users with their queries 24/7.Farfetch's Store of the Future, an augmented retail vision that aims to use data to improve the experience of a shopper, is another instance. “Consumers enjoy the experience of being in-store, building a relationship with the sales associate and experiencing merchandise in the luxury store setting, yet technology has meant that consumers now expect ultra-personalised experiences both in their real and digital lives, and expect those worlds to be seamlessly connected,” Farfetch explains on its website. “Farfetch Store of the Future aims to improve retail productivity by capturing consumer data and enhancing interactions between consumers and sales associates, both in store and when the consumer interacts with the retailer or brand online.”Most PopularCulture & LivingLatest OTT releases this week: 12 new movies and TV shows to watch on Netflix, Prime Video and moreBy Prabal Sharma, Vogue IndiaWeddingsExclusive: Inside Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s final wedding celebration in MumbaiBy Elise Taylor, Vogue IndiaFashionThe most spectacular jewellery from Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's weddingBy Vogue Staff, Vogue IndiaAccording to Falguni and Shane Peacock, there are two types of buyers. “The first type is the one who knows what they want to buy and are sure of the product. The second type is who browses through products and purchases on the basis on their visuals. AI helps a brand in making those visuals more pleasing, and more interactive with the audience,” they say. The designer duo are also among the first in India to launch an interactive online shoppable video where the consumer gets to take a closer look at a product worn by a celebrity, and also help put together a look specifically for them. Needless to say, all the products can be purchased online. “The video features Kartik Aryan and lets the watcher choose from the options presented. So in a way, the watcher is creating his look.”Gupta's approach is also geared into making it simpler for the consumer. “User experience is a vital element in the world of digital media. Today, a website can make you fill a simple questionnaire and a virtual stylist can pick out outfit options for you based on your answers. This is an algorithm of AI that can tabulate a person's interest using relevant data. It works to make the shopping experience as smooth and efficient as possible,” he says. Visual recognition, purchasing recommendations and customised options are other benefits of AI in online fashion retail.Most PopularCulture & LivingLatest OTT releases this week: 12 new movies and TV shows to watch on Netflix, Prime Video and moreBy Prabal Sharma, Vogue IndiaWeddingsExclusive: Inside Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s final wedding celebration in MumbaiBy Elise Taylor, Vogue IndiaFashionThe most spectacular jewellery from Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's weddingBy Vogue Staff, Vogue IndiaFindow, founded by Zarine Bajaj, is an online platform that uses advanced AI to help buyers discover fashion designers, retail stores, brands and boutiques nearest to them.

Does this mean that AI will one day replace manual fashion design? Or will it help a designer in infusing their work with increased creativity and faster processes?What's the future of AI and fashion?“We're all living in a world where technology moves in tandem with fashion. AI is an open space that allows you to construct, de-construct ideas and create something new altogether. This space is encouraging creativity and is aiding the fashion industry in a huge way,” Gupta thinks. “AI opens out a lot of ideas as to what technology can do and how can you incorporate it in your work. It is of great help if a brand knows how to utilise it,” say Shane and Falguni.AI's mathematical computing power promises speed, which can be beneficial across the fashion supply chain. The advancement in algorithms also points towards AI bring used for predictive trend forecasting. Its ability to store and read a large size of data can help retail brands and fashion houses in recognising a consumer's wants and needs. Lastly, AI is sure to create new jobs, but its automated processes will also mean that a lot of jobs that are done by human hands will become redundant. If brands keep this in consideration and take the first mover's advantage, the future of AI in fashion could definitely be bright.Also read:Get a closer look at Gaurav Gupta and IBM Watson's cognitive sari gownIs Artificial Intelligence the new artist we need to watch out for?",What is the future of Artificial Intelligence in fashion? | VOGUE India,fashion,,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Fashion', 'item': 'https://www.vogue.in/fashion'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'BALMAIN', 'item': 'https://www.vogue.in/topics/balmain'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'What is the future of Artificial Intelligence in fashion?'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,"You know change is in the air when virtual—that is, non-human—Instagram influencers are posing with traditional front row bigwigs at fashion weeks.

AI “Sputnik moment” (say it in Chinese*) is at hand
China is overtaking the US not just in the sheer volume of AI research papers submitted and published, but also in the production of high-impact papers as measured by the top 50%, top 10%, and top 1% most-cited papers. “By projecting current trends, we see that China is likely to have more top-10% papers by 2020 and more top-1% papers by 2025” (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence).

AI continues to be popular among business executives, regardless of complications, concerns and confusion
73% of senior executives see AI/machine learning and automation as areas they want to maintain or increase investment in but only 33% state that they plan to invest more in getting better visibility of their processes, not taking into account that understanding their current processes first could help them work out which technologies would be most beneficial to their business (Celonis).
71% of U.S. enterprises plan to leverage more AI/ML tools for security this year but only 49% of IT professionals feel extremely comfortable using these tools, 76% don’t care if their companies leverage them and 56% still aren’t even sure what AI and ML really mean (Webroot).
PROMOTED
82% of IT and business decision makers agree that company-wide strategies to invest in AI-driven technologies would offer significant competitive advantages, only 29% said their companies have those strategies in place (DXC).

66% of security experts said they would rely upon AI, down from the 74% who said they would in 2018. Cisco attributes the decline to their increased confidence that “migrating to the cloud will improve protection efforts, while apparently decreasing reliance on less proven technologies such as artificial intelligence” (Cisco).
83% of IT professionals are confident their organization has everything it needs to defend against advanced AI- and ML-based cyberattacks, yet 36% reported their organization has suffered a damaging cyberattack within the last 12 months despite using AI/ML security tools (Webroot).
Nearly 90% of IT leaders see their use of AI/ML increasing in the future and 41% look for technology that is powered by AI, a top factor in their purchasing decisions. Their top concerns: Data security (47%), implementing AI/ML (40%), driving innovation and implementing new tech (40%) (Adobe).
37% of service leaders are either piloting or using artificial intelligence (AI) bots and virtual customer assistants (VCAs), and 67% of those leaders believe they are high-value tools in the contact center; 68% of service leaders believe AI bots and VCAs will be of significant importance for them and their organizations in the next two years (Gartner2).
The race against the machine is on. Still, some humans trust AI more than their governments. 
56% of Europeans express weariness about a world where machines perform most of the tasks currently done by humans (IE University).
74% of Europeans think that businesses should only be allowed to substitute jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy and 72% think that governments should set limits to the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines (IE University).
61% of internet users worldwide were worried about AI affecting the availability of work, 58% believe governments need to regulate AI to protect jobs, 32% expressed unease about the potential ethical issues associated with AI, and 31% were concerned about lack of transparency in AI-based decision making (BCG).
25% of Europeans are somewhat or totally in favor of letting an artificial intelligence make important decisions about the running of their country; 43% in the Netherlands, 31% in the UK and Germany (IE University).
45% of retail customer service issues/inquiries have been fully automated without affecting CSAT scores; bots have been used to assist agents by collecting upfront information in 25% of issues; agents and bots combined have been able to handle twice the amount of tickets within a given time period (Helpshift).
Inmates at two prisons in Finland are classifying data to train artificial intelligence algorithms for a startup, Vainu, which sees the partnership as a kind of prison reform that teaches valuable skills. But “other experts say it plays into the exploitative economics of prisoners being required to work for very low wages,” according to The Verge.
“AI” is the new “Big Data” and the new “New Economy.” Tech bubbles are defined by poorly-defined terms and the proliferation of billion- and trillion-dollar forecasts leading to investors’ irrational exuberance
MMC Ventures reviewed the activities, focus and funding of 2,830 purported AI startups in the 13 EU countries most active in AI and found that in approximately 40% of the cases there was no evidence of AI being “material to the company’s value proposition” (MMC Ventures).
MMC Ventures: “‘AI’ is a general term that refers to hardware or software that exhibit behaviour which appears intelligent.”**
Worldwide spending on artificial intelligence (AI) systems is forecast to reach $35.8 billion in 2019, an increase of 44% over 2018, and to more than double to $79.2 billion in 2022 (IDC).
“IDC defines cognitive/Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems as a set of technologies that use deep natural language processing and understanding to answer questions and provide recommendations and direction.”
Business value derived from AI reached $1.2 trillion worldwide in 2018 and will grow to $3.9 trillion by 2022 (Gartner).
Gartner: “Artificial intelligence (AI) applies advanced analysis and logic-based techniques, including machine learning, to interpret events, support and automate decisions, and take actions.”
“We are investing $100 billion in just one thing, AI”—Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son (telling CNBC that all the 70 or investments of his Vision Fund—including Uber, DoorDash, WeWork, and Slack--have been focused on AI).
After years in the (mostly Canadian) wilderness followed by (almost) seven years of plenty, Deep Learning is officially recognized as the dominant AI paradigm
“ACM named Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun recipients of the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing…  their ideas recently resulted in major technological advances, and their methodology is now the dominant paradigm in the field”—Fathers of the Deep Learning Revolution Receive ACM Turing Award
""For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense. They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to young researchers is, don't be put off if everyone tells you what you are doing is silly""—Geoffrey Hinton
“What we have seen is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the science. History turned their way, and I am in awe”—Oren Etzioni, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence
[In October 2012, when a convolutional neural network achieved an error rate of only 16% in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, a significant improvement over the 25% error rate achieved by the best entry the year before,] “The difference there was so great that a lot of people, you could see a big switch in their head going ‘clunk.’ Now they were convinced”—Yann LeCun
“…science worked the way it's meant to work… until we could produce results that were clearly better than the current state of the art, people were very skeptical”—Geoffrey Hinton
“This is not just a Turing Award for these particular people. It’s recognition that machine learning has become a central field in computer science”—Pedro Domingos, University of Washington
[Anyone hoping to make the next Turing-winning breakthrough in AI] “should not follow the trend—which right now is deep learning”—Yoshua Bengio
“Whether we’ll able to use new methods to create human-level intelligence, well, there’s probably another 50 mountains to climb, including ones we can’t even see yet. We’ve only climbed the first mountain. Maybe the second”—Yann LeCun
AI is not perfect and will never be. Same as the humans using AI.
68% of Facebook, Google (YouTube), Reddit and Twitter employees think their companies have not done enough to stop the spread of violent content online (Blind’s Work Talk Blog).
“Many people have asked why artificial intelligence (AI) didn’t detect the video from last week’s attack automatically. AI has made massive progress over the years and in many areas, which has enabled us to proactively detect the vast majority of the content we remove. But it’s not perfect… this particular video did not trigger our automatic detection systems. To achieve that we will need to provide our systems with large volumes of data of this specific kind of content, something which is difficult as these events are thankfully rare”—Guy Rosen, VP, Product Management, Facebook
AI is not perfect. Smart and well-endowed people hope it can be improved by establishing research and education centers focusing on “multidisciplinary collaboration and diversity of thought”
MIT President Rafael Reif said the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing will train students in an interdisciplinary approach to AI. It will also train them to take a step back and weigh potential downsides of AI, which is poised to disrupt “every sector of our society.”
Stanford University is launching a new institute committed to studying, guiding and developing human-centered artificial intelligence technologies and applications. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) is building on a tradition of leadership in artificial intelligence at the university, as well as a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and diversity of thought. The mission of the institute is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.
“There’s no reason why computers can’t think like we [do] and can’t be ethical and moral like we aspire to be”—Patrick H. Winston, the Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT
MIT’s Marvin Minsky (1969) and Stanford’s John McCarthy (1971) received the Turing award for their pioneering AI work. Both saw the development of computers that think like we do as the primary goal of AI. Have they failed only because they have gone about achieving this goal with the wrong approach (encoding logic instead of improving machine learning, as this year’s Turing laureates have done) or because the goal itself led them astray? Does “diversity of thought” mean including researchers and practitioners that do not agree with the assumption that computers could be made to think like us (Minsky: “The human brain is just a computer that happens to be made out of meat”)? Will abandoning this goal and questioning this assumption help improve and advance “AI”?

McDonald’s is aiming to use machine learning to target customers’ appetites and personalize their orders.
The worldwide burger chain has made a $300-million investment in such personalization, acquiring Dynamic Yield, an Israeli artificial intelligence start-up.
Dynamic Yield has built technology focused on decision logicOpens a new window , which personalizes products based on customers’ former selections. McDonald’s wants to use the advance to become the fast-food leader in customizing its drive-through windows to meet changing conditions, including trending menu items, time of day and weather.
It’s a way for McDonald’s to push its other technological advances, such as self-order kiosks, to the next level .
“What we hadn’t done is begun to connect the technology together, and get the various pieces talking to each other,” McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook toldOpens a new window  Wired. “How do you transition from mass marketing to mass personalization? To do that, you’ve really got to unlock the data within that ecosystem in a way that’s useful to a customer.”
The concept driving the purchase is predictive analyticsOpens a new window , as McDonald’s works to make better use of the information its customers provide, using it to further push sales by suggesting that customers add a few well-chosen items to their order.
Dynamic Yield, which also includes Ikea, Sephora and Urban Outfitters as customers, sees a host of fields ripe for personalization through its technology. It offers on its web site to customize experiences in industries ranging from financial services to gaming to retail.
The company says its platforms can help companies change formerly static content into personalized experiences, tailor page layouts to visitors’ preferences and automate content personalization on a scale level.
“Let machine learning algorithms dynamically select the most relevant content for each user in carousels, multi-item banners and more, by syncing your personalization campaigns with fresh data feeds and creative libraries,” according to the company’s site.Opens a new window 
The beauty of the AI personalization technology developed by Dynamic Yield is that it can capture and analyze the information gathered by various transaction mechanisms, including web, email, kiosks and call centers.
“The platform’s data management capabilities provide for a unified view of the customer, allowing the rapid and scalable creation of highly targeted digital interactions,” writes CrunchbaseOpens a new window  in an analysis of the company.
The new technology is all part of McDonald’s gamble that artificial intelligenceOpens a new window  can help it become more competitive in a tough industry.
“The AI-powered personalization initiative could help McDonald’s upsell products to customers based on their orders, such as by detecting an order made for children and suggesting a snack for the parent picking it up,” accordingOpens a new window  to RetailTouchpoints.
The fast-food company plans to add the technology to 1,000 of its restaurants in the coming months, eventually expanding it to the company’s 14,000 locations.
Artificial intelligence is driving this form of marketing, which is expected to grow in popularity and move into new fieldsOpens a new window .
“There are many tangible benefits of mapping your customer’s journey, including improved efficiency within your internal operations and better end results for sales,” says Greg KihstromOpens a new window , senior vice president of Digital at Yes&, a performance-based marketing agency in Washington, D.C. “Increasingly, marketers are turning to automation, personalization and artificial intelligence to enhance the customer experience within that journey.”
The reason AI-based marketing is so successful is that it works: A 2017 Personalization Report foundOpens a new window  that 44&percnt; of customers will likely become repeat buyers based on personalized shopping experiences.
And AI-aided menu selections are likely to trigger unplanned spending. Nearly 50&percnt; of U.S. shoppers have said that they bought a product in the last three months they had not planned to after the brand made a personalized recommendation.
Company representatives have said they hope eventually to include license-plate recognition as part of their strategy, enabling artificial intelligence to identify your car and make suitable suggestions accordingly.
“When you look at the answers that this decision engine provides, it may not seem so obvious to begin with, but for customers it makes sense,” says Daniel Henry, McDonald’s EVP and global CIO. “It’s not just about the individual, it’s also taking training information from other customers. It’s only going to get smarter and smarter, the more customers interact with it.”

By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Apr 3, 2019, 11:47 AM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 NewIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeLast week, Google announced that it is creating a new external ethics board to guide its “responsible development of AI.” On the face of it, this seemed like an admirable move, but the company was hit with immediate criticism.Researchers from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and top universities objected to the board’s inclusion of Kay Coles James, the president of right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation. They pointed out that James and her organization campaign against anti-discrimination laws for LGBTQ groups and sponsor climate change denial, making her unfit to offer ethical advice to the world’s most powerful AI company. An open petition demanding James’ removal was launched (it currently has more than 1,700 signatures), and as part of the backlash, one member of the newly formed board resigned.Google has yet to say anything about all of this (it didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from The Verge), but to many in the AI community, it’s a clear example of Big Tech’s inability to deal honestly and openly with the ethics of its work. Ethics boards and charters aren’t changing how companies operateThis might come as a surprise if you’ve followed recent debates over AI ethics. In the past few years, tech companies certainly seem to have embraced ethical self-scrutiny: establishing ethics boards, writing ethics charters, and sponsoring research in topics like algorithmic bias. But are these boards and charters doing anything? Are they changing how these companies work or holding them accountable in any meaningful way? Academic Ben Wagner says tech’s enthusiasm for ethics paraphernalia is just “ethics washing,” a strategy to avoid government regulation. When researchers uncover new ways for technology to harm marginalized groups or infringe on civil liberties, tech companies can point to their boards and charters and say, “Look, we’re doing something.” It deflects criticism, and because the boards lack any power, it means the companies don’t change.“Most of the ethics principles developed now lack any institutional framework,” Wagner tells The Verge. “They’re non-binding. This makes it very easy for companies to look [at ethical issues] and go, ‘That’s important,’ but continue with whatever it is they were doing beforehand.” Think of it like CEO Jack Dorsey’s repeated assurances that’s he thinking hard about Twitter’s problems with abuse, harassment, and neo-Nazis. He keeps thinking, and things on the site stay pretty much the same. At a certain point, all of this contemplation looks like a substitute for actual policy change.An ethics explosionGoogle isn’t the only company with an ethics board and charter, of course. Its London AI subsidiary DeepMind has one, too, though it’s never revealed who’s on it or what they’re up to. Microsoft has its own AI principles, and it founded its AI ethics committee in 2018. Amazon has started sponsoring research into “fairness in artificial intelligence” with the help of the National Science Foundation, while Facebook has even co-founded an AI ethics research center in Germany. Despite their proliferation, these programs tend to share fundamental weaknesses, says Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist and lead for responsible AI at management consultancy Accenture. One of the most important points is that they lack transparency. Chowdhury notes that many of society’s most important institutions, from universities to hospitals, have, over time, developed effective review boards that represent the institutions’ values in the public interest. But in the case of Big Tech, it’s unclear whose interests are being represented. “This board cannot make changes, it can just make suggestions.”“It’s not that people are against governance bodies, but we have no transparency into how they’re built,” Chowdhury tells The Verge. With regard to Google’s most recent board, she says, “This board cannot make changes, it can just make suggestions. They can’t talk about it with the public.

When Microsoft set up its AI ethics oversight committee Aether, for example, the company said that “significant sales” had been cut off because of the group’s recommendations.

The cultural influences of libertarianism and cyberutopianism have made many engineers distrustful of government intervention. But now these companies have as much power as nation states without the checks and balances to match. “This is not about technology; this is about systems of democracy and governance,” says Chowdhury. “And when you have technologists, VCs, and business people thinking they know what democracy is, that is a problem.”The solution many experts suggest is government regulation. It’s the only way to ensure real oversight and accountability. In a political climate where breaking up big tech companies has become a presidential platform, the timing seems right. Jack Poulson, a former researcher at Google who resigned over the company’s work on its censored Chinese search engine, says that even the recent backlash over Google’s ethics board is something of a distraction compared to this bigger issue. “The major battle is accountability.”“In a sense, we are playing into their hands by polarizing [the issue of] ethics,” Poulson tells The Verge. “The major battle is accountability. And accountability is less likely if we polarize what is currently bipartisan concern over Big Tech.” Legislation is proven to work, too. Last week, Facebook was charged by the US government for allowing customers to target ads at users based on their ethnicity. It marks the first time federal anti-discrimination laws have been applied in this area. As Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, put it: “Using a computer to limit a person’s housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone’s face.” It’s not hard to imagine biased AI systems being prosecuted along similar lines. The difficult task now is finding crossovers between existing legislation and the malicious impact of new technology. After that, new legislation needs to be drafted to fill the gaps. Chowdhury says that since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke last year, there’s been a renewed interest among US lawmakers to tackle these problems. But a major problem is a lack of familiarity with the technology. As was demonstrated during Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional hearings, the people in charge of reining in these tech companies often know little about the tech itself. “They are trying their best, absolutely trying their best, to grapple with something that is completely outside their wheelhouse,” says Chowdhury of US politicians. “But a lot of the power — the intellectual knowledge — is held by the very bodies they would regulate.” That could mean that, as with the establishment of ethics boards, these firms get to shape the way they’re regulated. As Poulson puts it, “Why do tech companies get to choose their own critics?” It’s a dynamic that’s long worked in tech’s favor, and we’re seeing it action right now, with Zuckerberg calling for regulation of Facebook but on the company’s own terms. Wagner notes that whatever steps are made to regulate AI, the thinking has to be global, not US-centric. The technologies being developed by Google, Amazon, and others will be deployed around the world, and decisions made in America will affect more than just Americans. “We saw this with stuff like Facebook going into Myanmar,” he says. “This is a global challenge.” Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeTesla’s big, epic, confusing future | The Vergecast

Researchers from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and top universities objected to the board’s inclusion of Kay Coles James, the president of right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation. They pointed out that James and her organization campaign against anti-discrimination laws for LGBTQ groups and sponsor climate change denial, making her unfit to offer ethical advice to the world’s most powerful AI company. An open petition demanding James’ removal was launched (it currently has more than 1,700 signatures), and as part of the backlash, one member of the newly formed board resigned.

Google has yet to say anything about all of this (it didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from The Verge), but to many in the AI community, it’s a clear example of Big Tech’s inability to deal honestly and openly with the ethics of its work. 

""Ethics boards and charters aren’t changing how companies operate""

This might come as a surprise if you’ve followed recent debates over AI ethics. In the past few years, tech companies certainly seem to have embraced ethical self-scrutiny: establishing ethics boards, writing ethics charters, and sponsoring research in topics like algorithmic bias. But are these boards and charters doing anything? Are they changing how these companies work or holding them accountable in any meaningful way? 

Academic Ben Wagner says tech’s enthusiasm for ethics paraphernalia is just “ethics washing,” a strategy to avoid government regulation. When researchers uncover new ways for technology to harm marginalized groups or infringe on civil liberties, tech companies can point to their boards and charters and say, “Look, we’re doing something.” It deflects criticism, and because the boards lack any power, it means the companies don’t change.

“Most of the ethics principles developed now lack any institutional framework,” Wagner tells The Verge. “They’re non-binding. This makes it very easy for companies to look [at ethical issues] and go, ‘That’s important,’ but continue with whatever it is they were doing beforehand.” 

Think of it like CEO Jack Dorsey’s repeated assurances that’s he thinking hard about Twitter’s problems with abuse, harassment, and neo-Nazis. He keeps thinking, and things on the site stay pretty much the same. At a certain point, all of this contemplation looks like a substitute for actual policy change.

An ethics explosion

Google isn’t the only company with an ethics board and charter, of course. Its London AI subsidiary DeepMind has one, too, though it’s never revealed who’s on it or what they’re up to. Microsoft has its own AI principles, and it founded its AI ethics committee in 2018. Amazon has started sponsoring research into “fairness in artificial intelligence” with the help of the National Science Foundation, while Facebook has even co-founded an AI ethics research center in Germany. 

Despite their proliferation, these programs tend to share fundamental weaknesses, says Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist and lead for responsible AI at management consultancy Accenture. One of the most important points is that they lack transparency. 

Chowdhury notes that many of society’s most important institutions, from universities to hospitals, have, over time, developed effective review boards that represent the institutions’ values in the public interest. But in the case of Big Tech, it’s unclear whose interests are being represented. 

""“This board cannot make changes, it can just make suggestions.”""

“It’s not that people are against governance bodies, but we have no transparency into how they’re built,” Chowdhury tells The Verge. With regard to Google’s most recent board, she says, “This board cannot make changes, it can just make suggestions. They can’t talk about it with the public. So what oversight capabilities do they have?”

When boards do make interventions, only the company who operates it really knows why. When Microsoft set up its AI ethics oversight committee Aether, for example, the company said that “significant sales” had been cut off because of the group’s recommendations. But it’s never explained what customers or applications were vetoed. Where exactly does Microsoft draw the line on unethical uses of AI? Only the company itself knows. 

A report last year from research institute AI Now said there’s been a “rush to adopt” ethical codes, but there’s no corresponding introduction of mechanisms that can “backstop these ... commitments.” The report points out that there’s also scant evidence on a corporate and an individual level if these codes and charters even have much effect.

IBM offers similar evidence. The company has been vocal about its ethical efforts in AI, and last year, it created an ethnically diverse dataset to help remove racial bias from facial recognition systems.

Snack Delivery Robot
There’s a six-wheeled mobile vending machine robot tooling around the University of the Pacific chockful of PepsiCo snacks and beverages from Hello Goodness—a healthier line-up that includes SunChips, Baked Lay’s and bubly sparkling water. Named Snackbot, these self-driving robots are a partnership between Robby Technologies and PepsiCo. Students can order their snacks from the Snackbot app, and then the robot will deliver it to more than 50 spots across the campus without charging a delivery fee. The bots have a range of 20 miles on a single battery charge, and they can even navigate at night, in rain or up curbs thanks to onboard headlights and all-wheel drive capabilities.
Snackbot represents the solution to the needs of strapped-for-time college students and their preferences identified through PepsiCo’s research. There are three to five Snackbots on campus to keep up with demand.
PROMOTED
Manufacturing with Machine Learning
The Frito-Lay (a subsidiary of PepsiCo) manufacturing plant is benefiting from machine learning. One project uses lasers to hit chips and then listen to the sounds coming off the chip to determine texture. Algorithms process the sound and determine the chip texture to automate the quality check for Frito-Lay’s chip processing systems.
From this beginning, Shameer Mirza, senior research and development engineer at PepsiCo, realized several more applications of machine learning could impact process control within the factory. Next, Mirza developed a machine learning model that could be used with a vision system to be able to predict the weight of potatoes being processed. This led to considerable savings for the company because it no longer had to spend $300,000 per line (they had 35 in the U.S. alone) for weighing elements. Mirza's systems used only a camera and the machine learning model and are essentially just additional data points collected with no additional cost.
Another project still in development would assess the ""percent peel"" of a potato after it had gone through the peeling process. By understanding this data, it can help the Frito-Lay team to optimize the potato peeling system. This project alone is estimated to save the company more than $1 million a year just in the United States.
PepsiCo is launching a global training course on advanced machine learning and computer vision for its internal research and development associates this year to broaden its team's abilities to use these technologies to continue finding insights that will drive efficiencies in its manufacturing facilities.
Vera Streamlines the Hiring Process
PepsiCo used Robot Vera for the first time to phone and interview candidates for open positions in sales, as drivers and to fill factory vacancies in Russia when HR professionals needed to fill 250 jobs in two months. Vera was developed by Russian startup Stafory and is capable of interviewing 1,500 candidates in nine hours, a job that would take humans nine weeks.
Advanced speech recognition software and tools from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Russian technology company Yandex allow Vera to make calls and screen candidates for open positions such as fork-lift operators, factory workers, and sales staff. Its software can scan CVs to determine if a potential candidate has the right experience for the position, can respond to yes and no answers, ask follow-up questions and send out follow-up correspondence. It can also forward transcripts of a call to a human HR specialist for further review. So far, the reception from the majority of candidates when dealing with the robot has been positive. There was a bit more hesitation from human HR professionals. It turns out one of the biggest hurdles is ""reprogramming humans"" to feel comfortable with the technology.
PepsiCo’s In-House Technology Platform Ada
Ada provides “augmented intelligence” that relies on human’s insight in combination with algorithms. The company expects this philosophy will lead to rapid learning. Ada can pull together data from a variety of sources to allow PepsiCo to better leverage the massive amounts of data it collects. Ultimately, Ada will be involved in all aspects of operations including innovation, design, research and price decisions.
Other areas that PepsiCo will put data to use is in product development and sales and marketing. The company has used social prediction tools that aggregate publicly available consumer conversations in combination with its own data to identify new products to bring to market. This represents a transition for the company to create insights from the data it has and focus it on actionable activities. As more and more data get layered, PepsiCo is able to identify trends and marketing placements.
Pep Worx: Big Data and Analytics Platform
The cloud-based data and analytics platform PepsiCo uses called Pep Worx helps the company advise retail stores on the best items to stock, where to place them and what promotions to use. When the company wanted to launch Quaker Overnight Oats, it was able to identify 24 million households from a dataset of 110 million US households that it felt would be appropriate to market the product to.

The question of whether technology is good or bad depends on how it’s developed and used. Nowhere is that more topical than in technolgies using artificial intelligence.
When developed and used appropriately, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the way we live, work, communicate and travel. 
New AI-enabled medical technologies are being developed to improve patient care. There are persuasive indications that autonomous vehicles will improve safety and reduce the road toll. Machine learning and automation are streamlining workflows and allowing us to work smarter.

      To protect us from the risks of advanced artificial intelligence, we need to act now




Around the world, AI-enabled technology is increasingly being adopted by individuals, governments, organisations and institutions. But along with the vast potential to improve our quality of life, comes a risk to our basic human rights and freedoms. 
Appropriate oversight, guidance and understanding of the way AI is used and developed in Australia must be prioritised.
AI gone wild may conjure images of The Terminator and Ex Machina movies, but it is much simpler, fundamental issues that need to be addressed at present, such as:

how data is used to develop AI
whether an AI system is being used fairly
in which situations should we continue to rely on human decision-making?

We have an AI ethics plan
That’s why, in partnership with government and industry, we’ve developed an ethics framework for AI in Australia. The aim is to catalyse the discussion around how AI should be used and developed in Australia.
The ethical framework looks at various case studies from around the world to discuss how AI has been used in the past and the impacts that it has had. The case studies help us understand where things went wrong and how to avoid repeating past mistakes.
We also looked at what was being done around the world to address ethical concerns about AI development and use.

Based on the core issues and impacts of AI, eight principles were identified to support the ethical use and development of AI in Australia.

Generates net benefits: The AI system must generate benefits for people that are greater than the costs.
Do no harm: Civilian AI systems must not be designed to harm or deceive people and should be implemented in ways that minimise any negative outcomes.
Regulatory and legal compliance: The AI system must comply with all relevant international, Australian local, state/territory and federal government obligations, regulations and laws.
Privacy protection: Any system, including AI systems, must ensure people’s private data is protected and kept confidential and prevent data breaches that could cause reputational, psychological, financial, professional or other types of harm.
Fairness: The development or use of the AI system must not result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups. This requires particular attention to ensure the “training data” is free from bias or characteristics which may cause the algorithm to behave unfairly.
Transparency and explainability: People must be informed when an algorithm is being used that impacts them and they should be provided with information about what information the algorithm uses to make decisions.
Contestability: When an algorithm impacts a person there must be an efficient process to allow that person to challenge the use or output of the algorithm.
Accountability: People and organisations responsible for the creation and implementation of AI algorithms should be identifiable and accountable for the impacts of that algorithm, even if the impacts are unintended.

In addition to the core principles various toolkit items are identified in the framework that could be used to help support these principles. These include impact assessments, ongoing monitoring and public consultation.
A plan, what about action?
But principles and ethical goals can only go so far. At some point we will need to get to work on deciding how we are going to implement and achieve them. 
There are various complexities to consider when discussing the ethical use and development of AI. The vast reach of the technology has potential to impact every facet of our lives.
AI applications are already in use across households, businesses and governments, most Australians are already being impacted by them. 
There is a pressing need to examine the effects that AI has on the vulnerable and on minority groups, making sure we protect these individuals and communities from bias, discrimination and exploitation. (Remember Tay, the racist chatbot?)
There is also the fact that AI used in Australia will often be developed in other countries, so how do we ensure it adheres to Australian standards and expectations?
Your say
The framework explores these issues and forms some of Australia’s first steps on the journey towards the positive development and use of AI. But true progress needs input from stakeholders across government, business, academia and broader society.




      Read more:
      Careful how you treat today's AI: it might take revenge in the future




That’s why ethical framework discussion paper is now open to public comment. You have until May 31, 2019, to have your say in Australia’s digital future.
With a proactive approach to the ethical development of AI, Australia can do more than just mitigate against any risks. If we can build AI for a fairer go, we can secure a competitive advantage as well as safeguard the rights of Australians.

Allied Irish Banks (AIB) has announced a partnership with Boxever to improve the customer experience with Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Boxever will work with AIB for a three-year period during which it will aim to improve the user experience of the bank’s customers. Thanks to Boxever’s technology, AIB will give greater priority to the customer, offering true results and one-to-one customisation. 
Boxever, in fact, is a personalisation engine that uses data and artificial intelligence (AI) to help companies improve their customer interactions and offer new user experiences.
First and foremost, Boxever builds accurate customer profiles from the data extracted from all their activities within the company’s platform. Artificial intelligence is then used to automate decisions on how to personalise interactions on each channel and at any time.
Thanks to this partnership with AIB, Boxever is also expanding into the financial services sector, where customers have more complex and rapidly evolving habits and desires. 
AIB, on the other hand, is a financial services group mainly active in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. 
Seamus Murphy, Chief Digital Officer of AIB, said: 

“Our customers’ expectations are shifting rapidly. We have to be agile and keep ahead of this change to continue to offer a market-leading experience. Boxever’s personalisation platform will help us to do just that – allowing us to reach our customers with the right message, at the right time and through the right channel. This partnership with an indigenous Irish company will add some of the industry’s best technology and expertise to our digital transformation effort”.

Dave O’Flanagan, CEO of Boxever, said: 

“We’re really excited about partnering with AIB as we continue to expand our presence in the financial services sector. Together we will work to enhance the experience for AIB’s customers, and drive positive results throughout their business. It’s going to be fascinating to see the impact our industry-leading personalisation platform – powered by data and AI – will have for the AIB and its customers as we move forward together”.

In partnership with IDC, Microsoft unveils the Malaysia findings of its study on Artificial Intelligence – to analyse how Malaysia is embracing AI, the impact of AI on Malaysia’s businesses & economy 
Despite clear benefits in adopting the technology, only 26% of organizations in Malaysia today have embarked on their AI journeys.
Culture and Skills are among key barriers for organizations to succeed in AI. 

Malaysia, 2 April, 2019 – By 2021, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will allow the rate of innovation to almost double (x1.8) and increase employee productivity improvements by 60% in Malaysia, according to the country’s business leaders. The study from Microsoft and IDC Asia/Pacific, Future Ready Business: Assessing Asia Pacific’s Growth Potential Through AI surveyed 100 business leaders and 100 workers in Malaysia.

While seven in 10 business leaders polled agreed that AI is instrumental for their organization’s competitiveness, only 26% of organizations in Malaysia have embarked on their AI journeys. Those companies that have adopted AI expect it to increase their competitiveness by 2.2 times in 2021.
While seven in 10 business leaders polled agreed that AI is instrumental for their organization’s competitiveness, only 26% of organizations in Malaysia have embarked on their AI journeys. Those companies that have adopted AI expect it to increase their competitiveness by 2.2 times in 2021.
“Today, every company is a software company, and increasingly, every interaction is digital. To be successful in this new world, organizations need to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology; and secondly, they need to build their own unique digital capabilities,” said K Raman, Managing Director, Microsoft Malaysia. “AI is the defining technology of our time that significantly accelerates business transformation, enables innovation, boosts employee productivity, and ensures further growth.  Economies and businesses that have yet to embark on their AI journey run a real risk of missing out on the competitive benefits that are enjoyed by leaders.”
Why adopt AI?
For the organizations that have implemented AI initiatives, the top five business drivers to adopt the technology were (in priority order): Better customer engagements and higher competitiveness (both tied as the number one driver with 31% respondents respectively); accelerated innovation and improved efficiency (12%); as well as more productive employees (8%).
Jun-Fwu Chin, Research Director for IDC Asia Pacific Datacenter Group said: “Last year, organizations that have adopted AI saw tangible improvements in those areas in the range of 17% to 34%. They forecast further improvements of at least 1.6 times in the three-year horizon, with the biggest jump expected in accelerated innovation, higher competitiveness and better customer engagements.”

Malaysia needs to build on AI culture, as well as the rest of the dimensions
The study evaluated six dimensions critical to ensuring the success of a nation’s AI journey. It uncovered that Malaysia needs to focus on improving on all areas, particularly its data and investments in order to accelerate its AI journey.
“Malaysia is not ready yet for AI. To succeed in AI race, Malaysia needs to substantially improve its readiness.  Organizations’ leadership should make AI a core part of their strategy and develop a learning agility culture. They have to continuously invest in this transformative technology for the long-term success, sometimes without immediate returns,” Chin said. “There is an urgent need for talents and tools to develop, deploy and monitor AI models, along with the availability of a robust data estate with the adequate governance.”
Business leaders who are adopting AI face three top challenges a lack of thought leadership and leadership commitment to invest in AI; lack of skills, resources and continuous learning programs and lack of advanced analytics or adequate infrastructure and tools to develop actionable insights.
The study showed that to move ahead on their AI journeys businesses must create the right organizational culture. Majority of business leaders and workers surveyed believe that cultural traits that support AI journeys, such as risk-taking, proactive innovation, as well as cross-function partnerships among teams, are not pervasive today. “Overall, workers in Malaysia are more sceptical than business leaders about the cultural readiness of their organizations,” added Chin.

“Business leaders must now embrace a new culture, where innovation and continuous learning are core components of the organizational culture. It sets the stage for agility, adaptability and growth,” said Raman.
Organizations need to address skills challenge for an AI-enabled workforce
The study found that Malaysia’s business leaders and workers hold positive viewpoints about the AI’s impact on the future of jobs. More than half (67% of business leaders and 64% of workers) believe that AI will either help to do their existing jobs better or reduce repetitive tasks.
“When it comes to creating or replacing jobs, 17% of business leaders believe that AI will create new jobs, while 10% also feel that the technology will replace. Interestingly, workers are more optimistic, with only 7% expecting AI to replace jobs, and 18% to create new ones. At the same time, almost 11% of workers expect no impact to their jobs in three years from now.” said Chin.

The study also found that workers are more willing to reskill than business leaders believe they are. 23% of business leaders felt that workers have no interest to develop new skills, whereas only 10% of workers are not interested.
“Microsoft’s vision for AI is first and foremost about people. AI technology cannot progress without them. This means that millions will need to transform themselves into skilled workers as well as learners that an AI future needs,” said Raman. “It is heartening to see that 82% of businesses prioritize skilling and reskilling of workers in the future. They plan to invest as much, or even more, in human capital than in new technology. Even so, 72% of business leaders have yet to implement plans to help their employees’ to acquire the right skills, which is worrying in today’s context. They must have the urgency to support the fundamental shift in training workers for the future.”
The Microsoft AI study surveyed 1,605 business decision markets, and 1,585 workers from 15 markets participated in it. This included 100 business leaders and 100 workers in Malaysia.
Also present, Dr Karl Ng Kah Hou, Director, Data Economy, of Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) later commented, “As technology changes the rules of business, it is imperative to future-proof the Malaysian economy by building a strong digital innovation ecosystem. The potential of Artificial Intelligence is far from being fully exploited thus making now the best time for Malaysia to sprint to the front of the race. Malaysian businesses need to jump onto the bandwagon to embrace digital transformation and leverage digital technologies such as AI to accelerate the shift towards 4IR and retain their competitive edge.”

Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next tread for the industry to enhance engineering design, productivity, speed up shop floor operations and reduce production cost..The Manufacturer's Annual Manufacturing Report 2018 says 92% of senior manufacturing executives believed technologies like AI will empower them to scale up their productivity levels and enable staff to work smarter. Many of the manufacturing units' processes and machine-to-machine interactions have become complex and AI is here to bring simplicity and efficiency to it..Below is a rundown that describes how AI is being used within Industry 4.0 – a name was given to the current trend of automation..Generative Design.Designers and engineers, by giving a clearly defined design as an input, can use AI algorithms (predominantly known as generative design software) to consider conceivable versions of a solution. The solutions obtained can be used to determine which idea worked and which did not, thus advising an optimal solution..Supply Chain Management.Supply Chain is the pillar of the manufacturing unit. Many manufacturers have composite supply chains having various components and specialty tools. Any delay, breakdown or fault can cause a product assembly point to come to a halt. To determine the estimations of market demand, an algorithm can be used to take into account distinguishing demand patterns. Manufacturers can use this data to optimize inventory control, staffing, energy consumption, and make preferable financial decisions..According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, AI-enhanced supply chain management can help companies reduce forecasting errors by 20-50% to optimize stock replenishment..Hybrid Workforce.Development in the field of AI is paving way for shared environments where man and machine work alongside. Thanks to AI and machine learning, robots no longer perform monotonous and repetitive tasks. Collaborative and context-aware robots will improve production throughput in labor-intensive settings, and will increase productivity to 20% for certain tasks, says McKinsey..Predictive Maintenance.AI-enabled tools can foretell when the equipment is expected for maintenance. By means of embedding sensors in manufacturing equipment, AI can capture data like energy consumption of individual machines, study maintenance cycles, scan for the possibility of a defect and then optimize them in the following stage. As the volume of data increases, the system improves at perfecting itself and makes more precise predictions. McKinsey reports that AI-driven predictive maintenance can increase asset productivity by up to 20% and reduce maintenance charges up to 10%..Safer Systems.AI can help increase safety by automating risky activities. Facilitating robots with AI, high-risk jobs can be taken care of with minimum impact. These bots can work in unsafe environments while collecting, tracking, transmitting, and analyzing data at an accuracy level not done by the existing systems..Yield Enhancement .Manufacturers can now use AI systems to decrease scrap rates from faulty products and increase value out of the resources involved in the assembly process..While AI will metamorphose factories in incredible ways, it will also bring forth challenges. According to an Infosys survey, 37% of manufacturers believe that training will be a notable issue when it comes to deploying AI. Some 32% of manufacturers admitted to a need for knowledge about how AI can help the business..The use of AI appears as an innovative leap forward for many in the manufacturing sector. At length, this means implanting &quot;learnability&quot; in employees through a methodical process of established learning..The long-term contribution of AI in the sector is inevitable. While the positives of AI keep on outweighing the negatives, the successful mantra of using AI is to balance: significant automation but with comparable importance on people participation and skill expansion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The fear that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robots will automate many jobs has been growing as technological change accelerates. Some studies have predicted that 40-50% of US jobs could be automated in the next 20 years, and many people are worried that they could be forced into retirement. Per this Oxford Study: 

 “47 percent of U.S. workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years.” 
Is this time different?
The world has navigated a number of industrial revolutions in the past:
PROMOTED

First Industrial Revolution - Steam & Mechanical Production - 1700s & 1800s 
Second Industrial Revolution - Electricity & Mass Production 1870 to 1914
Third Industrial Revolution - Digital Revolution - 1980s
Fourth Industrial Revolution - AI, Robotics, Networks, BioTechnology, Internet of Things - Today

Each time many jobs were lost, but we created new ones and overall employment stayed high after the initial disruption. But this time it feels different partly due to the fact that real wage growth has been low to flat for many people meaning their standard of living isn’t rising. As we’ve become more productive through automation and globalization the share of GDP that goes to labor has fallen, while the share to capital has risen. Basically it’s better to be an investor rather than a worker - unless you have special skills.
Plus it seems like every week there are new headlines announcing new AI and Robot capabilities:

Self driving cars & trucks
Legal research automated
Telemarketing replaced by robo-callers
News articles getting generated by AI
Robots that can open doors, navigate the woods and do flips






Is the fear overblown?
Some experts say yes. I spoke with Ken Goldberg a UC Berkeley Robotics Professor and Eric Brewer a VP at Google and UC Berkeley Computer Science Professor about AI Automation and the Future of Work on a recent podcast.  
Both felt that the fears around AI and Robotics destroying jobs or worse leading to the Singularity where AI takes over are overblown. The Singularity is a term promoted by Ray Kurzweil which predicts that based on Moore’s law and the doubling of computing power per dollar every few years that:

By 2023 a $1,000 computer will have the processing power of 1 human brain
By 2030 the Singularity will occur and runaway AI will emerge
By 2050 a $1,000 computer will have the processing power of all human brains

Instead both Professors feel that predictions like self driving cars will take much longer to play out, and that while some industries may face big disruptions the jobs that get automated will be the boring mundane jobs which will be replaced by more interesting, creative jobs.
Ken Goldberg in particular believes “Rather than worrying about an impending Singularity, consider instead the concept of Multiplicity: where diverse combinations of people and machines work together to solve problems and innovate.“
He’s also written about how AI may not be bad, but instead by good for workers in the Economist.
They are both hopeful for the future where we all learn new skills faster and live more diverse rich lives. Eric Brewer shared “I feel like our kids will grow up in a generation that expects that they can do whatever they want at any time. That’s super empowering.”
If you’re still worried about being forced into an early retirement - you can run your own scenario through this automated retirement calculator - and yes we are considering folding in AI and Machine Learning to help bring better results to more people at a lower cost.
The good news is that smart people are working every day to use technology to bring better solutions to more people to solve big problems across the world and all industries.Stephen ChenFollowingFollowI’m the founder and CEO of  NewRetirement.com .

“We have entered a new era of analytics with machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms beginning to deliver on the long-promised advancement into self-learning systems,” said Stephen Brobst, CTO of Teradata, at the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Session organized by Telenor Pakistan.
Innovation isn’t new to Pakistan since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning are booming with a technological boon in the respective nation. The birth of the fourth Industrial Revolution has been a gateway for new analytics with respect to algorithmic advancement for the growth of a smart self-learning system. AI has emerged as a real-time problem-solving system that requires the assessment of big data, due to which it is going to emerge as one of the biggest investment priorities by 2020, as reported by Garter.
Realizing the potential that AI holds and the desire to produce data-driven predictive results, startups in Pakistan have begun to take their steps to integrate a physico-cyber mindset that aims to converge big data sets with mass storage to introduce phenomenal changes in the industrial ecosystem of Pakistan.
The employment of this transformational technology has gained quite a reputation after venture funding becoming accessible to startups in Pakistan in less than a decade. Moreover, the research in the field of AI speeded up in 2018 when the government of Pakistan allocated PKR 1.1 billion for seed funding. Given that Pakistan is progressing with leaps and bounds in the AI domain as compared to her Asian peers, Pakistani AI startups with a sense of digitization are galvanized to change the tech landscape of Pakistan and let her set afoot with others in the field.
Here is a list of 15 Pakistani AI tech startups, which are responding uniquely to the gravitational pull of AI and Machine Learning. Each of these startups and companies is using rich deep technology to transform the contemporary digital ecosystem in Pakistan at an unprecedented pace.

Perhaps the most important question we have looked at is whether AI will pose a threat - or provide new opportunities - for developing regions such as Africa. Optimists say that such places could use rapidly advancing AI systems to boost productivity and leapfrog ahead.Getty ImagesAutomated systems are already getting higher customer satisfaction ratings than people in call centresBut I am becoming increasingly concerned that AI will, in fact, block the traditional growth path by replacing low-wage jobs with robots. As Kai-Fu Lee, a Beijing-based venture capitalist who invests in artificial intelligence, tells us, AI is potentially the most revolutionary technology to emerge this century. It is also, along with the associated technologies of machine learning and robotics, advancing at breakneck speed. Already AI has the capacity to replace many work tasks that are rules-based and repetitive, and which do not require great dexterity or empathy.  In developed economies, for instance, robots have replaced well over half of the jobs in the car and related industries in recent decades. Getty ImagesMany jobs in the car industry have been displaced by robotsAutomated systems are already getting higher customer satisfaction ratings than people in call centres, threatening a key source of jobs in many countries. Similarly, AI enabled systems are leading to significant job losses in back-office administrative functions in banking, health, insurance and accounting. These are roles that had in recent years been outsourced to developing countries such as India, Vietnam, South Africa and Morocco.Jobs at risk?According to our research at Oxford, about 40% of jobs in Europe are vulnerable to AI over the coming decades, almost half of jobs in the USA, and an even greater share in developing countries.  Some argue that AI will create as many new jobs as those lost to robots, and that we shouldn't worry too much. But I believe that those new jobs will be concentrated in certain parts of the developed world, and that the developing world will miss out.Global TradeMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Why India is one of world's most protectionist countriesUruguay: The world’s marijuana pioneer Soft Brexit: What are the options?What happens if Trump closes the border?This matters most acutely in poorer nations that have used their relatively low-cost labour force as a first stage in catching up with the developed economies, examples being China, Thailand and Vietnam. Most of the jobs at threat in such places would be of the semi-skilled variety. But the fact that poor countries also tend to suffer shortages of highly skilled labour could further undermine their competitiveness. Getty ImagesIncomes have soared in tech hubs like San FranciscoThe development of supplementary technologies will add to the challenge. 3D printing, will combine with AI to allow consumers in rich countries to manufacture individually customised clothes, shoes, devices and other products, by themselves, much closer to home. The rise of such production could mean that the age of outsourcing production to developing countries is drawing to a close. Guy Ryder, director general of the UN's International Labour Organisation, highlights how the politics of protectionism will accelerate this. The demand to repatriate manufacturing to advanced countries has never been higher, although it is not jobs but AI and robotic processes that are coming home. Growing inequalityAs technology plays an increasingly dominant role in the global economy, the parts of the planet driving technological development stand to gain even more power. Just look at the concentration of wealth and incomes we have seen in places such as Silicon Valley.This trend could be replicated globally, worsening inequality. Due to the difficult to measure and cross-border nature of the digital economy, government tax revenues have been undermined, reducing investment in infrastructure, health and education. Getty ImagesA handful of big companies have come to dominate the tech industryThe tech industry also sucks up talent from around the globe, leaving shortages of human capital in some countries. All economies now require highly skilled workers to work in areas like AI, but these globetrotting individuals tend to prefer living in safe and developed cities that offer the best career opportunities.  With some notable exceptions - such as Bangalore in India - poorer countries will find it harder to attract and retain such workers, leaving them even more vulnerable. This concentration effect is not just evident in terms of location, but among companies themselves too. For example, just a handful of firms, based mainly in the US and China, now dominate AI, meaning that even European and Japanese businesses struggle to compete.A silver lining?Is all lost? Perhaps not. New firms are emerging that aim to use AI to boost growth and productivity in developing economies. They are also allowing citizens to access education, health, employment and other opportunities. One such company is M-Pesa, a mobile phone-based money transfer service, whose platform is used by more than 60% of Kenyans. M-Tiba, another Kenyan app, uses similar technology to deliver health services to more than four million people. Getty ImagesMoney transfer app M-Pesa is used by more than 60% of KenyansSome experts believe that AI could yield the same disruptive benefits as mobile phone technology in the developing world, helping to overcome the absence of infrastructure that contributes to low incomes and stalled development. Recent reports from the Pathways for Prosperity Commission and the World Bank similarly argue that AI and the digital economy could provide education, as well as jobs and incomes for people in poor countries, including those in isolated rural areas. However, it's early days for many of these companies, and it's not yet clear if they will succeed. It's also unclear whether the positive experiences in a handful of countries such as Kenya can be replicated elsewhere, and whether the positives outweigh the threats, not least in terms of lost jobs, tax revenues and rising inequality. The clock is ticking and the risks posed by AI to development have never been higher. Policymakers everywhere should be listening carefully and thinking hard about how to respond. Ian Goldin is professor of globalisation and development at Oxford University. His  BBC World Service documentary, Will AI Kill Development, is available on the BBC iPlayer.

A “diversity disaster” has contributed to flawed systems that perpetuate gender and racial biases found the survey, published by the AI Now Institute, of more than 150 studies and reports.The AI field, which is overwhelmingly white and male, is at risk of replicating or perpetuating historical biases and power imbalances, the report said. Examples cited include image recognition services making offensive classifications of minorities, chatbots adopting hate speech, and Amazon technology failing to recognize users with darker skin colors. The biases of systems built by the AI industry can be largely attributed to the lack of diversity within the field itself, the report said.'Bias deep inside the code': the problem with AI 'ethics' in Silicon ValleyRead more“The industry has to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and admit that its existing methods have failed to address these problems,” Kate Crawford, an author on the report said. “The use of AI systems for the classification, detection, and prediction of race and gender is in urgent need of re-evaluation.”More than 80% of AI professors are men, and only 15% of AI researchers at Facebook and 10% of AI researchers at Google are women, the report said. The makeup of the AI field is reflective of “a larger problem across computer science, Stem fields, and even more broadly, society as a whole”, said Danaë Metaxa, a PhD candidate and researcher at Stanford focused on issues of internet and democracy. Women comprised only 24% of the field of computer and information sciences in 2015, according to the National Science Board. Only 2.5% of Google’s workforce is black, while Facebook and Microsoft are each at 4%, and little data exists on trans workers or other gender minorities in the AI field.“The urgency behind this issue is increasing as AI becomes increasingly integrated into society,” Metaxa said. “Essentially, the lack of diversity in AI is concentrating an increasingly large amount of power and capital in the hands of a select subset of people.”The use of AI systems for the classification, detection, and prediction of race and gender is in urgent need of re-evaluationKate Crawford, report authorVenture capital funding for AI startups reached record levels in 2018, increasing 72% compared to 2017 to $9.33bn in funding. Active AI startups in the US increased 113% from 2015 to 2018. As more money and resources are invested into AI, companies have the opportunity to address the crisis as it unfolds, said Tess Posner, the chief executive officer of AI4ALL, a not-for-profit that works to increase diversity in the AI field. This lack of diversity must be addressed before AI reaches a “tipping point”, she said.“Every day that goes by it gets more difficult to solve the problem,” she said. “Right now we are in an exciting moment where we can make a difference before we see how much more complicated it can get later.”The report released on Tuesday cautioned against addressing diversity in the tech industry by fixing the “pipeline” problem, or the makeup of who is hired, alone. Men currently make up 71% of the applicant pool for AI jobs in the US, according to the 2018 AI Index, an independent report on the industry released annually. The AI institute suggested additional measures, including publishing compensation levels for workers publicly, sharing harassment and discrimination transparency reports, and changing hiring practices to increase the number of underrepresented groups at all levels.Google disbanded an artificial intelligence ethics council meant to oversee such issues just one week after announcing it in March. The Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC) was attracted backlash inside and outside the company after it appointed the anti-LGBT advocate Kay Coles James.Posner noted that additional efforts to increase transparency around how algorithms are built and how they work may be necessary to fix the diversity problems in AI. This month, the US senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act, a bill that would require algorithms used by companies that make more than $50m per year or hold information on at least 1 million users to be evaluated for biases.“The core of the problem is whether market forces are going to be sufficient for this to be fixed,” Posner said. “It’s going to take effort at all stages of AI and take change at cultural and procedural levels to solve this.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingRaceGenderSilicon ValleynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

Work for Humans at Time 100 Summit - TIME,2019-04-19,TIME,https://time.com,Kai-Fu Lee on How We Can Use AI,,Despite the disruptions and risks that it brings,Despite the disruptions and risks that it brings,https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,,,,,,,,"By Patrick Lucas AustinApril 19, 2019 11:49 AM EDTAI expert and Sinovation Ventures CEO Dr. Kai-Fu Lee took the stage at the TIME 100 Summit in New York on Tuesday to discuss the current state of artificial intelligence, arguing that it will do as much for society’s well-being as electricity. In his talk, Lee also touched on how governments and businesses can take advantage of artificial intelligence to improve nearly everything from infrastructure to the relationship between individuals and the companies handling their data. Lee showcased examples of AI applications, like warehouse machines that use computer vision to move and sort boxes, and an AI-powered rapper capable of generating rhymes based on any topic. Lee also highlighted an AI technique known as deep learning, and how it could be and has been used to generate false information, demonstrating with a fabricated audio clip of President Donald Trump. New machine learning techniques, like generative adversarial networks, have created real images of nonexistent people, as well as legit-looking news stories full of false information.Artificial intelligence generating fabricated audio, images, or stories is a major concern, especially when combined with the ongoing rise of fake news. “What’s more, biases inherent in machine learning software will continue to perpetuate an inequity between minorities and underrepresented communities,” said Lee, a comment addressing lack of training data for underrepresented communities, leading to a marked decrease in accuracy and effectiveness for those users. He also showed how AI is capable of providing a positive impact in China, where teachers in impoverished areas of the country are able to take advantage of the technology to grade tests and assign homework. “It’s an experience that will break down the barrier to education for those who need it,” said Lee. (Of course, AI is also being used in China and elsewhere for facial recognition security software that some are concerned can violate citizens’ rights.) Privacy, a hot-button issue in a time when user data gathered by major corporations is mismanaged or abused, is also on the list of problems artificial intelligence can tackle, Lee argues. “Certainly regulations are needed to prevent the most egregious misuse of data,” said Lee. But at the same time, Lee thinks technologists will eventually develop AI-powered tools to protect users while giving them the freedom to choose their level of privacy. “We can imagine a slider that gives each individual a choice, that gives an individual more security or more convenience,” said Lee, equating the idea to companies in the past that once created anti-virus software for computers.He also discussed job displacement occurring alongside the proliferation of artificial intelligence. “I think governments need to think about education, training, and changing the society’s belief about compassion and work,” said Lee, who thinks redesigned vocational programs and a focus on “compassionate work” should be considered when it comes to training a workforce.As for jobs, Lee isn’t shy about the coming disruption thanks to artificial intelligence. Customer service, telemarketing, and accounting jobs will all be subject to “serious job displacement issues,” according to Lee, and finding new careers for workers in the field will require difficult retraining. But Lee thinks, like electricity, AI’s potential to revolutionize every aspect of our daily life is more tangible than theoretical. “AI is here to stay, and i think we need to rise up to the occasion and embrace it.”",,,Kai-Fu Lee on How We Can Use AI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/jTzBLNZ5/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5574154/kai-fu-lee-time-100-summit/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",2019-04-23T18:06:26.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/jTzBLNZ5.m3u8,https://time.com/5574154/kai-fu-lee-time-100-summit/,PT2M35S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How tech's white male workforce feeds bias into AI

About 80 percent of AI professors are men, while women make up just 15 percent of AI research staff at Facebook and 10 percent at Google.The percentage is even lower for black employees at major tech firms, with just 2.5 percent at Google and 4 percent at Facebook and Microsoft.Bias seeps through when AI programs are constructed by those mostly white male workers who reinforce ""a narrow idea of the 'normal' person,"" a new study said.The technology industry's mostly white male workforce of coders is creating a ""diversity crisis,"" with bias seeping into products like facial recognition programs and chatbots, according to a new report from New York University's AI Now Institute. The report highlights how a workforce gender imbalance at major tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft is helping perpetuate bias within artificial intelligence.AI is used in products ranging from facial recognition to chatbots. But only 15 percent of AI research staffers at Facebook are women, and for Google it's even lower, at 10 percent, the report noted. This underscores what the study's authors say is the importance of a diverse workforce that reflects a diverse society. They argue that the tech industry's mostly white male legions of AI coders are linked to bias within technology products. Remedying the issues, they said, will require a broader approach to diversity, including hiring from colleges other than elite campuses and creating greater transparency in AI products. 






""To date, the diversity problems of the AI industry and the issues of bias in the systems it builds have tended to be considered separately,"" authors Sarah Myers West, Meredith Whittaker and Kate Crawford wrote. ""But we suggest that these are two versions of the same problem: issues of discrimination in the workforce and in system building are deeply intertwined.""""Narrow idea of the 'normal' person""It's not only that AI may discriminate against some types of people, but that it ""works to the advantage of others, reinforcing a narrow idea of the 'normal' person,"" the researchers wrote.

The report highlights several ways AI programs have created harmful circumstances to groups that already suffer from bias. Among them are: An Amazon AI hiring tool that scanned resumes from applicants relied on previous hires' resumes to set standards for ideal hires. However, the AI started downgrading applicants who attended women's colleges or who included the word ""women's"" in their resumes.Amazon's Rekognition facial analysis program had difficulty identifying dark-skinned women. According to one report, the program misidentified them as men, although the program had no problem identifying men of any skin tone. ""Deep concern""New York University isn't the first to ring alarm bells over problems of bias within AI. Groups such as the MIT Technology Review and the ACLU have documented problematic outcomes that affect issues such as hiring and criminal sentencing. 


The problem stems from the deep-learning stage, when coders ""teach"" a program through training data, the MIT Technology Review noted. Programmers can add bias into the system by relying on data sets that don't accurately reflect the world, such as relying on facial images that include very few black people. Programmers can also add bias by deciding which attributes are important -- such as gender. If a company's previous hires were mostly men, the program may learn to exclude women, as in the case of Amazon's hiring program, reinforcing a biased pattern of hiring. ""The use of AI systems for the classification, detection, and prediction of race and gender is in urgent need of re-evaluation,"" the New York University researchers noted. ""The commercial deployment of these tools is cause for deep concern.""

But only 15 percent of AI research staffers at Facebook are women, and for Google it's even lower, at 10 percent, the report noted. This underscores what the study's authors say is the importance of a diverse workforce that reflects a diverse society. They argue that the tech industry's mostly white male legions of AI coders are linked to bias within technology products. Remedying the issues, they said, will require a broader approach to diversity, including hiring from colleges other than elite campuses and creating greater transparency in AI products.""To date, the diversity problems of the AI industry and the issues of bias in the systems it builds have tended to be considered separately,"" authors Sarah Myers West, Meredith Whittaker and Kate Crawford wrote. ""But we suggest that these are two versions of the same problem: issues of discrimination in the workforce and in system building are deeply intertwined.""""Narrow idea of the 'normal' person""It's not only that AI may discriminate against some types of people, but that it ""works to the advantage of others, reinforcing a narrow idea of the 'normal' person,"" the researchers wrote. The report highlights several ways AI programs have created harmful circumstances to groups that already suffer from bias. Among them are: An Amazon AI hiring tool that scanned resumes from applicants relied on previous hires' resumes to set standards for ideal hires. However, the AI started downgrading applicants who attended women's colleges or who included the word ""women's"" in their resumes.Amazon's Rekognition facial analysis program had difficulty identifying dark-skinned women. According to one report, the program misidentified them as men, although the program had no problem identifying men of any skin tone. ""Deep concern""New York University isn't the first to ring alarm bells over problems of bias within AI. Groups such as the MIT Technology Review and the ACLU have documented problematic outcomes that affect issues such as hiring and criminal sentencing. The problem stems from the deep-learning stage, when coders ""teach"" a program through training data, the MIT Technology Review noted. Programmers can add bias into the system by relying on data sets that don't accurately reflect the world, such as relying on facial images that include very few black people. Programmers can also add bias by deciding which attributes are important -- such as gender. If a company's previous hires were mostly men, the program may learn to exclude women, as in the case of Amazon's hiring program, reinforcing a biased pattern of hiring. ""The use of AI systems for the classification, detection, and prediction of race and gender is in urgent need of re-evaluation,"" the New York University researchers noted. ""The commercial deployment of these tools is cause for deep concern.""",,How tech's white male workforce feeds bias into AI,,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/17/0c080814-73ca-442a-a731-1db1401d94cb/thumbnail/1200x630/3716c18151959aa6f7000289cc07eb4a/rts21mgl.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}",,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/17/0c080814-73ca-442a-a731-1db1401d94cb/thumbnail/1200x630/3716c18151959aa6f7000289cc07eb4a/rts21mgl.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d'}",1927-09-18,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#a0060f90-73b0-4a57-b756-ca7a7f26cc7d,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca,https://www.paramount.com/company-history,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/,,,,,,

As a result the next century will be dominated by countries that rapidly adapt to the new AI Economy. The assumptions that the next century will be the “Chinese Century” may be proved wrong if China cannot adapt to the AI Economy.The AI Economy is built on three pillars:AI Workforce: Labor pool with broad set of skills including AI researchers, AI implementors, and AI Literate workers adept with robotics and automationAI Infrastructure: Data sharing, algorithm exchange, labor mobility, and low-cost energy will be needed to support continued AI innovationAI Social Contract: Worker displacement will create significant resistance. Retraining, guaranteed income schemes, and other transition costs will be absorbed by leading countries adopting the AI EconomyPax Britannica (1815- 1914) — Map reproduction courtesy of the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education CenterOld World Orders:Since the early 1800’s the world orders of Pax Britannica (1815–1914) , the American Century (1917–2017) and the emergence (or perhaps re-emergence) of the Chinese Century (2017 — present) have been driven by similar economic and political rules.1. Readily available and low-cost labor, energy, and raw materials2. Institutional and government support of industry providing access to capital, political stability, and international trade3. Continued innovation that drives marginal production costs down, worker productivity up, supporting increased living standardsSince 1800 rapid adoption of new technologies including the telegraph, steam power, electricity, assembly lines, automation and recently robotics have delivered early adopters with durable advantage and supremacy on the world stage.As China prepares to assume economic supremacy for the next century, perhaps the rules have changed. Importantly energy costs are rapidly moving towards “zero marginal cost” per Jeremy Rifkin (2015), and the increased diffusion of military and political power as Fareed Zakaria first outlined in his 2009 book “The Post American World” are reducing the barriers to new entrants to the super power game.The most fundamental rule change is the mainstream adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and the realization of huge AI driven productivity gains in terms of automation, efficiency, and accuracy. AI and automation fundamentally change the economic foundation of the previous world orders.Digital Workers are robots that do repetitive tasks running as programs in the cloud or on desktop computers not entirely unlike the characters in the 1999 science fiction film “The Matrix”. This has been commonly known as Robotic Process Automation, but the new generation of digital workers are using computer vision, advanced machine learning to execute work at 100 times the speed of traditional human workersPhysical work is increasingly being done using industrial robots to replace human workers. Computer vision and robotics advances are rapidly shrinking the circle of things that can only be done by humans. Robot adoption is racing ahead, even in markets where low-cost labor is still abundantComplex decisions made with fuzzy facts have long been the domain of human subject matter experts whose organic neural network brains could contemplate all of the data and make the best split-second decisions. Today this advantage is narrowing, where deep learning systems consistently outperform humans in cognitive, vision, translation, signal processing, complex system analysis and a myriad of other tasksBuilding the AI Economy:First Priority: AI WorkforceThe demand for AI and robotics savvy workers already far outstrips the current supply. As the AI Economy ramps this impedance mismatch will become a gating factor for innovation. To avoid this we need to immediately make investments in adapting our workforce. China is already creating “AI Cities” and building this AI capability with full support of the Chinese government as Kai-Fu Lee outlines in his book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” .

In November 2007, Google laid the groundwork to dominate the mobile market by releasing Android, an open ­source operating system for phones. Eight years later to the month, Android has an an 80 percent market share, and Google is using the same trick—this time with artificial intelligence.
Today Google is announcing TensorFlow, its open ­source platform for machine learning, giving anyone a computer and internet connection (and casual background in deep learning algorithms) access to one of the most powerful machine learning platforms ever created. More than 50 Google products have adopted TensorFlow to harness deep learning (machine learning using deep neural networks) as a tool, from identifying you and your friends in the Photos app to refining its core search engine. Google has become a machine learning company. Now they’re taking what makes their services special, and giving it to the world.
Introducing TensorFlow, the Android of AI
TensorFlow is a library of files that allows researchers and computer scientists to build systems that break down data, like photos or voice recordings, and have the computer make future decisions based on that information. This is the basis of machine learning: computers understanding data, and then using it to make decisions. When scaled to be very complex, machine learning is a stab at making computers smarter. That’s the broader, and more ill-defined field of artificial intelligence. TensorFlow is extraordinary complex, because of its precision and speed in digesting and outputting data, and can unequivocally be placed in the realm of artificial intelligence tools.
Here are the nitty-gritty details: the TensorFlow system uses data flow graphs. In this system, data with multiple dimensions (values) are passed along from mathematical computation to mathematical computation. Those complex bits of data are called tensors. The math-y bits are called nodes, and the way the data changes from node to node tells the overall system relationships in the data. These tensors flow through the graph of nodes, and that’s where the name TensorFlow comes from.
Open-­sourcing TensorFlow allows researchers and even grad students the opportunity to work with professionally-built software, sure, but the real effect is the potential to inform every machine learning company’s research across the board. Now organizations of all sizes—from small startups to huge companies on par with Google—can take the TensorFlow system, adapt it to their own needs, and use it to compete directly against Google itself. More than anything, the release gives the world’s largest internet company authority in artificial intelligence.
Stanford computer science professor Christopher Manning was given TensorFlow a little more than three months ago, and his students had the opportunity to tinker with the system. After just a few weeks of using it himself, Manning decided that he’s going to implement it into his curriculum.
Besides Android, he also likens the platform to Gmail, Google’s ubiquitous email application. There are competitors, but Gmail is cleaner and makes more sense in most applications.
“It’s not that before this there weren’t any high level libraries available for deep learning,” Manning says. “But in general these other libraries are things by three academics and a grad student.”



While the others, most notably Torch and Theano, do have small groups updating them, it’s nothing like the full force of the developers working on Google’s machine learning infrastructure. Manning says that while TensorFlow is a huge gift to the community (one capable of reducing time spent optimizing the neural networks by 100 times), they might indirectly benefit from open­-sourcing their tools.
“A very small amount of companies have been trying to hire up a very large percentage of the talented people in artificial intelligence in general, and deep learning in particular,” Manning says. “Google is not a charity, I’m sure it’s also occurred to them that by ceding this, we will have a lot of Ph.D students who will be in universities and already liking Google deep learning tools.”
Jeff Dean, one of Google’s top engineers and one of the two people who could be listed as an author for TensorFlow (the other is Rajat Monga), is cautious about estimating the adoption in the community. He says that while it’s something Google has found immensely useful in their own work, the real test is whether the community will find it as capable. The idea is to provide a tool so the whole community will be able to go from not just ideas, but actual implementations of things more rapidly.
“We’re hoping, basically, to accelerate machine learning research and deployment,” Dean says. And while this is a big gift the community, the ideal scenario is that the community gives back, and shares what they’ve made with other researchers (and Google). “The machine learning community has been really good at polishing ideas, and that’s a really good thing, but it’s not the same thing as polishing working code associated with research ideas,” Dean says.

He also mentions that TensorFlow will help Google interns when they return back to their schools, because they can now access the once-proprietary systems on projects they might not have finished during their time at the company.
The TensorFlow system is a pretty complete package for an individual researcher. The system is a complete, standalone library associated with tools and an Apache 2.0 license, so it can be used in commercial settings. It can be compiled on desktops or laptops, or deployed on mobile (Android first, naturally, and then iOS to come later). It also comes with tutorials and documentation on how to modify and play with the platform.
Manning suggests that the ability to run deep learning algorithms on mobile devices will be an important factor that separates TensorFlow from other open-source systems.
For those who want to use the system as-is, Google is providing a version that researchers can start using right now (as pre-built binaries). There’s also an application programming interface (API), for software developers to train and control their TensorFlow models. And this isn’t a knockoff—it’s the literal system used in the Google app, and more than 50 other products.


Inside Google’s Artificial Intelligence Lab
Google is opening this platform to the world, which gives us an equal opportunity to peek in and see how the company thinks about developing machine learning systems.
Internally, Google has spent the last three years building a massive platform for artificial intelligence and now they’re unleashing it on the world. Although, Google would prefer you call it machine intelligence. They feel that the word artificial intelligence carries too many connotations, and fundamentally, they’re trying to create genuine intelligence—just in machines.
It’s the model that they’ve used within the company for years: where any engineer who wants to play with an artificial neural network can fork it off the system and tinker. That’s the kind of open structure that allows 100 teams within a company to build powerful machine learning techniques.
“Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re re-thinking how we’re doing everything,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company’s earnings call in October 2015. “We are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, ads, YouTube, or Play. And we’re in early days, but you will see us — in a systematic way — apply machine learning in all these areas.”
Welcome to Google, where everything is AI and AI is everything
It’s difficult to lay out a concrete diagram of machine intelligence research at Google, because it’s always changing, and saturates nearly every team in the company.
Google’s VP of engineering, John Giannandrea, calls this an “embedded model.” I met him at one of the many sleek modern moderns at Google’s headquarters in sunny Mountain View, California, in the fall of 2015.
I was on a floor technically not open to the public, and when I was left unattended for a moment, an engineer came up to me, noticing I wasn’t wearing an employee badge. He asked who I was, and saying I was a writer didn’t smooth the situation over. Google prides itself on making its research open to the public, but work in the labs is kept under heavy wraps.

For me, Google’s embedded model meant a lot of walking. The Googleplex contains 3.5 million square feet of office space over about seven acres of land. Google staff ride bikes between buildings, which are surrounded by well-groomed parks where Googlers sit with laptops, undoubtedly grappling with complex computer science conundrums or playing Minecraft during their lunch break. Different teams work in different buildings, and embedded machine intelligence researchers switch buildings when they switch teams.
Inside, most of what I saw looks like a normal office building. There are cubicles, computers with loads of monitors, and people discussing work in hushed tones while glancing nervously towards the journalist. There are holes cut in the wall to catch a quick nap—you know, office things.


Organizationally, there’s a pool of researchers always working on general machine intelligence problems, and that work feeds back into Google’s core products, such as the Photos app, Voice Search, and Search itself. There are some projects that start as just something Google wants to get better at. Giannandrea suggests handwriting as an example.
“We, as a company, want to understand how people would write a word. So that’s something we would invest in forever, even if we didn’t have a product,” he says.
But because Google is so vast in its offerings, there’s usually a tool that can use each research element. (Handwriting ended up in Google Keep, the note-taking software.)

When that use is figured out, the researcher hops onto the product team to help with implementation. Product teams develop specific applications that we all use, like the Photos app or Google Translate.
In general research, the teams are divided by their area of interest. There’s a team focused on teaching computers to see, a team working to understand language, a team looking at better voice recognition, and so on.
“There’s no world in which Google doesn’t want to have better speech recognition, language translation, language understanding— so these frontiers of research in computer science are things we invest in all the time,” Giannandrea says.
There are more than 1000 researchers at Google working on these machine intelligence applications, constantly rotating between applied and theoretical research. Some of these researchers work on simpler problems that wouldn’t be considered artificial intelligence, in the strictest sense of the word, but are more statistical methods of prediction.
Google’s new parent company, Alphabet, doesn’t make a big impact on the way Google’s machine intelligence research will continue, according to Google spokesman Jason Freidenfelds. While the research team will stay within Google Proper, there won’t be any barriers from working with Life Sciences or Google [x] on machine learning applications.
The Voice of the future
A rising star in Google’s catalog of tools is Voice Search. You’ve probably run into it before even if you didn’t know exactly what it it was: it’s the little microphone icon in the main Google search bar, which when pressed, let’s you speak your search query to Google instead of typing it in. That same little microphone appears in Google’s Search app for iPhone and Android, and can be found within the Android search bar itself on many smartphones.
Although superficially thought of as a rival to Siri, Google Voice search has actually become a secondary gateway to Google’s vast knowledge base, and to the language recognition team’s delight, it’s finally getting more popular.
While Google doesn’t release the percentage of voice searches in relation to text, it does provide a veritable rabbit hole of statistics: mobile search is now more popular than desktop, mobile voice search has doubled in the last year, about 50 percent of American phone and tablet users know they can ask Google questions, and a third of them actually do it.
That’s a long sentence saying that while Google won’t say how many voice searches are made, Google’s press team assures me it’s a lot.
Besides a few hundred iterations of the algorithm per year, Search has worked pretty much the same for years. But getting people confident enough to speak with their devices has been a struggle.
Senior researcher Françoise Beaufays works on developing the voice recognition engine behind Voice Search, and says that increased adoption is because the feature just works better now.
“When we started doing speech recognition, users weren’t fully confident. they were using it, but you could tell there was hesitation, the technology wasn’t as good as it is now,” Beaufays says. “Fast forward to nowadays, people are comfortable doing anything possible by voice in their office.”
Beaufays speaks quickly with a French accent, and is trilingual—on top of her fluency in neural network architecture. She led the Speech team just ripped out the service’s old engine used to recognize sounds, and replaced it with a new, more advanced system that uses a new brand of recurrent neural networks.
For a machine to understand speech, it needs to first learn what words and phrases sound like. That means audio files, and a lot of them. These files are processed by the algorithm, which create a huge graph of which sounds correlate to which sounds, words, and phrases. When an audio clip is presented to the computer, it analyzes the clip by pushing the audio waveform through the graph, in an attempt to find a path that best explains the audio.
“That path in the end will say, ‘We went through this sequence of sounds, and that maps to this sequence of words, and that makes this sentence,'” Beaufays says.

But all this relies on those initial audio files, which is called training data. This training data is actually made of millions of real voice searches by Google users. Whenever you make a voice search, the audio is uploaded to Google servers, and if you’ve opted into letting Google use it, can be integrated into the bank of clips used to train the machine.
But before it’s used, the data goes through a few steps. First (and most importantly to you), it’s scrubbed of all your information. That means timestamps, location data, your user profile, everything. The raw waveform is then sent to a human transcriber, because the algorithm needs reliable text to associate with the clip. Every clip needs this metadata, and a “bad” clip is really just one that isn’t properly transcribed.There are even instances where researchers add in artificial noise, in order for the machine to understand what different words sounds like in different situations.
Beaufays stresses that this program is opt-in. This is important, given the privacy concerns—which are rational—that regularly bubble up as Google continues amassing more information about the world and our lives. But if you don’t want Google to use your voice, you don’t have to let it. Also, there are ways of deleting your searches after the fact.
But these techniques have made voice search more effective. According to Google, two years ago the error rate was 25 percent, which means one of every four searches was wrong. Now, that number is down to 8 percent.
But what happens when Google can’t train on your data?
The intelligent Inbox
Last week, Google announced that it’s beginning to use machine learning in your email (if you use the Inbox app, which is separate from Gmail), and yes, it’s built on TensorFlow, according to Alex Gawley, product director for Gmail.
“We started to see some of the power of the neural nets our research team was building,” Gawley says. “That it might just be possible for us to help with more than just understanding and organizing. it might just be possible for us to help with things like writing mail.”
The feature is called Smart Reply, and basically one recurrent neural network reads your email and hands it off to a second, which generates three potential responses. You choose, and the email is sent. But email is just as sensitive as photos, if not more in some cases.
No person at Google reads your emails, which is important to keep in mind. However, data on which choice you made does get sent back to inform the global model. That’s how it learns. From that, researchers can ask the machine to answer certain questions, and from there understand what might need to be fixed in the neural networks. The software is same for everybody, too, which is something
Smart Reply also gives us a peek into how machine learning products are built within Google. The Inbox team deployed this feature internally, to test and feed the machine some ideas of what was right and wrong, a process called dogfooding. (The phrase comes from the idea of eating your own dog food, and is an example of why tech is bizarre.)
The whole team uses it, and documents bugs, and gives it more and more information to feed from. When the app behaves correctly in the controlled environment, and can be scaled, its released.

Internal testing gives researchers a chance to predict potential bugs when the neural nets are exposed to mass quantities of data. For instance, at first Smart Reply wanted to tell everyone “I love you.” But that was just because on personal emails, “I love you” was a very common phrase, so the machine thought it was important.
All this is an attempt to make your work easier—that’s what a most of the company’s products are aiming to do, especially Google Now, the personal assistant of the Google world. The team’s catch phrase is “just the right information at the right time.” Aparna Chennapragada, the head of Google Now, says that machine intelligence needs to be thoughtfully considered when being built into the platform, in order to complement the human brain.
“You want to pick problems that are hard for humans, and easy for machines, not the other way around,” Chennapragada says. “It’s about making the technology do the heavy lifting for you, rather than doing it yourself. “
At the moment, the product is really just exploring how to use these methods to make your life easier. Chennapragada likens it to where research sat with voice recognition 5 years ago—it was okay, but didn’t work every single time.
They’re looking now at how to leverage three different kinds of data to serve you with tidbits of information. They see the phone as a “partial attention device” and an ideal service shouldn’t overload you with information.
“If you look at how each of us uses the phone, it’s between things that you’re doing in your life. It’s bite sized piece of information that you’re looking for,” Chennapragada says. “One of the things we think about is how we can work on your behalf, proactively, all the time.”
That’s the end goal in a smartphone with machine intelligence: the true digital personal assistant, ultimately predictive and vastly knowledgeable—the part of your brain you’re not born with.
So to get there, your phone needs data about you: your schedule, what you search for, what music you listen to, and where you go. This is the easiest kind of information to get, because it’s already on the device.

But when you combine that personal information with knowledge about the world, through Google’s KnowledgeGraph (more on this later), and data being sourced from other users, the world is brought to your fingertips. You might not know how to navigate an airport, but your phone does.
Another example of the way Google uses data from lots of people is gauging road traffic. By pulling anonymous location data from phones on the highway, Google can tell that cars are moving slower than usual. The same goes for being able to tell when a restaurant or coffee shop is busy.
Google Now represents the way Google approaches machine intelligence. They’re aware that a general intelligence model that can translate and tell you what’s in a picture is years and years away, so in the meantime, they’re creating a mosaic of tools that act in harmony to provide the best experience possible.
Organizing the world’s information
Okay, so I mentioned that Google Now works with KnowledgeGraph. What’s that?
John Giannandrea, the head of Google’s research from earlier, was brought into Google in 2010. He founded a company called Metaweb, which related text and objects on the internet. It was a logical parallel to search—not only finding things, but finding similar bits and pieces of information. He had worked on this issue even before that, when he was the CTO of Netscape. (Remember Netscape?)
But this all manifested in KnowledgeGraph, which debuted in 2012 as the bits of information and text that automatically pop up when you search for facts. If you search “When was Popular Science founded?” Google will supply the answer (which is 1872).
This is Google’s way of not only cataloging the internet, but making it more accessible and useful to its users. It was also the first leak of artificial intelligence into the main product, search.
Since then, Google has handed 15 percent of its daily search traffic to artificial intelligence model called RankBrain. This system is the common sense of search—it’s meant to catch the queries that traditional algorithms can’t figure out.
Beyond integration into its core search algorithms, and the expansion into products, Google also has a few moonshots in the works. For that, they rely on Geoff Hinton.
Hinton is one of the foremost thinkers in artificial intelligence—he’s often listed in the same sentence as other high-level researchers like Yann LeCun at Facebook, Google’s Andrew Ng, and Yoshua Bengio. (In fact, LeCun, Hinton, and Bengio wrote a review in Nature this May on deep learning, which reads like the literal textbook on AI.)

Speaking with Hinton is like talking to someone who lives five years in the future. Our conversation centered around turning documents into thought vectors, so that machines could understand and remember lengthy versions, and reverse engineer the algorithm our brain uses to learn.
Many computer programs today, for example, brute force the problem of analyzing what a text document means by looking up the dictionary definitions of words in the document, and the grammar. But in order to understand the document like a human, a computer would ideally be able to break the document down into a series of distinct thoughts.
“Google would love to be able to take a document, and figure out what the reasoning is, what the document is saying, and how one thought follows from the previous thoughts,” Hinton says. “If we could start doing that, then it could give you much better answers to queries, because it actually reads the documents and understands them.”
When asked why we aren’t doing this already, Hinton says if we’re trying to match comprehension to the brain, it’s a matter of scale. The artificial neural networks researchers use now just don’t have the complexity of our brain, even at when scaled to their current limits. The best ones we have might have hundreds of millions of weights that can be manipulated (LeCun uses the analogy of a black box with a million knobs on the outside to explain fiddling with weights.) But Hinton explains that our brains have 100 trillion—that’s 100,000 times more information.
In the face of being dwarfed by scale, Hinton is still optimistic that this streak of artificial intelligence research won’t fizzle out as it has in the past. (Artificial intelligence research has seen “winters,” where progress hasn’t matched expectations and investment has faded.) A large factor of this is the increasingly popular idea of thought vectors, as mentioned earlier. But the most comforting thing to Hinton is the progress in the last five years, especially object recognition and speech. These problems were often seen as too complex in the past, and now the error rate has drastically decreased on standardized tests.

“They’re getting close to human-level performance. Not in all aspects, but things like object recognition. A few years ago, computer vision people would have told you ‘no, you’re not going to get to that level in many years.’ So that’s a reason for being optimistic,” Hinton says.
But no matter how well a machine may complement or emulate the human brain, it doesn’t mean anything if the average person can’t figure out how to use it. That’s Google’s plan to dominate artificial intelligence—making it simple as possible. While the machinations behind the curtains are complex and dynamic, the end result are ubiquitous tools that work, and the means to improve those tools if you’re so inclined.
“There’s a thin line between magic and mystery,” Google Now’s Chennapragada says.”And we want to be on the right side of it.”

Eight years later to the month, Android has an an 80 percent market share, and Google is using the same trick—this time with artificial intelligence.\n\nToday Google is announcing TensorFlow, its open \xadsource platform for machine learning, giving anyone a computer and internet connection (and casual background in deep learning algorithms) access to one of the most powerful machine learning platforms ever created. More than 50 Google products have adopted TensorFlow to harness deep learning (machine learning using deep neural networks) as a tool, from identifying you and your friends in the Photos app to refining its core search engine. Google has become a machine learning company. Now they\'re taking what makes their services special, and giving it to the world.\n\nIntroducing TensorFlow, the Android of AI\n\nTensorFlow is a library of files that allows researchers and computer scientists to build systems that break down data, like photos or voice recordings, and have the computer make future decisions based on that information. This is the basis of machine learning: computers understanding data, and then using it to make decisions. When scaled to be very complex, machine learning is a stab at making computers smarter. That\'s the broader, and more ill-defined field of artificial intelligence. TensorFlow is extraordinary complex, because of its precision and speed in digesting and outputting data, and can unequivocally be placed in the realm of artificial intelligence tools.\n\nHere are the nitty-gritty details: the TensorFlow system uses data flow graphs. In this system, data with multiple dimensions (values) are passed along from mathematical computation to mathematical computation. Those complex bits of data are called tensors. The math-y bits are called nodes, and the way the data changes from node to node tells the overall system relationships in the data. These tensors flow through the graph of nodes, and that\'s where the name TensorFlow comes from.\n\nOpen-\xadsourcing TensorFlow allows researchers and even grad students the opportunity to work with professionally-built software, sure, but the real effect is the potential to inform every machine learning company\'s research across the board. Now organizations of all sizes—from small startups to huge companies on par with Google—can take the TensorFlow system, adapt it to their own needs, and use it to compete directly against Google itself. More than anything, the release gives the world\'s largest internet company authority in artificial intelligence.\n\nStanford computer science professor Christopher Manning was given TensorFlow a little more than three months ago, and his students had the opportunity to tinker with the system. After just a few weeks of using it himself, Manning decided that he\'s going to implement it into his curriculum.\n\nBesides Android, he also likens the platform to Gmail, Google\'s ubiquitous email application. There are competitors, but Gmail is cleaner and makes more sense in most applications.\n\n""It\'s not that before this there weren\'t any high level libraries available for deep learning,"" Manning says. ""But in general these other libraries are things by three academics and a grad student.""\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nWhile the others, most notably Torch and Theano, do have small groups updating them, it\'s nothing like the full force of the developers working on Google\'s machine learning infrastructure. Manning says that while TensorFlow is a huge gift to the community (one capable of reducing time spent optimizing the neural networks by 100 times), they might indirectly benefit from open\xad-sourcing their tools.\n\n""A very small amount of companies have been trying to hire up a very large percentage of the talented people in artificial intelligence in general, and deep learning in particular,"" Manning says. ""Google is not a charity, I\'m sure it\'s also occurred to them that by ceding this, we will have a lot of Ph.D students who will be in universities and already liking Google deep learning tools.""\n\nJeff Dean, one of Google\'s top engineers and one of the two people who could be listed as an author for TensorFlow (the other is Rajat Monga), is cautious about estimating the adoption in the community. He says that while it\'s something Google has found immensely useful in their own work, the real test is whether the community will find it as capable. The idea is to provide a tool so the whole community will be able to go from not just ideas, but actual implementations of things more rapidly.\n\n""We\'re hoping, basically, to accelerate machine learning research and deployment,"" Dean says. And while this is a big gift the community, the ideal scenario is that the community gives back, and shares what they\'ve made with other researchers (and Google). ""The machine learning community has been really good at polishing ideas, and that\'s a really good thing, but it\'s not the same thing as polishing working code associated with research ideas,"" Dean says.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZikw5k_2FM\nHe also mentions that TensorFlow will help Google interns when they return back to their schools, because they can now access the once-proprietary systems on projects they might not have finished during their time at the company.\n\nThe TensorFlow system is a pretty complete package for an individual researcher. The system is a complete, standalone library associated with tools and an Apache 2.0 license, so it can be used in commercial settings. It can be compiled on desktops or laptops, or deployed on mobile (Android first, naturally, and then iOS to come later). It also comes with tutorials and documentation on how to modify and play with the platform.\n\nManning suggests that the ability to run deep learning algorithms on mobile devices will be an important factor that separates TensorFlow from other open-source systems.\n\nFor those who want to use the system as-is, Google is providing a version that researchers can start using right now (as pre-built binaries). There\'s also an application programming interface (API), for software developers to train and control their TensorFlow models. And this isn\'t a knockoff—it\'s the literal system used in the Google app, and more than 50 other products.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nInside Google\'s Artificial Intelligence Lab\n\nGoogle is opening this platform to the world, which gives us an equal opportunity to peek in and see how the company thinks about developing machine learning systems.\n\nInternally, Google has spent the last three years building a massive platform for artificial intelligence and now they\'re unleashing it on the world. Although, Google would prefer you call it machine intelligence. They feel that the word artificial intelligence carries too many connotations, and fundamentally, they\'re trying to create genuine intelligence—just in machines.\n\nIt\'s the model that they\'ve used within the company for years: where any engineer who wants to play with an artificial neural network can fork it off the system and tinker. That\'s the kind of open structure that allows 100 teams within a company to build powerful machine learning techniques.\n\n""Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we\'re re-thinking how we\'re doing everything,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company\'s earnings call in October 2015. ""We are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, ads, YouTube, or Play. And we\'re in early days, but you will see us — in a systematic way — apply machine learning in all these areas.""\n\nWelcome to Google, where everything is AI and AI is everything\n\nIt\'s difficult to lay out a concrete diagram of machine intelligence research at Google, because it\'s always changing, and saturates nearly every team in the company.\n\nGoogle\'s VP of engineering, John Giannandrea, calls this an ""embedded model."" I met him at one of the many sleek modern moderns at Google\'s headquarters in sunny Mountain View, California, in the fall of 2015.\n\nI was on a floor technically not open to the public, and when I was left unattended for a moment, an engineer came up to me, noticing I wasn\'t wearing an employee badge. He asked who I was, and saying I was a writer didn\'t smooth the situation over. Google prides itself on making its research open to the public, but work in the labs is kept under heavy wraps.\n\n\n\nFor me, Google\'s embedded model meant a lot of walking. The Googleplex contains 3.5 million square feet of office space over about seven acres of land. Google staff ride bikes between buildings, which are surrounded by well-groomed parks where Googlers sit with laptops, undoubtedly grappling with complex computer science conundrums or playing Minecraft during their lunch break. Different teams work in different buildings, and embedded machine intelligence researchers switch buildings when they switch teams.\n\nInside, most of what I saw looks like a normal office building. There are cubicles, computers with loads of monitors, and people discussing work in hushed tones while glancing nervously towards the journalist. There are holes cut in the wall to catch a quick nap—you know, office things.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOrganizationally, there\'s a pool of researchers always working on general machine intelligence problems, and that work feeds back into Google\'s core products, such as the Photos app, Voice Search, and Search itself. There are some projects that start as just something Google wants to get better at. Giannandrea suggests handwriting as an example.\n\n""We, as a company, want to understand how people would write a word. So that\'s something we would invest in forever, even if we didn\'t have a product,"" he says.\n\nBut because Google is so vast in its offerings, there\'s usually a tool that can use each research element. (Handwriting ended up in Google Keep, the note-taking software.)\n\n\n\nWhen that use is figured out, the researcher hops onto the product team to help with implementation. Product teams develop specific applications that we all use, like the Photos app or Google Translate.\n\nIn general research, the teams are divided by their area of interest. There\'s a team focused on teaching computers to see, a team working to understand language, a team looking at better voice recognition, and so on.\n\n""There\'s no world in which Google doesn\'t want to have better speech recognition, language translation, language understanding— so these frontiers of research in computer science are things we invest in all the time,"" Giannandrea says.\n\nThere are more than 1000 researchers at Google working on these machine intelligence applications, constantly rotating between applied and theoretical research. Some of these researchers work on simpler problems that wouldn\'t be considered artificial intelligence, in the strictest sense of the word, but are more statistical methods of prediction.\n\nGoogle\'s new parent company, Alphabet, doesn\'t make a big impact on the way Google\'s machine intelligence research will continue, according to Google spokesman Jason Freidenfelds. While the research team will stay within Google Proper, there won\'t be any barriers from working with Life Sciences or Google [x] on machine learning applications.\n\nThe Voice of the future\n\nA rising star in Google\'s catalog of tools is Voice Search. You\'ve probably run into it before even if you didn\'t know exactly what it it was: it\'s the little microphone icon in the main Google search bar, which when pressed, let\'s you speak your search query to Google instead of typing it in. That same little microphone appears in Google\'s Search app for iPhone and Android, and can be found within the Android search bar itself on many smartphones.\n\nAlthough superficially thought of as a rival to Siri, Google Voice search has actually become a secondary gateway to Google\'s vast knowledge base, and to the language recognition team\'s delight, it\'s finally getting more popular.\n\nWhile Google doesn\'t release the percentage of voice searches in relation to text, it does provide a veritable rabbit hole of statistics: mobile search is now more popular than desktop, mobile voice search has doubled in the last year, about 50 percent of American phone and tablet users know they can ask Google questions, and a third of them actually do it.\n\nThat\'s a long sentence saying that while Google won\'t say how many voice searches are made, Google\'s press team assures me it\'s a lot.\n\nBesides a few hundred iterations of the algorithm per year, Search has worked pretty much the same for years. But getting people confident enough to speak with their devices has been a struggle.\n\nSenior researcher Françoise Beaufays works on developing the voice recognition engine behind Voice Search, and says that increased adoption is because the feature just works better now.\n\n""When we started doing speech recognition, users weren\'t fully confident. they were using it, but you could tell there was hesitation, the technology wasn\'t as good as it is now,"" Beaufays says. ""Fast forward to nowadays, people are comfortable doing anything possible by voice in their office.""\n\nBeaufays speaks quickly with a French accent, and is trilingual—on top of her fluency in neural network architecture. She led the Speech team just ripped out the service\'s old engine used to recognize sounds, and replaced it with a new, more advanced system that uses a new brand of recurrent neural networks.\n\nFor a machine to understand speech, it needs to first learn what words and phrases sound like. That means audio files, and a lot of them. These files are processed by the algorithm, which create a huge graph of which sounds correlate to which sounds, words, and phrases. When an audio clip is presented to the computer, it analyzes the clip by pushing the audio waveform through the graph, in an attempt to find a path that best explains the audio.\n\n""That path in the end will say, \'We went through this sequence of sounds, and that maps to this sequence of words, and that makes this sentence,\'"" Beaufays says.\n\n\n\nBut all this relies on those initial audio files, which is called training data. This training data is actually made of millions of real voice searches by Google users. Whenever you make a voice search, the audio is uploaded to Google servers, and if you\'ve opted into letting Google use it, can be integrated into the bank of clips used to train the machine.\n\nBut before it\'s used, the data goes through a few steps. First (and most importantly to you), it\'s scrubbed of all your information. That means timestamps, location data, your user profile, everything. The raw waveform is then sent to a human transcriber, because the algorithm needs reliable text to associate with the clip. Every clip needs this metadata, and a ""bad"" clip is really just one that isn\'t properly transcribed.There are even instances where researchers add in artificial noise, in order for the machine to understand what different words sounds like in different situations.\n\nBeaufays stresses that this program is opt-in. This is important, given the privacy concerns—which are rational—that regularly bubble up as Google continues amassing more information about the world and our lives. But if you don\'t want Google to use your voice, you don\'t have to let it. Also, there are ways of deleting your searches after the fact.\n\nBut these techniques have made voice search more effective. According to Google, two years ago the error rate was 25 percent, which means one of every four searches was wrong. Now, that number is down to 8 percent.\n\nBut what happens when Google can\'t train on your data?\n\nThe intelligent Inbox\n\nLast week, Google announced that it\'s beginning to use machine learning in your email (if you use the Inbox app, which is separate from Gmail), and yes, it\'s built on TensorFlow, according to Alex Gawley, product director for Gmail.\n\n""We started to see some of the power of the neural nets our research team was building,"" Gawley says. ""That it might just be possible for us to help with more than just understanding and organizing. it might just be possible for us to help with things like writing mail.""\n\nThe feature is called Smart Reply, and basically one recurrent neural network reads your email and hands it off to a second, which generates three potential responses. You choose, and the email is sent. But email is just as sensitive as photos, if not more in some cases.\n\nNo person at Google reads your emails, which is important to keep in mind. However, data on which choice you made does get sent back to inform the global model. That\'s how it learns. From that, researchers can ask the machine to answer certain questions, and from there understand what might need to be fixed in the neural networks. The software is same for everybody, too, which is something\n\nSmart Reply also gives us a peek into how machine learning products are built within Google. The Inbox team deployed this feature internally, to test and feed the machine some ideas of what was right and wrong, a process called dogfooding. (The phrase comes from the idea of eating your own dog food, and is an example of why tech is bizarre.)\n\nThe whole team uses it, and documents bugs, and gives it more and more information to feed from. When the app behaves correctly in the controlled environment, and can be scaled, its released.\n\n\n\nInternal testing gives researchers a chance to predict potential bugs when the neural nets are exposed to mass quantities of data. For instance, at first Smart Reply wanted to tell everyone ""I love you."" But that was just because on personal emails, ""I love you"" was a very common phrase, so the machine thought it was important.\n\nAll this is an attempt to make your work easier—that\'s what a most of the company\'s products are aiming to do, especially Google Now, the personal assistant of the Google world. The team\'s catch phrase is ""just the right information at the right time."" Aparna Chennapragada, the head of Google Now, says that machine intelligence needs to be thoughtfully considered when being built into the platform, in order to complement the human brain.\n\n""You want to pick problems that are hard for humans, and easy for machines, not the other way around,"" Chennapragada says. ""It\'s about making the technology do the heavy lifting for you, rather than doing it yourself. ""\n\nAt the moment, the product is really just exploring how to use these methods to make your life easier.

But do we actually understand what artificial intelligence really is? And how this technology is helping our businesses? Let’s find out- What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial intelligence in simple words is the ability of a machine or computer program to think and learn. It is also a place of study which tries to develop computers a little smarter. Computers can work on their own without any human intervention. Artificial intelligence is playing an important role in the growth of businesses. Every year or month, we see a fresh batch of advanced AI-based solutions across both processes and products. It helps the business to detect fraud early, increase sales, automate work processes, improve customer experience, and offer predictive analysis.Also, it supports healthcare service providers by offering better and advanced tools for early diagnosis. According to PwC’s report, “67.0% of executives believe AI will help machines and people to work together to improve operations — by combining human and artificial intelligence.The surging business productivity and increasing consumer demand for better quality and increasing customized AI-enhanced products are escalating the growth of AI in the market. According to the Statista,  the global artificial intelligence software market is predicted to witness a massive growth in the near future, with revenue surging from around $10.0 billion in 2018 to  $126 billion by 2025It’s hard to ignore that  AI is the future of business, and sooner or later, companies across the globe will implement it to stay ahead in the competitive market. There are various types of artificial intelligence that help a business to grow which are as follows- Everyone is talking about AI in business, it can be hard to know which one to choose or from where to start when deciding how to add AI in your business operations. So for better understanding, here are some suggestions on how you can choose AI for your business. Suppose you have a retail store and wish to improve your overall customer experience and support services with AI. And, you also want to make your support staff use AI-enabled automated assistance technologies to make decisions and get work done.So, how to prepare for AI? The best way to evaluate the implementation of AI in your business is to figure out its practical use in your business. And, you also have to decide:What AI tools can do for your business? See if it can help in your work. How your competitors are using AI in their business operations? What are the challenges in adding AI to your company’s operations? What are the future trends of AI?Let's finish things one by one, so the first one is the importance of AI in business-                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Importance of AI in BusinessMany businesses have witnessed that after employing AI programs in their organization, there is increasing productivity and surging revenue due to the AI's greater automation. Today, the majority of companies are developing smart AI software programs with Go programming language, Python, Lisp, Java, Haskell, and Julia.  For example, National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers use Artificial Intelligence (AI) with smartphone cameras to detect cervical cancer that will help more women to get the right medication. According to reports by the National Cancer Institute, a system based on the AI algorithm learned to detect the specific form of changes in the cervix due to precancerous changes.Retail and banking are among the top sectors using AI in their existing and upcoming projects. For example, Walmart harnessing AI to optimize everything related to their inventories, supply chain metrics, and customer service. For example, Walmart plans to deploy AI-enabled shelf-scanning robots across their U.S stores to find missing items, price tags, and products that need to be rearranged. These robots will also take care of customers' needs and make sure that customers aren’t faced with the issue of empty shelves. Banking and financial institutions see great potential in AI technology. How? See the below-given image:As AI adds productivity and opens up a whole new world of possibilities for your enterprise, you should also know about the best programming languages for AI.Best programming languages for AI that will benefit your businessYou should keep an eye on AI programming languages along with what the other businesses are using and talking about. There is no denying that the number of emerging AI technologies these days is overwhelming. So, which one is the perfect fit for your own business?To lend you a hand, here's the list of the best AI programming languages for enterprises and programmers community. So, let’s dive in! 1) PythonWhen it comes to the best AI programming language, Python is your best bet because of its less complex programming and pre-built libraries - (SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit learn, and NumPy) that help in AI software development.If you are working on deep learning projects, such as automatic image colourization, pixel restoration, multi-person pose estimation, and more, then you can use Python pre-built libraries, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Apache MXNet.Furthermore, if you are working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) sentiment analysis, then you should go for Python’s NLTK to take advantage of simple & easy syntax, structuring, and text processing. One of the best examples of the online retail store built on Python is Affirm that allows its users to make their payments in a completely safe manner. Python is also used to build AI software solutions to analyze the market, and make predictions, and visualize data. Some big brands using Python in their application development- Google has been a supporter of Python because of its ease of maintenance and fast delivery system. Facebook also uses Python for hardware imaging, operational automation, infrastructure management, and binary distribution. 2) JAVA Java is one of the best programming languages used by analytics firms like NASA.  The list of best programming languages for AI is incomplete without talking about Java which is an object-oriented programming language that is easy to maintain, portable, and transparent language supported by a group of libraries.Java is also user-friendly and can work across different platforms without requiring any recompilation. If you’re working on a natural language processing (NLP) project, then Java gives you enough support from its group of libraries. Java supports big data platforms like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, which is good for creating data analytics related to AI development. NASA World Wind is an open-source virtual globe built on the principles of Java. It is known for its zooming capabilities that allow you to zoom from satellite altitude into any place on the Earth. It also lets you see Earth terrain in a 3D rich environment. 3) Google GO  Go Language is seen as the future of AI-enabled technologies While AI has only started making an impact on consumers, Google’s Go is an open source language that has been at the heart of AI development today.Some consider it to be the best programming language for AI development because developers can work with machine learning libraries written directly in Go language. It’s also best suited for AI development because its unique features enable the safe and smooth processing of information. Most notable companies such as Dropbox, Google, Lyft, Uber and Heroku use Go language because of its cross-platform support capabilities, fast compilation, and reliable software creation. What is Golang used for? Golang is a general purpose language made for future AI programming. Today AI developers often turn to Golang for AI projects that are based on ML because it offers features such as functional programming, rapid prototyping capabilities, C-inspired syntax, simplified documentation, garbage collection, and is highly flexible and adaptable to problem-solving needs. According to research by Google’s Russ Cox, “Golang  is currently used by at least 1 million developers across the world. On GitHub, the language has received over 65.7k stars and 9.3k forks, with over 1,400 contributors and 42,000 commits”.In recent years some of its key features made it a special option in the world of AI for businesses. It’s also easy to hire expert Go Lang developers with the help of the best companies to hire Golang developers. So, don’t delay, get it now to your work.4) JuliaIf you have a requirement for a task that demands numerical computing and analysis, Julia is the best programming language for your AI business projects. It is specifically designed for the numerical computing required by AI.It gives you results without requiring a separate form of compilation and its programming structure includes parametric polymorphism to make your software program more expressive along with the capabilities of dispatch software. According to a report, the number of downloads of Julia has increased 78.0%, from 1.8 million to 3.2 million,  since January 2018. Unlike the languages above, Julia provides excellent support for deep learning applications. For example, working with Julia allows you to translate complex algorithms directly from the research papers into the code form. This significantly reduces the risk of errors, improves safety, and cuts costs because it supports languages like Python, C++, and R. 5) HaskellHaskell is a perfect choice for building AI enabled software solutions. Tech giants,  such as Alcatel-Lucent have been using Haskell to develop its narrowband software radio system. use it. Haskell is also used in banking, large financial institutions, large data science firms, and research projects because it supports domain-specific languages that support programming language research and AI capabilities.Unlike Python and Java, Haskell is perfect for academic software development, as it supports a group of expressive libraries to create AI algorithms. It’s also a perfect choice for creating probability based programming that helps developers quickly identify the compilation errors during the phase of the iteration.Bottom LineAI software solutions are already improving our way of managing business activities, and future AI solutions can be used to predict the outcome of your efforts. And it is also helping developers to understand and act on future opportunities for the execution of AI strategy in business organizations. So, be ready to take advantage of new AI enabled technologies.      There are many companies, but its difficult to opt for the one, who keep an eye on market trends , AI capabilities, and everything involving development technology for your business project. If you are looking to hire machine learning app developers you can connect with ValueCoders- A leading machine learning app development company in India, the company have 16+ years of experience in delivering services to thousands of users across the world.

Lending tools charge higher interest rates to Hispanics and African Americans. Sentencing algorithms discriminate against black defendants. Job hunting tools favor men. Negative emotions are more likely to be assigned to black men's faces than white men. Computer vision systems for self-driving cars have a harder time spotting pedestrians with darker skin tones.The use of artificial intelligence, which combs through vast amounts of our personal data in search of patterns, is rapidly expanding in critical parts of Americans' daily lives such as education, employment, health care and policing. Increasingly, powerful artificial intelligence tools determine who gets into school, who gets a job, who pays a higher insurance premium.Yet a growing body of research shows that these technologies are rife with bias and discrimination, mirroring and amplifying real-world inequalities. A study scheduled to be released Wednesday by New York University's AI Now Institute identifies a key reason why: The people building these technologies are overwhelmingly white and male.Artificial intelligence technologies are developed mostly in major tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, and in a small number of university labs, which all tilt white, affluent and male and, in many cases, are only getting more so. Only by adding more women, people of color and other underrepresented groups can artificial intelligence address the bias and create more equitable systems, says Meredith Whittaker, a report author and co-founder of the AI Now Institute.""The problem of a lack of diversity in tech is obviously not new but it's reached a new and urgent inflection point. The number of women and people of color in the AI sector has decreased at the same time that the sector is establishing itself as a nexus of wealth and power,"" Whittaker says. ""In short, the problem here is that those in the room when AI is built, and those who are benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI systems, represent an extremely narrow segment of the population. They are mainly men, they are mainly technically educated and they are mainly white. This is not the diversity of people that are being affected by these systems.""The study, ""Discriminating Systems: Gender, Race, and Power in AI,"" comes as scrutiny of AI intensifies. For years, tech companies could not deliver on the industry's ambitious promises of what hyper-intelligent machines could do. Today, AI is no longer the stuff of science fiction. Machines can recognize objects in a photograph or translate an online post into dozens of languages. And they are getting smarter all the time, taking on more sophisticated tasks.Tech companies, AI researchers and industry groups cast AI in a positive light, pointing to the possibility of advances in such critical areas as medical diagnosis and personalized medicine. But as these technologies proliferate so, too, are alarm bells. People often think of computer algorithms and other automated systems as being neutral or scientific but research is increasingly uncovering how AI systems can cause harm to underrepresented groups and those with less power. Anna Lauren Hoffmann, an assistant professor with The Information School at the University of Washington, describes this as ""data violence,"" or data science that disproportionately affects some more than others. The NYU researchers say machines learn from and reinforce historical patterns of racial and gender discrimination.Last year, Amazon had to scrap a tool it built to review job applicants’ resumes because it discriminated against women. Earlier this month, more than two dozen AI researchers called on Amazon to stop selling its facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies, arguing it is biased against women and people of color.Google's speech recognition software has been dinged for performing better for male or male-sounding voices than female ones. In 2015, Google's image-recognition algorithm was caught auto-tagging pictures of black people as “gorillas.” Last year, transgender drivers for Uber whose appearances had changed were temporarily or permanently suspended because of an Uber security feature that required them to take a selfie to verify their identity.Other companies use AI to scan employees' social media for “toxic behavior” and alert their bosses or analyze job applicants' facial movements, tone of voice and word choice to predict how well they would do the job. Predictim analyzes online activities to produce ratings of which babysitters are more likely to abuse drugs or bully. AI can't make up for lack of diversity:Russia exploited race divisions on Facebook. More black staffers, diversity could have helped.Read more on tech's lack of diversity:Inequity in Silicon ValleyLeading the charge in raising awareness of the dangers of bias in AI is Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Joy Buolamwini, who with her research and advocacy has prompted Microsoft and IBM to improve their facial recognition systems and has drawn fire from Amazon, which has attacked her research methodology. Her work has also caused some in Congress to try to rein in the largely unregulated field as pressure increases from employees at major tech companies and the public. Last week, Democratic lawmakers introduced first-of-their-kind bills in the Senate and the House that would require big companies to test the ""algorithmic accountability"" of their artificial intelligence systems such as facial recognition. The bills were introduced just weeks after Facebook was sued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has charged the social media giant's targeting system with allowing advertisers to exclude protected groups from seeing housing ads.San Francisco is considering banning city agencies from using facial recognition. Privacy laws in Texas and Illinois require anyone recording biometric data, including facial recognition, to give people notice and obtain their consent. The Trump administration has made developing ""safe and trustworthy"" algorithms one of the key objectives of the White House's AI initiative.AI is controversial in tech world too:Elon Musk says AI could doom human civilization. Zuckerberg disagrees. Who's right?Some see AI doing social good:Can artificial intelligence prevent the next Parkland shooting?Facebook: Big user of facial recognition:Facebook wants to save your face. Should you say yes to facial recognition?The NYU researchers say it's critical for AI to diversify the homogeneous group of engineers and researchers building these automated systems. Yet the gender gap in computer science is widening.As of 2015, women made up 18 percent of computer science majors in the U.S., down from a high of 37 percent in 1984. Women make up less than one quarter of the computer science workforce and receive median salaries that are 66 percent of their male counterparts, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The number of bachelor’s degrees in engineering awarded to black women declined 11 percent between 2000 and 2015.The problem is even more acute in AI. Most speakers and attendees of machine learning conferences and 80 percent of AI professors are men, research shows. Women account for 15 percent of AI research staff at Facebook and 10 percent at Google. While there is very little public data on racial diversity in AI, anecdotal evidence suggests that the gaps are even wider, the study says.Last month when Stanford University unveiled an artificial intelligence institute with 120 faculty and technology leaders to represent humanity, not a single one was black. Boards created by tech companies to examine the ethics of artificial intelligence also lack members from underrepresented groups.Google also announced an “external advisory council” on AI ethics last month. NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson complained the new body ""lacks a qualified member of the civil rights community."" ""This is offensive to people of color & indicates AI tech wouldn't have the safeguards to prevent implicit & racial biases,"" he wrote on Twitter. Google later scrapped the advisory council. ""Both within the spaces where AI is being created, and in the logic of how AI systems are designed, the costs of bias, harassment, and discrimination are borne by the same people: gender minorities, people of color, and other underrepresented groups. Similarly, the benefits of such systems, from profit to efficiency, accrue primarily to those already in positions of power, who again tend to be white, educated, and male,"" the NYU study, a year in the making, found. Current efforts to attract and retain underrepresented groups in AI are not cutting it, the study warned.The push to bring more women into tech is too narrow and is ""likely to privilege white women over others."" Arguments focused on a recruiting or ""pipeline"" problem ignore pernicious issues in corporate and university work cultures – power imbalances, harassment, exclusionary hiring practices and unequal compensation – that drive women and people of color from AI or dissuade them from joining the field in the first place, researchers say.Among the study's recommendations: publish compensation levels broken down by race and gender and end pay and opportunity inequality; produce harassment and discrimination transparency reports; change hiring practices to increase diversity and the number of people of color, women and other underrepresented groups at senior leadership levels and create pathways for contractors, temps and vendors, who tend to be from more diverse backgrounds, to become full-time employees; and ensure executive incentives are tied to increases in hiring and retention of underrepresented groups.""To tackle the diversity crisis and to address AI bias, we need to look beyond technical fixes for social problems. We need to look at who has power, we need to ask who is harmed, we need to look at who benefits and we need to look at, ultimately, who gets to decide how these tools are built and which purposes they serve,"" Whittaker says.

Misk Schools introduce artificial intelligence into Saudi classrooms

            Misk Schools will revolutionize learning with the aid of the world’s most pioneering classroom technology, while empowering teachers to deliver an even stronger education. (Misk Schools photo)

It seems that we will reap the fruits of Saudi Vision earlier than expected:  Saleh Al-Ghamdi



	JEDDAH: Saudi students will soon be learning with the aid of artificial intelligence, as Riyadh’s leading Misk Schools become the first in the country to introduce AI into the classroom.

	From this September, students at Misk Schools will learn through and be assessed by artificial intelligence, providing a personalized education for each child and giving teachers greater insights into their performance. The school will use CENTURY, an award-winning teaching and learning platform that uses AI to adapt learning to each student’s individual strengths, weaknesses, behaviors and habits.

	Founded by Prince Mohammad Bin Salman’s Misk Foundation, Misk Schools is a state-of-the-art day school in Riyadh offering a new paradigm in education based on the best practices of international and progressive education.

	Misk Schools says that the move will ensure that students are learning with the aid of the world’s most pioneering classroom technology, while empowering teachers to deliver an even stronger education.

	Artificial intelligence — where machines are programmed to perform tasks traditionally associated with humans — is transforming education across the world. It is used to tailor learning to each student, while freeing teachers’ time to teach by automating admin tasks such as marking and planning. It also provides them with extensive data on each child’s performance, allowing for more effective targeted interventions to support or stretch students.

	While Misk Schools is the first school in Saudi Arabia to adopt AI, the Middle East is leading the way internationally in using AI and technology to improve education.

	Director General of Misk Schools Peter Hamilton said that they were excited to be partnering with CENTURY as its breaks new ground in ways to embed technology to transform the learning experience for students. “We seek to both support and challenge our learners, and by partnering with CENTURY we will empower our students to take ownership of their learning. Moreover, CENTURY will allow our teachers to have better insight into the daily work of each student, and to better plan future work in the classroom.” Hamilton said. 

	Founder and CEO of CENTURY Tech Priya Lakhani said: “AI is transforming schools across the world by providing a more personalized education to students, while simultaneously empowering teachers with precise data so that they can perform even better as educators.

	“AI is the only way we can move from the failed, outdated ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to ‘one-size-fits-one.’ It allows each student to learn at their own pace, with lessons and tests tailored to maximize their strengths and rapidly address their weaknesses,” she said.

	“I am delighted to welcome Misk Schools to the CENTURY family. From children in leading independent schools to Syrian refugees in the Middle East, CENTURY is being used across the world to improve the lives of children and young adults from all backgrounds.”

	Saleh Al-Ghamdi, an English language teacher, told Arab News that introducing AI into classrooms was a major leap forward in the Saudi education system.

	“It seems that we will earlier than expected reap the fruits of the promising Saudi Vision before 2030 falls. It is an important step that will entirely change education in Saudi Arabia. I see the step as a road map to a bright education future,” Al-Ghamdi said.

	He added that Saudi Arabia is looking forward to putting its citizens on the path toward first-world countries. “Introducing AI in our schools is one of the ways that can significantly help in achieving our Vision 2030 goals. It is true that this process may require big efforts, but with determination nothing is impossible,” Al-Ghamdi said.

	Introducing AI in schools would greatly help students to feel successful and educators more productive. “It will also assist in promoting active learning and deeper engagement. What is more, it will make educators’ jobs more focused and much easier,” he said.

	Al-Ghamdi said that some teachers might fear that the introduction of AI in education would threaten their jobs, but “the truth is that this revolution in education will hopefully make robots and computer programs and technology, in general, a supporting element to their indispensable profession,” he said.

	Research involving more than 11,000 students using CENTURY showed that the platform improves understanding of a topic by an average of 30 percent. It also frees teachers from admin tasks such as marking and planning — saving an average of six hours a week and allowing them to focus on teaching itself.

	Last month CENTURY Tech agreed a landmark agreement with the Belgium government. As a leading teaching and learning platform that uses artificial intelligence in its design, CENTURY Tech is rapidly spreading across the world, from English independent schools to schools in Lebanon educating large numbers of Syrian refugees.

Apr 18, 2019, 8:45 AM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 NewThe recent AI boom has had all sorts of weird and wonderful side effects as amateur tinkerers find ways to repurpose research from universities and tech companies. But one of the more unexpected applications has been in the world of video game mods. Fans have discovered that machine learning is the perfect tool to improve the graphics of classic games. The technique being used is known as “AI upscaling.” In essence, you feed an algorithm a low-resolution image, and, based on training data it’s seen, it spits out a version that looks the same but has more pixels in it. Upscaling, as a general technique, has been around for a long time, but the use of AI has drastically improved the speed and quality of results.“It was like witchcraft.”“It was like witchcraft,” says Daniel Trolie, a teacher and student from Norway who used AI to update the visuals of 2002 RPG classic The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. “[It] looked like I just downloaded a hi-res texture pack from [game developers] Bethesda themselves.” Trolie is a moderator at the r/GameUpscale subreddit where, along with specialist forums and chat apps like Discord, fans share tips and tricks on how to best use these AI tools. Browsing these forums, it’s apparent that the modding process is a lot like restoring old furniture or works of art. It’s a job for skilled craftspeople, requiring patience and knowledge. Not every game is a good fit for upscaling, and not every upscaling algorithm produces similar results. Modders have to pick the right tool for the job before putting in hundreds of hours of work to polish the final results. It’s a labor of love, not a quick fix. Despite the work involved, it’s still much faster than previous methods. It means restoring the graphics can be done in a few weeks by a single dedicated modder, rather than a team that has to work for years. As a consequence, there’s been an explosion of new graphics for old games over the past six months or so. The range of titles is impressive, including Doom, Half-Life 2, Metroid Prime 2, Final Fantasy VII, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Even more recent fare like 2010’s Mass Effect 2 has got the AI-upscaling treatment. In each case, though, these are unsanctioned upgrades, meaning it takes a bit of extra know-how to install the new visuals.Actually creating these AI graphics takes a lot of work, explains a modder who goes by the name hidfan. He tells The Verge that the updated Doom visuals he made took at least 200 hours of work to tweak the algorithm’s output and clean up final images by hand.In Doom, as with many video games, the majority of the visuals are stored as texture packs. These are images of rocks, metal, grass, and so on that are pasted onto the game’s 3D maps like wallpaper onto the walls of a house. Just as with wallpaper, these textures have to tesselate perfectly, or players can spot where one image starts and another begins. Because the output from AI upscaling algorithms tends to introduce a lot of noise, says hidfan, a lot of manual editing is still required. The same is true when it comes to the visuals for characters and enemies. Hidfan says that cleaning up just a single monster takes between five and 15 hours, depending on how complex their animation is.

But how does the process actually work? Albert Yang, CTO of Topaz Labs, a startup that offers a popular upscaling service used by many modders, says it’s pretty straightforward. You start by taking a type of algorithm known as a generative adversarial network (GAN) and train it on millions of pairs of low-res and high-res images. “After it’s seen these millions of photos many, many times it starts to learn what a high resolution image looks like when it sees a low resolution image,” Yang tells The Verge.RelatedHow artificial intelligence will revolutionize the way video games are developed and playedOne part of the algorithm tries to re-create this transition from low-res to high-res, while another part compares its work against the training data, seeing if it can spot the difference and rejecting the output if not. This feedback loop is how GANs improve over time. Using AI to upscale images is a relatively simple task, but it perfectly illustrates the core advantage of machine learning. While traditional algorithms rely on rules defined by humans, machine learning techniques create their own rules by learning from data. A comparison of a traditional upscaling technique (“nearest neighbor”) and the AI-enhanced version (“ESRGAN”).  Image: kingdomakrillic.tumblr.comIn the case of upscaling algorithms, these rules are often pretty simple. If you want to upscale a 50 x 50-pixel image to double its size, for example, a traditional algorithm just inserts new pixels between the existing ones, selecting the new pixels’ color based on an average of its neighbors. To give a very simplified example: if you have a red pixel on one side and a blue pixel on the other, the new pixel in the middle comes out purple. This sort of method is simple to code and execute, but it’s a one-size-fits-all approach that produces mixed results, says Yang.The algorithms created by machine learning are much more dynamic by comparison. Topaz Labs’ Gigapixel upscaling doesn’t just look at neighboring pixels; it looks at whole sections of images at a time. That allows it to better re-create larger structures, like the outlines of buildings and furniture or the edges of a racetrack in Mario Kart.“This larger perceptual field is the major reason [AI upscaling algorithms] perform so much better,” says Yang. Updating game graphics is more than just a technical challenge, though. It’s often about salvaging memories. Replaying the favorite video games of one’s youth can be a surprisingly bittersweet experience: the memories are intact, but the games themselves seem strangely ugly and raw. “Was I really impressed by those graphics?” you ask yourself, wondering if you’ve lost the capacity to enjoy such games altogether. Take the Final Fantasy series, for example. These were titles I played extensively as a child. Just hearing songs from their soundtracks can transport me back to specific in-game moments and locations. But playing the games again as an adult is a weird experience. I usually don’t get too far when I try, despite the treasured place they hold in my memory. They just look bad. Modder Stefan Rumen, who used AI upscaling to improve the graphics of Final Fantasy VII, explains that new display technology is as much to blame for this as outdated graphics. “With the pixel/low polygon graphics of yesteryear, the old TV monitors helped gloss over many imperfections,” he says. “Your mind finished the job and filled in the gaps [but] modern displays show these old games in their un-filtered roughness.” Luckily, these early games are also the perfect target for AI upscaling. In the case of the Final Fantasy series, that’s partly because of their extensive use of pre-rendered backgrounds, which mean modders have to process fewer images. The visuals also occupy a “sweet spot” in terms of detail, says Rumen. “They’re not as low-res as pixel art, meaning there’s more information for the machine learning to do its magic, but it’s not a too high resolution that an upscale wouldn’t be needed,” he says. The results speak for themselves. Rumen says that Final Fantasy VII isn’t actually a game he played when he was young. (“I was a PC kid.”) But by updating the graphics, he’s making these classics accessible once more. They’ve convinced me, anyway. I’ve just downloaded Rumen’s AI graphics pack myself and am getting ready to play FFVII once more.

But one of the more unexpected applications has been in the world of video game mods. Fans have discovered that machine learning is the perfect tool to improve the graphics of classic games. 

The technique being used is known as “AI upscaling.” In essence, you feed an algorithm a low-resolution image, and, based on training data it’s seen, it spits out a version that looks the same but has more pixels in it. Upscaling, as a general technique, has been around for a long time, but the use of AI has drastically improved the speed and quality of results.

""“It was like witchcraft.”""

“It was like witchcraft,” says Daniel Trolie, a teacher and student from Norway who used AI to update the visuals of 2002 RPG classic The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. “[It] looked like I just downloaded a hi-res texture pack from [game developers] Bethesda themselves.” 

[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgNkFzLObkY]

Trolie is a moderator at the r/GameUpscale subreddit where, along with specialist forums and chat apps like Discord, fans share tips and tricks on how to best use these AI tools. 

Browsing these forums, it’s apparent that the modding process is a lot like restoring old furniture or works of art. It’s a job for skilled craftspeople, requiring patience and knowledge. Not every game is a good fit for upscaling, and not every upscaling algorithm produces similar results. Modders have to pick the right tool for the job before putting in hundreds of hours of work to polish the final results. It’s a labor of love, not a quick fix. 

Despite the work involved, it’s still much faster than previous methods. It means restoring the graphics can be done in a few weeks by a single dedicated modder, rather than a team that has to work for years. As a consequence, there’s been an explosion of new graphics for old games over the past six months or so. 

The range of titles is impressive, including Doom, Half-Life 2, Metroid Prime 2, Final Fantasy VII, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Even more recent fare like 2010’s Mass Effect 2 has got the AI-upscaling treatment. In each case, though, these are unsanctioned upgrades, meaning it takes a bit of extra know-how to install the new visuals.

[Media: https://twitter.com/andrewrstine/status/1072238889673252864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1072238889673252864&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fajax%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1072238889673252864%26autosize%3D1]

Actually creating these AI graphics takes a lot of work, explains a modder who goes by the name hidfan. He tells The Verge that the updated Doom visuals he made took at least 200 hours of work to tweak the algorithm’s output and clean up final images by hand.

In Doom, as with many video games, the majority of the visuals are stored as texture packs. These are images of rocks, metal, grass, and so on that are pasted onto the game’s 3D maps like wallpaper onto the walls of a house. Just as with wallpaper, these textures have to tesselate perfectly, or players can spot where one image starts and another begins. 

Because the output from AI upscaling algorithms tends to introduce a lot of noise, says hidfan, a lot of manual editing is still required. The same is true when it comes to the visuals for characters and enemies. Hidfan says that cleaning up just a single monster takes between five and 15 hours, depending on how complex their animation is. 

That’s something to remember when looking at these updates or any project that uses machine learning. Just because AI is involved, doesn’t mean human labor isn’t.

This is similar to our apprehensions in the past about computers taking over workers upon mass adoption..Today, we see computers and laptops as indispensable goods in every domain. In fact, they have performed miracles — from assisting in controlling missiles to tracing water beneath dry soil..The new set of buzz words that have entered our lexicon due to computers include workplace automation, artificial intelligence (AI), robotisation, virtual assistance and block chain. The Google Assistant can now fairly remind your schedules, browse nearest coffee shops and plan for your health check-up on a single command. The Aristotle, a programmable device of Mattel, can read bedtime stories to the kids and teach foreign words to the toddlers. The Steve, a security robot, can walk around a place and detect potential fires. The nanny-robots can monitor a chicken’s health. The list keeps growing by the day. By 2025, robotics is predicted to be a $67 billion sector..State of affairs.Coming back to the issue of jobs, the claims about the impact of the aforesaid technologies are rather far-fetched. For starters, let us have a look at the employment share of different sectors in India. As per the Reserve Bank of India’s database, of a total 48 crore workers in the year 2015-16, 42 per cent were in agriculture, 14 per cent in construction, 12 per cent in trade, restaurants and hotels, another 12 per cent in manufacturing, 11 per cent in community, social and personal services, and the rest were in other industries. Within the 42 per cent in agriculture, 27 per cent were farmers and 15 per cent were agricultural labourers..But much of the new jobs generated in the past were restricted to very few industries. Between 2010-11 and 2015-16, around 1.5 crore new entrants joined the workforce throughout the country, averaging around 70 lakh new workers each year. Business services attracted these entrants the most (23 per cent), followed by manufacturing (17 per cent), education (12 per cent), trade (11 per cent) and transport and storage (11 per cent)..Even within manufacturing, there were job losses. The textile and leather sectors lost around 12 lakh workers and the wood and furniture sector has lost around 9 lakh workers during these five years. Much of the employment has happened in the electronic and optical equipment industries. The food and beverages sector attracted just 1 lakh new entrants a year..It is noteworthy to mention that during these five years alone, around 2.7 crore workers have left agriculture, including farmers. Almost equal in size, the construction sector has registered about 2.5 crore new workers, signaling the fact that much of the agricultural workers have now turned into construction workers..This ‘supply shock’, along with a shift into the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, has created an enormous increase in agricultural wages, the burden of which is ultimately passed on to the farmers. The statistics from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy shows that between 2014 and 2018 alone, agricultural wages of men have risen by 27 per cent and for operations like picking, it stands as high as 41 per cent..What is more interesting is that wages have risen by only 24 per cent in construction where most of the agricultural workers have shifted. Dominated by small holders who make up 86 per cent of all farmers, a rise in cost, propelled by rising wages, could harm farm earnings..Hence, the need of the hour is to move towards mechanised agriculture, prompted by cost-effective/affordable customs-hiring models that could compensate this labour shock and improve farmers' income. While these models have succeeded in a few states, a full-fledged adoption is yet to be realised..This trend of shifting into construction and other sectors would continue in the future as well. This is because non-farm jobs offer higher wages than agriculture. The wage rate in agriculture during last December (2018) was Rs 299 a day, whereas it was Rs 332 for a construction worker, Rs 426 for a carpenter, Rs 351 for a blacksmith, Rs 472 for a mason, Rs 443 for a plumber and Rs 427 for an electrician. With a little effort, an unskilled agricultural worker could get trained on these tasks. Moreover, they require no new skill to enter into the construction workforce..Another reason, in our view, is that there exists huge under-employment in agriculture. Farmers and labourers are available and willing to work for additional days and months, but they can’t get enough work. Our estimates using the Labour Bureau’s records showed that about 70 per cent of casual labourers in agriculture and 49 per cent of farmers are underemployed. In absolute size, this translates to 6.4 crore farmers and 5.0 crore agricultural labourers. When such a huge mass is placed in an environment where there are less jobs, it is natural for one to expect to migrate into high paying non-farm and urban jobs..Employing drones and robots or applications of AI and other innovations might not altogether worsen unemployment. Much of the developed countries’ applications of AI are in the finance, transportation, healthcare and defence sectors. In India, we have not more than seven per cent of workers in these sectors. The uses of robots are in the fields of manufacturing, construction, rescue operations and personal security. While one could think of threats to jobs in manufacturing and construction as we have high share of workers, it could still not be the case..For example, of the 5.7 crore workers employed in manufacturing industries during the year 2015-16, only 1.1 crore belong to formal industries. If we assume an average of 4 lakh new jobs generated in formal manufacturing each year and assume automation to the level of 10 per cent, the maximum possible job-loss turns out to be 40,000. And not all the industries would be able to afford automation for cost reasons. If we further assume an adoption of 20 per cent industries, this further boils down to 8,000. One could observe similar possibilities in the other sectors as well. In agriculture, one can barely expect to generate job losses as applications in pest surveillance and weather forecasting involve literally no unskilled worker..New avenues.Rather, moving towards these technologies would open avenues for new jobs, especially in information and communication technologies and data sciences. To harness potential, we require to build institutional capabilities that train the young workforce for these sectors. There exists huge demand for skill building, not just in these emerging technologies but in the existing industries as well. Today, even in manufacturing, just 10 per cent have received some form of training. In agriculture, construction and trade, it’s just five per cent and in finance, it is six per cent. Overall, not more than six per cent workers are trained in India. While there are definite margins for skilled personnel, the attempt to deliver skill-training could itself generate sizeable employment..To end up, when sufficient institutional capabilities are built to train the workforce for future jobs and impart skills to the existing force, the threat to job loss could be a lesser menace. But generating jobs for the underemployed could still be a hard matter to deal with.

The computer can compare activity data with qualitative assessments of workers from personnel files or sales performance figures to give managers a detailed picture of how behaviour affects output.Users so far include five law firms, a training company called Smarter Not Harder and a London estate agency, JBrown, according to Status Today, which promises “real-time insights into each employee and their position within the organisational network”. Workers do not automatically have a right to see the data, which is controlled by the employer.The insurer Hiscox and the IT firm Cisco have used the system for short-term analysis rather than continuous surveillance, Status Today said.Rise of robots ‘could see workers enjoy four-day weeks’Read moreCritics say such systems risk increasing pressure on workers who fear the judgment of the algorithm, and that it could encourage people not to take breaks or spend time in creative thought that will not be logged.“If performance targets are being fine-tuned by AI and your progress towards them being measured by AI, that will only multiply the pressure,” said Ursula Huws, a professor of labour and globalisation at the University of Hertfordshire. “People are deemed not to be working if they take their hands off the keyboard for five minutes. But they could be thinking, and that doesn’t get measured. What is this doing for innovation, which needs creative workers?”She said there were risks to mental health if people did not feel free to take breaks, for example to surf social media for a few minutes or play a game. A survey released this week suggests UK workers tend to procrastinate for on average three hours a day.The Isaak system has already gathered data on more than 1bn actions, which it uses to pinpoint “central individuals within a network” to better allocate workload and responsibilities, “ultimately improving the overall workplace environment and reducing stress and overworking”.It is part of what experts have labelled the “precision economy”, in which more and more aspects of life will be measured. The Royal Society of Arts predicts that in the next 15 years, life insurance premiums will be set with data from wearable monitors and workers in retail and hospitality will be tracked for time spent inactive. As gig economy working spreads, people will qualify for the best jobs only with performance and empathy metrics that pass a high threshold. Those with lower scores will have access to only the most menial and sometimes miserable tasks such as content moderation on social media, the RSA has predicted.Ankur Modi, the chief executive of Status Today, said his system aimed to provide a “wellbeing analysis” and could detect overwork – for example at evenings and weekends. But he admitted: “there’s always a risk that it might be misused”. He agreed it was a legitimate concern that companies could use it only to boost productivity, without focusing on wellbeing.“If one salesperson is performing well and you can see overwork and another isn’t performing well and isn’t overworked, that could be enough to start a conversation,” he said.However, he argued that it could help bosses cut out bias and discrimination by removing subjectivity from management decisions.How Taylor Swift showed us the scary future of facial recognitionRead moreAI ideas that are being developed elsewhere have included the use of facial recognition software and mood monitoring at work, recording a worker’s location on wearable devices and the monitoring of keyboard strokes.

Ginni Rometty is CEO, president and chairman of IBM. She has held the top job since 2012.
When she joined the company in 1981, total headcount across IBM was roughly 350,000. By 1994, under the direction of CEO Lou Gerstner, headcount dropped to around 225,000.

When she took over as CEO from Sam Palmisano—who had enjoyed a ten-year run as IBM’s top dog—the global employee population at the company had swollen to nearly 450,000 people. Some of it was organic. A lot of it was by acquisition.
Today and under Rometty’s leadership, IBM headcount has dropped approximately 25%. There are now less than 350,000 people. How? In part, artificial intelligence.
Rometty recently spoke at a CNBC event titled “@WORK TALENT + HR: Building the workforce of the future.” It’s her comments that got me thinking about the impact that artificial intelligence is going to have on an organization’s HR strategy and employee population.
PROMOTED
First, Rometty indicated that 100% of all jobs will be impacted by artificial intelligence.
I agree. Every role in the corporate hierarchy will in one way, shape or form be affected by the introduction of AI over time. She went on to say that job losses as a result of AI is a “red herring” and that we really shouldn’t “follow that logic all over the place.”

Not so fast.
There are millions of people in need of retraining and reskilling as a result of AI. If they aren’t at least partially taken care of by the organization, society will be overrun by people wondering what happened to them. It will become a zombie-like apocalypse of people wandering the streets looking for work.
In Rometty’s defense, she pointed out to audience members that organization’s ought to be considering three tactics to help with the transition to AI:

Retrain current employees;
Embrace people with less than a four-year degree;
Reskilling employees by apprenticeships.

Somewhat ironically, however, Rometty indicated that skills were going to become the lifeline of an employee’s relevancy. “If you have a skill that is not needed for the future and is abundant in the market and does not fit a strategy my company needs, you are not in a good square to stay inside of,"" Rometty said. ""I really believe in being transparent about where skills are.""
Again, transparency is one thing but helping employees with their transition under the shadow of AI, in my opinion, has got to be one of the organization’s top strategies going forward.
By example, IBM has reduced its global HR workforce by 30% through the introduction of AI into the company. But did it do anything to help those who were packaged out to learn a new skill?
Perhaps it did and those HR employees simply decided to leave. After all, Rometty suggested that  transparency is key to IBM’s workforce planning and skills gap. She also said that the AI that’s in place “infers” through the analysis of data, networks, relationships, skills, rankings and education what jobs are possible for internal candidates.
Maybe Watson felt those HR employees at IBM just didn’t have it in them to take on a new role.
That being stated, Rometty’s love for HR and the potential benefits of AI is demonstrable.
She alluded to other traditional HR systems being uprooted by AI for the better. MYCA—IBM’s internal career platform called My Career Advisor—no longer acts as a self serve system; instead the AI proactively recommends jobs to you based on skills, tenure, project work, rankings, and so on.
The company’s learning management system has become the “Netflix of Learning,” again proactively recommending courses and skill upgrades based on your progress at the company.
In an apparent knock to the antiquated way that HR organizes itself, Rometty believes that HR has got to become employee centric. “We have to do things for employees not to employees,” she said. She wants to see co-creation become a large part of its culture.
She wants companies to move away from centres of excellence to solution centres. Perhaps we should be thinking about pop-up solution shops. Using agile skills and collaborative team processes, these pop-up solution outfits allows her teams to come together for specific HR-related issues rather than the centre of excellence model.
Rometty rightly believes HR should be the role model for agile, AI, design thinking, net promoter score, and putting skills at the center of the organization. She believes it is an underutilized department. No complaints from me on that point.
IBM’s talent strategy also involves the proactive retention of people. Its HR AI system accurately predicts 95% of the time if people might want to leave the company. “It has saved the company over $300 million,” said Rometty, specifically due to proactive retention practices. It’s the artificial intelligence that tipped off IBM executives to take action—be it adding more compensation, skill development or a job change—before the employee might have left.
According to Rometty, this new way of operating at IBM has delivered a 20% bump in employee engagement scores across the company.
It’s still not clear how the changes in HR AI helped those folks in HR itself who lost their jobs due to AI. Irony aside, on the whole, I agree with Rometty.
Artificial intelligence is a must for any HR team if it wants to survive not only the pending talent war but its long-term existence, too. The big question is whether it will put that technology to good use to assist all employees, or will it simply be used to trim costs and total headcount numbers.

AI, or artificial intelligence, is huge right now. “Unsolvable” problems are being solved, billions of dollars are being invested, and Microsoft even hired Common to tell you how great its AI is with spoken word poetry. Yikes.
As with any new technology, it can be hard to cut through the hype. I spent years doing research in robotics and UAVs and “AI,” but even I’ve had a hard time keeping up. In recent years I've spent a lot of time learning to answer even some of the most basic questions like:AdChoicesADVERTISING

What are people talking about when they say AI?
What’s the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning?
What’s so great about deep learning?
What kind of formerly hard problems are now easily solvable, and what’s still hard?

I know I’m not alone in wondering these things. So if you’ve been wondering what the AI excitement is all about at the most basic level, it's time for a little peek behind the curtain. If you’re an AI expert who reads NIPS papers for fun, there won’t be much new for you here—but we all look forward to your clarifications and corrections in the comments.
What is AI?
There’s an old joke in computer science that goes like this: what’s the difference between AI and automation? Well, automation is what we can do with computers, and AI is what we wish we could do. As soon as we figure out how to do something, it stops being AI and starts being automation.
That joke exists because, even today, AI isn’t well defined—artificial intelligence simply isn’t a technical term. If you were to look it up on Wikipedia, AI is “intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.” That's about as vague as you can get.
Generally, there are two kinds of AI: strong AI and weak AI. Strong AI is what most people might be thinking of when they hear AI—some god-like omniscient intelligence like Skynet or Hal 9000 that's capable of general reasoning and human-like intelligence while surpassing human capabilities.
Weak AIs are highly specialized algorithms designed to answer specific, useful questions in narrowly defined problem domains. A really good chess-playing program, for example, fits this category. The same goes for software that’s really accurate in adjusting insurance premiums. These AI setups are impressive in their own way but very limited overall. Further ReadingDeepMind AI needs mere 4 hours of self-training to become a chess overlord
Hollywood aside, today we aren’t anywhere close to strong AI. Right now, all AI is weak AI, and most researchers in the field agree that the techniques we’ve come up with to make really great weak AIs probably won’t get us to Strong AI.
So AI currently represents more of a marketing term than a technical one. The reason companies are touting their “AIs” as opposed to “automation” is because they want to invoke the image of the Hollywood AIs in the public’s mind. But... that's not completely wrong. If we're being gracious, companies may simply be trying to say that, even though we’re nowhere near strong AI, the weak AIs of today are considerably more capable than those of only a few years ago. Ars VideoHow Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror
Any marketing instincts aside, that’s actually true. In certain areas, in fact, there has been a steep change in capability in machines, and that’s largely because of the two other buzzwords you hear a lot: machine learning and deep learning.

Machine learning
Machine learning is a particular way of creating machine intelligence. Let’s say you wanted to launch a rocket and predict where it will go. This is, in the grand scheme of things, not that hard: gravity is pretty well understood and you can write down the equations and work out where it will go based on a few variables like speed and starting position.
But this gets unwieldy when you’re looking at something where the rules aren’t as clear and well-known. Say you want a computer to look at pictures and you want to know if any of them shows a picture of a cat. How do you write down rules to describe what every possible combination of whiskers and cat ears looks like from every possible angle?Further Reading“OK Facebook”—Why stop at assistants? Facebook has grander ambitions for modern AI
The machine learning approach is well-known by now: instead of trying to write down the rules, you build a system that can figure out its own set of internalized rules after being shown a lot of examples. Instead of trying to describe cats, you would just show your AI a lot of pictures of cats and let it figure out what is and is not a cat.
This is perfect for our present world. A system that learns its own rules from data can be improved by more data. And if there’s one thing we’ve gotten really good at as a species, it’s generating, storing, and managing a lot of data. Want to be better at recognizing cats? The Internet is generating millions of examples as we speak.
The ever-increasing tide of data is one part of why machine learning algorithms have been blowing up. The other part has to do with how to use the data.
With machine learning, besides the data there are two other, related questions:

How do I remember what I’ve learned? On a computer, how do I store and represent the relationships and rules I’ve extracted from the example data?
How do I do the learning? How do I modify the representation I’ve stored in response to new examples and get better?

In other words, what’s the thing that’s actually doing the learning from all this data?
In machine learning, the computational representation of the learning that you store is called the model. The kind of model you use has huge effects: it determines how your AI learns, what kind of data it can learn from, and what kind of questions you can ask of it.
Let’s take a look at a really simple example to see what I mean. Say we’re shopping for figs at the grocery store, and we want to make a machine learning AI that tells us when they’re ripe. This should be pretty easy, because with figs it’s basically the softer they are, the sweeter they are. 
We could choose some samples of ripe and unripe fruits, see how sweet they are, then put them on a graph and fit a line. This line is our model.








                    Our baby AI, in line form. “The softer it is, the sweeter it is...""                  


                                          Haomiao Huang                                      









                    Things quickly get more complicated when you add extra data, though.                  


                                          Haomiao Huang                                      



Previous SlideNext Slide

Look at that! The line implicitly captures the idea of “the softer it is, the sweeter it is” without us having to write it down. Our baby AI doesn’t know anything about sugar content or how fruits ripen, but it can predict how sweet a fruit will be by squeezing it.
How do we train our model to make it better? We can collect some more samples and do another line fit to get more accurate predictions (as we did in the second image above).
Problems become immediately evident. We’ve been training our fig AI on nice grocery store figs so far, but what happens if we dump it in a fig orchard? All of a sudden, not only is there ripe fruit, there’s also rotten fruit. They’re super soft, but they’re definitely not good to eat.
What do we do? Well, it’s a machine learning model, so we can just feed it new data, right?
As the first image below shows, in this case we’d get a completely nonsense result. A line simply isn’t a good way to capture what happens when fruit gets too ripe. Our model no longer fits the underlying structure of the data.
Instead, we have to make a change and use a better, more complex model—maybe a parabola or something similar is a good fit. That tweak causes training to get more complicated, because fitting these curves requires more complicated math than fitting a line.








                    OK, maybe a line wasn't such a good idea for complex AI...                  


                                          Haomiao Huang                                      









                    More complicated math now required.                  


                                          Haomiao Huang                                      



Previous SlideNext Slide

This is a pretty silly example, but it shows you how the kind of model you choose determines the learning you can do. With figs, the data is simple so your models can be simple. But if you’re trying to learn something more complex, you need more complex models. Just as no amount of data would let the line-fit model capture how rotten fruit behaves, there’s no way to do a simple curve that fits to a pile of images and get a computer vision algorithm.
The challenge of machine learning, then, is in creating and choosing the right models for the right problems. We need a model that is sophisticated enough to capture really complicated relationships and structure but simple enough that we work with it and train it. So even though the Internet, smartphones, and so on have made tremendous amounts of data available to train on, we still need the right models to take advantage of this data.
And that's precisely where deep learning comes in.

Over the next decade up to 40% of jobs could be replaced by automation. That’s according to a forecast from the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia. 



Risk of job automation by country. In New Zealand, for instance,
the median worker has 39% chance of their job being automated.
OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Paper No. 202


Other estimates are less dire. A report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says only 14% of jobs across its member nations are “highly automatable”, though another 32% are likely to change significantly.
Despite this uncertainty about the exact number of human jobs that will disappear, it is certain the impacts of automation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) are potentially profound. 
If the new jobs that emerge as a result are fewer and less rewarding than those lost, we face a period of social dislocation. 
Yet there is little evidence of any strategic planning and forward thinking by Australia’s federal and state governments to minimise the potential downside. The recent federal budget, for example, was silent on this issue. 
It is analogous to the lack of a strategic plan on climate change.

Our concern about the policy vacuum is based on an extensive search on government websites, the media and budget speeches, which disturbingly yielded very little. 
We think AI should be an election issue, because there is virtually no job that won’t be affected by AI-driven automation. Being ready for this technological and social revolution should be at the heart of any government’s economic and educational reform agenda. 
Workers that never rest
The activities at which AI is expected to outperform humans by 2030 include translating languages, writing high-school essays and driving trucks. By mid-century it is expected AI could be capable of writing a bestselling books or performing surgery. 
Researchers believe there is a 50% chance AI will outperform humans in all tasks in 45 years and that almost all current human jobs can be automated in 120 years.

The World Economic Forum may argue that AI and automation “is about empowering people, not the rise of the machines” but there are good reasons to think some people will lose out.

      Careful how you treat today's AI: it might take revenge in the future




Machines have many attractions to employers. They do not need rest, holidays or take sick leave. They will never complain about overtime or join a union. 
A report published last month by management consultancy McKinsey Australia suggests, if proactive measures are not taken, the unemployment rate could increase by 2.5 percentage points, based on up to 46% of jobs being automated by 2030.




The industries likely to experience the greatest disruption are retail, administration and government, health and social assistance, construction, manufacturing, and accommodation and food services.
Australia Statistics, McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), ONED, BLS, Oxford Economics



Inequality will also increase, the report says. To what extent depends on “how much Australia steps up its efforts to retrain and redeploy its surplus service, administrative and manual workers”. Without large-scale retraining, Australia’s Gini coefficient (the standard measure of income inequality) could increase from 0.32 to 0.41.
Questions for policymakers
The stakes are high. Employment is so much more than just an income. A decent job provides purpose and dignity. It enables security, health and well-being. Joblessness hurts the individual, families and the wider community. If fewer people have work, and more people get paid less, the federal government will have to contend with falling income-tax revenue and rising welfare spending.
With intensifying global competition and rapid technological change, all governments need to be strategic. They need long-term policies to help business and workers gain the knowledge, skills and abilities needed to seize the opportunities and mitigate the threats.

      Artificial intelligence can now emulate human behaviors – soon it will be dangerously good




There are three key questions for policy makers: 

To what extent will AI-driven automation increase unemployment and underemployment?
How can governments and employers take advantage of AI and create the jobs of the future? 
How can government, employers and educators equip employees and graduates with the skills to have jobs alongside robots, instead of competing with them? 

The growth in AI and machine learning need not pose a threat to jobs and our standard of living, but without a strategic and shared effort, we will repeat the mistakes of previous technological revolutions, which imposed a terrible price on some in the name of progress.

The authors of this article are working towards a book, The Fourth Industrial Revolution: Implications for Managers in the Asia Pacific, due to be published in September. It will include chapters from colleagues in Taiwan, China, India, Mauritius, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. For the Australian chapter we need more information from leaders and managers in industry about the impact of AI and the preparation and planning that is, or is not, occurring. We invite you to complete a short survey as part of this study. You can do so confidentially here.

Writer Tara Calishain shares tips and tools so you can learn to do cool stuff with technology.
Headlines about artificial intelligence are almost uniformly grim: it’s the worst thing ever, the robots are coming, they’re taking our jobs, Daleks will rule the earth. Behind the headlines, though, things are a bit more prosaic: AI has a long road ahead of it. While it’s good at some things, it’s awful at others, and I don’t take seriously any robots that have to levitate to get up stairs (sorry, Daleks).
If you want to get a sample of what AI can do right now, take a look at photo apps on the web. Editing photos is often daunting, but web apps make it easy. If you can upload a photo, you can use a web app to colorize it, remove the background, and more!

These tools can’t take the place of a full-fledged photo editor like GIMP or Photoshop, or even a heavy-duty web app like PicMonkey. On the other hand, they’re free, and there’s no learning curve. If you’re interested in editing photos but don’t know how to get started, these apps can help you dip your toe in the water and get a sense of the possibilities.
Munsie. (Tara Calishain)
For comparison I’ll be using this photo of my great-great-grandmother, Munsie, and showing you what four different sites can do to enhance this picture.
Colorize It
Colorizing photos is equally an art and a skill, and an AI-based app is not going to come close to the ability of a human colorist. At the same time, not everyone has the time or the ability to learn to colorize. These apps won’t be perfect, but you’ll be surprised how good they are. Note also that not all coloring apps are equal. The two I’m going to show you here will give you very different results. Pick the one you like best or try a lot of different photos for comparison.
Algorithmia
Colorize with Algorithmia. (Tara Calishain)
With Algorithmia, you can upload a picture or choose one from the web. The instant you do, Algorithmia will start colorizing it and provide you with a comparison image. You can download that or download the fully-colorized photo. Here’s a comparison of Munsie.
As you can see, the image is almost sepia-toned except for the red in the jacket. I suspect it’s because this picture was taken outside in full sunlight and the image is accounting for the glare.
Colourise.sg
Colourise treats the image quite differently. This app was developed by GovTech Singapore, and the images it used to train its AI to color photos was completely different, which shows up in how it colors the picture of Munsie:
Colourise. (Tara Calishain)
As you can see, Colourise went more for a green tint than red. I like this better because of the enhanced difference between Munsie’s skin and the wall behind her. Furthermore, her hair looks more natural, and not like there’s been a sheen of color applied to it. All photos are different, though, and I wouldn’t settle on using Colourise exclusively based on the processing of one image.
Take Out the Background with Remove.bg
I’m willing to bet that you have a picture of someone where you’d like to remove the background. Whether it’s because you want to get rid of somebody behind you or because the setting isn’t flattering, removing background images can be so useful but at the same time so difficult. But not with Remove.bg. Try this tool with a photo and you will feel like a wizard. In just a few seconds you’ll get a clean image with no or very little background.
There are a couple of caveats to be aware of: Remove.bg works best for single individuals, and it only works on humans (can’t take the background out of your dog picture!). All you have to do is upload your photo. Here’s the picture of Munsie with the background removed:
Remove.bg. (Tara Calishain)
It’s almost perfect in only seconds. The only thing Remove.bg missed is the arm beside Munsie (probably because the arm and her jacket are so close together) and a bit of shadow.
Remove.bg does offer the option of editing the image further before downloading it, but I found the tools a little awkward. If you’d be comfortable using that, you’d probably be more comfortable using GIMP or Photoshop, which would give you more options for cleaning up the image. (To be honest I’d probably just crop the photo a bit.)
Get Stylin’ with DeepArt
Maybe you want to glam up your picture a little bit and give it a little pizazz. DeepArt is here for you. Upload an image and choose a style, and it’ll apply the style to your image for free — with one condition.
DeepArt.com.
DeepArt result. (Tara Calishain)
The one condition is that as of this writing the queue for getting your image processed is over five days long. If you’re willing to pay €1.99 (about $2.25) you’ll get your image in fifteen minutes. I found myself pleasantly surprised by how Munsie’s image worked out:
Editing images doesn’t have to be complicated, difficult, or costly! And we have AI to thank for it. I suspect that we’re only going to see more of these apps over time. I’ll be able to do even more of this instant editing, and see my picture of Munsie in more new ways.

IBM sees the value of putting AI to work in human resources

Who put the non-human into human resources? At first glance, it seems like an unpopular alliance—the use of artificial intelligence to support a company's strategic goals vis a vis human resources.





IBM, however, is the company going big and bold in championing the benefits of technology driving work efforts to retain the best, the brightest, the most apt to contribute something to the conference table.
IBM CEO Ginni Rometty touted IBM's successful use of AI for leading the workforce at CNBC's @ Work Talent + HR Summit. She sat down with Jon Fortt and delivered some impressive numbers on how the IBM's AI tool helped the company.
First, though, let's run a flashback to the old days of Watson in the limelight when Forsyth Alexander in 2016 in a blog said HR people could use Watson Analytics to know what factors can be changed to hold on to good finds. Alexander walked readers through what lightbulbs can turn on once the HR-curious logged in to Watson Analytics.
""I ask Watson Analytics what drives attrition, because it's the most interesting to me, and I want to see how the other fields statistically relate to that target. It looks like working a lot of overtime is strongly linked to attrition."" She then had Watson show her predictive information ""on how job role and performance evaluation relate to employees who have left.""
Sure, some insights on triggers that a worker will leave that she saw may seem obvious– people who work a lot of extra hours without being rewarded and attrition in sales jobs being higher than other areas.
""What Watson Analytics does is quantify these insights reliably."" That way, she said, a company can take focused actions based on factual insights.






Fast-forward to 2019 and IBM is still talking up AI's potential for human resources insights and, regarding accuracy, the numbers being touted are impressive. CNBC said IBM HR now has a patent for its ""predictive attrition program"" which was developed with Watson to predict employee flight risk and prescribe actions for managers to engage employees.










CEO Ginni Rometty in 2019 talked about this ""predictive attrition program.""
Eric Rosenbaum, Editor, CNBC.com, said the AI retention tool is part of a suite of IBM products that are designed to upend the traditional approach to human resources management.
IBM artificial intelligence can predict which employees will leave a job with 95 percent accuracy.
The tool feeds into an overall strategic view at IBM of changing the human resources function from service to growth engine. She also said, you have got to put skills at the center of the culture.
An article in Forbes relays an understanding of the proactive retention of people.
""IBM's talent strategy also involves the proactive retention of people. Its HR AI system accurately predicts 95% of the time if people might want to leave the company. 'It has saved the company over $300 million,' said Rometty, specifically due to proactive retention practices. It's the artificial intelligence that tipped off IBM executives to take action—be it adding more compensation, skill development or a job change—before the employee might have left.""
How does this AI tool work? Seriously, how does it work? Several reports said they had not found specifics behind how this AI works.
Meanwhile, not everyone hastens to cheer and embrace the role of AI in HR. An interesting view was from Nick Kolakowski, senior editor, Dice Insights:





                Credit: IBM
             


""Indeed, given all the hype over A.I. and machine learning, it's easy to forget these aren't omnisciently wise systems...and HR processes are generally far more sophisticated, with a tricky human element.""
On the other hand, it is not easy to dismiss Rometty's insights about employee focus and fairness.
Have all managers in your experience kept an eye out for your professional growth? ""Among the tasks that HR departments and corporate managers have not always proved effective at, and where AI will play a bigger role in the future, is keeping employees on a clear career path and identifying their skills,"" said CNBC.com. ""Rometty said being transparent with individual employees about their career path is an issue in which many companies still fail.""
Regarding formal skills assessments. managers can be subjective in ratings.
Nonetheless, human resources as a human function with AI in the mix is a testy subject for some workers and it was not surprising to see thoughtful reader comments in TechSpot.
""If only we could predict when 'that next guy' is loading his AR-15 and getting ready to do something terrible,"" said one reader.
""Now it would be nice if employees also could use AI to predict when they are going to be laid off..."" said another,
And this one: ""As for what this AI is looking at, they say people don't leave companies, they leave bosses.""
Perhaps the last word on this belongs to Don Pontefract in Forbes: ""Artificial intelligence is a must for any HR team if it wants to survive not only the pending talent war but its long-term existence, too. The big question is whether it will put that technology to good use to assist all employees, or will it simply be used to trim costs and total headcount numbers.""

A Faculty of Computer Science researcher has been named as one of the new Canada CIFAR AI (CCAI) Chairs. This is the first Canada CIFAR AI Chair held by a Dalhousie faculty member.

Dr. Sageev Oore, also a Research Faculty Member at the Vector Institute in Toronto, joins top academic AI researchers from across Canada to form the second cohort of Canada CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) AI Chairs.

“I'm grateful to CIFAR,” says Dr. Oore. “Not only for the opportunities that the CCAI Chair opens for my own research with colleagues and students but also for the opportunities that the entire program opens for AI in Canada.”
World-class AI research

Alongside his work at Dalhousie, Dr. Oore is a Research Faculty Member at the Vector Institute. Based out of Toronto’s AI Hub, the Vector Institute is a community of world-class AI researchers and academic partners who work across disciplines on both curiosity-driven and applied research. The chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute is Geoffrey Hinton, one of the founders of the field of neural networks and deep learning, who also happens to have been Dr. Oore’s PhD supervisor.


“I joined Vector in early 2018 and I’m fortunate to be part of it,” says Dr. Oore. “There’s enormous wealth of experience and strength in machine learning at Vector, and my students at Dalhousie also have the opportunity to be affiliated with that.”

This latest announcement brings the number of Canada CIFAR AI Chairs to 46, from 29 announced in December. As part of the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy, the prestigious Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, funded by the Federal government with $86.5 million over five years, provides researchers with long-term, dedicated research funding to support their research programs and help them to train the next generation of AI leaders. The 46 Chairs are named in partnership with Canada’s three national AI Institutes: Amii (Edmonton), Mila (Quebec) and the Vector Institute (Toronto), as well as twelve universities and hospitals across the country.

“The Canada CIFAR AI Chairs Program is core to Canada’s ongoing leadership in machine learning research and training,” says Dr. Elissa Strome, Executive Director of the CIFAR Pan-Canadian AI Strategy. “As the first country to develop a national AI strategy and the birthplace of deep learning, Canada is uniquely positioned to advance machine learning research and responsible AI.”
AI and music

Dr. Oore’s research is focused on using deep learning techniques to generate music and art – enabling him to combine his backgrounds as both a computer scientist and a professional musician. He joined the Faculty of Computer Science in early 2018 after spending eighteen months as a Visiting Research Scientist working at Google Brain in Mountain View, California.

“I was on the Magenta team, creating AI-powered tools to assist people making music and art. Part of this included using deep learning to generate music. Sometimes that music might sound, for a moment, as though a human is playing it, even though it’s machine-generated.”


Combining AI and music has been a curiosity for Dr. Oore for a long time and he is currently building his lab here at Dalhousie. His lab is focused on machine learning in computational creativity, but Dr. Oore is also very interested in the synergies with related areas in the field.

“As a scientist and musician, it’s fascinating to see how this research relates closely to many other directions. Some music-generation models use a ‘language model’ that’s based on similar techniques used for text processing—like Google Translate. Other projects are tied to signal processing, speech, or image generation. A keen student has lots to contribute regardless of whether they have musical background, and we have many collaborative opportunities.”

Dr. Oore is part of a group of well-established AI researchers in the Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning research cluster at the Faculty of Computer Science.

Artificial intelligence in Australia needs to get ethical, so we have a plan

By 
					Emma Schleigerand Stefan Hajkowicz

The question of whether technology is good or bad depends on how it’s developed and used. Nowhere is that more topical than in technologies using artificial intelligence.
When developed and used appropriately, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the way we live, work, communicate and travel.
New AI-enabled medical technologies are being developed to improve patient care. There are persuasive indications that autonomous vehicles will improve safety and reduce the road toll. Machine learning and automation are streamlining workflows and allowing us to work smarter.
Around the world, AI-enabled technology is increasingly being adopted by individuals, governments, organisations and institutions. But along with the vast potential to improve our quality of life, comes a risk to our basic human rights and freedoms.
Appropriate oversight, guidance and understanding of the way AI is used and developed in Australia must be prioritised.
AI gone wild may conjure images of The Terminator and Ex Machina movies, but it is much simpler, fundamental issues that need to be addressed at present, such as:





how data is used to develop AI
whether an AI system is being used fairly
in which situations should we continue to rely on human decision-making?

We have an AI ethics plan
That’s why, in partnership with government and industry, we’ve developed an ethics framework for AI in Australia. The aim is to catalyse the discussion around how AI should be used and developed in Australia.
The ethical framework looks at various case studies from around the world to discuss how AI has been used in the past and the impacts that it has had. The case studies help us understand where things went wrong and how to avoid repeating past mistakes.


We also looked at what was being done around the world to address ethical concerns about AI development and use.

Based on the core issues and impacts of AI, eight principles were identified to support the ethical use and development of AI in Australia.

Generates net benefits: The AI system must generate benefits for people that are greater than the costs.
Do no harm: Civilian AI systems must not be designed to harm or deceive people and should be implemented in ways that minimise any negative outcomes.
Regulatory and legal compliance: The AI system must comply with all relevant international, Australian local, state/territory and federal government obligations, regulations and laws.
Privacy protection: Any system, including AI systems, must ensure people’s private data is protected and kept confidential and prevent data breaches that could cause reputational, psychological, financial, professional or other types of harm.
Fairness: The development or use of the AI system must not result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups. This requires particular attention to ensure the “training data” is free from bias or characteristics which may cause the algorithm to behave unfairly.
Transparency and explainability: People must be informed when an algorithm is being used that impacts them and they should be provided with information about what information the algorithm uses to make decisions.
Contestability: When an algorithm impacts a person there must be an efficient process to allow that person to challenge the use or output of the algorithm.
Accountability: People and organisations responsible for the creation and implementation of AI algorithms should be identifiable and accountable for the impacts of that algorithm, even if the impacts are unintended.

In addition to the core principles, various toolkit items are identified in the framework that could be used to help support these principles. These include impact assessments, ongoing monitoring and public consultation.
A plan, what about action?
But principles and ethical goals can only go so far. At some point we will need to get to work on deciding how we are going to implement and achieve them.
There are various complexities to consider when discussing the ethical use and development of AI. The vast reach of the technology has the potential to impact every facet of our lives.
AI applications are already in use across households, businesses and governments, most Australians are already being impacted by them.
There is a pressing need to examine the effects that AI has on the vulnerable and on minority groups, making sure we protect these individuals and communities from bias, discrimination and exploitation. (Remember Tay, the racist chatbot?)
There is also the fact that AI used in Australia will often be developed in other countries, so how do we ensure it adheres to Australian standards and expectations?
Your say
The framework explores these issues and forms some of Australia’s first steps on the journey towards the positive development and use of AI. But true progress needs input from stakeholders across government, business, academia and broader society.

That’s why ethical framework discussion paper is now open to public comment. You have until May 31, 2019, to have your say in Australia’s digital future.
With a proactive approach to the ethical development of AI, Australia can do more than just mitigate against any risks. If we can build AI for a fairer go, we can secure a competitive advantage as well as safeguard the rights of Australians.

 Get it sent to your inbox.The Chinese government has drawn wide international condemnation for its harsh crackdown on ethnic Muslims in its western region, including holding as many as a million of them in detention camps. Now, documents and interviews show that the authorities are also using a vast, secret system of advanced facial recognition technology to track and control the Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority. It is the first known example of a government intentionally using artificial intelligence for racial profiling, experts said.The facial recognition technology, which is integrated into China’s rapidly expanding networks of surveillance cameras, looks exclusively for Uighurs based on their appearance and keeps records of their comings and goings for search and review. The practice makes China a pioneer in applying next-generation technology to watch its people, potentially ushering in a new era of automated racism.The technology and its use to keep tabs on China’s 11 million Uighurs were described by five people with direct knowledge of the systems, who requested anonymity because they feared retribution. The New York Times also reviewed databases used by the police, government procurement documents and advertising materials distributed by the A.I. companies that make the systems.

This is “The Daily.”Today: Under Xi Jinping, China is pioneering a new form of governance by surveillance. In the first of a two-part series, my colleague Paul Mozur on how China piloted that system on one minority group in the country. It’s Monday, May 6.Hi.paul mozurHi.michael barbaroHeadphones.Paul, we’ve actually never met. You are in town from China. I’m hoping you’re going to tell me why.paul mozurYeah, so I’ve been reporting in and around China for about 12 years. And there’s always been a lot of control. I think people are aware of that. They’re aware there’s censorship. They’re aware that people can be followed, and there is a certain amount of surveillance. But in the past five years, things have really changed and taken a much more dramatic and darker turn, really, when it comes to, especially, surveillance. And that coincides with the rise of Xi Jinping. China’s president who came into power about five years ago has really doubled down on control. And he has been not shy at all about using technology to exert that control. And there’s a lot of things that are invisible in how that works, but one of the very few visible symptoms are the cameras. There were always some cameras in China, but recently, past couple of years, the cameras have just gone in in this dramatic way. Some of them look like these baroque modernist sculptures or something. It’s like four cameras stretching off of a different pole, or you have a camera hanging from a tree. There’s these almost hidden cameras in the subway cars, these little holes. And if you look closely at them, you say, oh, my God, that’s actually a lens. I counted the cameras on my way to work one day, which is a two-subway-stop ride. And I passed, I think, 250 cameras.michael barbaroWow.paul mozurYeah.michael barbaroIn what kind of places? Where are you seeing them?paul mozurAll kinds of places. Every intersection will have dozens of cameras to catch people’s license plates as they drive by. About every 50 yards, you’ll have a camera on a pole that’s a dome camera that can zoom in and grab their faces or follow somebody if you have to. And when you walk down stairs, there’s these high-powered facial recognition cameras aimed at your face, with the idea of trying to figure out who you are as you walk by.michael barbaroAnd who’s on the other side of those cameras?paul mozurYeah, it’s what I always wonder. We don’t always know. And this is the thing about China, is that it is an autocratic system with very little transparency. For the most part, what we assume is a newly empowered police force is using these to try to learn as much as they can about the population and track them.michael barbaroBut to the degree that there’s a rationale for this, what is it?paul mozurSecurity. Safety. We want to make sure that if something bad were to happen in our neighborhood, we could protect ourselves. But in some recent reporting, what we discovered is the true breathtaking ways in which the police are already assembling lists of faces of people that they’re worried about, and even using it to mark people based on ethnicity and race, and track them and keep a record. It’s as if you were just counting only one group of people as they went around a city and keeping tabs so that you can go back and see which person that was. And in America, this would be horrendously unconstitutional. But in China, it had been happening for almost two years without anybody even noticing.michael barbaroAnd why would China want to do that? Why would it track a group of people by race through cameras and this classification system?paul mozurRight. So China has had this long issue with a Muslim minority known as the Uighurs, who live out in western China, this massive province, a fifth the size of China’s landmass, called Xinjiang. It’s mostly desert and really high mountains. It’s the old Silk Road. And these people have lived there for more than 1,000 years in these tiny little oasis cities around the desert. And China has occupied their land for several hundred years now. And as China has occupied it, for the most part, until maybe the past 50 or 60 years, it’s mostly just been a far-flung place. But under the Chinese Communist Party, they’ve really solidified power. And they’ve started to change the demographics. So they’ve created all these passive incentives to move Han Chinese into this region.michael barbaroTo basically make it less Muslim? More Chinese?paul mozurExactly. And so, 50 or 60 years ago, there were almost no Chinese, and it was all Uighurs. Now it’s 50 percent Chinese, 50 percent Uighur. And that’s created all of these conflicts.But everything really changed in 2009. What happens is, there’s violence in this small factory in southern China. And it turns out that there was a rumor that these two Uighur factory workers raped a Chinese woman, and then when the ethnic Chinese confront the Uighur population at the factory, a big fight breaks out, where, ultimately, two Uighurs end up beaten to death.archived recording[SHOUTING]paul mozurAnd there’s a video of this on YouTube, and it goes around.archived recording[SPEAKING MANDARIN]paul mozurAnd in a tinderbox like Xinjiang, where you have all of these other tensions there, it becomes one of the main causes for this massive outburst of rioting and anger in the capital of Urumqi.Thousands of Uighurs take to the streets, some with knives, and they murder about 200 Han Chinese.michael barbaroWow.paul mozurSo it’s a brutal and large-scale race riot.archived recording[SHOUTING]paul mozurAnd following that, the military is mobilized. The internet is cut off in Xinjiang, so you cannot get online. Even phone calls outside the country are no longer allowed. It’s a new level of suffocating technological response. And so in the ensuing decade, what they’ve tried to do is figure out methods to systematize it. And so they’ve turned to the police, and they’ve turned to technology.michael barbaroHave you been back there recently?paul mozurYes. So I went back in October to Kashgar.It’s a transformed place. It’s one of the most bizarre places I think I’ve ever been. We’re, of course, followed by secret police wherever we go. There are checkpoints every couple hundred yards. And they’ve created these things called convenience police centers. So think of a convenience store, but it’s a police station instead. So these small concrete boxes with constantly flashing lights. And they’re every couple hundred yards, and police are in them. And they’ll set up checkpoints there. But the idea is to blanket the city with this very suffocating level of police presence and surveillance. This is an old, mud-brick city, filled with bazaars.And now what you have is that look with these tremendously powerful facial recognition cameras hanging from a mud-brick wall, and there are cameras absolutely everywhere.And so you have this very bizarre contrast of a place that in some ways feels like it could be timeless and 1,000 years old, with these hyper-modern technological solutions attempting to understand and track the populations.michael barbaroSo tell me about that tracking. So clearly, China is very anxious that this Muslim population is going to revolt or just generally disobey the desires of the Chinese government. So how does that translate into this surveillance apparatus? What are they going to do with the image of a Muslim man or woman in this place that’s going to stop that?paul mozurWell, so they’ve already thrown about a million people in camps.michael barbaroLabor camps?paul mozurWell, they call them re-education camps. And we don’t have a lot of understanding of what happens inside. But it seems to be day-long classes and people being made to sit and hear Chinese Communist Party theory and propaganda and things like that. They need excuses to put people in these places. So if you have this massive surveillance system, you can find people that you think might be dangerous or might be risky. But the thing is, it’s so over the top and so extreme, people get thrown in because they’re an academic, because they’re influential, because they use technology, because they wouldn’t shave their beard, because they read the Quran. There’s a million different ways. What they’ve done is just tracked everybody all the time in a way that nobody even can go out their door without feeling the weight of the gaze of the state.michael barbaroRight. Everything you just described would be something that you could capture on camera. You would see someone with a beard. You might see someone reading the Quran. And that could be the trigger.paul mozurRight. And they’ve hung lots of cameras in mosques. So the Id Kah Mosque is this beautiful, mustard yellow mosque that sits in the center of old Kashgar. It’s the heart of Uighur Islam. And I think I counted more than 200 cameras inside the mosque, trying to capture worshippers who would come and go. And there aren’t many worshippers anymore, of course, because who’s going to go walk in front of those cameras and show their faces? And then that very easily can just go into a database, and then they have a data point. They know that Michael was right outside the Id Kah Mosque at this time. And then when he leaves the Id Kah Mosque, he’ll have to give his ID again. And then when he goes down to the marketplace, he has to give his ID again. And that way, you can build a comprehensive map of where you’re going. If you want to go to the bank, if you want to go to a grocery store, you have to do this. If you want to enter the old city, you have to do it. And so, it effectively just makes it impossible to do anything in this society without constantly giving up your private information to the state and to the police.michael barbaroAnd what you’re describing is the definition of dystopia.paul mozurYeah. And it goes even deeper than this. Around 2017, 2016, in Kashgar, we’ve heard that many people were called in for compulsory medical checkups. And they never got the results of the medical checkup. But what the medical checkup was was they had to give a blood sample, and their faces were scanned. And they had to give a voice sample, irises were scanned. And so just a mass collection of a single ethnicity’s biometric information. And we don’t really know entirely what they’ll do with all of that. In our reporting, we’ve seen parts of this. We’ve seen some of the dossiers. And so they can map people’s family relationships.michael barbaroWow. And what might the Chinese government do with that information? About family members, all those connections?paul mozurThey use it to lean on people. And they use it to intimidate people. And they use it to show that they are so powerful that there would be no point, in a way, to resist or push back. And you could see it in the population, the fear.michael barbaroI’m trying to understand where this leads to, because this doesn’t seem like an effort to acculturate people or to encourage them toward a Chinese identity. If anything, the people who are being subjected to this would most likely resent the Chinese government, right?paul mozurRight. I think the thinking goes further than that. The hope is ultimately to, I think, change the population fundamentally — to re-engineer a new way of life for these people that is basically Chinese. And I think the ultimate goal here is to eradicate Uighur culture. And the thing is, if they fail, well, then they have a culture so completely in their control that it’s no longer a threat in any way.michael barbaroPaul, what’s the relationship between what’s happening to the Uighurs and the larger surveillance state in China? If the rest of China is already Chinese, how does this all connect?paul mozurSo a lot of people like to call Xinjiang the laboratory for Chinese surveillance. So if you have any kind of draconian solution to tracking somebody or figuring out what somebody is doing on their phone, you can try it out in Xinjiang, and then see what happens. In Xinjiang, they can get away with a lot more, because you have an ethnic minority that is already so beset that they can’t really push back.michael barbaroA group without any power.paul mozurRight, exactly. In the rest of China, you see something that’s a little bit more passive, but you see a constant creep.On the subway, for instance, you start to see more checkpoints. The police just sit out where people are transferring, and they just stop people at random, and they scan their ID card, just like what happened in Xinjiang. And one of the things our reporting showed is that it’s not just Uighurs they’re looking for in these cities. They’re making lists of people’s faces depending on what kind of group they are. So they are making lists of the mentally ill. They’re making lists of people with a past history of drug use. They’re making lists of people who would petition the government or complain about the government. But they also have lists of every single person registered to live in that city. So the idea isn’t just to track these small groups. It’s to track everyone, with the idea that if somebody were to get out of line, then you know everything about them to begin with.michael barbaroSo this is about every single person in China?paul mozurYes.[music]michael barbaroI’m struck that all of this is happening at the same time that China is becoming a world power whose influence is growing so much overseas, because those things don’t quite seem to be consistent. In fact, they seem to be very contradictory.paul mozurRight. And I think they’ve basically proved that wrong, that you can have censorship and you can have a closed society, in some ways, and a controlled society, but also have a booming tech sector. And this is the first time in probably 30 years that we’ve had an autocratic state alongside the United States at the cutting edge of technology. So if you think about it, democracies have dominated technological creation since the fall of the Berlin Wall, effectively. Now China’s coming along, and they’re making technologies, but these technologies are suited for their purposes. And in a lot of cases, those purposes have some authoritarian component to them, or some point of control to them. Very intentional control. And in fact, as they’ve risen, they’ve used all of this as a selling point. So think to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. This is China’s coming-out party as a new superpower.[music]paul mozurThey’ve outfitted the capital with tons of security to make sure it goes well, to make sure there’s no protests, but also to make sure there’s no attacks or anything. And so they load up the city with 300,000 cameras that the government was controlling.michael barbaroBecause, of course, this is a moment where you actually do want a lot of security.paul mozurYeah, exactly. Yeah. So they really pulled out all the stops.But then what they did when all these international leaders arrived to see the Olympics is they took them into the back rooms where you could see all these cameras operating. They show the screens. They show, this is how our policing system works.michael barbaroSo who is in there?paul mozurSo we don’t know everybody that visited. But what we do know is that countries like Ecuador sent delegations — places that might be struggling with democracy or even already being led by strongmen, who have come to check this out. And there’s screens up with video footage from these thousands and thousands of cameras. And they can see how the Chinese security forces can see everything. They look at it, and they say, well, this is pretty powerful. I wonder if we could get this. And that’s where it starts. And so now what we’re seeing is those technologies are beginning to flow to the world. And so all of a sudden, on the streets of Quito, you see the same cameras that you would see in Shanghai. And that’s not just happening there. That’s happening in Venezuela. That’s happening in Bolivia. That’s happening in Angola. That’s happening in Pakistan. It’s happening around the world.michael barbaroPaul, what do you make of this global spread of surveillance, starting in China? What does it tell you about the changes you’ve seen in China in recent years and where all this is headed?paul mozurIt tells me that, I think, the Chinese government believes it has created a different model and a new model, and they want to propagate it. They want to spread it. And they want to give other countries the ability to do what they’ve done and, in that way, influence the world. So this is — governance by data, governance by mass surveillance, is, in a way, the Chinese model now, and they want to bring it to the world. And what this encourages is authoritarianism, because it uses technology unapologetically to consolidate power by understanding what everybody’s doing and where they are at any given moment. And I think it’s an important moment for democracies like the United States, because they need to recognize this is happening, but also say, well, what does the United States stand for in all this? Do they stand for data collection, as well, without telling anybody? Do you stand for something else? Because the United States at this point is so lost in its own debates —michael barbaroRight. So do we stand in contrast to that?paul mozurRight. Exactly. And that’s the thing — as I write about this from China, it’s unclear where the United States stands in all of it.michael barbaroIn a world where this model that you’re describing is spreading around the world, how exactly does China benefit from that? Because there are fewer and fewer places where a democratic government without surveillance challenges it?paul mozurI think the idea is if you give the people you’re dealing with these systems, you increase their power. And that means the people you’re dealing with are more likely to keep dealing with you and be the ones in power. So there’s a sort of perpetuation. But I think there’s also just a broader sense of the more countries around the world that do this, the more it’s deemed acceptable by the world, and the more that they have reliable partners who are following what they’re doing and reliant on them and allow them to push how governance works. And so in a way, they become the axle, and all of these different places become the spokes in this wheel, the new version of global governance, a new alternative to the messy democracies of the past.michael barbaroGovernance by data.paul mozurGovernance by data and surveillance.michael barbaroPaul, thank you very much.paul mozurThanks.michael barbaroOn Sunday, The Times reported that the Trump administration has decided not to confront China over its repressive treatment of the Uighurs, for fear that it could disrupt the final stages of a major trade deal between the two countries.

The violence is the latest in a long-running series of clashes that have produced temporary ceasefires that are quickly broken. And President Trump on Sunday said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should not testify before Congress, setting up another confrontation with congressional Democrats, who have requested Mueller’s appearance. In a tweet, the president said that Mueller’s report was conclusive and that Americans do not need to hear from him again. “No redos for the Dems,” he wrote. Because Mueller was appointed by the Department of Justice, which answers to the president, it appears that Trump has the authority to prevent Mueller from testifying.That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.Listen · 23:18 minChinese authorities already maintain a vast surveillance net, including tracking people’s DNA, in the western region of Xinjiang, which many Uighurs call home. But the scope of the new systems, previously unreported, extends that monitoring into many other corners of the country. ImageShoppers lined up for identification checks outside the Kashgar Bazaar last fall. Members of the largely Muslim Uighur minority have been under Chinese surveillance and persecution for years.Credit...Paul MozurThe police are now using facial recognition technology to target Uighurs in wealthy eastern cities like Hangzhou and Wenzhou and across the coastal province of Fujian, said two of the people. Law enforcement in the central Chinese city of Sanmenxia, along the Yellow River, ran a system that over the course of a month this year screened whether residents were Uighurs 500,000 times. Police documents show demand for such capabilities is spreading. Almost two dozen police departments in 16 different provinces and regions across China sought such technology beginning in 2018, according to procurement documents. Law enforcement from the central province of Shaanxi, for example, aimed to acquire a smart camera system last year that “should support facial recognition to identify Uighur/non-Uighur attributes.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSome police departments and technology companies described the practice as “minority identification,” though three of the people said that phrase was a euphemism for a tool that sought to identify Uighurs exclusively. Uighurs often look distinct from China’s majority Han population, more closely resembling people from Central Asia. Such differences make it easier for software to single them out.For decades, democracies have had a near monopoly on cutting-edge technology. Today, a new generation of start-ups catering to Beijing’s authoritarian needs are beginning to set the tone for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Similar tools could automate biases based on skin color and ethnicity elsewhere.“Take the most risky application of this technology, and chances are good someone is going to try it,” said Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. “If you make a technology that can classify people by an ethnicity, someone will use it to repress that ethnicity.”From a technology standpoint, using algorithms to label people based on race or ethnicity has become relatively easy. Companies like I.B.M. advertise software that can sort people into broad groups. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut China has broken new ground by identifying one ethnic group for law enforcement purposes. One Chinese start-up, CloudWalk, outlined a sample experience in marketing its own surveillance systems. The technology, it said, could recognize “sensitive groups of people.” ImageA screen shot from the CloudWalk website details a possible use for its facial recognition technology. One of them: recognizing “sensitive groups of people.”Credit...CloudWalkImageA translation of marketing material for CloudWalk’s facial recognition technology.Credit...The New York Times“If originally one Uighur lives in a neighborhood, and within 20 days six Uighurs appear,” it said on its website, “it immediately sends alarms” to law enforcement.In practice, the systems are imperfect, two of the people said. Often, their accuracy depends on environmental factors like lighting and the positioning of cameras.In the United States and Europe, the debate in the artificial intelligence community has focused on the unconscious biases of those designing the technology. Recent tests showed facial recognition systems made by companies like I.B.M. and Amazon were less accurate at identifying the features of darker-skinned people.China’s efforts raise starker issues. While facial recognition technology uses aspects like skin tone and face shapes to sort images in photos or videos, it must be told by humans to categorize people based on social definitions of race or ethnicity. Chinese police, with the help of the start-ups, have done that.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s something that seems shocking coming from the U.S., where there is most likely racism built into our algorithmic decision making, but not in an overt way like this,” said Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “There’s not a system designed to identify someone as African-American, for example.”The Chinese A.I. companies behind the software include Yitu, Megvii, SenseTime, and CloudWalk, which are each valued at more than $1 billion. Another company, Hikvision, that sells cameras and software to process the images, offered a minority recognition function, but began phasing it out in 2018, according to one of the people.The companies’ valuations soared in 2018 as China’s Ministry of Public Security, its top police agency, set aside billions of dollars under two government plans, called Skynet and Sharp Eyes, to computerize surveillance, policing and intelligence collection.In a statement, a SenseTime spokeswoman said she checked with “relevant teams,” who were not aware its technology was being used to profile. Megvii said in a statement it was focused on “commercial not political solutions,” adding, “we are concerned about the well-being and safety of individual citizens, not about monitoring groups.” CloudWalk and Yitu did not respond to requests for comment. China’s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Selling products with names like Fire Eye, Sky Eye and Dragonfly Eye, the start-ups promise to use A.I. to analyze footage from China’s surveillance cameras. The technology is not mature — in 2017 Yitu promoted a one-in-three success rate when the police responded to its alarms at a train station — and many of China’s cameras are not powerful enough for facial recognition software to work effectively. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYet they help advance China’s architecture for social control. To make the algorithms work, the police have put together face-image databases for people with criminal records, mental illnesses, records of drug use, and those who petitioned the government over grievances, according to two of the people and procurement documents. A national database of criminals at large includes about 300,000 faces, while a list of people with a history of drug use in the city of Wenzhou totals 8,000 faces, they said.ImageA security camera in a rebuilt section of the Old City in Kashgar, Xinjiang.Credit...Thomas Peter/ReutersUsing a process called machine learning, engineers feed data to artificial intelligence systems to train them to recognize patterns or traits. In the case of the profiling, they would provide thousands of labeled images of both Uighurs and non-Uighurs. That would help generate a function to distinguish the ethnic group. The A.I. companies have taken money from major investors. Fidelity International and Qualcomm Ventures were a part of a consortium that invested $620 million in SenseTime. Sequoia invested in Yitu. Megvii is backed by Sinovation Ventures, the fund of the well-known Chinese tech investor Kai-Fu Lee. A Sinovation spokeswoman said the fund had recently sold a part of its stake in Megvii and relinquished its seat on the board. Fidelity declined to comment. Sequoia and Qualcomm did not respond to emailed requests for comment.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Lee, a booster of Chinese A.I., has argued that China has an advantage in developing A.I. because its leaders are less fussed by “legal intricacies” or “moral consensus.” “We are not passive spectators in the story of A.I. — we are the authors of it,” Mr. Lee wrote last year. “That means the values underpinning our visions of an A.I. future could well become self-fulfilling prophecies.” He declined to comment on his fund’s investment in Megvii or its practices.Ethnic profiling within China’s tech industry isn’t a secret, the people said. It has become so common that one of the people likened it to the short-range wireless technology Bluetooth. Employees at Megvii were warned about the sensitivity of discussing ethnic targeting publicly, another person said.China has devoted major resources toward tracking Uighurs, citing ethnic violence in Xinjiang and Uighur terrorist attacks elsewhere. Beijing has thrown hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and others in Xinjiang into re-education camps. The software extends the state’s ability to label Uighurs to the rest of the country. One national database stores the faces of all Uighurs who leave Xinjiang, according to two of the people.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGovernment procurement documents from the past two years also show demand has spread. In the city of Yongzhou in southern Hunan Province, law enforcement officials sought software to “characterize and search whether or not someone is a Uighur,” according to one document.In two counties in Guizhou Province, the police listed a need for Uighur classification. One asked for the ability to recognize Uighurs based on identification photos at better than 97 percent accuracy. In the central megacity of Chongqing and the region of Tibet, the police put out tenders for similar software. And a procurement document for Hebei Province described how the police should be notified when multiple Uighurs booked the same flight on the same day. A  study in 2018 by the authorities described a use for other types of databases. Co-written by a Shanghai police official, the paper said facial recognition systems installed near schools could screen for people included in databases of the mentally ill or crime suspects.One database generated by Yitu software and reviewed by The Times showed how the police in the city of Sanmenxia used software running on cameras to attempt to identify residents more than 500,000 times over about a month beginning in mid-February.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIncluded in the code alongside tags like “rec_gender” and “rec_sunglasses” was “rec_uygur,” which returned a 1 if the software believed it had found a Uighur. Within the half million identifications the cameras attempted to record, the software guessed it saw Uighurs 2,834 times. Images stored alongside the entry would allow the police to double check.Yitu and its rivals have ambitions to expand overseas. Such a push could easily put ethnic profiling software in the hands of other governments, said Jonathan Frankle, an A.I. researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.“I don’t think it’s overblown to treat this as an existential threat to democracy,” Mr. Frankle said. “Once a country adopts a model in this heavy authoritarian mode, it’s using data to enforce thought and rules in a much more deep-seated fashion than might have been achievable 70 years ago in the Soviet Union. To that extent, this is an urgent crisis we are slowly sleepwalking our way into.”ImageAn undercover police officer in Kashgar.Credit...Paul MozurPaul Mozur is a Shanghai-based technology reporter.

Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverThe ObserverIan McEwan This article is more than 5 years oldInterviewIan McEwan: ‘Who’s going to write the algorithm for the little white lie?’This article is more than 5 years oldTim AdamsThe writer, now 70, takes a typically probing look at the dilemma posed by artificial intelligence in his new bookSun 14 Apr 2019 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Apr 2019 06.12 EDTShareThere is a scene toward the end of Ian McEwan’s new novel, Machines Like Me, when the narrator, Charlie, is pushing his lifelike prototype robot, Adam, in a wheelchair through a demonstration in Trafalgar Square. The demonstrators are protesting about everything under the sun – “poverty, unemployment, housing, healthcare, education, crime, race, gender, climate, opportunity”. The suggestion being presented by McEwan and his narrator, however, is that here, unnoticed in their midst, is the one thing they should be most concerned about: a man-made intelligence greater than their own.There is a Cassandra tendency in McEwan’s fiction. His domestic dramas routinely play out against a backdrop of threatened doom. Since the portent-laden meditation on war and terrorism, Saturday, in 2005, he has also turned his gimlet attention to climate change in Solar. The opening lines of that novel – “He was running out of time. Everyone was, it was the general condition…” – have sometimes sounded like his fiction’s statement of intent. The New Yorker called his work “the art of unease”.It was perhaps, I suggested to him one afternoon a couple of weeks ago, therefore only a matter of time before he got around to the looming ethical anxieties of artificial intelligence.McEwan smiled at this idea and explained that he had been enthralled by the possibility of man-made consciousness for just about as long as he could remember. He was sitting in a low armchair in the corner of the upstairs room of his compact mews house near London’s inns of court (his primary home is a 16th-century Cotswolds manor house). He is 70 years old, still limber and thin and prolific, and among the few English novelists who can make headlines with stray comments on the issues of the day. There was a time when he appeared to approach that “man of letters” role with a studied gravity; these days he seems to wear the mantle more lightly.McEwan has twitchy antennae as a writer, scanning the news for patterns. In reflecting on the themes of his new novel he mentions the recent Boeing 737 crash in Ethiopia, in which the plane’s software apparently overrode the pilot’s best efforts to keep it airborne. This is a story, he forecasts, that will become an insistent narrative in all areas of our lives. “People are not quite aware yet that when they get in a plane they are flying in a giant brain,” he says. “That brain might believe the plane is stalling – though every last passenger and the pilot can look out of the window and see the plane is not stalling. We are in the process of handing over responsibility for safety, but also for ethical decisions, to machines.”McEwan has an abiding faith that novels are the best place to examine such ethical dilemmas, though he has little time for conventional science fiction. “There could be an opening of a mental space for novelists to explore this future, not in terms of travelling at 10 times the speed of light in anti-gravity boots, but in actually looking at the human dilemmas of being close up to something that you know to be artificial but which thinks like you. If a machine seems like a human or you can’t tell the difference, then you’d jolly well better start thinking about whether it has responsibilities and rights and all the rest.”View image in fullscreenMcEwan in 1976, when First Love, Last Rites was causing a literary stir. Photograph: Tony McGrath/The ObserverThe time frame we have for conducting that thinking, McEwan says, can probably be measured in the years that it will take for us to design the batteries that allow such robots as Adam to become autonomous. “My novel is a total fantasy. I look on YouTube at the best robots. There’s a creepy looking bald guy and various poker-faced females, but what you can’t see is the cable snaking into the mains. None of it will happen until we crack the battery problem.”Before we achieve that, he says, we need to confront the challenges of encoding what it means to be fully human. The drama of his novel, a somewhat predictable love triangle in which one of the trio has an on-off switch, hinges on the question of whether we can teach machines to lie. “Who’s going to write the algorithm for the little white lie that spares the blushes of a friend?” his novel asks at one point. “Or the lie that sends the rapist to prison who’d otherwise go free?”The tale itself is the familiar McEwan mix of minutely observed psychologies and page-turning plot. The latter is “like a pair of ready-made trousers you slip into,” he says. Though his interest here is in the limits of technology, he is not shy of the oldest stories. “I thought,” he says, with sudden bluntness, “if Charlie has fallen in love with the girl upstairs and a robot comes along who they have chosen to be averagely well endowed, then we are going to be so disappointed if he doesn’t fuck her…”In this sense, you might say, he is coming at the AI question from the opposite angle to Mary Shelley in Frankenstein. “There the monster is a metaphor for science out of control, but it is ourselves out of control that I am interested in.”That latter interest is the thread that runs through all of McEwan’s fiction from those early, disturbing stories of incest and paedophilia and psychosis in First Love, Last Rites through the tragic deceptions of Atonement, which has now sold six million copies. The warring parties in McEwan’s imagination are rationality and its discontents. You feel just a little of that conflict about him in person. He is a generous and entirely measured talker, who gives a sense of having long overcome an inbuilt reserve. His work ethic – one that has produced 15 novels, half a dozen screenplays – is in tension with a commitment to a certain playfulness. Diary entries of his youth seem telling. He joined the hippy trail to Iran and Afghanistan in the early 1970s and even in 1976 he was recording how “we eat psilocybe mushrooms, canoe, swim naked in the electric-cold water, take saunas, play volleyball, drink wine and talk about Jimmy Carter and Ezra Pound.” Elsewhere, however, he recalled of such hedonism, that: “On the road I often dreamed of being back under undistracting grey skies, writing fiction. After six months I was desperate to get to work.”View image in fullscreenJames McAvoy and Keira Knightley in the film version of Atonement. The book has sold six million copies.The action of the current novel is set not in some virtual future, but in a reimagined fragment of that personal past. Charlie, a vague alter ego of the novelist and his robot companion, Adam, occupy a house in south London in the early 1980s, just as McEwan did, prior to his first marriage. The technological anomaly of Adam is explained in the novel by the fact that Alan Turing, the mastermind behind the breaking of the enigma code, had not taken his own life in 1954, but lived into his 70s to fulfil his dream to create the first human-like brain.There were other contemporary parallels with that period that drew McEwan to it. He admits that he would not know quite where to start in writing a novel about our current polarised moment (“there are too many constituencies to consider”) but this book gave him a licence to examine a decade whose political dramas seem much like our own. Thus the book makes reference to the battle for the soul of the Labour party between the Trotskyite comrades of Tony Benn and the centrist followers of Denis Healey. It also imagines the fallout of a Falklands war that had been a humiliating defeat rather than a flag-waving victory.“The great thing about having an altered reality is that you can’t get anything wrong,” McEwan says. “Though I have become a merchant of fake news, I’m afraid, for probably an entire American audience and almost anyone else under 40.”The more McEwan reimagined that era, the more he felt that its history was being replayed as farce. “When the Falklands happened I was very much against the whole enterprise, and everyone I knew – with the exception of Christopher Hitchens – felt the same,” he recalls. “Yet every poll I read said 80 or 90% were in favour of the invasion. I realised what a bubble I lived in then as now. I have so few friends or acquaintances that are in favour of Brexit.”McEwan embarked on his novel a couple of months after the European referendum. I wonder how much of the general atmosphere of malaise he felt had filtered into it?He says that if it has, it is mostly subconscious. “Sometimes, I wake in the morning wondering what is bearing in on me, and then I remember,” he says. “Brexit does seem to me a national tragedy… the great lie of the Brexiters, their magic dust, was to persuade 37% of the electorate that the EU, not the UK, was in charge of immigration, and they succeeded.”On the day we meet the news is full of familiar accusations of betrayal from the Tory right. The novelist in him wants to get inside and understand the mindset of the European Research Group, he suggests, but he hasn’t quite the heart. “I am never sure what these people love about England,” he says. “I only hear what they hate. You don’t hear them eulogising folk music or Gardeners’ Question Time or anything, do you? What do they love?”View image in fullscreenMcEwan with fellow Booker prize shortlist finalists in 2007. Photograph: Alastair Grant/APAs he explains this, I’m reminded of a couple of profiles of McEwan I have read that have described him as Britain’s “national novelist”. I’d never really thought of him in that way but it seems true to the extent that he has a sure feel for the deep roots of our neuroses. The unconsummated wedding night in On Chesil Beach for example, captured all that Larkinesque weirdness about sex that was never quite expelled from the middle classes by the promiscuous 1960s.McEwan was in some ways born to that role of national psychologist. His father, Major David McEwan, was a hard-drinking spit-and-polish NCO, and he grew up in Aldershot and on various army bases in the dregs of empire. His earliest recollections, he has said, are of “weekday idylls with my mother interrupted at weekends by the loud appearance of my father, when our tiny prefabricated bungalow would fill with his cigarette smoke”. Their marriage, in which frustration became violence, began in unspoken tragedy.McEwan’s mother had met David McEwan in 1941. Her first husband, Ernest Wort, was serving in the forces abroad and in 1942 she and David conceived a child who was put up for adoption in a small ad in the Reading Mercury that was a short story in itself: “Wanted, Home for Baby Boy, age 1 month; complete surrender.” Wort was killed in action in 1944, and McEwan’s parents subsequently married. His mother’s two children from her first marriage were unwanted by McEwan’s father. One was sent to live with his paternal grandmother, the other was enrolled at a boarding school for soldiers’ orphans. When McEwan was born, he was treated as an only child. He only discovered and met the brother who had been given up for adoption, Dave Sharp, a bricklayer, in 2002.Does such a family history furnish a keener than average desire to make sense of the world? Certainly you could read McEwan’s work in that way. Does he see his parents’ relationship as the trigger of his fiction?I think about my parents’ marriage a lot,” he says. “Discovering I had a brother I didn’t know about made me really re-examine and understand differently, especially my mother, the sadness that I think I knew hung over her, which now I begin to understand.”View image in fullscreenWith David Sharp, the brother he only discovered he had in 2002. Photograph: RexIs he aware, looking back, of confronting that history subconsciously in different ways – the books, from The Child in Time onwards, are full of relationships on the rocks and missing children?“No, I don’t think I have ever gone that near it really,” he says. “It is quite a painful thought. Just the way that a war rips up private lives, throws everything into a turmoil that is mostly unrecorded among people who don’t write things down.”The war persisted in his childhood long after it ended; great events shadowed his home life in the way that history seeps through the cracks of his novels.“In 1956, we were in Libya,” he says, by way of example. “My mother had gone home for some family reason and because of the Suez crisis all army families were considered vulnerable to attack by Arab nationalists, so we were herded into camps. Actually it was one of the most blissful 10 days of my life. School stopped. I would occasionally see my father, who was then a captain, with a revolver strapped to his side in the distance, and us kids just ran free among the machine-gun nests and the barbed wire. Very heaven it was.”I wonder what his old man made of his writing?“He was torn between pleasure that I seemed to have my face in the papers occasionally, and utter horror at the contents of the first book or two.”In this McEwan shared a background with those friends, all born in the four years after the war, who later became the headline acts of literary London alongside him. Julian Barnes’s parents also never read his books (“too much below-stairs language”), while Kingsley Amis infamously never got beyond the first few pages of any of Martin’s novels. Christopher Hitchens called his father, a naval hero in the war, simply “the commander”.In some ways the friendship that group developed in the 1970s and 80s seems to have provided the camaraderie they had missed in childhood. I wonder if he believes that they would have achieved all that they have as writers and public figures without each other’s support?View image in fullscreenWith his old friend Martin Amis. Photograph: Bruce Adams/Daily Mail“Oh yeah, I think so,” he says. “We sat around then as we do now, and if we talked about literature it was only to celebrate things we liked. Mostly we just had a lot of fun.” The other day he says, he was coming back from Clapham in an Uber. “It took exactly the same route I used to drive my crappy little car to go and see Martin in the 1970s when he was living off Queensway. My car had an open top and I remembered exactly how I used to love in summer to zoom down the tram tunnel at the far end of Waterloo bridge, with the wind in my hair – when I had a lot of hair.”In a rare short story in the New Yorker a couple of years ago, My Purple-Scented Novel, McEwan told a fable of authorial jealousy; a failing writer steals the manuscript of a successful and brilliant friend and passes it off as his own, destroying the rival’s reputation in the process. Halfway through, he noted, archly, how the idea came from a story he had read about Martin Amis drinking one evening “with another novelist, the one (memory fails me) with the Scottish name and the English attitude. I heard that the two friends entertained themselves by dreaming up all the ways one writer might ruin the life of another.”Though there was no doubt plenty of competitive energy in their real-life friendships, there was always enough success to go around to make envy just a parlour game. McEwan’s was perhaps the least flamboyant talent of that circle, but it has proved the most commercial and perhaps enduring; since the triumphs of Atonement, his novels have been turned seamlessly into films. Two opened in the last year – On Chesil Beach and The Children Act. He is currently working on adapting Sweet Tooth, his story of 1970s espionage, for Working Title.Does he still go to his desk with the same excitement as when he was starting out?“I’m a great believer in turning up still,” he says. “No forgiving yourself because you are tired. I try to get there before 10, not too early.” His office is “a nice big converted barn” if he is at the house he and his second wife, Annalena McAfee, share in Gloucestershire, or here at the kitchen table if he is in London. There are still those magical writing days, he says, when “you forget you exist and you surface an hour later and you have 400 words you were not expecting to write”. He has never learned how to summon those moments to order. “But turning up is certainly the first condition. Work until lunchtime, listen to World at One, have a sandwich. Walk the dog. We have a very active sheepdog.”Long before Fitbits and 10,000-step regimes, McEwan was an evangelist for walking as the most useful creative habit, one that has taken him from the Chilterns and the Lake District to the Himalayas and the Dolomites. His eyes light up when he talks me through the 10-mile hike he has planned for the following day on the North Downs with his regular companion Ray Dolan, director of neuroimaging at the Wellcome Trust. They both see it as a way to discover healthy neural pathways.“It is more or less the case that when I have done a big walk and it is really satisfying, something is cleared out of my mind,” he says. “Particularly if the walk has had just a little edge of danger. If Ray and I were doing day walks on mountain ridges, particularly when we were younger, almost deliberately we would stay up a little too long and have to come down mountain streams in the pitch dark, with head torches, because we had lost the path.”View image in fullscreenWith his wife, Annalena McAfee, at a literary festival in Italy. Photograph: RexEntering his eighth decade he hasn’t lost his taste for that whiff of adventure, either in his walking or his writing.“The fact is I was heartbroken when I turned 18,” he says, when I ask him how he feels about his age. “My mother said to me once when I was in my 20s: “You know I would give anything to be 45 again.” I obviously burst out laughing. Now I understand. I played a good game of squash when I was 45. I had my life all sorted out.”From the outside, squash game aside, that remains the case. “What goes?” he asks himself. “The pleasures of conversation don’t fade. The degree to which I get depressed by the news doesn’t fade. Sometimes there are pleasurable events that I don’t look forward to as intensely as I used to, but when I get there, it’s a different story. I have always taken the idea of holidays very seriously and my two grown-up sons have that too, which I love. We often holiday together, something I never did with my parents.”We talk a little more about how each generation reacts to the experience of the previous. McEwan’s charmed life suggests that it is not enough to agree with Larkin that “man hands on misery to man”.“For my parents’ generation the men especially had looked into the abyss. Afterwards they just wanted to be mowing the lawn or polishing the car,” he says. “They had no problem with ordinariness that for us growing up with peace and prosperity was hard to fathom.” One positive result, McEwan says, “was that parliament was only full of people who had served in the war, so it was usefully risk-averse.”It is, he says, a shame we don’t have a little more of that character among our politicians now. He returns to our original theme, of the risks presented by the advances of technology and the apparently reckless inadequacy of our current politics to deal with them, or much else. “We are at the beginning of artificial intelligence and assuming civilisation holds together it is going to have a massive effect on employment. Already various forms of nationalism are blaming immigrants for changes that are the result of automation…”He doesn’t see change coming, but then he knows, too, that prophets are rarely on the money: “There is that rule about imagined futures: things are never quite as bad as pessimists say and never quite as good as optimists hope.” Machines Like Me is published by Vintage (£18.99).

 Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Netflix’s prediction of your next favorite show—we’re already living with artificial intelligence, and its adoption by the business world will only increase in coming years. We’re already hearing about AI’s potentially disastrous impact on the labor market, but how will these technological tools, designed to augment or replace human cognition, affect women? 
The first-ever study to map the labor consequences of AI for women, published by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), is a reminder of the intractable stubbornness of gender inequality, despite, or increasingly, because of, the direction of our digital future.

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGEWhile estimates vary hugely, IWPR calculates that although women make up just under half the US workforce, they will make up nearly 60 percent of the workers at highest risk of being displaced by technology. Today, argues Ariane Hegewisch—IWPR’s program director for employment and earnings—“The impact of technology critically depends on how it is implemented and who is at the table when it is implemented.”
Overall, IWPR estimates that there are 10 women for every seven men who work in jobs “threatened” by technological advancement (jobs that have at least a 90 percent likelihood of going extinct). Moreover, these jobs are concentrated in relatively high-paying positions, compared to the male-dominated jobs that will decline. So as women seek upward mobility in the face of long-standing employment barriers, Hegewisch explains, “the threat that tech poses to those jobs may also mean that you eliminate some of the ladders that are now available for people to really climb into a better economic prospect.” Whether you’re an accountant competing with bookkeeping algorithms or a senior bank teller soon to be replaced by an ATM, automation could wreak havoc on women’s participation in the workforce if robust protections are not put in place.

In addition, the jobs that will survive AI disruption are disproportionately low quality, such as senior- and personal-care jobs, domestic work, and adjunct teaching jobs.
The promise of tech to improve jobs—making them healthier, more enjoyable, less physically taxing and more flexible for workers—is largely driven by politics and extant hierarchies in the workforce. Workers who lack power in general will be less resilient and adaptable when technology begins to marginalize them. Decisions on when and how to introduce new technology, Hegewisch argues, hinge on whether the disruption is used “to complement people’s jobs or to replace people.” One solution could be to retrofit traditional collective bargaining for future change: For example, union contracts for Marriott Hotel workers include rules safeguarding members from the impact of automation, requiring advanced consultation and preparation of compensatory measures when potentially disruptive technology is introduced to the workplace.

The jobs most directly, and positively, impacted by tech are, of course, in technology-based industries. But with a massive gender gap in those workforces, even as Silicon Valley expands and advances, women will likely continue to be marginalized in lower-paying or lower-ranking positions.

Paradoxically, women working in the industries making up the technological cutting edge face some of the worst employment trends. Over the past 20 years, women’s representation has declined in the three largest tech sectors: computer scientists and systems analysts, software developers, and computer support specialists. Despite Silicon Valley’s progressive cultural patina, women of color are even more underrepresented in the current tech workforce: Even amid growing cultural emphasis on female-friendly STEM education programs and diversity in tech, women are still stuck on an unlevel playing field: “for women and men working at the same level of digitalization, women face an earnings gap in returns on digital skills of 41 percent.”
Another sector that will proliferate with automation is platform-based work, like ridesharing or digital “tasking” gigs. Though currently these make up just a small fraction of the job market, they are shaping patterns of commerce and culture for the digital age. And yet they are also pushing many workers into erratic schedules and unstable jobs with virtually no labor protections. Landing a fast gig online may mean less transparency, less ability to negotiate working conditions, and no effective way to organize with peers and colleagues, leading to economic insecurity and exploitation.
And others are excluded from these platforms altogether: IWPR warns that the shifting of decent work to online platforms “puts older and immigrant workers, many of whom speak English as a second language or have less familiarity with social media, at a disadvantage.”
The key to navigating these future trends is to get ahead of and harness the automation wave: First, comprehensive training programs could allow the workforce to be more adaptable to technological changes.
Second, the tech sector itself needs to work toward greater gender and racial diversity within its own ranks, including lifting more women into their leadership ranks, to help build greater equity into hiring and promotion policies.
Third, work as a whole for women, including precarious gig work, needs to be made fairer and more sustainable—for example by instituting policies that provide “portable” benefits—attached to the worker, not the job—to provide long-term financial security in a fast-churning workforce. Moreover, labor advocates point out that these protections will benefit all precariously employed workers, whether they are on a digital platform or just working ordinary part-time, freelance, or on-call jobs.
The more global challenge is to ensure that the fruits of technological advancement are reinvested in improving women’s lives. Today’s technological resilience gap between men and women stems from existing inequality: Women have always had less time and resources to adapt to change due to greater economic insecurity and caregiving burdens at home.
But technology could also turn the crisis upside down: With scheduling flexibility to accommodate online training for upgrading skills or credentials, digital learning could enable more women with caregiving constraints to pursue fresh job opportunities. A more flexible digitized workplace could allow workers more time at home, and potentially more equal distribution of work between parents, which helps upgrade the family structure for a more gender-balanced economy. But these developments require worker empowerment, now and in the future.

Then delegations of mayors and senior leaders came back in 2012, and in 2013, and in 2014.Siebel is a businessman based in Silicon Valley. He founded business application software company Siebel Systems in 1993, sold it for $5.9 billion in 2006, and in 2011 started another company: C3IOT, which is known as C3.ai.An artificial intelligence company specializing in predictive analytics, C3.ai has helped Baltimore Gas Electric save $20 million annually by checking the health of the utility’s meters and reducing the amount of unbilled energy usage. The company’s web site also boasts testimonials from Fortune 500 giants, such as 3M and Shell. Since its founding, C3 has invested more than $500 million in a software stack that performs artificial intelligence tasks.Because of all that, the Chinese teams wanted C3.ai to help with the country’s Smart Grid project, a $250 billion program to transform how China uses and distributes electricity. Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state currently on C3.ai’s board of directors, told Siebel to “run, don’t walk,” he recalled.“I actually had very candid conversations with them when they were here,” he said. “I simply said, ‘I don’t understand how this could possibly work. I’m in the business of developing intellectual property, and you’re in the business of massive, state-sanctioned intellectual property theft. I mean, how are we ever going to find a business model that works for both of us?’”This could have been the end of the story. C3.ai’s founders hadn’t expected to work in the national security sector in their first years. In 2015, however, shortly after former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter established the Department of Defense’s Silicon Valley outpost known (at the time) as the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, Pentagon representatives contacted Siebel. Like their Chinese counterparts, they too wanted help with artificial intelligence. Ninety days later, they had him on contract.Secretary of Defense Ash Carter speaks with Defense Innovation Unit Experimental employees as he arrives at Moffett Field, Calif., to deliver remarks at  DIUx May 11, 2016. (Photo by Senior Master Sgt. Adrian Cadiz)(Released) How people view this story is often colored by their view of how the Defense Department works, a kind of Rorschach test on Pentagon acquisition.Maybe it’s evidence, perhaps unfair, that the Chinese government is at least four years ahead of the United States in how it thinks about artificial intelligence. Maybe the Pentagon is taking steps to improve how it uses artificial intelligence and is ready to fully take advantage of the expertise on the subject that now resides in Silicon Valley. Maybe this is work the nation’s largest defense contractors could already perform and haven’t been asked.Siebel has his own interpretation.To comprehend how Siebel, 66, an expert salesman and an adventurer who was once attacked by an elephant, first attracted the attention of the Pentagon requires understanding the Defense Innovation Unit.Carter founded DIUx (now, initial experiments proven successful, just DIU) in 2015 with the thinking that the technology and the innovation the Pentagon needs for future battles won’t exclusively come from the defense industrial base around Washington, D.C. Instead, the Defense Department needed to attract new businesses, specifically those tech and IT companies in California, to bid on its work.Today, DIU’s headquarters are housed in a two-story brick Army building that sits in the shadows of NASA’s Ames Research Center and its giant wind tunnels. On the inside, the meeting rooms carry Star Wars references.Since its founding, occasionally lawmakers in Washington have questioned the success of DIU as a host of other organizations focused on future technologies have popped up. DIU received $30 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2017. The White House’s budget request for fiscal 2020 asks for the organization to receive about $30 million for each of the next five budget cycles.But sources in the Silicon Valley tech community said shortly after DIU’s arrival that the Pentagon staff was a walking example of what’s described as “tech tourism.”That pejorative refers to the regular occurrence of officials, usually from the East Coast, wandering the offices of upstart IT companies with open office plans and casual dress codes to talk about what it could mean for their agencies or businesses, but without investing or signing on to become a customer.More recently, the organization has won over skeptics with a series of low-cost, high-profile contracts. In the cyber realm, the team has set up contracts with security firms, including one with Recorded Future, to learn more about cyber intrusions.Previously, federal agencies only had access to a small percentage of threat intelligence, but by purchasing information DIU was able to better understand open-source data associated with threat actors and shrink research times. The contract was only a few million of the Pentagon’s $700 billion budget but was also used to incentivize other organizations to buy the information as well.In the software arena, leaders at DIU helped open Kessel Run, an Air Force laboratory that has reimagined software development.And one of its biggest successes, the example often cited by leaders in case studies and congressional hearings, has been with predictive maintenance and artificial intelligence.U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Gilbert, 380th Expeditionary Aircraft Maintenance Squadron E-3 AWACS Sentry crew chief, inspects a tire of a KC-10 during a pre-flight inspection at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 20, 2018. The crew chief’s extensive list of responsibilities including for pre-, post- and thru-flight checks, and well as various inspections, allows them to fully understand their vital role, making them jacks-of-all-trades when it comes to repairing the aircraft. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Mya M. Crosby) Predictive maintenance is far from the science fiction future of robot overlords or Terminator vs. Iron Man debates popular in national security circles. The idea calls for essentially identifying system failure before it happens in order to repair before things breaks.Analysts at Global Market Insights guess the predictive maintenance and machine inspection segment in AI in the manufacturing market (not the defense market) is projected to grow by 44 percent annually between today and 2025.Now consider that the average aircraft in the Air Force is about 28 years old and on any given day about 30 percent of the aircraft cannot deploy. The service wants to shrink those numbers.C3.ai’s first project with the Air Force looked at the E-3 Sentry, an aircraft that provides the service surveillance, command and control. The Air Force has roughly 40 of those aircraft, which were first designed in 1958. But C3.ai had no telemetry data to help predict when something would go wrong.“All we have is basically unstructured data in textual form,” Siebel said. “These consist of maintenance logs, which tend to be pretty messy and undecipherable. They also had flight logs, pilot logs and records from the maintenance system that might include oil inspections.”C3.ai ran all that information through a natural language processing program, took the text and extracted bits of information and stored it on Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud. The challenge was that not every piece of information is valuable.“Temperature doesn’t mean much, but high temperature might be meaningful. Pressure doesn’t mean much, but low pressure does. So, we were able to find those signals that correlated with system failure,” he said. “We built the algorithms, designed the user interface, built the application, loaded all the data and trained the users. And brought the application live in six months.”Siebel is proud of the timeline.“No chance [the Air Force gets] its [request for proposals] out in six months. Zero chance … This is a testament to DIU; I mean it wasn’t a big battle, it was a couple million bucks, right? [For] a fraction of the cost it takes to draft and evaluate RFPs, we delivered a production system,” he said.“The last time the United States Air Force had a system in production out in six months would be World War II, right?”Also, it worked. Within six months, C3.ai had demonstrated a reduction of as much as 28 percent of unscheduled maintenance events for the E-3, according to a DIU fact sheet.Then the Pentagon awarded a similar contract for the C-5 Galaxy. Again, it worked. Siebel’s team completed the project in six months. Then awards for the F-15, F-16, F-18 and F-35 joint strike fighter.The work attracted attention in the Pentagon, including from Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the Pentagon’s No. 2 uniformed officer, as well as Heather Wilson, the secretary of the Air Force.In March, Michael Brown, the managing partner at DIU, told Congress that his organization is working with the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to scale this type of predictive maintenance approach across multiple aircraft, as well as ground vehicles beginning with the Army’s Bradley Fighting Vehicle.“This is one of DIU’s highest priorities for FY19 given its enormous potential for impact on readiness and reducing costs,” he said.Now Siebel and C3.ai are doubling down.While a few high-profile companies faced protests over working with the Defense Department, Seibel and C3.ai quietly suggested one of the Pentagon’s most ambitious artificial intelligence programs to date.In late 2018, C3.ai made an unsolicited proposal to bring the entire Air Force fleet on to the system. Siebel said Wilson’s staff estimates it could lead to a 40 percent increase in aircraft availability. (C4ISRNET could not confirm that figure.) DIU’s estimates say the department could save $15 billion annually if the program was scaled to DoD’s aircraft fleet.“Forty percent!” Siebel said during an interview in his office in Redwood City, California. “Oh my God, if you’re secretary of defense, and you have 40 percent more stuff than the day before, and what’s a new F-35 cost? $100 million?”(It costs about $89 million.)But here’s another way of thinking about it: $15 billion is at least four times the Pentagon’s spending on AI programs alone for fiscal 2020. It’s about 1.5 times what the Pentagon spends on netcentric warfare and the same as the entire Pentagon portfolio in space.National security experts suggest that the program could have wider implications.Kara Frederick, an associate fellow for the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, said the real value in C3.ai’s work with the Air Force may be cultural.“This collaboration, this idea of consistent data standards, the idea that you take the algorithm and upload it to the cloud and then it can be used to cross different components of DoD. It’s that muscle memory that you’re creating with this initiative that could be a bigger deal,” she said.“This can help create that environment conducive to the behaviors that you’re seeking to encourage for more efficient data processing, efficient use of these functions. … Instead of coming into varied bespoke systems, if you think about plug-and-play architecture, this is starting the ball rolling with some of those behaviors that are going to be used for a long time to come.”In addition, if C3.ai secures a contract for the Air Force’s entire fleet, it would likely mark one of the Pentagon’s largest AI contracts to date. If such a contract reached tens of millions of dollars it could help entice other tech companies, including those in Silicon Valley, to reconsider doing business with the Pentagon, Frederick said.“A couple million dollars? That’s nothing. … I think a big number will raise some eyebrows in a good way and cause companies to say now the economic risk maybe worth it,” she said. “Frankly, the smaller, single-digit million dollars contracts are not going to make it worth it to some of these companies just for the privilege of working with the Department of Defense.”Pat Kumashiro, a retired Air Force colonel who led the maintenance division for the service’s logistics, engineering and force protection directorate and is currently director of the Air Force market at not-for-profit consulting firm LMI, said companies must demonstrate deep functional expertise in the area. For example, are there maintenance chiefs on staff who understand the inspection logs?“Clearly the pressures will be to go faster and improve scale. It’s hard to slow down this fast-moving train,” he said. “What all of us want as taxpayers want is that they are not going to take unacceptable risks.”The day I spoke with Siebel in February was the day after the Trump White House announced the nation’s AI strategy and on the day the Department of Defense released its own long-awaited strategy on the topic. “Implementing predictive maintenance and supply” is one of four examples the Pentagon uses to discuss AI.“We will use AI to predict the failure of critical parts, automate diagnostics, and plan maintenance based on data and equipment condition. Similar technology will be used to guide provisioning of spare parts and optimize inventory levels. These advances will ensure appropriate inventory levels, assist in troubleshooting, and enable more rapidly deployable and adaptable forces at reduced cost,” it reads.The Pentagon strategy also formally notes the work with C3.ai.Yet, Siebel sees predictive maintenance as a bridge to broader artificial intelligence applications. Most media attention in artificial intelligence has focused on science fiction’s idea of killer robots. And perhaps rightfully so. During the tenure of former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, the Pentagon chief put a premium on “increasing lethality” for every budget item. Siebel suggests AI systems can lock onto a target 1,000 times faster than a human.“You get into cyberwarfare? That’s entirely an AI problem,” he said. “We get into space command, these are AI problems. Now, will robotics play a factor? Absolutely. What do you want to send across a minefield? Do you want to send an infantryman? I mean, I don’t think so. Who do you want to send into some cave in Afghanistan? Why would you want to send a human being when you could send a machine? I would say that these UAVs, these are robots, basically, right? Some are remotely controlled, but why put people, human beings, in jeopardy when you can just have a machine blow up? And so, you lose a little bit of metal and maybe it costs you, who cares how much it costs. It’s just metal.”Finding targets is a touchy topic.When they talk about AI, national security leaders have spent much of their time talking about Project Maven, an Air Force program that worked with Google to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify objects in drone imagery. The project inadvertently became the posterchild for the Pentagon’s efforts on AI in Silicon Valley.While the program received mainstream attention, in large part because Google contractors backed out of the project, folks in the national security community have stressed it was a pathfinder.(Siebel says Maven was “a silly little trivial prototype. There was nothing to it. It was a silly project.”)As for his own systems, he says he will always build a system where humans are in the loop to make decisions, not robots or computers.“I’ve never encountered anybody in the Pentagon or in any places where we play, whether it’s [the Defense Security System, the Defense Information Systems Agency] that wants to have any discussion about an application where there isn’t a human in the loop. All we do is use AI to inform a human being. With the same data that they would have otherwise. It’s a MiG and we have it in our crosshairs.”And in the next breath, he says, he recognizes not everyone will do it that way.So now back to that Rorschach test. Is the Air Force’s predictive maintenance work playing catchup or is it an act of innovation in which service leaders are planting seeds for future bloom? Are Pentagon leaders forgetting the industrial base of defense companies in the Washington area?Siebel’s interpretation is more ominous: It’s a war to win artificial intelligence.“The way this war is being played out is that you have this highly controlled five-year-plan totalitarian state in China that is controlling it top-down and making massive, massive investments. And these guys are smart as hell. They are highly motivated, and they throw a hundred teams of people at a time at this,” he said.“And then you have this kind of very American idea … Rather than fix this through [requests for proposal] that we run through Lockheed Martin, and let these guys line up at the trough for these multibillion-dollar multiyear projects, can we get a thousand points of light of innovation going on everywhere and make little experiments and find the ones that work and latch onto them? Which is kind of a very, Western, American idea versus this totalitarian idea. It’ll be interesting to see who wins.”Air Force officials declined to speak on C3.ai’s unsolicited proposal, but Siebel said the service is taking it seriously. This winter, he sat down with Wilson and Will Roper, the service’s top acquisition official, at the Pentagon. He’s also met with Ryan McCarthy, the Army’s undersecretary. It is unclear how or even if the Air Force is pursuing the idea further.Still, Siebel looks at the aircraft’s handwritten data logs and sees not just unstructured data, but a smarter way.“I know who I’m betting on.”About  Mike GrussMike Gruss served as the editor-in-chief of Sightline Media Group's stable of news outlets, which includes Army Times, Air Force Times, C4ISRNET, Defense News, Federal Times, Marine Corps, Military Times and Navy Times.Share:More In IT and NetworksSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",Could artificial intelligence save the Pentagon $15 billion a year?,IT and Networks,C4ISRNet,,,,,,,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",,,,,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2019/04/15/could-artificial-intelligence-could-save-the-pentagon-15-billion-a-year/,,,,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As federal leaders work on the largest process overhaul in half a century, artificial intelligence will play a key role.In February, officials unveiled plans for Trusted Workforce 2.0, a framework that would shift suitability and security determinations from a one-time investigation followed by reassessments every five to 10 years, to an ongoing process that uses technology and private sector partners and data.The first step in moving away from the old process is getting rid of all the paper, according to Terry Carpenter, the program executive officer for the National Background Investigation Service, the office overseeing the technical overhaul of the investigations process.“The days of you filling out some form—online or in paper—submitting this form; having people go through that form; analyze your responses; decide which investigator to send out there to meet with your parents, your friends, your neighbors, who may all be in different states; to write up reports and assemble a package that grows as we do the investigation and come back to somebody to adjudicate the recommendation to say, ‘should this person get a clearance or not based on policy?’ We can’t do that anymore—that’s paper,” Carpenter said Thursday during the Government Analytics Breakfast Forum hosted by Johns Hopkins University and REI Systems.Before instituting the Trusted Workforce 2.0 framework, adjudicators would have to physically travel to interview people on every topic covered by the clearance investigation. Under the new guidance, investigators have the option to use other means to speed the process.In October, Carpenter’s team rolled out a tool to digitize the front-end of the security clearance process: filling out paper forms like the SF-86.The NBIS team developed a digital form that operates similarly to modern tax preparation software. Users are guided through a set of questions and document requests that ensure the data is entered in a structured format.Another tool currently in development uses artificial intelligence to pull investigatees’ data from multiple sources, including public information, private data sources like credit reports and government data, either through interagency partners or data collected by investigators. The AI tool will gather and sort that data and present it to adjudicators in a structured, interactive format.“We have a complete list of how the algorithm got to the recommendation. We can click on any piece of data in that decision-making chain and see it. And that gets packaged up as part of the supporting evidence for why decisions were made,” Carpenter said.With digitized data sources and AI helping pull and sort the information, the investigative process can move toward a “continuous evaluation” model, in which clearance holders are regularly reassessed based on new information, rather than on an arbitrary, decade-long cycle.“We already have 1.1 million names in as part of the initiative and it just goes through the data sources on some reoccurring schedule set by the business rules and if an anomaly comes up, then we look at the anomaly and decide what to do with it,” Carpenter said. “Maybe I got a speeding ticket last night and it popped up on the data source,” he offered as a hypothetical.Carpenter said the team hopes soon to be able to pilot the system end-to-end with the lowest level suitability determinations. If that pilot succeeds, the team can add more data streams and capabilities in order to handle more sensitive assessments.

All this will be possible because the team looked at the problem as a whole, rather than just finding cool tools to apply to parts of the problem, Carpenter said.“We moved the NBIS architecture to an enterprise data broker concept and we moved the data sources to one place,” he explained. “This gave us the ability to focus on control of that data. I don’t have to own it all—it doesn’t have to sit on my servers. … But we need to know that we have the connection, we have the ability to pull it when we need it, we know what the data is—what it represents—and we know the policies and agreements—the laws—that surround the use of that data.”“We couldn’t rush to the quick answer,” he added. “We had to do some of these critical, I call them ‘hygiene steps.’”No matter what, it will be up to humans to make the final decisions about suitability and trust, Carpenter said.“No decision will be made by a machine. We will augment decision- making,” he said. “Instead of them spending weeks and months trying to find needles in a haystack, we’re using artificial intelligence and machine learning to present those needles, in a neat form with all the relevant information to how we found it for the human to make that final determination.”

TT’s future with AI





		Newsday								
	



Thursday 11 April 2019

Despite the apprehension, artificial intelligence is expected to increase efficiency and productivity while creating even more jobs than it is replacing.

While artificial intelligence (AI) may seem a long way into the future for TT, local businesses have been capitalising on the technology to remain competitive and the average consumer, though largely unaware, has multiple interactions with AI daily.
As part of the company’s strategic plan, communications solutions provider, bmobile is already technologically prepared as AI becomes more widespread.
According to Hassel Bacchus, TSTT’s chief technology officer (CTO), the company’s Network Evolution Programme has, at its core, designs that include AI operationally and those that are at a state of readiness for AI capability. “So, in many instances, it is more about utilisation and application rather than upgrade,” Bacchus noted.
Understandably, a major concern and the apprehension toward the adoption of AI is the fear of losing one’s job to a computer program or robot. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that while 33 per cent of Americans are enthusiastic about AI’s integration into the workplace, a whopping 72 per cent worry about a future where AI can do many of the jobs that humans currently perform.



Bacchus explained, “In the customer interface space, many of the systems are being replaced and, again, AI is at the heart of the design as it makes interaction quality and content more consistent and predictable.”

It’s only natural to ask, what jobs are likely to be affected by AI? It all depends of the type of work an AI program can learn and while it is still relatively far into the future, this information can help people and economies prepare for the changes ahead.
In a 2018 study, Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Tom Mitchell noted, “Tasks within jobs typically show considerable variability and ‘suitability for machine learning’ while few – if any- jobs can be fully automated using machine learning.” As it turns out, automating particular elements of a job – namely routine tasks – often increases productivity and quality of output by allowing employees to focus on high level jobs that require greater attention.
The research stated that mechanical drafters, credit authorisers and brokerage clerks are among the jobs likely to be replaced by AI technology. While one may say that these jobs can be handled relatively straightforward by algorithms, the study also identified concierges and funeral directors in the line-up. However, the social element required for the latter makes the inclusion seem a bit odd. After all, concierges are responsible for more than just bookings; they are a key part of the hospitality experience, and while empathy is expected, grief counselling is an unwritten part of the service provided by funeral directors.
Another study determined that telemarketers, couriers, book keeping clerks and Computer support specialists may be among those negatively impacted by AI. On the opposite end of the spectrum, as people crave experiences, AI may make event planners even more valuable which is good news for the country that hosts the greatest show on earth.
Globally, 83 per cent of businesses say that AI is a strategic priority for their businesses, and despite the scepticism, research from Gartner revealed that AI is actually creating more jobs than it is destroying. By 2025, there will be an estimated net increase of over 2 million jobs, at all levels, as a result of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
As Bacchus puts it, ""Successful deployment of AI in any space requires complementary business processes, so it is not just about technology.” The key lies in capitalising on AI to increase productivity, increase efficiency and deliver greater value and service to customers.
